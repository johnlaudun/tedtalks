So  people argue vigorously about the definition of life. They ask if it should have reproduction in it  or metabolism  or evolution. And I don't know the answer to that  so I'm not going to tell you. I will say that life involves computation. So this is a computer program. Booted up in a cell  the program would execute  and it could result in this person  or with a small change  it could result in this person  or another small change  this person  or with a larger change  this dog  or this tree  or this whale. So now  if you take this metaphor  of  genome as program seriously  you have to consider that Chris Anderson is a computer fabricated artifact  as is Jim Watson  Craig Venter  as are all of us. And in convincing yourself that this metaphor is true  there are lots of similarities between genetic programs and computer programs that could help to convince you. But one  to me  that's most compelling is the peculiar sensitivity to small changes that can make large changes in biological development    the output. A small mutation can take a two wing fly and make it a four wing fly. Or it could take a fly and put legs where its antennae should be. Or if you're familiar with  The Princess Bride   it could create a six fingered man. Now  a hallmark of computer programs is just this kind of sensitivity to small changes. If your bank account's one dollar  and you flip a single bit  you could end up with a thousand dollars. So these small changes are things that I think that    they indicate to us that a complicated computation in development is underlying these amplified  large changes. So now  all of this indicates that there are molecular programs underlying biology  and it shows the power of molecular programs    biology does. And what I want to do is write molecular programs  potentially to build technology. And there are a lot of people doing this  a lot of synthetic biologists doing this  like Craig Venter. And they concentrate on using cells. They're cell oriented. So my friends  molecular programmers  and I have a sort of biomolecule centric approach. We're interested in using DNA  RNA and protein  and building new languages for building things from the bottom up  using biomolecules  potentially having nothing to do with biology. So  these are all the machines in a cell. There's a camera. There's the solar panels of the cell  some switches that turn your genes on and off  the girders of the cell  motors that move your muscles. My little group of molecular programmers are trying to refashion all of these parts from DNA. We're not DNA zealots  but DNA is the cheapest  easiest to understand and easy to program material to do this. And as other things become easier to use    maybe protein    we'll work with those. If we succeed  what will molecular programming look like  You're going to sit in front of your computer. You're going to design something like a cell phone  and in a high level language  you'll describe that cell phone. Then you're going to have a compiler that's going to take that description and it's going to turn it into actual molecules that can be sent to a synthesizer and that synthesizer will pack those molecules into a seed. And what happens if you water and feed that seed appropriately  is it will do a developmental computation  a molecular computation  and it'll build an electronic computer. And if I haven't revealed my prejudices already  I think that life has been about molecular computers building electrochemical computers  building electronic computers  which together with electrochemical computers will build new molecular computers  which will build new electronic computers  and so forth. And if you buy all of this  and you think life is about computation  as I do  then you look at big questions through the eyes of a computer scientist. So one big question is  how does a baby know when to stop growing  And for molecular programming  the question is how does your cell phone know when to stop growing  Or how does a computer program know when to stop running  Or more to the point  how do you know if a program will ever stop  There are other questions like this  too. One of them is Craig Venter's question. Turns out I think he's actually a computer scientist. He asked  how big is the minimal genome that will give me a functioning microorganism  How few genes can I use  This is exactly analogous to the question  what's the smallest program I can write that will act exactly like Microsoft Word  And just as he's writing  you know  bacteria that will be smaller  he's writing genomes that will work  we could write smaller programs that would do what Microsoft Word does. But for molecular programming  our question is  how many molecules do we need to put in that seed to get a cell phone  What's the smallest number we can get away with  Now  these are big questions in computer science. These are all complexity questions  and computer science tells us that these are very hard questions. Almost    many of them are impossible. But for some tasks  we can start to answer them. So  I'm going to start asking those questions for the DNA structures I'm going to talk about next. So  this is normal DNA  what you think of as normal DNA. It's double stranded  it's a double helix  has the As  Ts  Cs and Gs that pair to hold the strands together. And I'm going to draw it like this sometimes  just so I don't scare you. We want to look at individual strands and not think about the double helix. When we synthesize it  it comes single stranded  so we can take the blue strand in one tube and make an orange strand in the other tube  and they're floppy when they're single stranded. You mix them together and they make a rigid double helix. Now for the last    years  Ned Seeman and a bunch of his descendants have worked very hard and made beautiful three dimensional structures using this kind of reaction of DNA strands coming together. But a lot of their approaches  though elegant  take a long time. They can take a couple of years  or it can be difficult to design. So I came up with a new method a couple of years ago I call DNA origami that's so easy you could do it at home in your kitchen and design the stuff on a laptop. But to do it  you need a long  single strand of DNA  which is technically very difficult to get. So  you can go to a natural source. You can look in this computer fabricated artifact  and he's got a double stranded genome    that's no good. You look in his intestines. There are billions of bacteria. They're no good either. Double strand again  but inside them  they're infected with a virus that has a nice  long  single stranded genome that we can fold like a piece of paper. And here's how we do it. This is part of that genome. We add a bunch of short  synthetic DNAs that I call staples. Each one has a left half that binds the long strand in one place  and a right half that binds it in a different place  and brings the long strand together like this. The net action of many of these on that long strand is to fold it into something like a rectangle. Now  we can't actually take a movie of this process  but Shawn Douglas at Harvard has made a nice visualization for us that begins with a long strand and has some short strands in it. And what happens is that we mix these strands together. We heat them up  we add a little bit of salt  we heat them up to almost boiling and cool them down  and as we cool them down  the short strands bind the long strands and start to form structure. And you can see a little bit of double helix forming there. When you look at DNA origami  you can see that what it really is  even though you think it's complicated  is a bunch of double helices that are parallel to each other  and they're held together by places where short strands go along one helix and then jump to another one. So there's a strand that goes like this  goes along one helix and binds    it jumps to another helix and comes back. That holds the long strand like this. Now  to show that we could make any shape or pattern that we wanted  I tried to make this shape. I wanted to fold DNA into something that goes up over the eye  down the nose  up the nose  around the forehead  back down and end in a little loop like this. And so  I thought  if this could work  anything could work. So I had the computer program design the short staples to do this. I ordered them  they came by FedEx. I mixed them up  heated them  cooled them down  and I got    billion little smiley faces floating around in a single drop of water. And each one of these is just one thousandth the width of a human hair  OK  So  they're all floating around in solution  and to look at them  you have to get them on a surface where they stick. So  you pour them out onto a surface and they start to stick to that surface  and we take a picture using an atomic force microscope. It's got a needle  like a record needle  that goes back and forth over the surface  bumps up and down  and feels the height of the first surface. It feels the DNA origami. There's the atomic force microscope working and you can see that the landing's a little rough. When you zoom in  they've got  you know  weak jaws that flip over their heads and some of their noses get punched out  but it's pretty good. You can zoom in and even see the extra little loop  this little nano goatee. Now  what's great about this is anybody can do this. And so  I got this in the mail about a year after I did this  unsolicited. Anyone know what this is  What is it  It's China  right  So  what happened is  a graduate student in China  Lulu Qian  did a great job. She wrote all her own software to design and built this DNA origami  a beautiful rendition of China  which even has Taiwan  and you can see it's sort of on the world's shortest leash  right  So  this works really well and you can make patterns as well as shapes  OK  And you can make a map of the Americas and spell DNA with DNA. And what's really neat about it    well  actually  this all looks like nano artwork  but it turns out that nano artwork is just what you need to make nano circuits. So  you can put circuit components on the staples  like a light bulb and a light switch. Let the thing assemble  and you'll get some kind of a circuit. And then you can maybe wash the DNA away and have the circuit left over. So  this is what some colleagues of mine at Caltech did. They took a DNA origami  organized some carbon nano tubes  made a little switch  you see here  wired it up  tested it and showed that it is indeed a switch. Now  this is just a single switch and you need half a billion for a computer  so we have a long way to go. But this is very promising because the origami can organize parts just one tenth the size of those in a normal computer. So it's very promising for making small computers. Now  I want to get back to that compiler. The DNA origami is a proof that that compiler actually works. So  you start with something in the computer. You get a high level description of the computer program  a high level description of the origami. You can compile it to molecules  send it to a synthesizer  and it actually works. And it turns out that a company has made a nice program that's much better than my code  which was kind of ugly  and will allow us to do this in a nice  visual  computer aided design way. So  now you can say  all right  why isn't DNA origami the end of the story  You have your molecular compiler  you can do whatever you want. The fact is that it does not scale. So if you want to build a human from DNA origami  the problem is  you need a long strand that's    trillion trillion bases long. That's three light years' worth of DNA  so we're not going to do this. We're going to turn to another technology  called algorithmic self assembly of tiles. It was started by Erik Winfree  and what it does  it has tiles that are a hundredth the size of a DNA origami. You zoom in  there are just four DNA strands and they have little single stranded bits on them that can bind to other tiles  if they match. And we like to draw these tiles as little squares. And if you look at their sticky ends  these little DNA bits  you can see that they actually form a checkerboard pattern. So  these tiles would make a complicated  self assembling checkerboard. And the point of this  if you didn't catch that  is that tiles are a kind of molecular program and they can output patterns. And a really amazing part of this is that any computer program can be translated into one of these tile programs    specifically  counting. So  you can come up with a set of tiles that when they come together  form a little binary counter rather than a checkerboard. So you can read off binary numbers five  six and seven. And in order to get these kinds of computations started right  you need some kind of input  a kind of seed. You can use DNA origami for that. You can encode the number    in the right hand side of a DNA origami  and when you add those tiles that count  they will start to count    they will read that    and they'll stop at   . So  what we've done is we've figured out a way to have a molecular program know when to stop going. It knows when to stop growing because it can count. It knows how big it is. So  that answers that sort of first question I was talking about. It doesn't tell us how babies do it  however. So now  we can use this counting to try and get at much bigger things than DNA origami could otherwise. Here's the DNA origami  and what we can do is we can write    on both edges of the DNA origami  and we can now use our watering can and water with tiles  and we can start growing tiles off of that and create a square. The counter serves as a template to fill in a square in the middle of this thing. So  what we've done is we've succeeded in making something much bigger than a DNA origami by combining DNA origami with tiles. And the neat thing about it is  is that it's also reprogrammable. You can just change a couple of the DNA strands in this binary representation and you'll get    rather than   . And if you do that  the origami's the same size  but the resulting square that you get is three times bigger. So  this sort of recapitulates what I was telling you about development. You have a very sensitive computer program where small changes    single  tiny  little mutations    can take something that made one size square and make something very much bigger. Now  this    using counting to compute and build these kinds of things by this kind of developmental process is something that also has bearing on Craig Venter's question. So  you can ask  how many DNA strands are required to build a square of a given size  If we wanted to make a square of size         or        if we used DNA origami alone  we would require a number of DNA strands that's the square of the size of that square  so we'd need             or a million DNA strands. That's really not affordable. But if we use a little computation    we use origami  plus some tiles that count    then we can get away with using          or     DNA strands. And so we can exponentially reduce the number of DNA strands we use  if we use counting  if we use a little bit of computation. And so computation is some very powerful way to reduce the number of molecules you need to build something  to reduce the size of the genome that you're building. And finally  I'm going to get back to that sort of crazy idea about computers building computers. If you look at the square that you build with the origami and some counters growing off it  the pattern that it has is exactly the pattern that you need to make a memory. So if you affix some wires and switches to those tiles    rather than to the staple strands  you affix them to the tiles    then they'll self assemble the somewhat complicated circuits  the demultiplexer circuits  that you need to address this memory. So you can actually make a complicated circuit using a little bit of computation. It's a molecular computer building an electronic computer. Now  you ask me  how far have we gotten down this path  Experimentally  this is what we've done in the last year. Here is a DNA origami rectangle  and here are some tiles growing from it. And you can see how they count. One  two  three  four  five  six  nine                . So it's got some errors  but at least it counts up. So  it turns out we actually had this idea nine years ago  and that's about the time constant for how long it takes to do these kinds of things  so I think we made a lot of progress. We've got ideas about how to fix these errors. And I think in the next five or    years  we'll make the kind of squares that I described and maybe even get to some of those self assembled circuits. So now  what do I want you to take away from this talk  I want you to remember that to create life's very diverse and complex forms  life uses computation to do that. And the computations that it uses  they're molecular computations  and in order to understand this and get a better handle on it  as Feynman said  you know  we need to build something to understand it. And so we are going to use molecules and refashion this thing  rebuild everything from the bottom up  using DNA in ways that nature never intended  using DNA origami  and DNA origami to seed this algorithmic self assembly. You know  so this is all very cool  but what I'd like you to take from the talk  hopefully from some of those big questions  is that this molecular programming isn't just about making gadgets. It's not just making about    it's making self assembled cell phones and circuits. What it's really about is taking computer science and looking at big questions in a new light  asking new versions of those big questions and trying to understand how biology can make such amazing things. Thank you. My mission in life since I was a kid was  and is  to take the rest of you into space. It's during our lifetime that we're going to take the Earth  take the people of Earth and transition off  permanently. And that's exciting. In fact  I think it is a moral imperative that we open the space frontier. You know  it's the first time that we're going to have a chance to have planetary redundancy  a chance to  if you would  back up the biosphere. And if you think about space  everything we hold of value on this planet    metals and minerals and real estate and energy    is in infinite quantities in space. In fact  the Earth is a crumb in a supermarket filled with resources. The analogy for me is Alaska. You know  we bought Alaska. We Americans bought Alaska in the     s. It's called Seward's folly. We valued it as the number of seal pelts we could kill. And then we discovered these things    gold and oil and fishing and timber    and it became  you know  a trillion dollar economy  and now we take our honeymoons there. The same thing will happen in space. We are on the verge of the greatest exploration that the human race has ever known. We explore for three reasons  the weakest of which is curiosity. You know  it's funded NASA's budget up until now. Some images from Mars      . In fact  I think in the next decade  without any question  we will discover life on Mars and find that it is literally ubiquitous under the soils and different parts of that planet. The stronger motivator  the much stronger motivator  is fear. It drove us to the moon. We    literally in fear    with the Soviet Union raced to the moon. And we have these huge rocks  you know  killer sized rocks in the hundreds of thousands or millions out there  and while the probability is very small  the impact  figured in literally  of one of these hitting the Earth is so huge that to spend a small fraction looking  searching  preparing to defend  is not unreasonable. And of course  the third motivator  one near and dear to my heart as an entrepreneur  is wealth. In fact  the greatest wealth. If you think about these other asteroids  there's a class of the nickel iron  which in platinum group metal markets alone are worth something like    trillion dollars  if you can go out and grab one of these rocks. My plan is to actually buy puts on the precious metal market  and then actually claim that I'm going to go out and get one. And that will fund the actual mission to go and get one. But fear  curiosity and greed have driven us. And for me  this is    I'm the short kid on the right. This was    my motivation was actually during Apollo. And Apollo was one of the greatest motivators ever. If you think about what happened at the turn of    early     s  on May     JFK said   We're going to go to the moon.  And people left their jobs and they went to obscure locations to go and be part of this amazing mission. And we knew nothing about going to space. We went from having literally put Alan Shepard in suborbital flight to going to the moon in eight years  and the average age of the people that got us there was    years old. They didn't know what couldn't be done. They had to make up everything. And that  my friend  is amazing motivation. This is Gene Cernan  a good friend of mine  saying   If I can go to the moon     this is the last human on the moon so far     nothing  nothing is impossible.  But of course  we've thought about the government always as the person taking us there. But I put forward here  the government is not going to get us there. The government is unable to take the risks required to open up this precious frontier. The shuttle is costing a billion dollars a launch. That's a pathetic number. It's unreasonable. We shouldn't be happy in standing for that. One of the things that we did with the Ansari X PRIZE was take the challenge on that risk is OK  you know. As we are going out there and taking on a new frontier  we should be allowed to risk. In fact  anyone who says we shouldn't  you know  just needs to be put aside  because  as we go forward  in fact  the greatest discoveries we will ever know is ahead of us. The entrepreneurs in the space business are the furry mammals  and clearly the industrial military complex    with Boeing and Lockheed and NASA    are the dinosaurs. The ability for us to access these resources to gain planetary redundancy    we can now gather all the information  the genetic codes  you know  everything stored on our databases  and back them up off the planet  in case there would be one of those disastrous situations. The difficulty is getting there  and clearly  the cost to orbit is key. Once you're in orbit  you are two thirds of the way  energetically  to anywhere    the moon  to Mars. And today  there's only three vehicles    the U.S. shuttle  the Russian Soyuz and the Chinese vehicle    that gets you there. Arguably  it's about     million dollars a person on the space shuttle. One of the companies I started  Space Adventures  will sell you a ticket. We've done two so far. We'll be announcing two more on the Soyuz to go up to the space station for    million dollars. But that's expensive and to understand what the potential is    it is expensive. But people are willing to pay that  You know  one    we have a very unique period in time today. For the first time ever  we have enough wealth concentrated in the hands of few individuals and the technology accessible that will allow us to really drive space exploration. But how cheap could it get  I want to give you the end point. We know       million dollars today  you can go and buy a ticket  but how cheap could it get  Let's go back to high school physics here. If you calculate the amount of potential energy  mgh  to take you and your spacesuit up to a couple hundred miles  and then you accelerate yourself to        miles per hour    remember  that one half MV squared    and you figure it out. It's about  .  gigajoules of energy. If you expended that over an hour  it's about  .  megawatts. If you go to one of Vijay's micro power sources  and they sell it to you for seven cents a kilowatt hour    anybody here fast in math  How much will it cost you and your spacesuit to go to orbit      bucks. That's the price improvement curve that    we need some breakthroughs in physics along the way  I'll grant you that. But guys  if history has taught us anything  it's that if you can imagine it  you will get there eventually. I have no question that the physics  the engineering to get us down to the point where all of us can afford orbital space flight is around the corner. The difficulty is that there needs to be a real marketplace to drive the investment. Today  the Boeings and the Lockheeds don't spend a dollar of their own money in R D. It's all government research dollars  and very few of those. And in fact  the large corporations  the governments  can't take the risk. So we need what I call an exothermic economic reaction in space. Today's commercial markets worldwide  global commercial launch market     to    launches per year. Number of commercial companies out there     to    companies. One per company. That's not it. There's only one marketplace  and I call them self loading carbon payloads. They come with their own money. They're easy to make. It's people. The Ansari X PRIZE was my solution  reading about Lindbergh for creating the vehicles to get us there. We offered    million dollars in cash for the first reusable ship  carry three people up to     kilometers  come back down  and within two weeks  make the trip again. Twenty six teams from seven countries entered the competition  spending between one to    million dollars each. And of course  we had beautiful SpaceShipOne  which made those two flights and won the competition. And I'd like to take you there  to that morning  for just a quick video. Richard Searfoss  Good luck. RS  We've got an altitude call of         feet. RS  So in my official capacity as the chief judge of the Ansari X PRIZE competition  I declare that Mojave Aerospace Ventures has indeed earned the Ansari X PRIZE. Peter Diamandis  Probably the most difficult thing that I had to do was raise the capital for this. It was literally impossible. We went    I went to          CEOs  CMOs. No one believed it was done. Everyone said   Oh  what does NASA think  Well  people are going to die  how can you possibly going to put this forward   I found a visionary family  the Ansari family  and Champ Car  and raised part of the money  but not the full    million. And what I ended up doing was going out to the insurance industry and buying a hole in one insurance policy. See  the insurance companies went to Boeing and Lockheed  and said   Are you going to compete   No.  Are you going to compete   No.  No one's going to win this thing.  So  they took a bet that no one would win by January of '    and I took a bet that someone would win. So    and the best thing is they paid off and the check didn't bounce. We've had a lot of accomplishments and it's been a tremendous success. One of the things I'm most happy about is that the SpaceShipOne is going to hang in Air and Space Museum  next to the Spirit of St. Louis and the Wright Flyer. Isn't that great   Applause  So a little bit about the future  steps to space  what's available for you. Today  you can go and experience weightless flights. By '    suborbital flights  the price tag for that  you know  on Virgin  is going to be about        . There are three or four other serious efforts that will bring the price down very rapidly  I think  to about        dollars for a suborbital flight. Orbital flights    we can take you to the space station. And then I truly believe  once a group is in orbit around the Earth    I know if they don't do it  I am    we're going to stockpile some fuel  make a beeline for the moon and grab some real estate. Quick moment for the designers in the audience. We spent    years getting FAA approval to do zero gravity flights. Here are some fun images. Here's Burt Rutan and my good friend Greg Meronek inside a zero gravity    people think a zero gravity room  there's a switch on there that turns it off    but it's actually parabolic flight of an airplane. And turns out   Up has just done a little commercial that's airing this month. If we can get the audio up  look for specially marked packages of Diet   Up. When you want the taste that won't weigh you down  the only way to go is up. PD  That was filmed inside our airplane  and so  you can now do this. We're based down in Florida. Let me talk about the other thing I'm excited about. The future of prizes. You know  prizes are a very old idea. I had the pleasure of borrowing from the Longitude Prize and the Orteig Prize that put Lindbergh forward. And we have made a decision in the X PRIZE Foundation to actually carry that concept forward into other technology areas  and we just took on a new mission statement   to bring about radical breakthroughs in space and other technologies for the benefit of humanity.  And this is something that we're very excited about. I showed this slide to Larry Page  who just joined our board. And you know  when you give to a nonprofit  you might have    cents on the dollar. If you have a matching grant  it's typically two or three to one. If you put up a prize  you can get literally a    to one leverage on your dollars. And that's huge. And then he turned around and said   Well  if you back a prize institute that runs a    prize  you get     to one.  I said   Well  that's great.  So  we have actually    are looking to turn the X PRIZE into a world class prize institute. This is what happens when you put up a prize  when you announce it and teams start to begin doing trials. You get publicity increase  and when it's won  publicity shoots through the roof    if it's properly managed    and that's part of the benefits to a sponsor. Then  when the prize is actually won  after it's moving  you get societal benefits  you know  new technology  new capability. And the benefit to the sponsors is the sum of the publicity and societal benefits over the long term. That's our value proposition in a prize. If you were going to go and try to create SpaceShipOne  or any kind of a new technology  you have to fund that from the beginning and maintain that funding with an uncertain outcome. It may or may not happen. But if you put up a prize  the beautiful thing is  you know  it's a very small maintenance fee  and you pay on success. Orteig didn't pay a dime out to the nine teams that went across    tried to go across the Atlantic  and we didn't pay a dime until someone won the Ansari X PRIZE. So  prizes work great. You know  innovators  the entrepreneurs out there  you know that when you're going for a goal  the first thing you have to do is believe that you can do it yourself. Then  you've got to  you know  face potential public ridicule of    that's a crazy idea  it'll never work. And then you have to convince others  so that they can  in fact  help you raise the funds  and then you've got to deal with the fact that you've got government bureaucracies and institutions that don't want you to move those things forward  and you have to deal with failures. What a prize does  what we've experienced a prize doing  is literally help to short circuit or support all of these things  because a prize credentials the idea that this is a good idea. Well  it must be a good idea. Someone's offering    million dollars to go and do this thing. And each of these areas was something that we found the Ansari X PRIZE helped short circuit these for innovation. So  as an organization  we put together a prize discovery process of how to come up with prizes and write the rules  and we're actually looking at creating prizes in a number of different categories. We're looking at attacking energy  environment  nanotechnology    and I'll talk about those more in a moment. And the way we're doing that is we're creating prize teams within the X PRIZE. We have a space prize team. We're going after an orbital prize. We are looking at a number of energy prizes. Craig Venter has just joined our board and we're doing a rapid genome sequencing prize with him  we'll be announcing later this fall  about    imagine being able to sequence anybody's DNA for under       dollars  revolutionize medicine. And clean water  education  medicine and even looking at social entrepreneurship. So my final slide here is  the most critical tool for solving humanity's grand challenges    it isn't technology  it isn't money  it's only one thing    it's the committed  passionate human mind. Well  good morning. You know  the computer and television both recently turned     and today I'd like to talk about their relationship. Despite their middle age  if you've been following the themes of this conference or the entertainment industry  it's pretty clear that one has been picking on the other. So it's about time that we talked about how the computer ambushed television  or why the invention of the atomic bomb unleashed forces that lead to the writers' strike. And it's not just what these are doing to each other  but it's what the audience thinks that really frames this matter. To get a sense of this  and it's been a theme we've talked about all week  I recently talked to a bunch of tweeners. I wrote on cards   television    radio    MySpace    Internet    PC.  And I said  just arrange these  from what's important to you and what's not  and then tell me why. Let's listen to what happens when they get to the portion of the discussion on television. because you can do a lot of other stuff with your free time than watch programs. Peter Hirshberg  Which is more fun  Internet or TV  Girls  Internet. Girl    I think we    the reasons  one of the reasons we put computer before TV is because nowadays  like  we have TV shows on the computer. Girl    And then you can download onto your iPod. PH  Would you like to be the president of a TV network  Girl    I wouldn't like it. Girl    That would be so stressful. Girl    No. PH  How come  Girl    Because they're going to lose all their money eventually. Girl    Like the stock market  it goes up and down and stuff. I think right now the computers will be at the top and everything will be kind of going down and stuff. PH  There's been an uneasy relationship between the TV business and the tech business  really ever since they both turned about   . We go through periods of enthrallment  followed by reactions in boardrooms  in the finance community best characterized as  what's the finance term  Ick pooey. Let me give you an example of this. The year is       and Warner buys Atari because video games are on the rise. The next year they march forward and they introduce Qube  the first interactive cable TV system  and the New York Times heralds this as telecommunications moving to the home  convergence  great things are happening. Everybody in the East Coast gets in the pictures    Citicorp  Penney  RCA    all getting into this big vision. By the way  this is about when I enter the picture. I'm going to do a summer internship at Time Warner. That summer I'm all    I'm at Warner that summer    I'm all excited to work on convergence  and then the bottom falls out. Doesn't work out too well for them  they lose money. And I had a happy brush with convergence until  kind of  Warner basically has to liquidate the whole thing. That's when I leave graduate school  and I can't work in New York on kind of entertainment and technology because I have to be exiled to California  where the remaining jobs are  almost to the sea  to go to work for Apple Computer. Warner  of course  writes off more than     million dollars. Four hundred million dollars  which was real money back in the '  s. But they were onto something and they got better at it. By the year       the process was perfected. They merged with AOL  and in just four years  managed to shed about     billion dollars of market capitalization  showing that they'd actually mastered the art of applying Moore's law of successive miniaturization to their balance sheet. Now  I think that one reason that the media and the entertainment communities  or the media community  is driven so crazy by the tech community is that tech folks talk differently. You know  for    years  we've talked about changing the world  about total transformation. For    years  it's been about hopes and fears and promises of a better world. And I got to thinking  you know  who else talks that way  And the answer is pretty clearly    it's people in religion and in politics. And so I realized that actually the tech world is best understood  not as a business cycle  but as a messianic movement. We promise something great  we evangelize it  we're going to change the world. It doesn't work out too well  and so we actually go back to the well and start all over again  as the people in New York and L.A. look on in absolute  morbid astonishment. But it's this irrational view of things that drives us on to the next thing. So  what I'd like to ask is  if the computer is becoming a principal tool of media and entertainment  how did we get here  I mean  how did a machine that was built for accounting and artillery morph into media  Of course  the first computer was built just after World War II to solve military problems  but things got really interesting just a couple of years later         with Whirlwind  built at MIT's Lincoln Lab. Jay Forrester was building this for the Navy  but you can't help but see that the creator of this machine had in mind a machine that might actually be a potential media star. So take a look at what happens when the foremost journalist of early television meets one of the foremost computer pioneers  and the computer begins to express itself. With considerable trepidation  we undertake to interview this new machine. Jay Forrester  Hello New York  this is Cambridge. And this is the oscilloscope of the Whirlwind electronic computer. Would you like if I used the machine  Journalist  Yes  of course. But I have an idea  Mr. Forrester. Since this computer was made in conjunction with the Office of Naval Research  why don't we switch down to the Pentagon in Washington and let the Navy's research chief  Admiral Bolster  give Whirlwind the workout  Calvin Bolster  Well  Ed  this problem concerns the Navy's Viking rocket. This rocket goes up     miles into the sky. Now  at the standard rate of fuel consumption  I would like to see the computer trace the flight path of this rocket and see how it can determine  at any instant  say at the end of    seconds  the amount of fuel remaining  and the velocity at that set instant. JF  Over on the left hand side  you will notice fuel consumption decreasing as the rocket takes off. And on the right hand side  there's a scale that shows the rocket's velocity. The rocket's position is shown by the trajectory that we're now looking at. And as it reaches the peak of its trajectory  the velocity  you will notice  has dropped off to a minimum. Then  as the rocket dives down  velocity picks up again toward a maximum velocity and the rocket hits the ground. How's that  Journalist  What about that  Admiral  CB  Looks very good to me. JF  And before leaving  we would like to show you another kind of mathematical problem that some of the boys have worked out in their spare time  in a less serious vein  for a Sunday afternoon.  Music  Journalist  Thank you very much indeed  Mr. Forrester and the MIT lab. PH  You know  so much was worked out  the first real time interaction  the video display  pointing a gun. It lead to the microcomputer  but unfortunately  it was too pricey for the Navy  and all of this would have been lost if it weren't for a happy coincidence. Enter the atomic bomb. We're threatened by the greatest weapon ever  and knowing a good thing when it sees it  the Air Force decides it needs the biggest computer ever to protect us. They adapt Whirlwind to a massive air defense system  deploy it all across the frozen north  and spend nearly three times as much on this computer as was spent on the Manhattan Project building the A Bomb in the first place. Talk about a shot in the arm for the computer industry. And you can imagine that the Air Force became a pretty good salesman. Here's their marketing video. before we could determine their tracks. And then it would be too late to act. We cannot afford to take that chance. It is to meet this threat that the Air Force has been developing SAGE  the Semi Automatic Ground Environment system  to strengthen our air defenses. This new computer  built to become the nerve center of a defense network  is able to perform all the complex mathematical problems involved in countering a mass enemy raid. It is provided with its own powerhouse containing large diesel driven generators  air conditioning equipment  and cooling towers required to cool the thousands of vacuum tubes in the computer. PH  You know  that one computer was huge. There's an interesting marketing lesson from it  which is basically  when you market a product  you can either say  this is going to be wonderful  it will make you feel better and enliven you. Or there's one other marketing proposition  if you don't use our product  you'll die. This is a really good example of that. This had the first pointing device. It was distributed  so it worked out    distributed computing and modems    so all these things could talk to each other. About    percent of all the nation's programmers were wrapped up in this thing  and it led to an awful lot of what we have today. It also used vacuum tubes. You saw how huge it was  and to give you a sense for this    because we've talked a lot about Moore's law and making things small at this conference  so let's talk about making things large. If we took Whirlwind and put it in a place that you all know  say  Century City  it would fit beautifully. You'd kind of have to take Century City out  but it could fit in there. But like  let's imagine we took the latest Pentium processor  the latest Core   Extreme  which is a four core processor that Intel's working on  it will be our laptop tomorrow. To build that  what we'd do with Whirlwind technology is we'd have to take up roughly from the    to Mulholland  and from the     to La Cienega just with those Whirlwinds. And then  the    nuclear power plants that it would take to provide the power would fill up the rest of Los Angeles. That's roughly a third more nuclear power than all of France creates. So  the next time they tell you they're on to something  clearly they're not. So    and we haven't even worked out the cooling needs. But it gives you the kind of power that people have  that the audience has  and the reasons these transformations are happening. All of this stuff starts moving into industry. DEC kind of reduces all this and makes the first mini computer. It shows up at places like MIT  and then a mutation happens. Spacewar  is built  the first computer game  and all of a sudden  interactivity and involvement and passion is worked out. Actually  many MIT students stayed up all night long working on this thing  and many of the principles of gaming today were worked out. DEC knew a good thing about wasting time. It shipped every one of its computers with that game. Meanwhile  as all of this is happening  by the mid '  s  the business model of traditional broadcasting and cinema has been busted completely. A new technology has confounded radio men and movie moguls and they're quite certain that television is about to do them in. In fact  despair is in the air. And a quote that sounds largely reminiscent from everything I've been reading all week. RCA had David Sarnoff  who basically commercialized radio  said this   I don't say that radio networks must die. Every effort has been made and will continue to be made to find a new pattern  new selling arrangements and new types of programs that may arrest the declining revenues. It may yet be possible to eke out a poor existence for radio  but I don't know how.  And of course  as the computer industry develops interactively  producers in the emerging TV business actually hit on the same idea. And they fake it. up on the set  you just get them out. First of all  get your Winky Dink kits out. Put out your Magic Window and your erasing glove  and rub it like this. That's the way we get some of the magic into it  boys and girls. Then take it and put it right up against the screen of your own television set  and rub it out from the center to the corners  like this. Make sure you keep your magic crayons handy  your Winky Dink crayons and your erasing glove  because you'll be using them during the show to draw like that. You all set  OK  let's get right to the first story about Dusty Man. Come on into the secret lab. PH  It was the dawn of interactive TV  and you may have noticed they wanted to sell you the Winky Dink kits. Those are the Winky Dink crayons. I know what you're saying.  Pete  I could use any ordinary open source crayon  why do I have to buy theirs   I assure you  that's not the case. Turns out they told us directly that these are the only crayons you should ever use with your Winky Dink Magic Window  other crayons may discolor or hurt the window. This proprietary principle of vendor lock in would go on to be perfected with great success as one of the enduring principles of windowing systems everywhere. It led to lawsuits    federal investigations  and lots of repercussions  and that's a scandal we won't discuss today. But we will discuss this scandal  because this man  Jack Berry  the host of  Winky Dink   went on to become the host of  Twenty One   one of the most important quiz shows ever. And it was rigged  and it became unraveled when this man  Charles van Doren  was outed after an unnatural winning streak  ending Berry's career. And actually  ending the career of a lot of people at CBS. It turns out there was a lot to learn about how this new medium worked. And    years ago  if you'd been at a meeting like this and were trying to understand the media  there was one prophet and only but one you wanted to hear from  Professor Marshall McLuhan. He actually understood something about a theme that we've been discussing all week. It's the role of the audience in an era of pervasive electronic communications. Here he is talking from the     s. of making the ad  then it's happy. It's like the old quiz shows. They were great TV because it gave the audience a role  something to do. They were horrified when they discovered they'd really been left out all the time because the shows were rigged. Now  then  this was a horrible misunderstanding of TV on the part of the programmers. PH  You know  McLuhan talked about the global village. If you substitute the word blogosphere  of the Internet today  it is very true that his understanding is probably very enlightening now. Let's listen in to him. in which you don't necessarily have harmony. You have extreme concern with everybody else's business and much involvement in everybody else's life. It's a sort of Ann Landers' column writ large. And it doesn't necessarily mean harmony and peace and quiet  but it does mean huge involvement in everybody else's affairs. And so the global village is as big as a planet  and as small as a village post office. PH  We'll talk a little bit more about him later. We're now right into the     s. It's the era of big business and data centers for computing. But all that was about to change. You know  the expression of technology reflects the people and the time of the culture it was built in. And when I say that code expresses our hopes and aspirations  it's not just a joke about messianism  it's actually what we do. But for this part of the story  I'd actually like to throw it to America's leading technology correspondent  John Markoff. in drugs  sex  rock 'n' roll and the anti war movement had to do with computing  Everything. It all happened within five miles of where I'm standing  at Stanford University  between      and     . In the midst of revolution in the streets and rock and roll concerts in the parks  a group of researchers led by people like John McCarthy  a computer scientist at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab  and Doug Engelbart  a computer scientist at SRI  changed the world. Engelbart came out of a pretty dry engineering culture  but while he was beginning to do his work  all of this stuff was bubbling on the mid peninsula. There was LSD leaking out of Kesey's Veterans' Hospital experiments and other areas around the campus  and there was music literally in the streets. The Grateful Dead was playing in the pizza parlors. People were leaving to go back to the land. There was the Vietnam War. There was black liberation. There was women's liberation. This was a remarkable place  at a remarkable time. And into that ferment came the microprocessor. I think it was that interaction that led to personal computing. They saw these tools that were controlled by the establishment as ones that could actually be liberated and put to use by these communities that they were trying to build. And most importantly  they had this ethos of sharing information. I think these ideas are difficult to understand  because when you're trapped in one paradigm  the next paradigm is always like a science fiction universe    it makes no sense. The stories were so compelling that I decided to write a book about them. The title of the book is   What the Dormouse Said  How the '  s Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer Industry.  The title was taken from the lyrics to a Jefferson Airplane song. The lyrics go   Remember what the dormouse said. Feed your head  feed your head  feed your head.   Music  PH  By this time  computing had kind of leapt into media territory  and in short order much of what we're doing today was imagined in Cambridge and Silicon Valley. Here's the Architecture Machine Group  the predecessor of the Media Lab  in     . Meanwhile  in California  we were trying to commercialize a lot of this stuff. HyperCard was the first program to introduce the public to hyperlinks  where you could randomly hook to any kind of picture  or piece of text  or data across a file system  and we had no way of explaining it. There was no metaphor. Was it a database  A prototyping tool  A scripted language  Heck  it was everything. So we ended up writing a marketing brochure. We asked a question about how the mind works  and we let our customers play the role of so many blind men filling out the elephant. A few years later  we then hit on the idea of explaining to people the secret of  how do you get the content you want  the way you want it and the easy way  Here's the Apple marketing video. to create a HyperCard interactive video. The most involved method is to go ahead and produce your own videodisc as well as build your own HyperCard stacks. By far the simplest method is to buy a pre made videodisc and HyperCard stacks from a commercial supplier. The method we illustrate in this video uses a pre made videodisc but creates custom HyperCard stacks. This method allows you to use existing videodisc materials in ways which suit your specific needs and interests. PH  I hope you realize how subversive that is. That's like a Dick Cheney speech. You think he's a nice balding guy  but he's just declared war on the content business. Find the commercial stuff  mash it up  tell the story your way. Now  as long as we confine this to the education market  and a personal matter between the computer and the file system  that's fine  but as you can see  it was about to leap out and upset Jack Valenti and a lot of other people. By the way  speaking of the filing system  it never occurred to us that these hyperlinks could go beyond the local area network. A few years later  Tim Berners Lee worked that out. It became a killer app of links  and today  of course  we call that the World Wide Web. Now  not only was I instrumental in helping Apple miss the Internet  but a couple of years later  I helped Bill Gates do the same thing. The year is      and he was working on a book and I was working on a video to help him kind of explain where we were all heading and how to popularize all this. We were plenty aware that we were messing with media  and on the surface  it looks like we predicted a lot of the right things  but we also missed an awful lot. Let's take a look. and TV dinners  ancient and modern wonders of the man made world all. Yet each pales to insignificance with the completion of that magnificent accomplishment of twenty first century technology  the Digital Superhighway. Once it was only a dream of technoids and a few long forgotten politicians. The Digital Highway arrived in America's living rooms late in the twentieth century. Let us recall the pioneers who made this technical marvel possible. The Digital Highway would follow the rutted trail first blazed by Alexander Graham Bell. Though some were incredulous ... Man    The phone company  Narrator  Stirred by the prospects of mass communication and making big bucks on advertising  David Sarnoff commercializes radio. Man    Never had scientists been put under such pressure and demand. Narrator  The medium introduced America to new products. Voice    Say  mom  Windows for Radio means more enjoyment and greater ease of use for the whole family. Be sure to enjoy Windows for Radio at home and at work. Narrator  In       the Radio Corporation of America introduced television. Man    Never had scientists been put under such pressure and demand. Narrator  Eventually  the race to the future took on added momentum with the breakup of the telephone company. And further stimulus came with the deregulation of the cable television industry  and the re regulation of the cable television industry. Ted Turner  We did the work to build this  this cable industry  now the broadcasters want some of our money. I mean  it's ridiculous. Narrator  Computers  once the unwieldy tools of accountants and other geeks  escaped the backrooms to enter the media fracas. The world and all its culture reduced to bits  the lingua franca of all media. And the forces of convergence exploded. Finally  four great industrial sectors combined. Telecommunications  entertainment  computing and everything else. Man    We'll see channels for the gourmet and we'll see channels for the pet lover. Voice    Next on the gourmet pet channel  decorating birthday cakes for your schnauzer. Narrator  All of industry was in play  as investors flocked to place their bets. At stake  the battle for you  the consumer  and the right to spend billions to send a lot of information into the parlors of America.  Music  PH  We missed a lot. You know  you missed  we missed the Internet  the long tail  the role of the audience  open systems  social networks. It just goes to show how tough it is to come up with the right uses of media. Thomas Edison had the same problem. He wrote a list of what the phonograph might be good for when he invented it  and kind of only one of his ideas turned out to have been the right early idea. Well  you know where we're going on from here. We come into the era of the dotcom  the World Wide Web  and I don't need to tell you about that because we all went through that bubble together. But when we emerge from this and what we call Web  .   things actually are quite different. And I think it's the reason that TV's so challenged. If Internet one was about pages  now it's about people. It's a customer  it's an audience  it's a person who's participating. It's the formidable thing that is changing entertainment now. PH  In my own company  Technorati  we see something like        blog posts an hour come in. That's about       fresh  connective links across about     million blogs that are out there. And it's no wonder that as we head into the writers' strike  odd things happen. You know  it reminds me of that old saw in Hollywood  that a producer is anyone who knows a writer. I now think a network boss is anyone who has a cable modem. But it's not a joke. This is a real headline.  Websites attract striking writers  operators of sites like MyDamnChannel.com could benefit from labor disputes.  Meanwhile  you have the TV bloggers going out on strike  in sympathy with the television writers. And then you have TV Guide  a Fox property  which is about to sponsor the online video awards    but cancels it out of sympathy with traditional television  not appearing to gloat. To show you how schizophrenic this all is  here's the head of MySpace  or Fox Interactive  a News Corp company  being asked  well  with the writers' strike  isn't this going to hurt News Corp and help you online  there's an opportunity for more people to experience video on places like MySpace TV. PH  Oh  but then he remembers he works for Rupert Murdoch. as part of Fox Entertainment Group. Obviously  we hope that the strike is    that the issues are resolved as quickly as possible. PH  One of the great things that's going on here is the globalization of content really is happening. Here is a clip from a video  from a piece of animation that was written by a writer in Hollywood  animation worked out in Israel  farmed out to Croatia and India  and it's now an international series. in the months preceding the presidential primaries. Voice    You'll have to stay here in the safe house until we get word the terrorist threat is over. Voice    You mean we'll have to live here  together  Voices      and    With her  Voice    Well  there goes the neighborhood. PH  The company that created this  Aniboom  is an interesting example of where this is headed. Traditional TV animation costs  say  between        and        dollars a minute. They're producing things for between       and     dollars a minute. And they're offering their creators    percent of the back end  in a much more entrepreneurial manner. So  it's a different model. What the entertainment business is struggling with  the world of brands is figuring out. For example  Nike now understands that Nike Plus is not just a device in its shoe  it's a network to hook its customers together. And the head of marketing at Nike says   People are coming to our site an average of three times a week. We don't have to go to them.  Which means television advertising is down    percent for Nike. Or  as Nike's head of marketing says   We're not in the business of keeping media companies alive. We're in the business of connecting with consumers.  And media companies realize the audience is important also. Here's a man announcing the new Market Watch from Dow Jones  powered     percent by the user experience on the home page    user generated content married up with traditional content. It turns out you have a bigger audience and more interest if you hook up with them. Or  as Geoffrey Moore once told me  it's intellectual curiosity that's the trade that brands need in the age of the blogosphere. And I think this is beginning to happen in the entertainment business. One of my heroes is songwriter  Ally Willis  who just wrote  The Color Purple  and has been an R and    rhythm and blues writer  and this is what she said about where songwriting's going. Ally Willis  Where millions of collaborators wanted the song  because to look at them strictly as spam is missing what this medium is about. PH  So  to wrap up  I'd love to throw it back to Marshall McLuhan  who     years ago  was dealing with audiences that were going through just as much change  and I think that  today  traditional Hollywood and the writers are framing this perhaps in the way that it was being framed before. But I don't need to tell you this  let's throw it back to him. MM  The medium does things to people and they are always completely unaware of this. They don't really notice the new medium that is wrapping them up. They think of the old medium  because the old medium is always the content of the new medium  as movies tend to be the content of TV  and as books used to be the content  novels used to be the content of movies. And so every time a new medium arrives  the old medium is the content  and it is highly observable  highly noticeable  but the real  real roughing up and massaging is done by the new medium  and it is ignored. PH  I think it's a great time of enthrallment. There's been more raw DNA of communications and media thrown out there. Content is moving from shows to particles that are batted back and forth  and part of social communications  and I think this is going to be a time of great renaissance and opportunity. And whereas television may have gotten beat up  what's getting built is a really exciting new form of communication  and we kind of have the merger of the two industries and a new way of thinking to look at it. Thanks very much. I'm going to try and explain why it is that perhaps we don't understand as much as we think we do. I'd like to begin with four questions. This is not some sort of cultural thing for the time of year. That's an in joke  by the way. But these four questions  actually  are ones that people who even know quite a lot about science find quite hard. And they're questions that I've asked of science television producers  of audiences of science educators    so that's science teachers    and also of seven year olds  and I find that the seven year olds do marginally better than the other audiences  which is somewhat surprising. So the first question  and you might want to write this down  either on a bit of paper  physically  or a virtual piece of paper in your head. And  for viewers at home  you can try this as well. A little seed weighs next to nothing and a tree weighs a lot  right  I think we agree on that. Where does the tree get the stuff that makes up this chair  right  Where does all this stuff come from  And your next question is  can you light a little torch bulb with a battery  a bulb and one piece of wire  And would you be able to  kind of  draw a    you don't have to draw the diagram  but would you be able to draw the diagram  if you had to do it  Or would you just say  that's actually not possible  The third question is  why is it hotter in summer than in winter  I think we can probably agree that it is hotter in summer than in winter  but why  And finally  would you be able to    and you can sort of scribble it  if you like    scribble a plan diagram of the solar system  showing the shape of the planets' orbits  Would you be able to do that  And if you can  just scribble a pattern. OK. Now  children get their ideas not from teachers  as teachers often think  but actually from common sense  from experience of the world around them  from all the things that go on between them and their peers  and their carers  and their parents  and all of that. Experience. And one of the great experts in this field  of course  was  bless him  Cardinal Wolsey. Be very careful what you get into people's heads because it's virtually impossible to shift it afterwards  right  I'm not quite sure how he died  actually. Was he beheaded in the end  or hung  Now  those questions  which  of course  you've got right  and you haven't been conferring  and so on. And I    you know  normally  I would pick people out and humiliate  but maybe not in this instance. A little seed weighs a lot and  basically  all this stuff     percent of this stuff  came out of the air. Now  I guarantee that about    percent of you  or maybe it's fewer at TED  will have said it comes out of the ground. And some people  probably two of you  will come up and argue with me afterwards  and say that actually  it comes out of the ground. Now  if that was true  we'd have trucks going round the country  filling people's gardens in with soil  it'd be a fantastic business. But  actually  we don't do that. The mass of this comes out of the air. Now  I passed all my biology exams in Britain. I passed them really well  but I still came out of school thinking that that stuff came out of the ground. Second one  can you light a little torch bulb with a battery bulb and one piece of wire  Yes  you can  and I'll show you in a second how to do that. Now  I have some rather bad news  which is that I had a piece of video that I was about to show you  which unfortunately    the sound doesn't work in this room  so I'm going to describe to you  in true  Monty Python  fashion  what happens in the video. And in the video  a group of researchers go to MIT on graduation day. We chose MIT because  obviously  that's a very long way away from here  and you wouldn't mind too much  but it sort of works the same way in Britain and in the West Coast of the USA. And we asked them these questions  and we asked those questions of science graduates  and they couldn't answer them. And so  there's a whole lot of people saying   I'd be very surprised if you told me that this came out of the air. That's very surprising to me.  And those are science graduates. And we intercut it with   We are the premier science university in the world   because of British like hubris. And when we gave graduate engineers that question  they said it couldn't be done. And when we gave them a battery  and a piece of wire  and a bulb  and said   Can you do it   They couldn't do it. Right  And that's no different from Imperial College in London  by the way  it's not some sort of anti American thing going on. As if. Now  the reason this matters is we pay lots and lots of money for teaching people    we might as well get it right. And there are also some societal reasons why we might want people to understand what it is that's happening in photosynthesis. For example  one half of the carbon equation is how much we emit  and the other half of the carbon equation  as I'm very conscious as a trustee of Kew  is how much things soak up  and they soak up carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. That's what plants actually do for a living. And  for any Finnish people in the audience  this is a Finnish pun  we are  both literally and metaphorically  skating on thin ice if we don't understand that kind of thing. Now  here's how you do the battery and the bulb. It's so easy  isn't it  Of course  you all knew that. But if you haven't played with a battery and a bulb  if you've only seen a circuit diagram  you might not be able to do that  and that's one of the problems. So  why is it hotter in summer than in winter  We learn  as children  that you get closer to something that's hot  and it burns you. It's a very powerful bit of learning  and it happens pretty early on. By extension  we think to ourselves   Why it's hotter in summer than in winter must be because we're closer to the Sun.  I promise you that most of you will have got that. Oh  you're all shaking your heads  but only a few of you are shaking your heads very firmly. Other ones are kind of going like this. All right. It's hotter in summer than in winter because the rays from the Sun are spread out more  right  because of the tilt of the Earth. And if you think the tilt is tilting us closer  no  it isn't. The Sun is    million miles away  and we're tilting like this  right  It makes no odds. In fact  in the Northern Hemisphere  we're further from the Sun in summer  as it happens  but it makes no odds  the difference. OK  now  the scribble of the diagram of the solar system. If you believe  as most of you probably do  that it's hotter in summer than in winter because we're closer to the Sun  you must have drawn an ellipse. Right  That would explain it  right  Except  in your    you're nodding    now  in your ellipse  have you thought   Well  what happens during the night   Between Australia and here  right  they've got summer and we've got winter  and what    does the Earth kind of rush towards the Sun at night  and then rush back again  I mean  it's a very strange thing going on  and we hold these two models in our head  of what's right and what isn't right  and we do that  as human beings  in all sorts of fields. So  here's Copernicus' view of what the solar system looked like as a plan. That's pretty much what you should have on your piece of paper. Right  And this is NASA's view. They're stunningly similar. I hope you notice the coincidence here. What would you do if you knew that people had this misconception  right  in their heads  of elliptical orbits caused by our experiences as children  What sort of diagram would you show them of the solar system  to show that it's not really like that  You'd show them something like this  wouldn't you  It's a plan  looking down from above. But  no  look what I found in the textbooks. That's what you show people  right  These are from textbooks  from websites  educational websites    and almost anything you pick up is like that. And the reason it's like that is because it's dead boring to have a load of concentric circles  whereas that's much more exciting  to look at something at that angle  isn't it  Right  And by doing it at that angle  if you've got that misconception in your head  then that two dimensional representation of a three dimensional thing will be ellipses. So you've    it's crap  isn't it really  As we say. So  these mental models    we look for evidence that reinforces our models. We do this  of course  with matters of race  and politics  and everything else  and we do it in science as well. So we look  just look    and scientists do it  constantly    we look for evidence that reinforces our models  and some folks are just all too able and willing to provide the evidence that reinforces the models. So  being I'm in the United States  I'll have a dig at the Europeans. These are examples of what I would say is bad practice in science teaching centers. These pictures are from La Villette in France and the welcome wing of the Science Museum in London. And  if you look at the  kind of the way these things are constructed  there's a lot of mediation by glass  and it's very blue  and kind of professional    in that way that  you know  Woody Allen comes up from under the sheets in that scene in  Annie Hall   and said   God  that's so professional.  And that you don't    there's no passion in it  and it's not hands on  right  and  you know  pun intended. Whereas good interpretation    I'll use an example from nearby    is San Francisco Exploratorium  where all the things that    the demonstrations  and so on  are made out of everyday objects that children can understand  it's very hands on  and they can engage with  and experiment with. And I know that if the graduates at MIT and in the Imperial College in London had had the battery and the wire and the bit of stuff  and you know  been able to do it  they would have learned how it actually works  rather than thinking that they follow circuit diagrams and can't do it. So good interpretation is more about things that are bodged and stuffed and of my world  right  And things that    where there isn't an extra barrier of a piece of glass or machined titanium  and it all looks fantastic  OK  And the Exploratorium does that really  really well. And it's amateur  but amateur in the best sense  in other words  the root of the word being of love and passion. So  children are not empty vessels  OK  So  as  Monty Python  would have it  this is a bit Lord Privy Seal to say so  but this is    children are not empty vessels. They come with their own ideas and their own theories  and unless you work with those  then you won't be able to shift them  right  And I probably haven't shifted your ideas of how the world and universe operates  either. But this applies  equally  to matters of trying to sell new technology. For example  we are  in Britain  we're trying to do a digital switchover of the whole population into digital technology  for television . And it's one of the difficult things is that when people have preconceptions of how it all works  it's quite difficult to shift those. So we're not empty vessels  the mental models that we have as children persist into adulthood. Poor teaching actually does more harm than good. In this country and in Britain  magnetism is understood better by children before they've been to school than afterwards  OK  Same for gravity  two concepts  so it's    which is quite humbling  as a  you know  if you're a teacher  and you look before and after  that's quite worrying. They do worse in tests afterwards  after the teaching. And we collude. We design tests  or at least in Britain  so that people pass them. Right  And governments do very well. They pat themselves on the back. OK  We collude  and actually if you    if someone had designed a test for me when I was doing my biology exams  to really understand  to see whether I'd understood more than just kind of putting starch and iodine together and seeing it go blue  and really understood that plants took their mass out of the air  then I might have done better at science. So the most important thing is to get people to articulate their models. Your homework is    you know  how does an aircraft's wing create lift  An obvious question  and you'll have an answer now in your heads. And the second question to that then is  ensure you've explained how it is that planes can fly upside down. Ah ha  right. Second question is  why is the sea blue  All right  And you've all got an idea in your head of the answer. So  why is it blue on cloudy days  Ah  see. I've always wanted to say that in this country. Finally  my plea to you is to allow yourselves  and your children  and anyone you know  to kind of fiddle with stuff  because it's by fiddling with things that you  you know  you complement your other learning. It's not a replacement  it's just part of learning that's important. Thank you very much. Now    oh  oh yeah  go on then  go on. Good afternoon  good evening  whatever. We can go  jambo  guten Abend  bonsoir  but we can also ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh. That is the call that chimpanzees make before they go to sleep in the evening. You hear it going from one side of the valley to the other  from one group of nests to the next. And I want to pick up with my talk this evening from where Zeray left off yesterday. He was talking about this amazing  three year old Australopithecine child  Selam. And we've also been hearing about the history  the family tree  of mankind through DNA genetic profiling. And it was a paleontologist  the late Louis Leakey  who actually set me on the path for studying chimpanzees. And it was pretty extraordinary  way back then. It's kind of commonplace now  but his argument was    because he'd been searching for the fossilized remains of early humans in Africa. And you can tell an awful lot about what those beings looked like from the fossils  from the shape of the muscle attachments  something about the way they lived from the various artifacts found with them. But what about how they behaved  That's what he wanted to know. And of course  behavior doesn't fossilize. He argued    and it's now a fairly common theory    that if we found behavior patterns similar or the same in our closest living relatives  the great apes  and humans today  then maybe those behaviors were present in the ape like  human like ancestor some seven million years ago. And therefore  perhaps we had brought those characteristics with us from that ancient  ancient past. Well  if you look in textbooks today that deal with human evolution  you very often find people speculating about how early humans may have behaved  based on the behavior of chimpanzees. They are more like us than any other living creature  and we've heard about that during this TED Conference. So it remains for me to comment on the ways in which chimpanzees are so like us  in certain aspects of their behavior. Every chimpanzee has his or her own personality. Of course  I gave them names. They can live to be    years or more  although we think most of them probably don't make it to    in the wild. Mr. Wurzel. The female has her first baby when she's    or   . Thereafter  she has one baby only every five or six years  a long period of childhood dependency when the child is nursing  sleeping with the mother at night  and riding on her back. And we believe that this long period of childhood is important for chimpanzees  just as it is for us  in relation to learning. As the brain becomes ever more complex during evolution in different forms of animals  so we find that learning plays an ever more important role in an individual's life history. And young chimpanzees spend a lot of time watching what their elders do. We know now that they're capable of imitating behaviors that they see. And we believe that it's in this way that the different tool using behaviors    that have now been seen in all the different chimpanzee populations studied in Africa    how these are passed from one generation to the next  through observation  imitation and practice  so that we can describe these tool using behaviors as primitive culture. Chimpanzees don't have a spoken language. We've talked about that. They do have a very rich repertoire of postures and gestures  many of which are similar  or even identical  to ours and formed in the same context. Greeting chimpanzees embracing. They also kiss  hold hands  pat one another on the back. And they swagger and they throw rocks. In chimpanzee society  we find many  many examples of compassion  precursors to love and true altruism. Unfortunately  they  like us  have a dark side to their nature. They're capable of extreme brutality  even a kind of primitive war. And these really aggressive behaviors  for the most part  are directed against individuals of the neighboring social group. They are very territorially aggressive. Chimpanzees  I believe  more than any other living creature  have helped us to understand that  after all  there is no sharp line between humans and the rest of the animal kingdom. It's a very blurry line  and it's getting more blurry all the time as we make even more observations. The study that I began in      is still continuing to this day. And these chimpanzees  living their complex social lives in the wild  have helped    more than anything else    to make us realize we are part of  and not separated from  the amazing animals with whom we share the planet. So it's pretty sad to find that chimpanzees  like so many other creatures around the world  are losing their habitats. This is just one photograph from the air  and it shows you the forested highlands of Gombe. And it was when I flew over the whole area  about    years ago  and realized that outside the park  this forest  which in      had stretched almost unbroken along the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika  which is where the tiny     square mile Gombe National Park lies  that a question came to my mind.  How can we even try to save these famous chimpanzees  when the people living around the National Park are struggling to survive   More people are living there than the land could possibly support. The numbers increased by refugees pouring in from Burundi and over the lake from Congo. And very poor people    they couldn't afford to buy food from elsewhere. This led to a program  which we call TACARE. It's a very holistic way of improving the lives of the people living in the villages around the park. It started small with    villages. It's now in   . There isn't time to go into it  but it's including things like tree nurseries  methods of farming most suitable to this now very degraded  almost desert like land up in these mountains. Ways of controlling  preventing soil erosion. Ways of reclaiming overused farmland  so that within two years they can again be productive. Working to help the villagers obtain fresh water from wells. Perhaps build some schoolrooms. Most important of all  I believe  is working with small groups of women  providing them with opportunities for micro credit loans. And we've got  as is the case around the world  about    percent of all loans returned. Empowering women  working with education  providing scholarships for girls so they can finish secondary school  in the clear understanding that  all around the world  as women's education improves  family size drops. We provide information about family planning and about HIV AIDS. And as a result of this program  something's happening for conservation. What's happening for conservation is that the farmers living in these    villages  instead of looking on us as a bunch of white people coming to study a whole bunch of monkeys    and by the way  many of the staff are now Tanzanian    but when we began the TACARE program  it was a Tanzanian team going into the villages. It was a Tanzanian team talking to the villagers  asking what they were interested in. Were they interested in conservation  Absolutely not. They were interested in health  they were interested in education. And as time went on  and as their situation began to improve  they began to understand ever more about the need for conservation. They began to understand that as the upper levels of the hills were denuded of trees  so you've got this terrible soil erosion and mudslides. Today  we are developing what we call the Greater Gombe Ecosystem. This is an area way outside the National Park  stretching out into all these very degraded lands. And as these villages have a better standard of life  they are actually agreeing to put between    percent and    percent of their land in the highlands aside  so that once again  as the trees grow back  the chimpanzees will have leafy corridors through which they can travel to interact    as they must for genetic viability    with other remnant groups outside the National Park. So TACARE is a success. We're replicating it in other parts of Africa  around other wilderness areas which are faced with extreme population pressure. The problems in Africa  however  as we've been discussing for the whole of these first couple of days of TED  are major problems. There is a great deal of poverty. And when you get large numbers of people living in land that is not that fertile  particularly when you cut down trees  and you leave the soil open to the wind for erosion  as desperate populations cut down more and more trees  so that they can try and grow food for themselves and their families  what's going to happen  Something's got to give. And the other problems    in not only Africa  but the rest of the developing world and  indeed  everywhere    what are we doing to our planet  You know  the famous scientist  E. O. Wilson said that if every person on this planet attains the standard of living of the average European or American  we need three new planets. Today  they are saying four. But we don't have them. We've got one. And what's happened  I mean  the question here is  here we are  arguably the most intelligent being that's ever walked planet Earth  with this extraordinary brain  capable of the kind of technology that is so well illustrated by these TED Conferences  and yet we're destroying the only home we have. The indigenous people around the world  before they made a major decision  used to sit around and ask themselves   How does this decision affect our people seven generations ahead   Today  major decisions    and I'm not particularly talking about Africa here  but the developed world    major decisions involving millions of dollars  and millions of people  are often based on   How will this affect the next shareholders' meeting   And these decisions affect Africa. As I began traveling around Africa talking about the problems faced by chimpanzees and their vanishing forests  I realized more and more how so many of Africa's problems could be laid at the door of previous colonial exploitation. So I began traveling outside Africa  talking in Europe  talking in the United States  going to Asia. And everywhere there were these terrible problems. And you know the kind I'm talking about. I'm talking about pollution. The air that we breathe that often poisons us. The earth is poisoning our foods. The water    water is perhaps one of the most crucial issues that we're going to face in this century    and everywhere water is being polluted by agricultural  industrial and household chemicals that still are being sprayed around the world  seemingly with the inability to profit from past experience. The mangroves are being cut down  the effects of things like the tsunami get worse. We've talked about the soil erosion. We have the reckless burning of fossil fuels along with other greenhouse gasses  so called  leading to climate change. Finally  all around the world  people have begun to believe that there is something going on very wrong with our climate. All around the world climates are mixed up. And it's the poor people who are affected worse. It's Africa that already is affected. In many parts of sub Saharan Africa  the droughts are so much worse. And when the rain does come  it so often leads to flooding and added distress  and the cycle of poverty and hunger and disease. And the numbers of people living in an area that the land cannot support  who are too poor to buy food  who can't move away because the whole land is degraded. And so you get desertification    creeping  creeping  creeping    as the last of the trees are cut down. And this kind of thing is not just in Africa. It's all over the world. So it wasn't surprising to me that as I was traveling around the world I met so many young people who seemed to have lost hope. We seem to have lost wisdom  the wisdom of the indigenous people. I asked a question.  Why   Well  do you think there could be some kind of disconnect between this extraordinarily clever brain  the kind of brain that the TED technologies exemplify  and the human heart  Talking about it in the non scientific term  in terms of love and compassion. Is there some disconnect  And these young people  when I talk to them  basically they were either depressed or apathetic  or bitter and angry. And they said more or less the same thing   We feel this way because we feel you've compromised our future and there's nothing we can do about it.  We have compromised their future. I've got three little grandchildren  and every time I look at them and I think how we've harmed this beautiful planet since I was their age  I feel this desperation. And that led to this program we call Roots and Shoots  which began right here in Tanzania and has now spread to    countries around the world. It's symbolic. Roots make a firm foundation. Shoots seem tiny  to reach the sun they can break through a brick wall. See the brick wall as all these problems we've inflicted on the planet  environmental and social. It's a message of hope. Hundreds and thousands of young people around the world can break through and can make this a better world for all living things. The most important message of Roots and Shoots  every single one of us makes a difference  every single day. We have a choice. Every one of us in this room  we have a choice as to what kind of difference we want to make. The very poor have no choice. It's up to us to change things so that the poor have choice as well. The Roots and Shoots groups all choose three projects. It depends on how old they are  and which country  whether they're in a city or rural  as to what kinds of projects. But basically  we have programs now from preschool right through university  with more and more adults starting their own Roots and Shoots groups. And every group chooses  between them  three different kinds of project to make this a better world  recognizing that all these different problems are interconnected and impinge on each other. So one of their projects will be to help their own human community. And then  if they're able  they may raise money to help communities in other parts of the world. One of their projects will be to help animals    not just wildlife  domestic animals as well. And one of their projects will be to help the environment that we all share. And woven throughout all of this is a message of learning to live in peace and harmony within ourselves  in our families  in our communities  between nations  between cultures  between religions and between us and the natural world. We need the natural world. We cannot go on destroying it at the rate we are. We not do have more than this one planet. Just picking one or two of the projects right here in Africa that the Roots and Shoots groups are doing  one or two projects only    in Tanzania  in Uganda  Kenya  South Africa  Congo Brazzaville  Sierra Leone  Cameroon and other groups. And as I say  it's in    countries around the world. Of course  they're planting trees. They're growing organic vegetables. They're working in the refugee camps  with chickens and selling the eggs for a little amount of money  or just using them to feed their families  and feeling a sense of pride and empowerment  because they're no longer helpless and depending on others with their vegetables and their chickens. It's being used in Uganda to give some psychological help to ex child soldiers. Doing projects like this is bringing them out of themselves. Once again  they're useful members of society. We have this program in prisons as well. So  there's no time for more Roots and Shoots now. But    oh  they're also working on HIV AIDS. That's a very important component of Roots and Shoots  with older kids talking to younger ones. And unwanted pregnancies and things like that  which young people listen to better from other youth  rather than adults. Hope. That's the question I get asked as I'm going around the world   Jane  you've seen so many terrible things  you've seen your chimpanzees decrease in number from about one million  at the turn of the century  to no more than         now  and the same with so many other animals. Forests disappearing  deserts where once there was forest. Do you really have hope   Well  yes. You can't come to a conference like TED and not have hope  can you  And of course  there's hope. One is this amazing human brain. And I mean  think of the technologies. And I've just been so thrilled  finally  to come to people talking about compost latrines. It's one of my hobbyhorses. We just flush all this water down the lavatory  it's terrible. And then talking about renewable energy    desperately important. Do we care about the planet for our children  How many of us have children or grandchildren  nieces  nephews  Do we care about their future  And if we care about their future  we  as the elite around the world  we can do something about it. We can make choices as to how we live each day. What we buy. What we wear. And choose to make these choices with the question  how will this affect the environment around me  How will it affect the life of my child when he or she grows up  Or my grandchild  or whatever it is. So the human brain  coupled with the human heart  and we join hands around the world. And that's what TED is helping so well with  and Google who help us  and Esri are helping us with mapping in Gombe National Park. All of these technologies we can use. Now let's link them  and it's beginning to happen  isn't it  You've heard about it this afternoon. It's beginning to happen. This change  this change. To see change that we must have if we care about the future. And the next reason for hope    nature is amazingly resilient. You can take an area that's absolutely destroyed  with time and perhaps some help it can regenerate. And an example is the TACARE program. I told you  where a seemingly dead tree stump    if you stop hacking them for firewood  which you don't need to because you have wood lots  then in five years you can have a    foot tree. And animals  almost on the brink of extinction  can be given a second chance. That's my next book. It's inspiring. And it brings me to my last category of hope  and we've heard about this so much in the last two days  this indomitable human spirit. This determination of people  the resilience of the human spirit  So that people who you would think would be battered by poverty  or disease  or whatever  can pull themselves up out of it  sometimes with a helping hand  and take their part in society  and take their part in changing the world. And just to think of one or two people out of Africa who are just really inspiring. We could make a very long list  but obviously Nelson Mandela  emerging from    years of hard physical labor     years of imprisonment  with this amazing ability to forgive  so that he could lead his nation out the evil regime of apartheid without a bloodbath. Ken Saro Wiwa  in Nigeria  who took on the giant oil companies  and although people around the world tried their best  was executed. People like this are so inspirational. People like this are the role models we need for young Africans. And we need some environmental role models as well  and I've been hearing some of them today. So I'm really grateful for this opportunity to share this message again  with everyone at TED. And I hope that some of us can get together and talk about some of these things  especially the Roots and Shoots program. And just a last word on that    the young woman who's running this entire conference center  I met her today. She came up so excited  with her certificate. She was  in  Roots and Shoots. She was in the leadership in Dar es Salaam. She said it's helped her to do what she's doing. And it was very  very exciting for me to meet her and see just one example of how young people  when they are empowered  given the opportunity to take action  to make the world a better place  truly are our hope for tomorrow. Thank you. So  a big question that we're facing now and have been for quite a number of years now  are we at risk of a nuclear attack  Now  there's a bigger question that's probably actually more important than that  is the notion of permanently eliminating the possibility of a nuclear attack  eliminating the threat altogether. And I would like to make a case to you that over the years since we first developed atomic weaponry  until this very moment  we've actually lived in a dangerous nuclear world that's characterized by two phases  which I'm going to go through with you right now. First of all  we started off the nuclear age in     . The United States had developed a couple of atomic weapons through the Manhattan Project  and the idea was very straightforward  we would use the power of the atom to end the atrocities and the horror of this unending World War II that we'd been involved in in Europe and in the Pacific. And in       we were the only nuclear power. We had a few nuclear weapons  two of which we dropped on Japan  in Hiroshima  a few days later in Nagasaki  in August       killing about         people between those two. And for a few years  we were the only nuclear power on Earth. But by       the Soviet Union had decided it was unacceptable to have us as the only nuclear power  and they began to match what the United States had developed. And from      to      was an extraordinary time of a buildup of a nuclear arsenal that no one could possibly have imagined back in the     s. So by         each of those red bombs up here is equivalent of a thousands warheads    the world had        nuclear warheads  and seven members of something that came to be known as the  nuclear club.  And it was an extraordinary time  and I am going to go through some of the mentality that we    that Americans and the rest of the world were experiencing. But I want to just point out to you that    percent of the nuclear weapons at any particular time since         going forward  of course    were part of the arsenals of the United States and the Soviet Union. After       and before the break up of the Soviet Union  we began to disarm from a nuclear point of view. We began to counter proliferate  and we dropped the number of nuclear warheads in the world to about a total of       . It's a very difficult number to deal with  because what we've done is we've quote unquote  decommissioned  some of the warheads. They're still probably usable. They could be  re commissioned   but the way they count things  which is very complicated  we think we have about a third of the nuclear weapons we had before. But we also  in that period of time  added two more members to the nuclear club  Pakistan and North Korea. So we stand today with a still fully armed nuclear arsenal among many countries around the world  but a very different set of circumstances. So I'm going to talk about a nuclear threat story in two chapters. Chapter one is      to       when the Soviet Union broke up  and what we were dealing with  at that point and through those years  was a superpowers' nuclear arms race. It was characterized by a nation versus nation  very fragile standoff. And basically  we lived for all those years  and some might argue that we still do  in a situation of being on the brink  literally  of an apocalyptic  planetary calamity. It's incredible that we actually lived through all that. We were totally dependent during those years on this amazing acronym  which is MAD. It stands for mutually assured destruction. So it meant if you attacked us  we would attack you virtually simultaneously  and the end result would be a destruction of your country and mine. So the threat of my own destruction kept me from launching a nuclear attack on you. That's the way we lived. And the danger of that  of course  is that a misreading of a radar screen could actually cause a counter launch  even though the first country had not actually launched anything. During this chapter one  there was a high level of public awareness about the potential of nuclear catastrophe  and an indelible image was implanted in our collective minds that  in fact  a nuclear holocaust would be absolutely globally destructive and could  in some ways  mean the end of civilization as we know it. So this was chapter one. Now the odd thing is that even though we knew that there would be that kind of civilization obliteration  we engaged in America in a series    and in fact  in the Soviet Union    in a series of response planning. It was absolutely incredible. So premise one is we'd be destroying the world  and then premise two is  why don't we get prepared for it  So what we offered ourselves was a collection of things. I'm just going to go skim through a few things  just to jog your memories. If you're born after       this is just    consider this entertainment  otherwise it's memory lane. This was Bert the Turtle.  Video  This was basically an attempt to teach our schoolchildren that if we did get engaged in a nuclear confrontation and atomic war  then we wanted our school children to kind of basically duck and cover. That was the principle. You    there would be a nuclear conflagration about to hit us  and if you get under your desk  things would be OK. I didn't do all that well in psychiatry in medical school  but I was interested  and I think this was seriously delusional. Secondly  we told people to go down in their basements and build a fallout shelter. Maybe it would be a study when we weren't having an atomic war  or you could use it as a TV room  or  as many teenagers found out  a very  very safe place for a little privacy with your girlfriend. And actually    so there are multiple uses of the bomb shelters. Or you could buy a prefabricated bomb shelter that you could simply bury in the ground. Now  the bomb shelters at that point    let's say you bought a prefab one    it would be a few hundred dollars  maybe up to      if you got a fancy one. Yet  what percentage of Americans do you think ever had a bomb shelter in their house  What percentage lived in a house with a bomb shelter  Less than two percent. About  .  percent of the population  as far as anyone knows  did anything  either making a space in their basement or actually building a bomb shelter. Many buildings  public buildings  around the country    this is New York City    had these little civil defense signs  and the idea was that you would run into one of these shelters and be safe from the nuclear weaponry. And one of the greatest governmental delusions of all time was something that happened in the early days of the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  as we now know  and are well aware of their behaviors from Katrina. Here is their first big public announcement. They would propose    actually there were about six volumes written on this    a crisis relocation plan that was dependent upon the United States having three to four days warning that the Soviets were going to attack us. So the goal was to evacuate the target cities. We would move people out of the target cities into the countryside. And I'm telling you  I actually testified at the Senate about the absolute ludicrous idea that we would actually evacuate  and actually have three or four days' warning. It was just completely off the wall. Turns out that they had another idea behind it  even though this was    they were telling the public it was to save us. The idea was that we would force the Soviets to re target their nuclear weapons    very expensive    and potentially double their arsenal  to not only take out the original site  but take out sites where people were going. This was what apparently  as it turns out  was behind all this. It was just really  really frightening. The main point here is we were dealing with a complete disconnect from reality. The civil defense programs were disconnected from the reality of what we'd see in all out nuclear war. So organizations like Physicians for Social Responsibility  around       started saying this a lot publicly. They would do a bombing run. They'd go to your city  and they'd say   Here's a map of your city. Here's what's going to happen if we get a nuclear hit.  So no possibility of medical response to  or meaningful preparedness for all out nuclear war. So we had to prevent nuclear war if we expected to survive. This disconnect was never actually resolved. And what happened was    when we get in to chapter two of the nuclear threat era  which started back in     . Chapter two starts in     . When the Soviet Union broke up  we effectively lost that adversary as a potential attacker of the United States  for the most part. It's not completely gone. I'm going to come back to that. But from      through the present time  emphasized by the attacks of       the idea of an all out nuclear war has diminished and the idea of a single event  act of nuclear terrorism is what we have instead. Although the scenario has changed very considerably  the fact is that we haven't changed our mental image of what a nuclear war means. So I'm going to tell you what the implications of that are in just a second. So  what is a nuclear terror threat  And there's four key ingredients to describing that. First thing is that the global nuclear weapons  in the stockpiles that I showed you in those original maps  happen to be not uniformly secure. And it's particularly not secure in the former Soviet Union  now in Russia. There are many  many sites where warheads are stored and  in fact  lots of sites where fissionable materials  like highly enriched uranium and plutonium  are absolutely not safe. They're available to be bought  stolen  whatever. They're acquirable  let me put it that way. From      through       the International Atomic Energy Agency documented     cases of nuclear theft     of which involved highly enriched uranium or plutonium  the key ingredients to make a nuclear weapon. The global stockpile of highly enriched uranium is about        at the low end  to about       metric tons. More than     megatons of this is stored in particularly insecure Russian facilities. How much of that do you think it would take to actually build a    kiloton bomb  Well  you need about    pounds of it. So  what I'd like to show you is what it would take to hold    pounds of highly enriched uranium. This is not a product placement. It's just    in fact  if I was Coca Cola  I'd be pretty distressed about this       but basically  this is it. This is what you would need to steal or buy out of that     metric ton stockpile that's relatively insecure to create the type of bomb that was used in Hiroshima. Now you might want to look at plutonium as another fissionable material that you might use in a bomb. That    you'd need    to    pounds of plutonium. Now  plutonium     to    pounds  this. This is enough plutonium to create a Nagasaki size atomic weapon. Now this situation  already I    you know  I don't really like thinking about this  although somehow I got myself a job where I have to think about it. So the point is that we're very  very insecure in terms of developing this material. The second thing is  what about the know how  And there's a lot of controversy about whether terror organizations have the know how to actually make a nuclear weapon. Well  there's a lot of know how out there. There's an unbelievable amount of know how out there. There's detailed information on how to assemble a nuclear weapon from parts. There's books about how to build a nuclear bomb. There are plans for how to create a terror farm where you could actually manufacture and develop all the components and assemble it. All of this information is relatively available. If you have an undergraduate degree in physics  I would suggest    although I don't  so maybe it's not even true    but something close to that would allow you  with the information that's currently available  to actually build a nuclear weapon. The third element of the nuclear terror threat is that  who would actually do such a thing  Well  what we're seeing now is a level of terrorism that involves individuals who are highly organized. They are very dedicated and committed. They are stateless. Somebody once said  Al Qaeda does not have a return address  so if they attack us with a nuclear weapon  what's the response  and to whom is the response  And they're retaliation proof. Since there is no real retribution possible that would make any difference  since there are people willing to actually give up their lives in order to do a lot of damage to us  it becomes apparent that the whole notion of this mutually assured destruction would not work. Here is Sulaiman Abu Ghaith  and Sulaiman was a key lieutenant of Osama Bin Laden. He wrote many  many times statements to this effect   we have the right to kill four million Americans  two million of whom should be children.  And we don't have to go overseas to find people willing to do harm  for whatever their reasons. McVeigh and Nichols  and the Oklahoma City attack in the     s was a good example of homegrown terrorists. What if they had gotten their hands on a nuclear weapon  The fourth element is that the high value U.S. targets are accessible  soft and plentiful. This would be a talk for another day  but the level of the preparedness that the United States has achieved since      of '   is unbelievably inadequate. What you saw after Katrina is a very good indicator of how little prepared the United States is for any kind of major attack. Seven million ship cargo containers come into the United States every year. Five to seven percent only are inspected    five to seven percent. This is Alexander Lebed  who was a general that worked with Yeltsin  who talked about  and presented to Congress  this idea that the Russians had developed    these suitcase bombs. They were very low yield     .  to one kiloton  Hiroshima was around    kilotons    but enough to do an unbelievable amount of damage. And Lebed came to the United States and told us that many  many    more than    of the suitcase bombs were actually not accountable. And they look like this. They're basically very simple arrangements. You put the elements into a suitcase. It becomes very portable. The suitcase can be conveniently dropped in your trunk of your car. You take it wherever you want to take it  and you can detonate it. You don't want to build a suitcase bomb  and you happen to get one of those insecure nuclear warheads that exist. This is the size of the  Little Boy  bomb that was dropped at Hiroshima. It was  .  feet long  weighed       pounds. You go down to your local rent a truck and for    bucks or so  you rent a truck that's got the right capacity  and you take your bomb  you put it in the truck and you're ready to go. It could happen. But what it would mean and who would survive  You can't get an exact number for that kind of probability  but what I'm trying to say is that we have all the elements of that happening. Anybody who dismisses the thought of a nuclear weapon being used by a terrorist is kidding themselves. I think there's a lot of people in the intelligence community    a lot of people who deal with this work in general think it's almost inevitable  unless we do certain things to really try to defuse the risk  like better interdiction  better prevention  better fixing  you know  better screening of cargo containers that are coming into the country and so forth. There's a lot that can be done to make us a lot safer. At this particular moment  we actually could end up seeing a nuclear detonation in one of our cities. I don't think we would see an all out nuclear war any time soon  although even that is not completely off the table. There's still enough nuclear weapons in the arsenals of the superpowers to destroy the Earth many  many times over. There are flash points in India and Pakistan  in the Middle East  in North Korea  other places where the use of nuclear weapons  while initially locally  could very rapidly go into a situation where we'd be facing all out nuclear war. It's very unsettling. Here we go. OK. I'm back in my truck  and we drove over the Brooklyn Bridge. We're coming down  and we bring that truck that you just saw somewhere in here  in the Financial District. This is a    kiloton bomb  slightly smaller than was used in Hiroshima. And I want to just conclude this by just giving you some information. I think     news you could use  kind of concept here. So  first of all  this would be horrific beyond anything we can possibly imagine. This is the ultimate. And if you're in the half mile radius of where this bomb went off  you have a    percent chance of not making it. If you're right where the bomb went off  you will be vaporized. And that's    I'm just telling you  this is not good. You assume that. Two mile radius  you have a    percent chance of being killed  and up to about eight miles away    now I'm talking about killed instantly    somewhere between a    and    percent chance of getting killed. The thing about this is that the experience of the nuclear detonation is    first of all  tens of millions of degrees Fahrenheit at the core here  where it goes off  and an extraordinary amount of energy in the form of heat  acute radiation and blast effects. An enormous hurricane like wind  and destruction of buildings almost totally  within this yellow circle here. And what I'm going to focus on  as I come to conclusion here  is that  what happens to you if you're in here  Well  if we're talking about the old days of an all out nuclear attack  you  up here  are as dead as the people here. So it was a moot point. My point now  though  is that there is a lot that we could do for you who are in here  if you've survived the initial blast. You have  when the blast goes off    and by the way  if it ever comes up  don't look at it. If you look at it  you're going to be blind  either temporarily or permanently. So if there's any way that you can avoid  like  avert your eyes  that would be a good thing. If you find yourself alive  but you're in the vicinity of a nuclear weapon  you have    that's gone off    you have    to    minutes  depending on the size and exactly where it went off  to get out of the way before a lethal amount of radiation comes straight down from the mushroom cloud that goes up. In that    to    minutes  all you have to do    and I mean this seriously    is go about a mile away from the blast. And what happens is    this is    I'm going to show you now some fallout plumes. Within    minutes  it comes straight down. Within    hours  lethal radiation is going out with prevailing winds  and it's mostly in this particular direction    it's going northeast. And if you're in this vicinity  you've got to get away. So you're feeling the wind    and there's tremendous wind now that you're going to be feeling    and you want to go perpendicular to the wind  not upwind or downwind . if you are in fact able to see where the blast was in front of you. You've got to get out of there. If you don't get out of there  you're going to be exposed to lethal radiation in very short order. If you can't get out of there  we want you to go into a shelter and stay there. Now  in a shelter in an urban area means you have to be either in a basement as deep as possible  or you have to be on a floor    on a high floor    if it's a ground burst explosion  which it would be  higher than the ninth floor. So you have to be tenth floor or higher  or in the basement. But basically  you've got to get out of town as quickly as possible. And if you do that  you actually can survive a nuclear blast. Over the next few days to a week  there will be a radiation cloud  again  going with the wind  and settling down for another    or    miles out    in this case  over Long Island. And if you're in the direct fallout zone here  you really have to either be sheltered or you have to get out of there  and that's clear. But if you are sheltered  you can actually survive. The difference between knowing information of what you're going to do personally  and not knowing information  can save your life  and it could mean the difference between         to         fatalities from something like this and half a million to         fatalities. So  response planning in the twenty first century is both possible and is essential. But in       there isn't one single American city that has done effective plans to deal with a nuclear detonation disaster. Part of the problem is that the emergency planners themselves  personally  are overwhelmed psychologically by the thought of nuclear catastrophe. They are paralyzed. You say  nuclear  to them  and they're thinking   Oh my God  we're all gone. What's the point  It's futile.  And we're trying to tell them   It's not futile. We can change the survival rates by doing some commonsensical things.  So the goal here is to minimize fatalities. And I just want to leave you with the personal points that I think you might be interested in. The key to surviving a nuclear blast is getting out  and not going into harm's way. That's basically all we're going to be talking about here. And the farther you are away in distance  the longer it is in time from the initial blast  and the more separation between you and the outside atmosphere  the better. So separation    hopefully with dirt or concrete  or being in a basement    distance and time is what will save you. So here's what you do. First of all  as I said  don't stare at the light flash  if you can. I don't know you could possibly resist doing that. But let's assume  theoretically  you want to do that. You want to keep your mouth open  so your eardrums don't burst from the pressures. If you're very close to what happened  you actually do have to duck and cover  like Bert told you  Bert the Turtle. And you want to get under something so that you're not injured or killed by objects  if that's at all possible. You want to get away from the initial fallout mushroom cloud  I said  in just a few minutes. And shelter and place. You want to move  only  crosswind for  .  miles. You know  if you're out there and you see buildings horribly destroyed and down in that direction  less destroyed here  then you know that it was over there  the blast  and you're going this way  as long as you're going crosswise to the wind. Once you're out and evacuating  you want to keep as much of your skin  your mouth and nose covered  as long as that covering doesn't impede you moving and getting out of there. And finally  you want to get decontaminated as soon as possible. And if you're wearing clothing  you've taken off your clothing  you're going to get showered down some place and remove the radiation that would be    the radioactive material that might be on you. And then you want to stay in shelter for    to    hours minimum  but you're going to wait hopefully    you'll have your little wind up  battery less radio  and you'll be waiting for people to tell you when it's safe to go outside. That's what you need to do. In conclusion  nuclear war is less likely than before  but by no means out of the question  and it's not survivable. Nuclear terrorism is possible    it may be probable    but is survivable. And this is Jack Geiger  who's one of the heroes of the U.S. public health community. And Jack said the only way to deal with nuclear anything  whether it's war or terrorism  is abolition of nuclear weapons. And you want something to work on once you've fixed global warming  I urge you to think about the fact that we have to do something about this unacceptable  inhumane reality of nuclear weapons in our world. Now  this is my favorite civil defense slide  and I       I don't want to be indelicate  but this    he's no longer in office. We don't really care  OK. This was sent to me by somebody who is an aficionado of civil defense procedures  but the fact of the matter is that America's gone through a very hard time. We've not been focused  we've not done what we had to do  and now we're facing the potential of bad  hell on Earth. Thank you. We really need to put the best we have to offer within reach of our children. If we don't do that  we're going to get the generation we deserve. They're going to learn from whatever it is they have around them. And we  as now the elite  parents  librarians  professionals  whatever it is  a bunch of our activities are  in fact  in trying to get the best we have to offer within reach of those around us  or as broadly as we can. I'm going to start and end this talk with a couple things that are carved in stone. One is what's on the Boston Public Library. Carved above their door is   Free to All.  It's kind of an inspiring statement  and I'll go back at the end of this. I'm a librarian  and what I'm trying to do is bring all of the works of knowledge to as many people as want to read it. And the idea of using technology is perfect for us. I think we have the opportunity to one up the Greeks. It's not easy to one up the Greeks. But with the industriousness of the Egyptians  they were able to build the Library of Alexandria    the idea of a copy of every book of all the peoples of the world. The problem was you actually had to go to Alexandria to go to it. On the other hand  if you did  then great things happened. I think we can one up the Greeks and achieve something. And I'm going to try to argue only one point today  that universal access to all knowledge is within our grasp. So if I'm successful  then you'll actually come away thinking  yeah  we could actually achieve the great vision of everything ever published  everything that was ever meant for distribution  available to anybody in the world that's ever wanted to have access to it. Yes  there's issues about how money should be distributed  and that's still being refigured out. But I'd say there's plenty of money  and there's plenty of demand  so we can actually achieve that. But I'm going to go over the technological  social and sort of where are we as a whole  trying to get to that particular vision. And the way I'm going to try to do this is do it like the Amazon.com website  the books  music  video and just go step    media type by media type  just go and say  all right  how're we doing on this  So if we start with books  you know  sort of where are we  Well  first you have to  as an engineer  scope the problem. How big is it  If you wanted to put all of the published works online so that anybody could have it available  well  how big a problem is it  Well  we don't really know  but the largest print library in the world is the Library of Congress. It's    million volumes     million volumes. It is  by far and away  the largest print library in the world. And a book  if you had a book  is about a megabyte  so    you know  if you had it in Microsoft Word. So a megabyte     million megabytes is    terabytes    it goes mega   giga   tera .    terabytes.    terabytes fits in a computer system that's about this big  on spinning Linux drives  and it costs about        dollars. So for the cost of a house    or around here  a garage    you can put  you can have spinning all of the words in the Library of Congress. That's pretty neat. Then the question is  what do you get  You know  is it worth trying to get there  Do you actually want it online  Some of the first things that people do is they make book readers that allow you to search inside the books  and that's kind of fun. And you can download these things  and look around them in new and different ways. And you can get at them remotely  if you happen to have a laptop. There's starting to be some of these sort of page turn y interfaces that look a whole lot like books in certain ways  and you can search them  make little tabs  and it's kind of cute    still very book like    on your laptop. But I don't know  reading things on a laptop    whenever I pull up my laptop  it always feels like work. I think that's one of the reasons why the Kindle is so great. I don't have to feel like I'm at work to read a Kindle. It's starting to be a little bit more specified. But I have to say that there's older technologies that I tend to like. I like the physical book. And I think we can go and use our technology to go and digitize things  put them on the Net  and then download  print them and bind them  and end up with books again. And we sort of said  well  how hard is this  And it turns out to not be very hard. We actually went off to make a bookmobile. And a bookmobile    the size of a van with a satellite dish  a printer  binder and cutter  and kids make their own books. It costs about three dollars to download  print and bind a normal  old book. And they actually come out kind of nice looking. You can actually get really good looking books for on the order of one penny per page  sort of the parts cost for doing this. So the idea of    this technology actually may end up putting books back in people's hands again. There are some other bookmobiles running around. This is Eric Eldred making books at Walden Pond    Thoreau's works. This is just before he got kicked out by the Parks Services  for competing with the bookstore there. In India  they've got another couple bookmobiles running around. And this is the opening day at the Library of Alexandria  the new Library of Alexandria  in Egypt. It was quite popularly attended. And kids starting to make their own books  and a happy kid with the first book that he's ever owned. So the idea of being able to use this technology to end up with paper where I can handle sort of sounds a little retro  but I think it still has its place. And being from the Silicon Valley  sort of utopian sort of world  we thought  if we can make this technology work in rural Uganda  we might have something. So we actually got some funding from the World Bank to try it out. And we found in about    days we could go and take a couple folks from Silicon Valley  fly them to Uganda  buy a car  set up the first Internet connection at the National Library of Uganda  figure out what they wanted  and get a program going making books in rural Uganda. And it actually    so technologically  it works. What we found out of this is we didn't have the right books. So the books were in the library. We could get it to people  if they're digitized  but we didn't know how to quite get them digitized. Everybody thought the answer is  send things to India and China. And so we've tried that  and I'll go over that in a moment. There are some newer technologies for delivering that have happened that are actually quite exciting as well. One is a print on demand machine that looks like a Rube Goldberg machine. We have one of these things now. It's completely cool. It's all conveyor belt  and it makes a book. And it's called the  Espresso Book Machine   and in about    minutes  you can press a button and make a book. Something else I'm quite excited about in this particular domain  beyond these sort of kiosk y things where you can get books on demand  is some of these new little screens that are coming out. And one of my favorites in this is the      laptop. And I don't mean to steal any thunder here  but we've gone and used one of these things to be an e book reader. So here's one of the beta units and you can    it actually turns out to be a really good looking e book reader. And we have a quick hack that we did to try to put one of our books on it  and it turns out that     dots per inch means that you can put scanned books on them that look really good. At     dots per inch  it's kind of the equivalent of a     dot print laser printer. We're in good enough shape. You actually can go and read scanned books quite easily. So the idea of electronic books is starting to come about. But how do you go about doing all this scanning  So we thought  okay  well  let's try out this send books to India thing. And there was a project with  funded by the National Science Foundation    sent a bunch of scanners  and the American libraries were supposed to send books. Well  they didn't. They didn't want to send their books. So we bought         books and sent them to India. And then we learned why you don't want to send books to India. The lesson we learned out of this is  scan your own books. If you really care about books  you're going to scan them better  especially if they're valuable books. If they're new books and you can just  you know  butcher them  because you could just buy another one  that's not such a big deal in terms of doing high quality scanning. But do things that you love. But the Indians have been scanning a lot of their own books    about         now    doing very well. The Chinese did over a million  and the Egyptians are about       . But we sent    thought  OK  if we're going to need to do this  let's do it in library. How do we go and do this  and how do we get it down so that it's a cost point that we could afford  And we sort of picked the price point of    cents a page. If it's basically the cost of xeroxing to basically digitize  OCR  package it up  make it so that you could download  print and bind it    the whole shebang    we would have achieved something. So we started out trying to figure out. How do we get to    cents  And we tried these robot things  and they worked pretty well    sort of these auto page turning things. If we can have Mars Rovers  you'd think you could turn pages. But it actually turns out to be pretty hard to turn pages  and the volume isn't there. So anyway    so we ended up making our own book scanner  and with two digital  high grade  professional digital cameras  controlled museum lighting  so even if it's a black and white book  you can go and get the proper intonation. So you basically do a beautiful  respectful job. This is not a fax  this is    the idea is to do a beautiful job as you're going through these libraries. And we've been able to achieve    cents a page if we run things in volume. This is what it looks like at the University of Toronto. And actually  it turns out to  you know  pay a living wage. People seem to love it. Yes  it's a little boring  but some people kind of get into the Zen of it. And especially if it's kind of interesting books that you care about  in languages that you can read. We actually have been able to do a pretty good job of this  at getting    cents a page. So    cents a page      pages in your average book     dollars a book. The Library of Congress  if you did the whole darn thing       million books    is about     million dollars  right  But a million books  I think  actually would be a pretty good start  and that would cost    million dollars. That's not that big a bill. And what we've been able to do is get into libraries. We've now got eight of these scanning centers in three countries  and libraries are up for having their books scanned. The Getty here is moving their books to the UCLA  which is where we have one these scanning centers  and scanning their out of copyright books  which is fabulous. So we're starting to get the institutional responsibility. The thing we're missing is the    cents. If we can get the    cents  all the rest of it flows. We've scanned about         books. Now we're scanning about        books a month  and it's starting to gear up another factor of two from there. So all in all  that's going very well. And we're starting to move out of the just out of copyright into the out of print world. So I think of    we're kind of going from the out of copyright  library stuff  and Amazon.com is coming from the in print world. And I think we'll meet in the middle some place  and have the classic thing that you have  which is a publishing system and a library system working in parallel. And so we're starting up a program to do out of print works  but loaning them. Exactly what loaning means  I'm not quite sure. But anyway  loaning out of print works from the Boston Public Library  the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute and a few other libraries that are starting to participate in this program  to try out this model of where does a library stop and where does the bookstore take over. So all in all  it's possible to do this in large scale. We're also going back over microfilm and getting that online. So  we can do    cents a page  we're going        books a month and we've got about         books online  counting all the other projects that are starting to add in. So what I wanted to argue is  books are within our grasp. The idea of taking on the whole ball of wax is not that big a deal. Yes  it costs tens of millions  low hundreds of millions  but one time shot and we've got basically the history of printed literature online. And then  there's business model issues about how to try to effectively market it and get it to people. But it is within our grasp  technologically and law wise  at least for the out of print and out of copyright  we suggest  to be able to get the whole darn thing online. Now let's go for audio  and I'm going to go through these. So how much is there  Well  as best we can tell  there are about two to three million disks having been published    so   s  long playing records and CDs    or at least that's the largest archives of published materials we've been able to sort of point at. It costs about    dollars a piece to go and take a disk and put it online  if you're doing things in volume. But we've found that the rights issues are really quite thorny. This is a fairly heavily litigated area  so we've found that there are niches in the music world that aren't served terribly well by the classic commercial publishing system. And we've been starting to make these available by going and offering shelf space on the Net. In the United States  it doesn't cost you to give something away. Right  If you give something to a charity or to the public  you get a pat on the back and a tax donation    except on the Net  where you can go broke. If you put up a video of your garage band  and it starts getting heavily accessed  you can lose your guitars or your house. This doesn't make any sense. So we've offered unlimited storage  unlimited bandwidth  forever  for free  to anybody that has something to share that belongs in a library. And we've been getting a lot of takers. One is the rock 'n' rollers. The rock 'n' rollers had a tradition of sharing  as long as nobody made any money. You could    concert recordings  it's not the commercial recordings  but concert recordings  started by the Grateful Dead. And we get about two or three bands a day signing up. They give permission  and we get about    or    concerts a day. We have about        concerts  everything the Grateful Dead ever did  up on the Net  so that people can see it and listen to this material. So audio is possible to put up  but the rights issues are really pretty thorny. We've got a lot of collections now    a couple hundred thousand items    and it's growing over time. Moving images  if you think of theatrical releases  there are not that many of them. As best we can tell  there are about         to         movies ever that are really meant for a large scale theatrical distribution. It's just not that many. But half of those were Indian. But anyway  it's doable  but we've only found about a thousand of these things that    to be out of copyright. So we've digitized those and made those available. But we've found that there's lots of other types of movies that haven't really seen the light of day    archival films. We've found  also  a lot of political films  a lot of amateur films  all sorts of things that are basically needing a home  a permanent home. So we've been starting to make these available and it's grown to be very popular. We're not quite a YouTube. We tended towards longer term things and also things that people can reuse and make into new movies  which has just been great fun. Television comes quite a bit larger. We started recording    channels of television    hours a day. It's sort of the biggest TiVo box you've ever seen. It's about a petabyte  so far  of worldwide television    Russian  Chinese  Japanese  Iraqi  Al Jazeera  BBC  CNN  ABC  CBS  NBC       hours a day. We only put one week up  which is mostly for cost reasons  which is the       sort of from          . For one week  what did the world see  CNN was saying that Palestinians were dancing in the streets. Were they  Let's look at the Palestinian television and find out. How can we have critical thinking without being able to quote and being able to compare what happened in the past  And television is dreadfully unrecorded and unquotable  except by Jon Stewart  who does a fabulous job. So anyway  television is  I would suggest  within our grasp. So    dollars per video hour  and also about     dollars to     dollars per celluloid hour  we're able to go and get materials online very inexpensively and have them up on the Net. And we've got  now  a lot of these materials. So we've got about         pieces up there. So books  music  video  software. There's only        titles of it. Mostly the issues there are legal issues and breaking copy protections. But we've worked through some of those  but we've still got real problems in Washington. Well  we're best known as the World Wide Web. We've been archiving the World Wide Web since     . We take a snapshot of every website and all of the pages on it  every two months. And actually  it's really been pioneered by Alexa Internet  which donates this collection to the Internet Archive. And it's been growing along for the last    years  and it's a fantastic resource. And we've made a Wayback Machine that you can then go and see old websites kind of the way they were. If you go and search on something    this is Google.com  the different versions of it that we have  this is what it looks like when it was an alpha release  and this is what it looked like at Stanford. So anyway  you've got basically an idea of where things came from. Mostly  people want to see their old stuff out of this. If there's one thing that we want to learn from the Library of Alexandria version one  which is probably best known for burning  is  don't just have one copy. So we've started to    we've made another copy of all of this and we actually put it back in the Library of Alexandria. So this is a picture of the Internet Archive at the Library of Alexandria. And we now have also another copy building up in Amsterdam. So  we should put it in the San Andreas Fault Line in San Francisco  flood zone in Amsterdam and in the Middle East. Right  so anyway ... so we're hedging our bets here. If we go and put it in a couple more places  I think we'll be in good shape. There's a political and social question out of this. Is all of this  as we go digital  is it going to be public or private  There's some large companies that have seen this vision  that are doing large scale digitization  but they're locking up the public domain. The question is  is that the world that we really want to live in  What's the role of the public versus the private as things go forward  How do we go and have a world where we both have libraries and publishing in the future  just as we basically benefited as we were growing up  So universal access to all knowledge    I think it can be one of the greatest achievements of humankind  like the man on the moon  or the Gutenberg Bible  or the Library of Alexandria. It could be something that we're remembered for  for millennia  for having achieved. And as I said before  I'll end with something that's carved above the door of the Carnegie Library. Carnegie    one of the great capitalists of this country    carved above his legacy   Free to the People.  Thank you very much. David Gallo  This is Bill Lange. I'm Dave Gallo. And we're going to tell you some stories from the sea here in video. We've got some of the most incredible video of Titanic that's ever been seen  and we're not going to show you any of it. The truth of the matter is that the Titanic    even though it's breaking all sorts of box office records    it's not the most exciting story from the sea. And the problem  I think  is that we take the ocean for granted. When you think about it  the oceans are    percent of the planet. Most of the planet is ocean water. The average depth is about two miles. Part of the problem  I think  is we stand at the beach  or we see images like this of the ocean  and you look out at this great big blue expanse  and it's shimmering and it's moving and there's waves and there's surf and there's tides  but you have no idea for what lies in there. And in the oceans  there are the longest mountain ranges on the planet. Most of the animals are in the oceans. Most of the earthquakes and volcanoes are in the sea  at the bottom of the sea. The biodiversity and the biodensity in the ocean is higher  in places  than it is in the rainforests. It's mostly unexplored  and yet there are beautiful sights like this that captivate us and make us become familiar with it. But when you're standing at the beach  I want you to think that you're standing at the edge of a very unfamiliar world. We have to have a very special technology to get into that unfamiliar world. We use the submarine Alvin and we use cameras  and the cameras are something that Bill Lange has developed with the help of Sony. Marcel Proust said   The true voyage of discovery is not so much in seeking new landscapes as in having new eyes.  People that have partnered with us have given us new eyes  not only on what exists    the new landscapes at the bottom of the sea    but also how we think about life on the planet itself. Here's a jelly. It's one of my favorites  because it's got all sorts of working parts. This turns out to be the longest creature in the oceans. It gets up to about     feet long. But see all those different working things  I love that kind of stuff. It's got these fishing lures on the bottom. They're going up and down. It's got tentacles dangling  swirling around like that. It's a colonial animal. These are all individual animals banding together to make this one creature. And it's got these jet thrusters up in front that it'll use in a moment  and a little light. If you take all the big fish and schooling fish and all that  put them on one side of the scale  put all the jelly type of animals on the other side  those guys win hands down. Most of the biomass in the ocean is made out of creatures like this. Here's the X wing death jelly. The bioluminescence    they use the lights for attracting mates and attracting prey and communicating. We couldn't begin to show you our archival stuff from the jellies. They come in all different sizes and shapes. Bill Lange  We tend to forget about the fact that the ocean is miles deep on average  and that we're real familiar with the animals that are in the first     or     feet  but we're not familiar with what exists from there all the way down to the bottom. And these are the types of animals that live in that three dimensional space  that micro gravity environment that we really haven't explored. You hear about giant squid and things like that  but some of these animals get up to be approximately          feet long. They're very little understood. DG  This is one of them  another one of our favorites  because it's a little octopod. You can actually see through his head. And here he is  flapping with his ears and very gracefully going up. We see those at all depths and even at the greatest depths. They go from a couple of inches to a couple of feet. They come right up to the submarine    they'll put their eyes right up to the window and peek inside the sub. This is really a world within a world  and we're going to show you two. In this case  we're passing down through the mid ocean and we see creatures like this. This is kind of like an undersea rooster. This guy  that looks incredibly formal  in a way. And then one of my favorites. What a face  This is basically scientific data that you're looking at. It's footage that we've collected for scientific purposes. And that's one of the things that Bill's been doing  is providing scientists with this first view of animals like this  in the world where they belong. They don't catch them in a net. They're actually looking at them down in that world. We're going to take a joystick  sit in front of our computer  on the Earth  and press the joystick forward  and fly around the planet. We're going to look at the mid ocean ridge  a        mile long mountain range. The average depth at the top of it is about a mile and a half. And we're over the Atlantic    that's the ridge right there    but we're going to go across the Caribbean  Central America  and end up against the Pacific  nine degrees north. We make maps of these mountain ranges with sound  with sonar  and this is one of those mountain ranges. We're coming around a cliff here on the right. The height of these mountains on either side of this valley is greater than the Alps in most cases. And there's tens of thousands of those mountains out there that haven't been mapped yet. This is a volcanic ridge. We're getting down further and further in scale. And eventually  we can come up with something like this. This is an icon of our robot  Jason  it's called. And you can sit in a room like this  with a joystick and a headset  and drive a robot like that around the bottom of the ocean in real time. One of the things we're trying to do at Woods Hole with our partners is to bring this virtual world    this world  this unexplored region    back to the laboratory. Because we see it in bits and pieces right now. We see it either as sound  or we see it as video  or we see it as photographs  or we see it as chemical sensors  but we never have yet put it all together into one interesting picture. Here's where Bill's cameras really do shine. This is what's called a hydrothermal vent. And what you're seeing here is a cloud of densely packed  hydrogen sulfide rich water coming out of a volcanic axis on the sea floor. Gets up to          degrees F  somewhere in that range. So that's all water under the sea    a mile and a half  two miles  three miles down. And we knew it was volcanic back in the '  s  '  s. And then we had some hint that these things existed all along the axis of it  because if you've got volcanism  water's going to get down from the sea into cracks in the sea floor  come in contact with magma  and come shooting out hot. We weren't really aware that it would be so rich with sulfides  hydrogen sulfides. We didn't have any idea about these things  which we call chimneys. This is one of these hydrothermal vents. Six hundred degree F water coming out of the Earth. On either side of us are mountain ranges that are higher than the Alps  so the setting here is very dramatic. BL  The white material is a type of bacteria that thrives at     degrees C. DG  I think that's one of the greatest stories right now that we're seeing from the bottom of the sea  is that the first thing we see coming out of the sea floor after a volcanic eruption is bacteria. And we started to wonder for a long time  how did it all get down there  What we find out now is that it's probably coming from inside the Earth. Not only is it coming out of the Earth    so  biogenesis made from volcanic activity    but that bacteria supports these colonies of life. The pressure here is       pounds per square inch. A mile and a half from the surface to two miles to three miles    no sun has ever gotten down here. All the energy to support these life forms is coming from inside the Earth    so  chemosynthesis. And you can see how dense the population is. These are called tube worms. BL  These worms have no digestive system. They have no mouth. But they have two types of gill structures. One for extracting oxygen out of the deep sea water  another one which houses this chemosynthetic bacteria  which takes the hydrothermal fluid    that hot water that you saw coming out of the bottom    and converts that into simple sugars that the tube worm can digest. DG  You can see  here's a crab that lives down there. He's managed to grab a tip of these worms. Now  they normally retract as soon as a crab touches them. Oh  Good going. So  as soon as a crab touches them  they retract down into their shells  just like your fingernails. There's a whole story being played out here that we're just now beginning to have some idea of because of this new camera technology. BL  These worms live in a real temperature extreme. Their foot is at about     degrees C and their head is out at three degrees C  so it's like having your hand in boiling water and your foot in freezing water. That's how they like to live. DG  This is a female of this kind of worm. And here's a male. You watch. It doesn't take long before two guys here    this one and one that will show up over here    start to fight. Everything you see is played out in the pitch black of the deep sea. There are never any lights there  except the lights that we bring. Here they go. On one of the last dive series  we counted     species in these areas        were new  new species. BL  One of the big problems is that for the biologists working at these sites  it's rather difficult to collect these animals. And they disintegrate on the way up  so the imagery is critical for the science. DG  Two octopods at about two miles depth. This pressure thing really amazes me    that these animals can exist there at a depth with pressure enough to crush the Titanic like an empty Pepsi can. What we saw up till now was from the Pacific. This is from the Atlantic. Even greater depth. You can see this shrimp is harassing this poor little guy here  and he'll bat it away with his claw. Whack  And the same thing's going on over here. What they're getting at is that    on the back of this crab    the foodstuff here is this very strange bacteria that lives on the backs of all these animals. And what these shrimp are trying to do is actually harvest the bacteria from the backs of these animals. And the crabs don't like it at all. These long filaments that you see on the back of the crab are actually created by the product of that bacteria. So  the bacteria grows hair on the crab. On the back  you see this again. The red dot is the laser light of the submarine Alvin to give us an idea about how far away we are from the vents. Those are all shrimp. You see the hot water over here  here and here  coming out. They're clinging to a rock face and actually scraping bacteria off that rock face. Here's a tiny  little vent that's come out of the side of that pillar. Those pillars get up to several stories. So here  you've got this valley with this incredible alien landscape of pillars and hot springs and volcanic eruptions and earthquakes  inhabited by these very strange animals that live only on chemical energy coming out of the ground. They don't need the sun at all. BL  You see this white V shaped mark on the back of the shrimp  It's actually a light sensing organ. It's how they find the hydrothermal vents. The vents are emitting a black body radiation    an IR signature    and so they're able to find these vents at considerable distances. DG  All this stuff is happening along that        mile long mountain range that we're calling the ribbon of life  because just even today  as we speak  there's life being generated there from volcanic activity. This is the first time we've ever tried this any place. We're going to try to show you high definition from the Pacific. We're moving up one of these pillars. This one's several stories tall. In it  you'll see that it's a habitat for a lot of different animals. There's a funny kind of hot plate here  with vent water coming out of it. So all of these are individual homes for worms. Now here's a closer view of that community. Here's crabs here  worms here. There are smaller animals crawling around. Here's pagoda structures. I think this is the neatest looking thing. I just can't get over this    that you've got these little chimneys sitting here smoking away. This stuff is toxic as hell  by the way. You could never get a permit to dump this in the ocean  and it's coming out all from it. It's unbelievable. It's basically sulfuric acid  and it's being just dumped out  at incredible rates. And animals are thriving    and we probably came from here. That's probably where we evolved from. BL  This bacteria that we've been talking about turns out to be the most simplest form of life found. There are a number of groups that are proposing that life evolved at these vent sites. Although the vent sites are short lived    an individual site may last only    years or so    as an ecosystem they've been stable for millions    well  billions    of years. DG  It works too well. You see there're some fish inside here as well. There's a fish sitting here. Here's a crab with his claw right at the end of that tube worm  waiting for that worm to stick his head out. BL  The biologists right now cannot explain why these animals are so active. The worms are growing inches per week  DG  I already said that this site  from a human perspective  is toxic as hell. Not only that  but on top    the lifeblood    that plumbing system turns off every year or so. Their plumbing system turns off  so the sites have to move. And then there's earthquakes  and then volcanic eruptions  on the order of one every five years  that completely wipes the area out. Despite that  these animals grow back in about a year's time. You're talking about biodensities and biodiversity  again  higher than the rainforest that just springs back to life. Is it sensitive  Yes. Is it fragile  No  it's not really very fragile. I'll end up with saying one thing. There's a story in the sea  in the waters of the sea  in the sediments and the rocks of the sea floor. It's an incredible story. What we see when we look back in time  in those sediments and rocks  is a record of Earth history. Everything on this planet    everything    works by cycles and rhythms. The continents move apart. They come back together. Oceans come and go. Mountains come and go. Glaciers come and go. El Nino comes and goes. It's not a disaster  it's rhythmic. What we're learning now  it's almost like a symphony. It's just like music    it really is just like music. And what we're learning now is that you can't listen to a five billion year long symphony  get to today and say   Stop  We want tomorrow's note to be the same as it was today.  It's absurd. It's just absurd. So  what we've got to learn now is to find out where this planet's going at all these different scales and work with it. Learn to manage it. The concept of preservation is futile. Conservation's tougher  but we can probably get there. Thank you very much. Thank you. When I knew I was going to come to speak to you  I thought   I gotta call my mother.  I have a little Cuban mother    she's about that big. Four feet. Nothing larger than the sum of her figurative parts. You still with me   Laughter  I called her up.  Hello  how're you doing  baby    Hey  ma  I got to talk to you.   You're talking to me already. What's the matter   I said   I've got to talk to a bunch of nice people.   You're always talking to nice people  except when you went to the White House.   Ma  don't start   And I told her I was coming to TED  and she said   What's the problem   And I said   Well  I'm not sure.  I said   I have to talk to them about stories. It's 'Technology  Entertainment and Design.'  And she said   Well  you design a story when you make it up  it's entertainment when you tell it  and you're going to use a microphone.  I said   You're a peach  ma. Pop there    What's the matter  The pearls of wisdom leaping from my lips like lemmings is no good for you   Then my pop got on there. My pop  he's one of the old souls  you know    old Cuban man from Camaguey. Camaguey is a province in Cuba. He's from Florida. He was born there in     . He grew up in a bohio of dirt floors  and the structure was the kind used by the Tainos  our old Arawak ancestors. My father is at once quick witted  wickedly funny  and then poignancy turns on a dime and leaves you breathless.  Papi  help.   I already heard your mother. I think she's right.   After what I just told you   My whole life  my father's been there. So we talked for a few minutes  and he said   Why don't you tell them what you believe   I love that  but we don't have the time. Good storytelling is crafting a story that someone wants to listen to. Great story is the art of letting go. So I'm going to tell you a little story. Remember  this tradition comes to us not from the mists of Avalon  back in time  but further still  before we were scratching out these stories on papyrus  or we were doing the pictographs on walls in moist  damp caves. Back then  we had an urge  a need  to tell the story. When Lexus wants to sell you a car  they're telling you a story. Have you been watching the commercials  Because every one of us has this desire  for once    just once    to tell our story and have it heard. There are stories you tell from stages. There's stories that you may tell in a small group of people with some good wine. And there's stories you tell late at night to a friend  maybe once in your life. And then there are stories that we whisper into a Stygian darkness. I'm not telling you that story. I'm telling you this one. It's called   You're Going to Miss Me.  It's about human connection. My Cuban mother  which I just briefly introduced you to in that short character sketch  came to the United States one thousand years ago. I was born in       I forget  and I came to this country with them in the aftermath of the Cuban revolution. We went from Havana  Cuba to Decatur  Georgia. And Decatur  Georgia's a small Southern town. And in that little Southern town  I grew up  and grew up hearing these stories. But this story only happened a few years ago. I called my mom. It was a Saturday morning. And I was calling about how to make ajiaco. It's a Cuban meal. It's delicious. It's savory. It makes spit froth in the little corners of your mouth    is that enough  It makes your armpits juicy  you know  That kind of food  yeah. This is the sensory part of the program  people. I called my mother  and she said   Carmen  I need you to come  please. I need to go to the mall  and you know your father now  he takes a nap in the afternoon  and I got to go. I got an errand to run.  Let me parenthetically pause here and tell you    Esther  my mother  had stopped driving several years ago  to the collective relief of the entire city of Atlanta. Any vehicular outing with that woman from the time I was a young child  guys  naturally included flashing  blue lights. But she'd become adept at dodging the boys in blue  and when she did meet them  oh  she had wonderful  well  rapport.  Ma'am  did you know that was a light you just ran    You don't speak English    No.  But eventually  every dog has its day  and she ended up in traffic court  where she bartered with the judge for a discount. There's a historical marker. But now she was a septuagenarian  she'd stopped driving. And that meant that everyone in the family had to sign up to take her to have her hair dyed  you know  that peculiar color of blue that matches her polyester pants suit  you know  same color as the Buick. Anybody  All right. Little picks on the legs  where she does her needlepoint  and leaves little loops. Rockports    they're for this. That's why they call them that. This is her ensemble. And this is the woman that wants me to come on a Saturday morning when I have a lot to do  but it doesn't take long because Cuban guilt is a weighty thing. I'm not going political on you but ... And so  I go to my mother's. I show up. She's in the carport. Of course  they have a carport. The kind with the corrugated roof  you know. The Buick's parked outside  and she's jingling  jangling a pair of keys.  I got a surprise for you  baby    We taking your car    Not we  I.  And she reaches into her pocket and pulls out a catastrophe. Somebody's storytelling. Interactive art. You can talk to me. Oh  a driver's license  a perfectly valid driver's license. Issued  evidently  by the DMV in her own county of Gwinnett. Blithering fucking idiots. I said   Is that thing real    I think so.   Can you even see    I guess I must.   Oh  Jesus.  She gets into the car    she's sitting on two phone books. I can't even make this part up because she's that tiny. She's engineered an umbrella so she can    bam     slam the door. Her daughter  me  the village idiot with the ice cream cone in the middle of her forehead  is still standing there  slack jawed.  You coming  You no coming    Oh  my God.  I said   OK  fine. Does pop know you're driving    Are you kidding me    How are you doing it    He's got to sleep sometime.  And so we left my father fast asleep  because I knew he'd kill me if I let her go by herself  and we get in the car. Puts it in reverse. Fifty five out of the driveway  in reverse. I am buckling in seatbelts from the front. I'm yanking them in from the back. I'm doing double knots. I mean  I've got a mouth as dry as the Kalahari Desert. I've got a white knuckle grip on the door. You know what I'm talking about  And she's whistling  and finally I do the kind of birth breathing    you know  that one  Only a couple of women are going uh huh  uh huh  uh huh. Right. And I said   Ma  would you slow down   Because now she's picked up the Highway      the perimeter around Atlanta  which encompasses now    there's seven lanes  she's on all of them  y'all. I said   Ma  pick a lane    They give you seven lanes  they expect you to use them.  And there she goes  right. I don't believe for a minute she has been out and not been stopped. So  I think  hey  we can talk. It'll be a diversion. It'll help my breathing. It'll do something for my pulse  maybe.  Mommy  I know you have been stopped.   No  no  what you talking about    You have a license. How long have you been driving    Four or five days.   Yeah. And you haven't been stopped    I did not get a ticket.  I said   Yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  but come on  come on  come on.   OK  so I stopped at a light and there's a guy  you know  in the back.   Would this guy have  like  a blue uniform and a terrified look on his face    You weren't there  don't start.   Come on. You got a ticket    No.  She explained   The man     I have to tell you as she did  because it loses something if I don't  you know     he come to the window  and he does a thing like this  which tells me he's pretty old  you know. So I look up and I'm thinking  maybe he's still going to think I'm kind of cute.   Ma  are you still doing that    If it works  it works  baby. So  I say  'Perdon  yo no hablo ingles.' Well  wouldn't you know  he had been in Honduras for the Peace Corps.  So he's talking to her  and at some point she says   Then  you know  it was it. That was it. It was done.   Yeah  What  He gave you a ticket  He didn't give you a ticket  What    No  I look up  and the light  she change.  You should be terrified. Now  I don't know if she's toying with me  kind of like a cat batting back a mouse  batting back a mouse    left paw  right paw  left paw  right paw    but by now  we've reached the mall. Now  you have all been at a mall during the holidays  yes  Talk to me. Yes. Yes. You can say yes. Audience  Yes. Carmen Agra Deedy  All right  then you know that you have now entered parking lot purgatory  praying to that saint of perpetual availability that as you join that serpentine line of cars crawling along  some guy's going to turn on the brake lights just as you pull up behind him. But that doesn't happen most of the time  right  So  first I say   Ma  why are we here    You mean  like  in the car    No  don't    why are we here today  It's Saturday. It's the holidays.   Because I have to exchange your father's underwear.  Now  see  this is the kind of Machiavellian thinking  that you really have to    you know  in my mind  it's a rabbit's warren  this woman's mind. Do I want to walk in  because unless I have Ariadne's thread to anchor    enough metaphors for you     somewhere  I may not get out. But you know.  Why do we have to take pop's underwear back now  And why  What is wrong with his underwear    It will upset you.   It won't upset me. Why  What  Is something wrong with him    No  no  no. The only thing with him is  he's an idiot. I sent him to the store  which was my first mistake  and he went to buy underwear  and he bought the grippers  and he's supposed to buy the boxers.   Why    I read it on the Intersnet. You cannot have children.   Oh  my God   Olivia  Huh  Huh  By now  we have now crawled another four feet  and my mother finally says to me   I knew it  I knew it. I'm an immigrant. We make a space. What I tell you  Right there.  And she points out the passenger window  and I look out  and three    three    aisles down   Look  the Chevy.  You want to laugh  but you don't know    you're that politically corrected  have you noticed  Correct the other direction now  it's OK.  Look  the Chevy    he's coming this way.   Mama  mama  mama  wait  wait  wait. The Chevy is three aisles away.  She looks at me like I'm her  you know  her moron child  the cretin  the one she's got to speak to very slowly and distinctly.  I know that  honey. Get out of the car and go stand in the parking space till I get there.  OK  I want a vote. Come on  come on. No  no. How many of you once in your    you were a kid  you were an adult    you stood in a parking space to hold it for someone  See  we're a secret club with a secret handshake. And years of therapy later  we're doing great. We're doing great. We're doing fine. Well  I stood up to her. This is    you know  you'd think by now I'm    and still holding  I said   No way  ma  you have embarrassed me my entire life.  Of course  her comeback is   When have I embarrassed you   And she's still talking while she puts the car in park  hits the emergency brake  opens the door  and with a spryness astounding in a woman her age  she jumps out of the car  knocks out the phone books  and then she walks around    she's carrying her cheap Kmart purse with her    around the front of the car. She has amazing land speed for a woman her age  too. Before I know it  she has skiddled across the parking lot and in between the cars  and people behind me  with that kind of usual religious charity that the holidays bring us  wah wah wah wah.  I'm coming.  Italian hand signals follow. I scoot over. I close the door. I leave the phone books. This is new and fast  just so you    are you still with us  We'll wait for the slow ones. OK. I start  and this is where a child says to me    and the story doesn't work if I tell you about her before  because this is my laconic child. A brevity  brevity of everything with this child. You know  she eats small portions. Language is something to be meted out in small phonemes  you know    just little hmm  hmm hmm. She carries a mean spiral notebook and a pen. She wields great power. She listens  because that's what people who tell stories do first. But she pauses occasionally and says   How do you spell that  What year  OK.  When she writes the expose in about    years  don't believe a word of it. But this is my daughter  Lauren  my remarkable daughter  my borderline Asperger's kid. Bless you  Dr. Watson. She says   Ma  you got to look   Now  when this kid says I got to look  you know. But it isn't like I haven't seen this crime scene before. I grew up with this woman. I said   Lauren  you know what  give me a play by play. I can't.   No  mama  you got to look.  I got to look. You got to look. Don't you want to look  There she is. I look in bewildered awe  she's standing  those Rockports slightly apart  but grounded. She's holding out that cheap Kmart purse  and she is wielding it. She's holding back tons of steel with the sheer force of her little personality  in that crone ish voice  saying things like   Back it up  buddy  No  it's reserved   Ready  Brace yourselves. Here it comes.  No  my daughter  she's coming in the Buick. Honey  sit up so they can see you.  Oh  Jesus. Oh  Jesus. I finally come    and now  it's the South. I don't know what part of the country you live in. I think we all secretly love stories. We all secretly want our blankie and our Boo Bear. We want to curl up and say   Tell it to me  tell it to me. Come on  honey  tell it to me.  But in the South  we love a good story. People have pulled aside  I mean  they've come out of that queue line  they have popped their trunks  pulled out lawn chairs and cool drinks. Bets are placed.  I'm with the little lady. Damn   And she's bringing me in with a slight salsa movement. She is  after all  Cuban. I'm thinking   Accelerator  break. Accelerator  break.  Like you've never thought that in your life  Right  Yeah. I pull in. I put the car in park. Engine's still running    mine  not the car. I jump out next to her going   Don't you move    I'm not going anywhere.  She's got front seat in a Greek tragedy. I come out  and there's Esther. She's hugging the purse.  Que   Which means  what   and so much more.  Ma  have you no shame  People are watching us all around   right  Now  some of them you've got to make up  people. Secret of the trade. Guess what  Some of these stories I sculpt a little  here and there. Some  they're just right there  right there. Put them right there. She says this to me. After I say    let me refresh you     have you no shame    No. I gave it up with pantyhose    they're both too binding.  Yeah  you can clap  but then you're about    seconds from the end. I'm about to snap like a brittle twig  when suddenly someone taps me on the shoulder. Intrepid soul. I'm thinking   This is my kid. How dare she  She jumped out of that car.  That's OK  because my mother yells at me  I yell at her. It's a beautiful hierarchy  and it works. I turn around  but it's not a child. It's a young woman  a little taller than I  pale green  amused eyes. With her is a young man    husband  brother  lover  it's not my job. And she says   Pardon me  ma'am     that's how we talk down there     is that your mother   I said   No  I follow little old women around parking lots to see if they'll stop. Yes  it's my mother   The boy  now  he says.  Well  what my sister meant     they look at each other  it's a knowing glance     God  she's crazy   I said   Spanish   and the young girl and the young boy say   No  no  honey  we just want to know one more thing.  I said   Look  please  let me take care of her  OK  because I know her  and believe me  she's like a small atomic weapon  you know  you just want to handle her really gingerly.  And the girl goes   I know  but  I mean  I swear to God  she reminds us of our mother.  I almost miss it. He turns to her on the heel of his shoe. It's a half whisper   God  I miss her.  They turn then  shoulder to shoulder  and walk away  lost in their own reverie. Memories of some maddening woman who was the luck of their DNA draw. And I turn to Esther  who's rocking on those 'ports  and says   You know what  honey    What  ma    I'm going to drive you crazy probably for about        more years  if you're lucky  but after that  honey  you're going to miss me.   SHIT  This is arguably the back end of the design of animals. But the reason I put this up here is because when I was in Africa last year  my wife and I were driving around  we had this wonderful guide  who showed us something that surprised both of us  and it was very revealing in terms of the fascination that comes with the design of animals. It turns out that in about the     s  the missionaries came to Africa to spread the word of Christianity  to teach English to the natives. And they brought blackboards and chalk. And I'd like you to imagine that that's a blackboard  and I just used some chalk on there. And they brought quite a bit of this stuff. But over the years  the blackboards were fine  but they ran out of chalk. And this is a real crisis for them. And that's where the hyena comes in. The hyena is probably the most perfectly designed scavenging animal in the world. It strip mines carcasses  and it has amazing teeth  because it enables the hyena to essentially eat bones. Now  the end product of that action is up on the board here. What the missionaries would do is  they'd walk around and they'd pick up hyena shit. And the incredible thing about hyena shit is  it makes great chalk. That's not what I'm here to talk about  but it is a fascinating aspect of animal design. What I'm here to talk about is the camel. When I started talking to Richard about what I was going to speak about  I had recently come back from Jordan  where I had an amazing experience with a camel. And we were in the desert. Richard Wurman  That's the end  Keith Bellows  Yeah  yeah. We were in the desert  in Wadi Rum  in a small Jeep. There were four of us  two Bedouin drivers. You can just imagine  this expanse is an ocean of sand      degrees  one water bottle. And we were driving in what they told us was their very  very best Jeep. Didn't look like it to me. And as we started to go through the desert  the Jeep broke down. The guys got out  they put the hood up  they started working under the hood  got it going again. About a hundred yards  it broke down. This went on about     times  we were getting more and more alarmed  we were also getting deeper and deeper into the desert. And eventually  our worst nightmare happened  they flooded the engine. And they said   Ah  no problem  We just get out and walk.  And we said   We get out and walk   One water bottle  remember  guys  four people. And they said   Yeah  yeah  we'll walk. We'll find some camels.  We got out and walked  and sure enough  about half a mile  we came over the crest of this hill  and there was a huge gathering of Bedouin with their camels. The guy went up and started dickering  and    dollars later  we had four camels. They went down like elevators  we got on them. They went back up  and the Bedouin  each Bedouin  four of them  got behind each of the camels with a little whip. And they started slashing away at the back of the camels  and they started galloping. And if you've ever been on a camel  it is a very  very uncomfortable ride. There's also one other aspect about these camels. About every    steps  they lean back and try to take a chunk out of your leg. So we kept on going  and this camel kept on trying to take a chunk out of my leg. And eventually  three miles later  we arrived at our destination  where a Jeep was supposed to meet us. And the camels come down again like elevators  we sort of clumsily get off  and they  obviously  try to take another chunk out of my leg. And I've developed a very wonderful relationship with this creature by this point  and I've realized that this is a mean son of a bitch. And much meaner  by the way  than the Bedouin who greeted me and tried to sell me one of his    daughters to take back to the States. So as we talked  Richard and I  I said   You know  maybe I should bring a camel. It's the best designed animal in the world.  He went   Nah. I don't think we want to be bringing a camel.  And you should be really glad we decided not to bring the camel. So I did the next best thing. I went to the Washington Zoo. Richard said   I want you to get up close and personal with this camel. I want you to inspect its mouth  look at its teeth. Go underneath it. Go above it. Go around it. Pull its tail up  take a look in there. I want you to get as close to that camel as you possibly can.  So  I got a National Geographic film crew. We went down there  and I took one look at this camel. It is a       pound creature who is in rut. Now  if you've ever seen a       pound camel in rut  it is a scary  scary thing to behold. And if Richard thought I was getting in the ring with that camel  someone was smoking Bedouin high grade. So we got as close to it as possible  and I'm going to share this. Chris  if you want to roll this film. Then I'm going to show you a little bit more about the design of camels. Do you want to roll the film  with the TED National Geographic Camel Investigation Unit. I'm here to look at the ultimate desert machine. Keith Bellows  And you'll note I started chewing gum because I was around this camel all day. See  now he's getting a little overexcited. So we'll need to be very careful around him. Don't let him get you. Now  you can see copious amounts of saliva in there. I always called myself the unstable stable boy. Their nose  you can see his nose is flared right now. When they're in rut  they're similar to seals in the way  like  a seal has to open its nose to breathe. And they're similar. They have to consciously open their nose. KB  Ears  SK  They are small. But they have excellent hearing. But not big  for instance  in zebras  they have a huge ear that's very mobile  so they can actually turn them both around. And they use them in the same way we use our binocular vision. They use that to pinpoint sound. The desert's extremely windy as well as being very cold. So not only do they have the very long eyelashes  but there's the secondary    I guess you'd call it the  unclear  or whatever. It's this hair that's above the eyes  and below it  it's longer. Most people think that the humps store water. They don't. They store fat. Now  I'm not a chemist  but basically what happens is the fat is oxidized by their breathing. And that will turn it into actually usable water. Like a lot of predators  they walk on their toes. But there's a big fat pad in there that squishes out. They're like sun shoes  but  you know  with sand. Hooves  They don't have traditional hooves  but they do have one  like  big nail. You can't really see too clear. The fur's kind of grown over. But they use their tails a lot  especially in rut. He will urinate and spin his tail to spread the urine around and make him more attractive. I don't know why that would be  but it works for them. So  what the hell. Now  they will also defecate in certain areas. Generally  they poop wherever they want to  but during their rut  they will defecate in perimeter areas. I don't know if you've read or heard about the sub sonic sounds from elephants  you know what I mean  like   Br r r   These big  big rumbling sounds. He will do the same thing. You can actually see  right here  it will vibrate. We weigh our animals. Unfortunately  he's a very aggressive animal  so he's actually destroyed some of the scales. We had these big things that I weigh the bison on  for instance. I'm guessing that he's at least       pounds. But I would put him closer to      . He's basically a walking mulch pile. We're kind of like buds  but I'm also a male as well. KB  He sees you as competition  Senior Keeper  Yeah  exactly. And it makes him very dangerous at this time of year. Don't even think about it. Don't think about it  But now  we're going to meet. Out  Out  Out  No. Out  KB  What I didn't show you was  you got that swinging thing going  Well  and you're glad I didn't show you this. One of the other things about the camel's beautiful design is that its penis points backwards. That way the camel can dip its tail in the stream  and just whacker the entire area around him. And that's how he really marks his territory. Now  what you also didn't see was that    and you may have noticed in the pen beside him and  by the way  the camel's name is Suki. In the pen beside him is Jasmine. Jasmine has been his mate for some time. But on this particular occasion  it was very  very clear that as horny as Suki was  Jasmine was having none of it. And so we started thinking. Well  if poor old Suki is in search of a mate  what would Suki do to find the perfect mate  I'm going to show you another film. But before I do  I just want to mention that this animal truly is a sort of the SUV of the sand  the ship of the desert. It's so vital to the inhabitants of the areas in which the camel is found  largely Mongolia and Sahara  that there are     words in Arabic to describe the camel. And if this is a creature that was designed by committee  it's certainly been like no committee I've ever been on. So here's what Suki would do in search of a mate. Can you roll it  please  Camel seeking camel Lusty beast desires attractive and sincere mate. I'm seven feet        lbs.  with brown hair and eyes  long legs    and I'm very well ... hung. I'm TED Camel. The perfect desert machine. I'm smartly designed. Eyelashes that keep out sand and a third eyelash that works like a windshield wiper. A distinguished nose    with nostrils lined to filter out sand and dust and a groove that catches moisture. Amazingly full lips    that allow me to eat practically anything that grows. Callouses on my knees that let me kneel comfortably. Leathery chest pads that beat the heat. Short fur that keeps my skin cool. Long legs that allow heat to escape. And my hump  Ogden Nash once wrote   The camel has a single hump  the dromedary two  or else the other way around. I'm never sure. Are you   Here's a hint  Bactarian. Dromedary. My hump contains up to    lbs. of fat  but doesn't store H O. I'm built to last. I'm the go to animal when the oasis is dry. I usually won't sweat until my body reaches      F  enough to fry an egg. I'm able to lose     of my weight without dying. I'll drink   to   gallons of water a day. But go without for more than a month. I'm powerful. Able to pack up to     lbs. of cargo. Outrun a horse    And cover    miles on a good day. Camelot. Jackie O. once said that traveling by camel made riding an elephant seem like taking a jet plane. Yet my large  soft feet allow me to navigate sand. I'm a good provider  too. Bedouins call the camel the Gift of God. No surprise. Tents and rugs are made of my hair. My dried bones are prized as a sort of ivory. My dung is burned as fuel. My milk is used for cheese.  Camels are like angels   a Bedouin once said. Thank you. I just want to leave you with one last thought  which is probably the most important thing to take away. Humans  the animal  are pretty lucky creatures because  by and large  we really don't have to adapt to our environment  we adapt our environment to us. And we've seen that repeatedly through this conference  not just this year  but in past years. But this creature that you've just seen ultimately adapts  and keeps adapting and adapting. I think when you look at the animal kingdom  that is one of the most remarkable things. It doesn't have an environment that adapts to it  it has to adapt to the environment. Ricky  thank you very much for having me. RW  That's terrific. Thank you. My thing with school lunch is  it's a social justice issue. I'm the Director of Nutrition Services for the Berkeley Unified School District. I have    employees and    locations        kids. I'm doing       meals a day and I've been doing it for two years  trying to change how we feed kids in America. And that's what I want to talk to you a little bit about today. These are some of my kids with a salad bar. I put salad bars in all of our schools when I got there. Everyone says it couldn't be done. Little kids couldn't eat off the salad bar  big kids would spit in it    neither happened. When I took over this  I tried to really figure out  like  what my vision would be. How do we really change children's relationship to food  And I'll tell you why we need to change it  but we absolutely have to change it. And what I came to understand is  we needed to teach children the symbiotic relationship between a healthy planet  healthy food and healthy kids. And that if we don't do that  the antithesis  although we've heard otherwise  is we're really going to become extinct  because we're feeding our children to death. That's my premise. We're seeing sick kids get sicker and sicker. And the reason this is happening  by and large  is because of our food system and the way the government commodifies food  the way the government oversees our food  the way the USDA puts food on kids' plates that's unhealthy  and allows unhealthy food into schools. And by    tacitly  all of us send our kids  or grandchildren  or nieces  or nephews  to school and tell them to learn  you know  learn what's in those schools. And when you feed these kids bad food  that's what they're learning. So that's really what this is all about. The way we got here is because of big agribusiness. We now live in a country where most of us don't decide  by and large  what we eat. We see big businesses  Monsanto and DuPont  who brought out Agent Orange and stain resistant carpet. They control    percent of the commercially produced seeds in our country. These are       companies control much of what's in our grocery stores  much of what people eat. And that's really  really a problem. So when I started thinking about these issues and how I was going to change what kids ate  I really started focusing on what we would teach them. And the very first thing was about regional food    trying to eat food from within our region. And clearly  with what's going on with fossil fuel usage  or when    as the fossil fuel is going away  as oil hits its peak oil  you know  we really have to start thinking about whether or not we should  or could  be moving food       miles before we eat it. So we talked to kids about that  and we really start to feed kids regional food. And then we talk about organic food. Now  most school districts can't really afford organic food  but we  as a nation  have to start thinking about consuming  growing and feeding our children food that's not chock full of chemicals. We can't keep feeding our kids pesticides and herbicides and antibiotics and hormones. We can't keep doing that. You know  it doesn't work. And the results of that are kids getting sick. One of my big soapboxes right now is antibiotics. Seventy percent of all antibiotics consumed in America is consumed in animal husbandry. We are feeding our kids antibiotics in beef and other animal protein every day. Seventy percent    it's unbelievable. And the result of it is  we have diseases. We have things like E. coli that we can't fix  that we can't make kids better when they get sick. And  you know  certainly antibiotics have been over prescribed  but it's an issue in the food supply. One of my favorite facts is that U.S. agriculture uses  .  billion pounds of pesticides every year. That means every one of us  and our children  consumes what would equal a five pound bag    those bags you have at home. If I had one here and ripped it open  and that pile I would have on the floor is what we consume and feed our children every year because of what goes into our food supply  because of the way we consume produce in America. The USDA allows these antibiotics  these hormones and these pesticides in our food supply  and the USDA paid for this ad in Time magazine. Okay  we could talk about Rachel Carson and DDT  but we know it wasn't good for you and me. And that is what the USDA allows in our food supply. And that has to change  you know. The USDA cannot be seen as the be all and end all of what we feed our kids and what's allowed. We cannot believe that they have our best interests at heart. The antithesis of this whole thing is sustainable food. That's what I really try and get people to understand. I really try and teach it to kids. I think it's the most important. It's consuming food in a way in which we'll still have a planet  in which kids will grow up to be healthy  and which really tries to mitigate all the negative impacts we're seeing. It really is just a new idea. I mean  people toss around sustainability  but we have to figure out what sustainability is. In less than     years  you know  just in a few generations  we've gone from being        being     percent     percent farmers to less than   percent of farmers. We now live in a country that has more prisoners than farmers     .  million prisoners   .  million farmers. And we spend        dollars on average a year keeping a prisoner in prison  and school districts spend     dollars a year feeding a child. It's no wonder  you know  we have criminals. And what's happening is  we're getting sick. We're getting sick and our kids are getting sick. It is about what we feed them. What goes in is what we are. We really are what we eat. And if we continue down this path  if we continue to feed kids bad food  if we continue not to teach them what good food is  what's going to happen  You know  what is going to happen  What's going to happen to our whole medical system  What's going to happen is  we're going to have kids that have a life less long than our own. The CDC  the Center for Disease Control  has said  of the children born in the year         those seven  and eight year olds today    one out of every three Caucasians  one out of every two African Americans and Hispanics are going to have diabetes in their lifetime. And if that's not enough  they've gone on to say  most before they graduate high school. This means that    or    percent of all school aged children could be insulin dependent within a decade. Within a decade. What's going to happen  Well  the CDC has gone further to say that those children born in the year      could be the first generation in our country's history to die at a younger age than their parents. And it's because of what we feed them. Because eight year olds don't get to decide    and if they do  you should be in therapy. You know  we are responsible for what kids eat. But oops  maybe they're responsible for what kids eat. Big companies spend    billion dollars a year marketing non nutrient foods to kids.    billion dollars a year.        ads most kids see. They spend     dollars for every one dollar        dollars marketing foods that kids shouldn't eat for every one dollar marketing healthy  nutritious food. The result of which is kids think they're going to die if they don't have chicken nuggets. You know that everybody thinks they should be eating more  and more  and more. This is the USDA portion size  that little  tiny thing. And the one over there  that's bigger than my head  is what McDonald's and Burger King and those big companies think we should eat. And why can they serve that much  Why can we have    cent Big Gulps and    cent double burgers  It's because of the way the government commodifies food  and the cheap corn and cheap soy that are pushed into our food supply that makes these non nutrient foods really  really cheap. Which is why I say it's a social justice issue. Now  I said I'm doing this in Berkeley  and you might think   Oh  Berkeley. Of course you can do it in Berkeley.  Well  this is the food I found    months ago. This is not even food. This is the stuff we were feeding our kids  Extremo Burritos  corn dogs  pizza pockets  grilled cheese sandwiches. Everything came in plastic  in cardboard. The only kitchen tools my staff had was a box cutter. The only working piece of equipment in my kitchen was a can crusher  because if it didn't come in a can  it came frozen in a box. The USDA allows this. The USDA allows all of this stuff. In case you can't tell  that's  like  pink Danish and some kind of cupcakes. Chicken nuggets  Tater Tots  chocolate milk with high fructose  canned fruit cocktail    a reimbursable meal. That's what the government says is okay to feed our kids. It ain't okay. You know what  It is not okay. And we  all of us  have to understand that this is about us  that we can make a difference here. Now I don't know if any of you out there invented chicken nuggets  but I'm sure you're rich if you did. But whoever decided that a chicken should look like a heart  a giraffe  a star  Well  Tyson did  because there's no chicken in the chicken. And that they could figure it out  that we could sell this stuff to kids. You know  what's wrong with teaching kids that chicken looks like chicken  But this is what most schools serve. In fact  this may be what a lot of parents serve  as opposed to    this is what we try and serve. We really need to change this whole paradigm with kids and food. We really have to teach children that chicken is not a giraffe. You know  that vegetables are actually colorful  that they have flavor  that carrots grow in the ground  that strawberries grow in the ground. There's not a strawberry tree or a carrot bush. You know  we have to change the way we teach kids about these things. There's a lot of stuff we can do. There's a lot of schools doing farm to school programs. There's a lot of schools actually getting fresh food into schools. Now  in Berkeley  we've gone totally fresh. We have no high fructose corn syrup  no trans fats  no processed foods. We're cooking from scratch every day. We have    percent of our    thank you       percent of our stuff is organic and local. We cook. Those are my hands. I get up at   a.m. every day and go cook the food for the kids  because this is what we need to do. We can't keep serving kids processed crap  full of chemicals  and expect these are going to be healthy citizens. You're not going to get the next generation  or the generation after  to be able to think like this if they're not nourished. If they're eating chemicals all the time  they're not going to be able to think. They're not going to be smart. You know what  They're just going to be sick. Now one of the things that    what happened when I went into Berkeley is I realized that  you know  this was all pretty amazing to people  very  very different  and I needed to market it. I came up with these calendars that I sent home to every parent. And these calendars really started to lay out my program. Now I'm in charge of all the cooking classes and all the gardening classes in our school district. So this is a typical menu. This is what we're serving this week at the schools. And you see these recipes on the side  Those are the recipes that the kids learn in my cooking classes. They do tastings of these ingredients in the gardening classes. They also may be growing them. And we serve them in the cafeterias. If we're going to change children's relationship to food  it's delicious  nutritious food in the cafeterias  hands on experience    you're looking in cooking and gardening classes    and academic curriculum to tie it all together. Now you've probably garnered that I don't love the USDA  and I don't have any idea what to do with their pyramid  this upside down pyramid with a rainbow over the top  I don't know. You know  run up into the end of the rainbow  I don't know what you do with it. So  I came up with my own. This is available on my website in English and Spanish  and it's a visual way to talk to kids about food. The really tiny hamburger  the really big vegetables. We have to start changing this. We have to make kids understand that their food choices make a big difference. We have cooking classes    we have cooking classrooms in our schools. And why this is so important is that we now have grown a generation  maybe two  of kids where one out of every four meals is eaten in fast food  one of every four meals is eaten in a car and one out of every last four meals is eaten in front of a TV or computer. What are kids learning  Where is the family time  Where is socialization  Where is discussion  Where is learning to talk  You know  we have to change it. I work with kids a lot. These are kids I work with in Harlem. EATWISE    Enlightened and Aware Teens Who Inspire Smart Eating. We have to teach kids that Coke and Pop Tarts aren't breakfast. We have to teach kids that if they're on a diet of refined sugar  they go up and down  just like if they're on a diet of crack. And we have to pull it all together. We have composting in all of our schools. We have recycling in all of our schools. You know  the things that we maybe do at home and think are so important  we have to teach kids about in school. It has to be so much a part of them that they really get it. Because  you know what  many of us are sort of at the end of our careers  and we need to be giving these kids    these young kids  the next generation    the tools to save themselves and save the planet. One of the things I do a lot is public private partnerships. I work with private companies who are willing to do R   D with me  who are willing to do distribution for me  who are really willing to work to go into schools. Schools are underfunded. Most schools in America spend less than       dollars a year teaching a child. That comes down to under five dollars an hour. Most of you spend        dollars an hour for babysitters when you have them. So we're spending less than   dollars an hour on the educational system. And if we're going to change it  and change how we feed kids  we really have to rethink that. So  public and private partnerships  advocacy groups  working with foundations. In our school district  the way we afford this is our school district allocates .   percent of the general fund towards nutrition services. And I think if every school district allocated a half to one percent  we could start to really fix this program. We really need to change it. It's going to take more money. Of course  it's not all about food  it's also about kids getting exercise. And one of the simple things we can do is put recess before lunch. It's sort of this  duh  thing. You know  if you have kids coming into lunch and all they're going to do when they get out of lunch is go to have recess  you see them just throw away their lunch so they can run outside. And then  at one in the afternoon  they're totally crashing. These are your children and grandchildren that are totally melting down when you pick them up  because they haven't had lunch. So if the only thing they'd have to do after lunch is go to class  believe me  they're going to sit there and eat their lunch. We need to    we need to educate. We need to educate the kids. We need to educate the staff. I had    employees. Two were supposed to be cooks    none could. And  you know  I'm not that better off now. But we really have to educate. We have to get academic institutions to start thinking about ways to teach people how to cook again  because  of course  they don't    because we've had this processed food in schools and institutions for so long. We need    minute lunches    most schools have    minute lunches    and lunches that are time appropriate. There was just a big study done  and so many schools are starting lunch at nine and    in the morning. That is not lunchtime. You know  it's crazy. It's crazy what we're doing. And just remember  at very least tacitly  this is what we're teaching children as what they should be doing. I think if we're going to fix this  one of the things we have to do is really change how we have oversight over the National School Lunch Program. Instead of the National School Lunch Program being under the USDA  I think it should be under CDC. If we started to think about food and how we feed our kids as a health initiative  and we started thinking about food as health  then I think we wouldn't have corn dogs as lunch. Okay  Finance     on this  and this    I'm sort of wrapping it up with this finance piece  because I think this is something we all have to understand. The National School Lunch Program spends   billion dollars feeding    million children a year. That number probably needs to double. People say   Oh my God  where are we going to get   billion   In this country  we're spending     billion dollars a year on fast food. We spend     billion dollars a year on diet aids. We spend    billion dollars on vegetables  which is why we need all the diet aids. We spend     billion dollars a year on diet related illness today  with nine percent of our kids having type   diabetes.     billion. So you know what  when we talk about needing   billion more  it's not a lot. That   billion comes down to two dollars and    cents    that's what the government allocates for lunch. Most school districts spend two thirds of that on payroll and overhead. That means we spend less than a dollar a day on food for kids in schools    most schools     to    cents. In L.A.  it's    cents. So we're spending less than a dollar  OK  on lunch. Now I don't know about you  but I go to Starbucks and Pete's and places like that  and venti latte in San Francisco is five dollars. One gourmet coffee  one  is more    we spend more on than we are spending to feed kids for an entire week in our schools. You know what  We should be ashamed. We  as a country  should be ashamed at that. The richest country. In our country  it's the kids that need it the most  who get this really  really lousy food. It's the kids who have parents and grandparents and uncles and aunts that can't even afford to pay for school lunch that gets this food. And those are the same kids who are going to be getting sick. Those are the same kids who we should be taking care of. We can all make a difference. That every single one of us  whether we have children  whether we care about children  whether we have nieces or nephews  or anything    that we can make a difference. Whether you sit down and eat a meal with your kids  whether you take your kids  or grandchildren  or nieces and nephews shopping to a farmers' market. Just do tastings with them. Sit down and care. And on the macro level  we're in what seems to be a    month presidential campaign  and of all the things we're asking all of these potential leaders  what about asking for the health of our children  Thank you. Suppose that two American friends are traveling together in Italy. They go to see Michelangelo's  David   and when they finally come face to face with the statue  they both freeze dead in their tracks. The first guy    we'll call him Adam    is transfixed by the beauty of the perfect human form. The second guy    we'll call him Bill    is transfixed by embarrassment  at staring at the thing there in the center. So here's my question for you  which one of these two guys was more likely to have voted for George Bush  which for Al Gore  I don't need a show of hands because we all have the same political stereotypes. We all know that it's Bill. And in this case  the stereotype corresponds to reality. It really is a fact that liberals are much higher than conservatives on a major personality trait called openness to experience. People who are high in openness to experience just crave novelty  variety  diversity  new ideas  travel. People low on it like things that are familiar  that are safe and dependable. If you know about this trait  you can understand a lot of puzzles about human behavior. You can understand why artists are so different from accountants. You can actually predict what kinds of books they like to read  what kinds of places they like to travel to  and what kinds of food they like to eat. Once you understand this trait  you can understand why anybody would eat at Applebee's  but not anybody that you know. This trait also tells us a lot about politics. The main researcher of this trait  Robert McCrae says that   Open individuals have an affinity for liberal  progressive  left wing political views     they like a society which is open and changing     whereas closed individuals prefer conservative  traditional  right wing views.  This trait also tells us a lot about the kinds of groups people join. So here's the description of a group I found on the Web. What kinds of people would join a global community welcoming people from every discipline and culture  who seek a deeper understanding of the world  and who hope to turn that understanding into a better future for us all  This is from some guy named Ted. Well  let's see now  if openness predicts who becomes liberal  and openness predicts who becomes a TEDster  then might we predict that most TEDsters are liberal  Let's find out. I'm going to ask you to raise your hand  whether you are liberal  left of center    on social issues  we're talking about  primarily    or conservative  and I'll give a third option  because I know there are a number of libertarians in the audience. So  right now  please raise your hand    down in the simulcast rooms  too  let's let everybody see who's here    please raise your hand if you would say that you are liberal or left of center. Please raise your hand high right now. OK. Please raise your hand if you'd say you're libertarian. OK  about a    two dozen. And please raise your hand if you'd say you are right of center or conservative. One  two  three  four  five    about eight or   . OK. This is a bit of a problem. Because if our goal is to understand the world  to seek a deeper understanding of the world  our general lack of moral diversity here is going to make it harder. Because when people all share values  when people all share morals  they become a team  and once you engage the psychology of teams  it shuts down open minded thinking. When the liberal team loses  as it did in       and as it almost did in       we comfort ourselves. We try to explain why half of America voted for the other team. We think they must be blinded by religion  or by simple stupidity. So  if you think that half of America votes Republican because they are blinded in this way  then my message to you is that you're trapped in a moral matrix  in a particular moral matrix. And by the matrix  I mean literally the matrix  like the movie  The Matrix.  But I'm here today to give you a choice. You can either take the blue pill and stick to your comforting delusions  or you can take the red pill  learn some moral psychology and step outside the moral matrix. Now  because I know    OK  I assume that answers my question. I was going to ask you which one you picked  but no need. You're all high in openness to experience  and besides  it looks like it might even taste good  and you're all epicures. So anyway  let's go with the red pill. Let's study some moral psychology and see where it takes us. Let's start at the beginning. What is morality and where does it come from  The worst idea in all of psychology is the idea that the mind is a blank slate at birth. Developmental psychology has shown that kids come into the world already knowing so much about the physical and social worlds  and programmed to make it really easy for them to learn certain things and hard to learn others. The best definition of innateness I've ever seen    this just clarifies so many things for me    is from the brain scientist Gary Marcus. He says   The initial organization of the brain does not depend that much on experience. Nature provides a first draft  which experience then revises. Built in doesn't mean unmalleable  it means organized in advance of experience.  OK  so what's on the first draft of the moral mind  To find out  my colleague  Craig Joseph  and I read through the literature on anthropology  on culture variation in morality and also on evolutionary psychology  looking for matches. What are the sorts of things that people talk about across disciplines  That you find across cultures and even across species  We found five    five best matches  which we call the five foundations of morality. The first one is harm care. We're all mammals here  we all have a lot of neural and hormonal programming that makes us really bond with others  care for others  feel compassion for others  especially the weak and vulnerable. It gives us very strong feelings about those who cause harm. This moral foundation underlies about    percent of the moral statements I've heard here at TED. The second foundation is fairness reciprocity. There's actually ambiguous evidence as to whether you find reciprocity in other animals  but the evidence for people could not be clearer. This Norman Rockwell painting is called  The Golden Rule   and we heard about this from Karen Armstrong  of course  as the foundation of so many religions. That second foundation underlies the other    percent of the moral statements I've heard here at TED. The third foundation is in group loyalty. You do find groups in the animal kingdom    you do find cooperative groups    but these groups are always either very small or they're all siblings. It's only among humans that you find very large groups of people who are able to cooperate  join together into groups  but in this case  groups that are united to fight other groups. This probably comes from our long history of tribal living  of tribal psychology. And this tribal psychology is so deeply pleasurable that even when we don't have tribes  we go ahead and make them  because it's fun. Sports is to war as pornography is to sex. We get to exercise some ancient  ancient drives. The fourth foundation is authority respect. Here you see submissive gestures from two members of very closely related species. But authority in humans is not so closely based on power and brutality  as it is in other primates. It's based on more voluntary deference  and even elements of love  at times. The fifth foundation is purity sanctity. This painting is called  The Allegory Of Chastity   but purity's not just about suppressing female sexuality. It's about any kind of ideology  any kind of idea that tells you that you can attain virtue by controlling what you do with your body  by controlling what you put into your body. And while the political right may moralize sex much more  the political left is really doing a lot of it with food. Food is becoming extremely moralized nowadays  and a lot of it is ideas about purity  about what you're willing to touch  or put into your body. I believe these are the five best candidates for what's written on the first draft of the moral mind. I think this is what we come with  at least a preparedness to learn all of these things. But as my son  Max  grows up in a liberal college town  how is this first draft going to get revised  And how will it end up being different from a kid born    miles south of us in Lynchburg  Virginia  To think about culture variation  let's try a different metaphor. If there really are five systems at work in the mind    five sources of intuitions and emotions    then we can think of the moral mind as being like one of those audio equalizers that has five channels  where you can set it to a different setting on every channel. And my colleagues  Brian Nosek and Jesse Graham  and I  made a questionnaire  which we put up on the Web at www.YourMorals.org. And so far         people have taken this questionnaire  and you can too. Here are the results. Here are the results from about        American citizens. On the left  I've plotted the scores for liberals  on the right  those for conservatives  in the middle  the moderates. The blue line shows you people's responses on the average of all the harm questions. So  as you see  people care about harm and care issues. They give high endorsement of these sorts of statements all across the board  but as you also see  liberals care about it a little more than conservatives    the line slopes down. Same story for fairness. But look at the other three lines. For liberals  the scores are very low. Liberals are basically saying   No  this is not morality. In group  authority  purity    this stuff has nothing to do with morality. I reject it.  But as people get more conservative  the values rise. We can say that liberals have a kind of a two channel  or two foundation morality. Conservatives have more of a five foundation  or five channel morality. We find this in every country we look at. Here's the data for       Canadians. I'll just flip through a few other slides. The U.K.  Australia  New Zealand  Western Europe  Eastern Europe  Latin America  the Middle East  East Asia and South Asia. Notice also that on all of these graphs  the slope is steeper on in group  authority  purity. Which shows that within any country  the disagreement isn't over harm and fairness. Everybody    I mean  we debate over what's fair    but everybody agrees that harm and fairness matter. Moral arguments within cultures are especially about issues of in group  authority  purity. This effect is so robust that we find it no matter how we ask the question. In one recent study  we asked people to suppose you're about to get a dog. You picked a particular breed  you learned some new information about the breed. Suppose you learn that this particular breed is independent minded  and relates to its owner as a friend and an equal  Well  if you are a liberal  you say   Hey  that's great   Because liberals like to say   Fetch  please.  But if you're conservative  that's not so attractive. If you're conservative  and you learn that a dog's extremely loyal to its home and family  and doesn't warm up quickly to strangers  for conservatives  well  loyalty is good    dogs ought to be loyal. But to a liberal  it sounds like this dog is running for the Republican nomination. So  you might say  OK  there are these differences between liberals and conservatives  but what makes those three other foundations moral  Aren't those just the foundations of xenophobia and authoritarianism and Puritanism  What makes them moral  The answer  I think  is contained in this incredible triptych from Hieronymus Bosch   The Garden of Earthly Delights.  In the first panel  we see the moment of creation. All is ordered  all is beautiful  all the people and animals are doing what they're supposed to be doing  where they're supposed to be. But then  given the way of the world  things change. We get every person doing whatever he wants  with every aperture of every other person and every other animal. Some of you might recognize this as the '  s. But the '  s inevitably gives way to the '  s  where the cuttings of the apertures hurt a little bit more. Of course  Bosch called this hell. So this triptych  these three panels portray the timeless truth that order tends to decay. The truth of social entropy. But lest you think this is just some part of the Christian imagination where Christians have this weird problem with pleasure  here's the same story  the same progression  told in a paper that was published in Nature a few years ago  in which Ernst Fehr and Simon Gachter had people play a commons dilemma. A game in which you give people money  and then  on each round of the game  they can put money into a common pot  and then the experimenter doubles what's in there  and then it's all divided among the players. So it's a really nice analog for all sorts of environmental issues  where we're asking people to make a sacrifice and they themselves don't really benefit from their own sacrifice. But you really want everybody else to sacrifice  but everybody has a temptation to a free ride. And what happens is that  at first  people start off reasonably cooperative    and this is all played anonymously. On the first round  people give about half of the money that they can. But they quickly see   You know what  other people aren't doing so much though. I don't want to be a sucker. I'm not going to cooperate.  And so cooperation quickly decays from reasonably good  down to close to zero. But then    and here's the trick    Fehr and Gachter said  on the seventh round  they told people   You know what  New rule. If you want to give some of your own money to punish people who aren't contributing  you can do that.  And as soon as people heard about the punishment issue going on  cooperation shoots up. It shoots up and it keeps going up. There's a lot of research showing that to solve cooperative problems  it really helps. It's not enough to just appeal to people's good motives. It really helps to have some sort of punishment. Even if it's just shame or embarrassment or gossip  you need some sort of punishment to bring people  when they're in large groups  to cooperate. There's even some recent research suggesting that religion    priming God  making people think about God    often  in some situations  leads to more cooperative  more pro social behavior. Some people think that religion is an adaptation evolved both by cultural and biological evolution to make groups to cohere  in part for the purpose of trusting each other  and then being more effective at competing with other groups. I think that's probably right  although this is a controversial issue. But I'm particularly interested in religion  and the origin of religion  and in what it does to us and for us. Because I think that the greatest wonder in the world is not the Grand Canyon. The Grand Canyon is really simple. It's just a lot of rock  and then a lot of water and wind  and a lot of time  and you get the Grand Canyon. It's not that complicated. This is what's really complicated  that there were people living in places like the Grand Canyon  cooperating with each other  or on the savannahs of Africa  or on the frozen shores of Alaska  and then some of these villages grew into the mighty cities of Babylon  and Rome  and Tenochtitlan. How did this happen  This is an absolute miracle  much harder to explain than the Grand Canyon. The answer  I think  is that they used every tool in the toolbox. It took all of our moral psychology to create these cooperative groups. Yes  you do need to be concerned about harm  you do need a psychology of justice. But it really helps to organize a group if you can have sub groups  and if those sub groups have some internal structure  and if you have some ideology that tells people to suppress their carnality  to pursue higher  nobler ends. And now we get to the crux of the disagreement between liberals and conservatives. Because liberals reject three of these foundations. They say  No  let's celebrate diversity  not common in group membership.  They say   Let's question authority.  And they say   Keep your laws off my body.  Liberals have very noble motives for doing this. Traditional authority  traditional morality can be quite repressive  and restrictive to those at the bottom  to women  to people that don't fit in. So liberals speak for the weak and oppressed. They want change and justice  even at the risk of chaos. This guy's shirt says   Stop bitching  start a revolution.  If you're high in openness to experience  revolution is good  it's change  it's fun. Conservatives  on the other hand  speak for institutions and traditions. They want order  even at some cost to those at the bottom. The great conservative insight is that order is really hard to achieve. It's really precious  and it's really easy to lose. So as Edmund Burke said   The restraints on men  as well as their liberties  are to be reckoned among their rights.  This was after the chaos of the French Revolution. So once you see this    once you see that liberals and conservatives both have something to contribute  that they form a balance on change versus stability    then I think the way is open to step outside the moral matrix. This is the great insight that all the Asian religions have attained. Think about yin and yang. Yin and yang aren't enemies. Yin and yang don't hate each other. Yin and yang are both necessary  like night and day  for the functioning of the world. You find the same thing in Hinduism. There are many high gods in Hinduism. Two of them are Vishnu  the preserver  and Shiva  the destroyer. This image actually is both of those gods sharing the same body. You have the markings of Vishnu on the left  so we could think of Vishnu as the conservative god. You have the markings of Shiva on the right  Shiva's the liberal god. And they work together. You find the same thing in Buddhism. These two stanzas contain  I think  the deepest insights that have ever been attained into moral psychology. From the Zen master Seng ts'an   If you want the truth to stand clear before you  never be for or against. The struggle between for and against is the mind's worst disease.  Now unfortunately  it's a disease that has been caught by many of the world's leaders. But before you feel superior to George Bush  before you throw a stone  ask yourself  do you accept this  Do you accept stepping out of the battle of good and evil  Can you be not for or against anything  So  what's the point  What should you do  Well  if you take the greatest insights from ancient Asian philosophies and religions  and you combine them with the latest research on moral psychology  I think you come to these conclusions  that our righteous minds were designed by evolution to unite us into teams  to divide us against other teams and then to blind us to the truth. So what should you do  Am I telling you to not strive  Am I telling you to embrace Seng ts'an and stop  stop with this struggle of for and against  No  absolutely not. I'm not saying that. This is an amazing group of people who are doing so much  using so much of their talent  their brilliance  their energy  their money  to make the world a better place  to fight    to fight wrongs  to solve problems. But as we learned from Samantha Power  in her story about Sergio Vieira de Mello  you can't just go charging in  saying   You're wrong  and I'm right.  Because  as we just heard  everybody thinks they are right. A lot of the problems we have to solve are problems that require us to change other people. And if you want to change other people  a much better way to do it is to first understand who we are    understand our moral psychology  understand that we all think we're right    and then step out  even if it's just for a moment  step out    check in with Seng ts'an. Step out of the moral matrix  just try to see it as a struggle playing out  in which everybody does think they're right  and everybody  at least  has some reasons    even if you disagree with them    everybody has some reasons for what they're doing. Step out. And if you do that  that's the essential move to cultivate moral humility  to get yourself out of this self righteousness  which is the normal human condition. Think about the Dalai Lama. Think about the enormous moral authority of the Dalai Lama    and it comes from his moral humility. So I think the point    the point of my talk  and I think the point of TED    is that this is a group that is passionately engaged in the pursuit of changing the world for the better. People here are passionately engaged in trying to make the world a better place. But there is also a passionate commitment to the truth. And so I think that the answer is to use that passionate commitment to the truth to try to turn it into a better future for us all. Thank you. I think it'll be a relief to some people and a disappointment to others that I'm not going to talk about vaginas today. I began  The Vagina Monologues  because I was worried about vaginas. I'm very worried today about this notion  this world  this prevailing kind of force of security. I see this word  hear this word  feel this word everywhere. Real security  security checks  security watch  security clearance. Why has all this focus on security made me feel so much more insecure  What does anyone mean when they talk about real security  And why have we  as Americans particularly  become a nation that strives for security above all else  In fact  I think that security is elusive. It's impossible. We all die. We all get old. We all get sick. People leave us. People change us. Nothing is secure. And that's actually the good news. This is  of course  unless your whole life is about being secure. I think that when that is the focus of your life  these are the things that happen. You can't travel very far or venture too far outside a certain circle. You can't allow too many conflicting ideas into your mind at one time  as they might confuse you or challenge you. You can't open yourself to new experiences  new people  new ways of doing things    they might take you off course. You can't not know who you are  so you cling to hard matter identity. You become a Christian  Muslim  Jew. You're an Indian  Egyptian  Italian  American. You're a heterosexual or a homosexual  or you never have sex. Or at least  that's what you say when you identify yourself. You become part of an  us.  In order to be secure  you defend against  them.  You cling to your land because it is your secure place. You must fight anyone who encroaches upon it. You become your nation. You become your religion. You become whatever it is that will freeze you  numb you and protect you from doubt or change. But all this does  actually  is shut down your mind. In reality  it does not really make you safer. I was in Sri Lanka  for example  three days after the tsunami  and I was standing on the beaches and it was absolutely clear that  in a matter of five minutes  a    foot wave could rise up and desecrate a people  a population and lives. All this striving for security  in fact  has made you much more insecure because now you have to watch out all the time. There are people not like you    people who you now call enemies. You have places you cannot go  thoughts you cannot think  worlds that you can no longer inhabit. And so you spend your days fighting things off  defending your territory and becoming more entrenched in your fundamental thinking. Your days become devoted to protecting yourself. This becomes your mission. That is all you do. Ideas get shorter. They become sound bytes. There are evildoers and saints  criminals and victims. There are those who  if they're not with us  are against us. It gets easier to hurt people because you do not feel what's inside them. It gets easier to lock them up  force them to be naked  humiliate them  occupy them  invade them and kill them  because they are only obstacles now to your security. In six years  I've had the extraordinary privilege through V Day  a global movement against  violence against  women  to travel probably to    countries  and spend a great deal of time in different portions. I've met women and men all over this planet  who through various circumstances    war  poverty  racism  multiple forms of violence    have never known security  or have had their illusion of security forever devastated. I've spent time with women in Afghanistan under the Taliban  who were essentially brutalized and censored. I've been in Bosnian refugee camps. I was with women in Pakistan who have had their faces melted off with acid. I've been with girls all across America who were date raped  or raped by their best friends when they were drugged one night. One of the amazing things that I've discovered in my travels is that there is this emerging species. I loved when he was talking about this other world that's right next to this world. I've discovered these people  who  in V Day world  we call Vagina Warriors. These particular people  rather than getting AK   s  or weapons of mass destruction  or machetes  in the spirit of the warrior  have gone into the center  the heart of pain  of loss. They have grieved it  they have died into it  and allowed and encouraged poison to turn into medicine. They have used the fuel of their pain to begin to redirect that energy towards another mission and another trajectory. These warriors now devote themselves and their lives to making sure what happened to them doesn't happen to anyone else. There are thousands if not millions of them on the planet. I venture there are many in this room. They have a fierceness and a freedom that I believe is the bedrock of a new paradigm. They have broken out of the existing frame of victim and perpetrator. Their own personal security is not their end goal  and because of that  because  rather than worrying about security  because the transformation of suffering is their end goal  I actually believe they are creating real safety and a whole new idea of security. I want to talk about a few of these people that I've met. Tomorrow  I am going to Cairo  and I'm so moved that I will be with women in Cairo who are V Day women  who are opening the first safe house for battered women in the Middle East. That will happen because women in Cairo made a decision to stand up and put themselves on the line  and talk about the degree of violence that is happening in Egypt  and were willing to be attacked and criticized. And through their work over the last years  this is not only happening that this house is opening  but it's being supported by many factions of the society who never would have supported it. Women in Uganda this year  who put on  The Vagina Monologues  during V Day  actually evoked the wrath of the government. And  I love this story so much. There was a cabinet meeting and a meeting of the presidents to talk about whether  Vaginas  could come to Uganda. And in this meeting    it went on for weeks in the press  two weeks where there was huge discussion. The government finally made a decision that  The Vagina Monologues  could not be performed in Uganda. But the amazing news was that because they had stood up  these women  and because they had been willing to risk their security  it began a discussion that not only happened in Uganda  but all of Africa. As a result  this production  which had already sold out  every single person in that     seat audience  except for    people  made a decision to keep the money. They raised        dollars on a production that never occurred. There's a young woman named Carrie Rethlefsen in Minnesota. She's a high school student. She had seen  The Vagina Monologues  and she was really moved. And as a result  she wore an  I heart my vagina  button to her high school in Minnesota. She was basically threatened to be expelled from school. They told her she couldn't love her vagina in high school  that it was not a legal thing  that it was not a moral thing  that it was not a good thing. So she really struggled with this  what to do  because she was a senior and she was doing well in her school and she was threatened expulsion. So what she did is she got all her friends together    I believe it was          students all wore  I love my vagina  T shirts  and the boys wore  I love her vagina  T shirts to school. Now this seems like a fairly  you know  frivolous  but what happened as a result of that  is that that school now is forming a sex education class. It's beginning to talk about sex  it's beginning to look at why it would be wrong for a young high school girl to talk about her vagina publicly or to say that she loved her vagina publicly. I know I've talked about Agnes here before  but I want to give you an update on Agnes. I met Agnes three years ago in the Rift Valley. When she was a young girl  she had been mutilated against her will. That mutilation of her clitoris had actually obviously impacted her life and changed it in a way that was devastating. She made a decision not to go and get a razor or a glass shard  but to devote her life to stopping that happening to other girls. For eight years  she walked through the Rift Valley. She had this amazing box that she carried and it had a torso of a woman's body in it  a half a torso  and she would teach people  everywhere she went  what a healthy vagina looked like and what a mutilated vagina looked like. In the years that she walked  she educated parents  mothers  fathers. She saved       girls from being cut. When V Day met her  we asked her how we could support her and she said   Well  if you got me a Jeep  I could get around a lot faster.  So  we bought her a Jeep. In the year she had the Jeep  she saved       girls from being cut. So  we said  what else could we do  She said   If you help me get money  I could open a house.  Three years ago  Agnes opened a safe house in Africa to stop mutilation. When she began her mission eight years ago  she was reviled  she was detested  she was completely slandered in her community. I am proud to tell you that six months ago  she was elected the deputy mayor of Narok. I think what I'm trying to say here is that if your end goal is security  and if that's all you're focusing on  what ends up happening is that you create not only more insecurity in other people  but you make yourself far more insecure. Real security is contemplating death  not pretending it doesn't exist. Not running from loss  but entering grief  surrendering to sorrow. Real security is not knowing something  when you don't know it. Real security is hungering for connection rather than power. It cannot be bought or arranged or made with bombs. It is deeper  it is a process  it is acute awareness that we are all utterly inter bended  and one action by one being in one tiny town has consequences everywhere. Real security is not only being able to tolerate mystery  complexity  ambiguity  but hungering for them and only trusting a situation when they are present. Something happened when I began traveling in V Day  eight years ago. I got lost. I remember being on a plane going from Kenya to South Africa  and I had no idea where I was. I didn't know where I was going  where I'd come from  and I panicked. I had a total anxiety attack. And then I suddenly realized that it absolutely didn't matter where I was going  or where I had come from because we are all essentially permanently displaced people. All of us are refugees. We come from somewhere and we are hopefully traveling all the time  moving towards a new place. Freedom means I may not be identified as any one group  but that I can visit and find myself in every group. It does not mean that I don't have values or beliefs  but it does mean I am not hardened around them. I do not use them as weapons. In the shared future  it will be just that  shared. The end goal will  be  becoming vulnerable  realizing the place of our connection to one another  rather than becoming secure  in control and alone. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  And how are you doing  Are you exhausted  On a typical day  do you wake up with hope or gloom  Eve Ensler  You know  I think Carl Jung once said that in order to survive the twentieth century  we have to live with two existing thoughts  opposite thoughts  at the same time. And I think part of what I'm learning in this process is that one must allow oneself to feel grief. And I think as long as I keep grieving  and weeping  and then moving on  I'm fine. When I start to pretend that what I'm seeing isn't impacting me  and isn't changing my heart  then I get in trouble. Because when you spend a lot of time going from place to place  country to country  and city to city  the degree to which women  for example  are violated  and the epidemic of it  and the kind of ordinariness of it  is so devastating to one's soul that you have to take the time  or I have to take the time now  to process that. CA  There are a lot of causes out there in the world that have been talked about  you know  poverty  sickness and so on. You spent eight years on this one. Why this one  EE  I think that if you think about women  women are the primary resource of the planet. They give birth  we come from them  they are mothers  they are visionaries  they are the future. If you think that the U.N. now says that one out of three women on the planet will be raped or beaten in their lifetime  we're talking about the desecration of the primary resource of the planet  we're talking about the place where we come from  we're talking about parenting. Imagine that you've been raped and you're bringing up a boy child. How does it impact your ability to work  or envision a future  or thrive  as opposed to just survive  What I believe is if we could figure out how to make women safe and honor women  it would be parallel or equal to honoring life itself. Good morning. My name is David Rose. I am a serial entrepreneur turned serial investor. And by the use of pitching PowerPoints to VCs  I have personally raised tens of millions of dollars from VCs through PowerPoint pitches. And then  turning round to the other side of the equation  I have personally supervised the investment of tens of millions of dollars into companies who have been pitching me with PowerPoint presentations. So I think it's safe to say I know a little bit about the process of pitching. So  the very first question that you've all got to figure out is  what is the single most important thing that a VC is looking for when you come to them pitching your new business idea  And there are obviously all kinds of things. There are business models  and there are financials  and there are markets and there is that. Overall  of all the things that you have to do  what is the single most important thing the VC is going to be investing in  Somebody  What  David S. Rose  People  You  That's it    you are the person. And so therefore  the entire purpose of a VC pitch is to convince them that you are the entrepreneur in whom they are going to invest their money and make a lot of money in return. Now  how do you do this  You can't just walk up and say  you know   Hi  I'm a really good guy  and a good girl  and you should really invest in me.  Right  So  in the course of your VC pitch  you have a very few minutes  and most VC pitches    most angel pitches are about    minutes  most VC pitches should be less than half an hour. People's attention span after    minutes begins to drop off  tests have shown. So in that    minutes  or    minutes  or five minutes  you have to convey a whole bunch of different characteristics. You actually have to convey about    different characteristics while you're standing up there. What's the single most important thing you've got to convey  What  DSR  Boy  oh boy  oh boy  And that's a straight line we got right over there. And I didn't even prompt him. You're right  integrity. Because that's the key thing. I would much rather invest in somebody    you know  take a chance on somebody    who I know is straight than somebody where there's any possible question of  you know  who are they looking out for  and what's going on. So the most important thing is integrity. And what's the second most important thing after integrity  Let's see if you can get this one. DSR  Close enough  Passion. Right  so here you want    entrepreneurs by definition are people who are leaving something else  starting a new world over here  creating and putting their lifeblood into this kind of thing. You've got to convey passion. If you're not passionate about your own company  why on Earth should anyone else be passionate  Why should they put more money into your company  if you're not passionate about it  So  integrity and passion  the single most important things out there. Then there are a whole panoply of other things that you've got to do  to wrap up in this package that you're presenting to a VC. Experience. You've got to be able to say   Hey  you know  I've done this before.  And  done this before  is starting an enterprise and creating value  and taking something from beginning to end. So that's why VCs love to fund serial entrepreneurs. Because even if you didn't do it right the first time  you've learned the lessons  which are going to stand you in very good stead the next time. And now along with that  along with the experience of starting an enterprise  or running something    and it doesn't have to be a business. It can be in an organization at school  it can be a not for profit. But they want experience in creating an organization. Next up is knowledge. If you're telling me you're going to be the great developer of the map of the human genome  you'd better know what a human genome is. I mean  I want you to have domain expertise. So I don't want somebody who's saying   Hey  I've got a great idea in a business I know nothing about. I don't know who the players are. I don't know what the market is like.  So you've got to know your market. You've got to know your area. And then you have to have the skills that it takes to get a company going. And those skills include everything from technical skills  if it's a technology business  to marketing  and sales  and management  and so on. But  you know  not everybody has all these skills. There are very few people who have the full set of skills that it takes to run a company. So what else do you require  Well  leadership. You've got to be able to convince us that you either have developed a team that has all those factors in it  or else you can. And you have the charisma and the management style and the ability to get people to follow your lead  to inspire them  to motivate them to be part of your team. All right  then  having done all that  what else do I want to know as a VC  I want to know that you have commitment. That you are going to be here to the end. I want you to say  or I want you to convey  that you are going to die if you have to  with your very last breath  with your fingernails scratching as they drag you out. You're going to keep my money alive and you're going to make more money out of it. So I don't want somebody who's going to cut and run at the first opportunity. Because bad things happen. There's never been an angel  or a venture funded company where bad things didn't happen. So I want to know that you're committed to be there to the very end. You've got to have vision. You've got to be able to see where this is going. I don't want another  me too  product. I want somebody who knows  who can change the world out there. But on top of that  I also need realism. Because I need to know that you know that while changing the world is great  it doesn't always happen. And before you get to change the world  bad things are going to take place. And you've got to be able to deal with that. And you have to have rational projections and stuff. And then finally  you're asking for my money  not just because it's my money  but because it's me. You need to be coachable. So I need to know that you have the ability to listen. We've had a lot of experience. People who are VCs or angels investing in you have had experience and they'd like to know that you want to hear that experience. Okay  so how do you convey all these    things in    minutes without saying any more  You can't say   Hey  I've got high integrity  invest in me   Right  You've got to do a whole pitch that conveys this without conveying it. So think about your pitch as a timeline. It starts off  you walk in the door. They know nothing at all  whatsoever  about you. And you can take them on an emotional    all pitches  or all sales presentations  are emotional at some level. You can go up  you can go down  right  And it goes from beginning to end. You walk in the door. So the first thing you've got to do    the overall  you know  arc of your presentation    it's got to start like a rocket. You've got maybe    seconds    between    and    seconds  depending on how long the pitch is    to get their attention. In my case   I've invested. I have got tens of millions of dollars from PowerPoint pitches. I have invested tens of millions of dollars.  That's it    that should get you right there. This can be a factor  and everybody can be saying it's counterintuitive. It can be a story  it can be experience. But you've got to grab their emotional attention  focused on you  within that first few seconds. And then from there  you've got to take them on a very solid  steady  upward path  right from beginning to end. And everything has got to be reinforcing this. And you've got to get better  and better  and better  and better. And it's revving up to the very end  and then at the very end you've got to    boom     knock them out of the park. You want to be able to get them to such an emotional high that they are ready to write you a check  throw money at you  right there before you leave. Okay  so how do you do that  Well  first of all  logical progression. Any time you go backwards  any time you skip a step    imagine walking up a staircase where some of the treads are missing  or the heights are different heights. You stop  you've got to figure it out. You want a nice logical progression. Start with telling them what the market is. Why are you going to do X  Y or Z. And then you've got to tell me how you're going to do it  and what it is you're going to do. How you're going to do it. And the whole    it's got to flow from beginning to end. You've also got to let me know that there are touchstones. You want to tie in to the rest of the world out there. So  for example  if you reference companies I've heard of  or basic items in your business  I want to know about them. Things that I can relate to  validators  or anything that tells me somebody else has approved this  or there's outside validation. It can be sales  it can be you've got an award for something  it can be  people have done it before  it can be your beta tests are going great. Whatever. I want to know validation  that you're telling me not just what you're telling me  but that somebody else    or something else out there    says this makes sense. And then  because I'm looking for the upside here  I've got to have believable upside. And that's two parts. It's got to be upside  and it's got to be believable. The upside means that if you're telling me that you're going to be out there  five years out  making a million dollars a year    hmm. That's not really upside. Telling me you're going to be out there making a billion dollars a year    that's not believable. So it's got to be both sides. On the other hand  there are a lot of things that drive me down  take the emotional level down  and you've got to recover from those. And those  for example  are anything you tell me that I know is not true.  We have no competition. There's nobody else who's ever made a widget like this.  Odds are I probably know somebody who has made a widget. And the minute you tell me that    boom  You know  I discount half of what you're saying from then on. Anything that makes me think. Anything that I don't understand  where I have to make the leap myself  in my own head  is going to stop the flow of the presentation. So  you've got to take me through like a sixth grader    dub  dub  dub  dub  dub    but without patronizing me. And it's a very tricky path to do it. But if you can do it  it works really  really well. Anything that's inconsistent within the concept of your thing. If you tell me sales of X  Y or Z are    million dollars  and the next slide  or five slides later  they're five million dollars. Well  one may have been gross sales  one may have been net sales  but I want to know that all the numbers make sense together. And then finally  anything that's an error  or a typo  or a stupid mistake  or a line that's in the wrong place. That shows me that    if you can't even do a presentation  how the heck can you run a company  So this all feeds in together. All right  so the best way to do this stuff is to look at our betters  look at people who have done this before. So let's look at the most successful technology executive in the business and see how a presentation goes. Bill Gates' PowerPoint presentation over here. Here's Gates doing a thing for Windows. Is this the way you should do a PowerPoint presentation  What do you think  No. Who do you think we should look at as our role model  Oh  isn't that funny  There's another great one over here. Yes  OK  Steve Jobs. You want absolute    this is the Zen of presentation  right  Here he is. One little guy  black jeans and stuff  on a totally empty stage. What are you focusing on  You're focusing on him  This is Steve Jobs. So  you know  our great    these wonderful long bullet points  a whole list of things  you know    good  No  they're not. The long bullet points are bad. What's good  Short  short bullet points. But you know what  Even better than short bullet points are no bullet points. Just give me the headline over here. And you know what  How many bullet points or headlines does Steve Jobs use  Basically none. What do you do  Best of all  images. Just a simple image. I looked at the image    a picture's worth a thousand words. You look at the image and you see that  and you drop the whole thing. And then  you come back to me. And you're focused on me and why I'm such a great guy  and why you want to invest in me. And why this whole thing makes sense. So with that said  we only have a very  very short time. So let's run through the things you've got to include in your presentation. Well  first of all  start out. None of these big  long titled slides with blah  blah  blah  blah  blah  blah and I'm presenting to so and so  such and such a date. I know the day  I know who I am  I know you're presenting. I don't need all that. Just give me your company logo. I look at the logo  and it sort of ties it to my brain. And then I come back to you. I'm focused on you  OK  You do that  you give me your quick    second or    second intro  grab my attention. And then you want to give me a quick business overview. This is not a five minute pitch. This is  you know  two sentences.  We build widgets for the X  Y  Z market.  Or   We sell services to help somebody do X.  You know  whatever. And that is like the picture on the outside of a jigsaw puzzle box. That lets me know the context. It gives me the armature for the whole thing you're going to be going through. And it lets me put everything else in relation to something you've already told me. So there you go    walk me through  show me who your management team is. It's helpful that you've had experience and you've done this kind of thing before. And I want to know the market    the size of the market. Why is this market worth getting at over here  I want to know your product  and that's very important. Now  this is not a product pitch  not a sales pitch. I don't want to know all the ins and outs  and the gazuntas and the yaddas and stuff. I just want to know    what the heck is it  If it's a website  show me a screenshot of your website. You know  don't do a live demo. No  never do a live demo. Do a canned demo  or do something that lets me know why people are going to buy whatever it is. Then I want to know    now that I know what you're selling  tell me how you make money on it. For every X you sell  you get Y  you do your services of Z. I want to know what the business model is on a sort of per unit basis  or for the actual product that you're selling. I want to know who you're selling this thing to  in terms of customers. And I want to know if you have any relationships that are going to be special to help you. Whether you have a distribution relationship with somebody  you know  you have a producing partner. Or  you know  again  validation. This helps to say you're bigger than just one little thing over here. But then  everybody has competition. There has never been a company that doesn't have competition. Even if the competition is the old way of doing something. I want to know exactly what your competition is  and then that will help me judge how you fit into the whole operation over here. But then  I want to know how you're special. If I know what your competition does  how are you going to prevent your competition from eating your lunch over here  And then all this ties into the financial overview. And you have to have    you can't do a VC pitch without giving me your financials. I want to know three and  you know  a year or two back  or as long as you've been in existence. And I want to know three or four or five years forward. Five is a bit much. Probably four is rational. And I want to know how that business model that you showed me on a product basis is going to translate into a company model. And  you know  how many widgets are you going to sell  You're making X amount per widget. I want to know what the driver is. We're going to have       customers this year  and        next year. And our revenues are going to go this  that and the other thing. And so that gives me the whole picture for the next several years into which I'm investing. And I want to know how the money you're going to get from me is going to help you get there. You're going to open an offshore plant in China  you're going to spend it all on sales and marketing  you're going to go to Tahiti  or whatever out there. But then comes the ask. This is where you tell me how much you actually want to get. You're looking for   million    at what kind of valuation  Two million at        . What's the money in so far  Who invested  I hope you invested personally. Because I'm following on. If you can't invest in your own thing  why should I invest in it  So I like to know if you have friends and family  or angel investors in there  or you've had more VCs before. What's the capital structure up until this point  And then finally  having done all that  you've now told me the whole thing  so now you've got to bring it back to that conclusion. This is that rocket going up. So hopefully everything has been positive  positive  positive  more positive. And everything  everything you say clicks with me  and it all makes sense. And I'm thinking   This is really  really great.  And then you take me back to your logo. Just your logo on the screen. And I look at the logo    okay  good. Now I come back to you. Nothing else to look at  right  And now  you've got to wrap it up and tie it up here. You've got to give me the final  you know    boom     the final pitch that's going to send me into space. Now  in the process of doing this over here  how do you remember the sequences and doers  You've noticed here that I'm not looking at the screen  right  The screen is  actually  in this room  is set up so it's in front of me. So  I couldn't even see if I wanted to. So now  how do I know what's going on here  Well  I've got a laptop in front of me  but you're looking at me. And you're looking at this. What do you think I'm looking at  You think that I'm looking at that  No  I'm looking actually at a special version of PowerPoint over here  which shows me the slides ahead  the slides behind  my notes from here  so I can see what's going on. PowerPoint has this built into every copy of PowerPoint that's shipped. If you use Apple's Keynote  it's got an even better version in Keynote. And then there's another program  called Ovation  you can get from Adobe  that they just bought last summer. Which actually helps you run the whole timers  and it lets you figure out what's going on. So  here's my wrap up to take you to the moon  right  David's    I usually do a top     we don't have time for top   s. So David's top five presentation tips. Number one  always use presenter mode  or Ovation  or presenter tools  because it lets you know exactly where you're going. It helps you pace yourself  it gives you a timer so we end on time and the whole bit. Number four  always use remote control. Have you seen me touch the computer  No  you haven't. Why not  Because I'm using remote control over here. Always use remote control. Number three  the handouts you give are not your presentation. If you follow my suggestions  you're going to have a very spare  very Zen like presentation  which is great for conveying who you are and getting people emotionally involved. But it's not really good as a handout. You want to have a handout that gives a lot more information  because the handout has to stand without you over here. Number three  don't read your speech. Can you imagine   Well  you should invest in my company because it's really good.  It doesn't work  right  Don't read your speech. And the number one presentation tip  never  ever look at the screen. You're making a connection with your audience over here  and you always want to do a one on one connection. The screen should come up visually behind you  and supplement what you're doing instead of replace you. And that is how to pitch to a VC. If you ask people about what part of psychology do they think is hard  and you say   Well  what about thinking and emotions   Most people will say   Emotions are terribly hard. They're incredibly complex. They can't    I have no idea of how they work. But thinking is really very straightforward  it's just sort of some kind of logical reasoning  or something. But that's not the hard part.  So here's a list of problems that come up. One nice problem is  what do we do about health  The other day  I was reading something  and the person said probably the largest single cause of disease is handshaking in the West. And there was a little study about people who don't handshake  and comparing them with ones who do handshake. And I haven't the foggiest idea of where you find the ones that don't handshake  because they must be hiding. And the people who avoid that have    percent less infectious disease or something. Or maybe it was    and a quarter percent. So if you really want to solve the problem of epidemics and so forth  let's start with that. And since I got that idea  I've had to shake hundreds of hands. And I think the only way to avoid it is to have some horrible visible disease  and then you don't have to explain. Education  how do we improve education  Well  the single best way is to get them to understand that what they're being told is a whole lot of nonsense. And then  of course  you have to do something about how to moderate that  so that anybody can    so they'll listen to you. Pollution  energy shortage  environmental diversity  poverty. How do we make stable societies  Longevity. Okay  there're lots of problems to worry about. Anyway  the question I think people should talk about    and it's absolutely taboo    is  how many people should there be  And I think it should be about     million or maybe     million. And then notice that a great many of these problems disappear. If you had     million people properly spread out  then if there's some garbage  you throw it away  preferably where you can't see it  and it will rot. Or you throw it into the ocean and some fish will benefit from it. The problem is  how many people should there be  And it's a sort of choice we have to make. Most people are about    inches high or more  and there's these cube laws. So if you make them this big  by using nanotechnology  I suppose       then you could have a thousand times as many. That would solve the problem  but I don't see anybody doing any research on making people smaller. Now  it's nice to reduce the population  but a lot of people want to have children. And there's one solution that's probably only a few years off. You know you have    chromosomes. If you're lucky  you've got    from each parent. Sometimes you get an extra one or drop one out  but    so you can skip the grandparent and great grandparent stage and go right to the great great grandparent. And you have    people and you give them a scanner  or whatever you need  and they look at their chromosomes and each of them says which one he likes best  or she    no reason to have just two sexes any more  even. So each child has    parents  and I suppose you could let each group of    parents have    children. Wouldn't that be enough  And then the children would get plenty of support  and nurturing  and mentoring  and the world population would decline very rapidly and everybody would be totally happy. Timesharing is a little further off in the future. And there's this great novel that Arthur Clarke wrote twice  called  Against the Fall of Night  and  The City and the Stars.  They're both wonderful and largely the same  except that computers happened in between. And Arthur was looking at this old book  and he said   Well  that was wrong. The future must have some computers.  So in the second version of it  there are     billion or       billion people on Earth  but they're all stored on hard disks or floppies  or whatever they have in the future. And you let a few million of them out at a time. A person comes out  they live for a thousand years doing whatever they do  and then  when it's time to go back for a billion years    or a million  I forget  the numbers don't matter    but there really aren't very many people on Earth at a time. And you get to think about yourself and your memories  and before you go back into suspension  you edit your memories and you change your personality and so forth. The plot of the book is that there's not enough diversity  so that the people who designed the city make sure that every now and then an entirely new person is created. And in the novel  a particular one named Alvin is created. And he says  maybe this isn't the best way  and wrecks the whole system. I don't think the solutions that I proposed are good enough or smart enough. I think the big problem is that we're not smart enough to understand which of the problems we're facing are good enough. Therefore  we have to build super intelligent machines like HAL. As you remember  at some point in the book for         HAL realizes that the universe is too big  and grand  and profound for those really stupid astronauts. If you contrast HAL's behavior with the triviality of the people on the spaceship  you can see what's written between the lines. Well  what are we going to do about that  We could get smarter. I think that we're pretty smart  as compared to chimpanzees  but we're not smart enough to deal with the colossal problems that we face  either in abstract mathematics or in figuring out economies  or balancing the world around. So one thing we can do is live longer. And nobody knows how hard that is  but we'll probably find out in a few years. You see  there's two forks in the road. We know that people live twice as long as chimpanzees almost  and nobody lives more than     years  for reasons that aren't very well understood. But lots of people now live to    or      unless they shake hands too much or something like that. And so maybe if we lived     years  we could accumulate enough skills and knowledge to solve some problems. So that's one way of going about it. And as I said  we don't know how hard that is. It might be    after all  most other mammals live half as long as the chimpanzee  so we're sort of three and a half or four times  have four times the longevity of most mammals. And in the case of the primates  we have almost the same genes. We only differ from chimpanzees  in the present state of knowledge  which is absolute hogwash  maybe by just a few hundred genes. What I think is that the gene counters don't know what they're doing yet. And whatever you do  don't read anything about genetics that's published within your lifetime  or something. The stuff has a very short half life  same with brain science. And so it might be that if we just fix four or five genes  we can live     years. Or it might be that it's just    or     and I doubt that it's several hundred. So this is something that people will be discussing and lots of ethicists    you know  an ethicist is somebody who sees something wrong with whatever you have in mind. And it's very hard to find an ethicist who considers any change worth making  because he says  what about the consequences  And  of course  we're not responsible for the consequences of what we're doing now  are we  Like all this complaint about clones. And yet two random people will mate and have this child  and both of them have some pretty rotten genes  and the child is likely to come out to be average. Which  by chimpanzee standards  is very good indeed. If we do have longevity  then we'll have to face the population growth problem anyway. Because if people live     or       years  then we can't let them have a child more than about once every     or       years. And so there won't be any workforce. And one of the things Laurie Garrett pointed out  and others have  is that a society that doesn't have people of working age is in real trouble. And things are going to get worse  because there's nobody to educate the children or to feed the old. And when I'm talking about a long lifetime  of course  I don't want somebody who's     years old to be like our image of what a     year old is    which is dead  actually. You know  there's about     different parts of the brain which seem to have different functions. Nobody knows how most of them work in detail  but we do know that there're lots of different things in there. And they don't always work together. I like Freud's theory that most of them are cancelling each other out. And so if you think of yourself as a sort of city with a hundred resources  then  when you're afraid  for example  you may discard your long range goals  but you may think deeply and focus on exactly how to achieve that particular goal. You throw everything else away. You become a monomaniac    all you care about is not stepping out on that platform. And when you're hungry  food becomes more attractive  and so forth. So I see emotions as highly evolved subsets of your capability. Emotion is not something added to thought. An emotional state is what you get when you remove     or     of your normally available resources. So thinking of emotions as the opposite of    as something less than thinking is immensely productive. And I hope  in the next few years  to show that this will lead to smart machines. And I guess I better skip all the rest of this  which are some details on how we might make those smart machines and       and the main idea is in fact that the core of a really smart machine is one that recognizes that a certain kind of problem is facing you. This is a problem of such and such a type  and therefore there's a certain way or ways of thinking that are good for that problem. So I think the future  main problem of psychology is to classify types of predicaments  types of situations  types of obstacles and also to classify available and possible ways to think and pair them up. So you see  it's almost like a Pavlovian    we lost the first hundred years of psychology by really trivial theories  where you say  how do people learn how to react to a situation  What I'm saying is  after we go through a lot of levels  including designing a huge  messy system with thousands of ports  we'll end up again with the central problem of psychology. Saying  not what are the situations  but what are the kinds of problems and what are the kinds of strategies  how do you learn them  how do you connect them up  how does a really creative person invent a new way of thinking out of the available resources and so forth. So  I think in the next    years  if we can get rid of all of the traditional approaches to artificial intelligence  like neural nets and genetic algorithms and rule based systems  and just turn our sights a little bit higher to say  can we make a system that can use all those things for the right kind of problem  Some problems are good for neural nets  we know that others  neural nets are hopeless on them. Genetic algorithms are great for certain things  I suspect I know what they're bad at  and I won't tell you. Thank you. Philosophers  dramatists  theologians have grappled with this question for centuries  what makes people go wrong  Interestingly  I asked this question when I was a little kid. I grew up in the South Bronx  inner city ghetto in New York  and I was surrounded by evil  as all kids are who grew up in an inner city. And I had friends who were really good kids  who lived out the Dr. Jekyll Mr. Hyde scenario    Robert Louis Stevenson. That is  they took drugs  got in trouble  went to jail. Some got killed  and some did it without drug assistance. So when I read Robert Louis Stevenson  that wasn't fiction. The only question is  what was in the juice  And more importantly  that line between good and evil    which privileged people like to think is fixed and impermeable  with them on the good side  the others on the bad side    I knew that line was movable  and it was permeable. Good people could be seduced across that line  and under good and some rare circumstances  bad kids could recover with help  with reform  with rehabilitation. So I want to begin with this wonderful illusion by  Dutch  artist M.C. Escher. If you look at it and focus on the white  what you see is a world full of angels. But let's look more deeply  and as we do  what appears is the demons  the devils in the world. That tells us several things. One  the world is  was  will always be filled with good and evil  because good and evil is the yin and yang of the human condition. It tells me something else. If you remember  God's favorite angel was Lucifer. Apparently  Lucifer means  the light.  It also means  the morning star   in some scripture. And apparently  he disobeyed God  and that's the ultimate disobedience to authority. And when he did  Michael  the archangel  was sent to kick him out of heaven along with the other fallen angels. And so Lucifer descends into hell  becomes Satan  becomes the devil  and the force of evil in the universe begins. Paradoxically  it was God who created hell as a place to store evil. He didn't do a good job of keeping it there though. So  this arc of the cosmic transformation of God's favorite angel into the Devil  for me  sets the context for understanding human beings who are transformed from good  ordinary people into perpetrators of evil. So the Lucifer effect  although it focuses on the negatives    the negatives that people can become  not the negatives that people are    leads me to a psychological definition. Evil is the exercise of power. And that's the key  it's about power. To intentionally harm people psychologically  to hurt people physically  to destroy people mortally  or ideas  and to commit crimes against humanity. If you Google  evil   a word that should surely have withered by now  you come up with     million hits in a third of a second. A few years ago    I am sure all of you were shocked  as I was  with the revelation of American soldiers abusing prisoners in a strange place in a controversial war  Abu Ghraib in Iraq. And these were men and women who were putting prisoners through unbelievable humiliation. I was shocked  but I wasn't surprised  because I had seen those same visual parallels when I was the prison superintendent of the Stanford Prison Study. Immediately the Bush administration military said what  What all administrations say when there's a scandal   Don't blame us. It's not the system. It's the few bad apples  the few rogue soldiers.  My hypothesis is  American soldiers are good  usually. Maybe it was the barrel that was bad. But how am I going to deal with that hypothesis  I became an expert witness for one of the guards  Sergeant Chip Frederick  and in that position  I had access to the dozen investigative reports. I had access to him. I could study him  have him come to my home  get to know him  do psychological analysis to see  was he a good apple or bad apple. And thirdly  I had access to all of the       pictures that these soldiers took. These pictures are of a violent or sexual nature. All of them come from the cameras of American soldiers. Because everybody has a digital camera or cell phone camera  they took pictures of everything  more than      . And what I've done is I organized them into various categories. But these are by United States military police  army reservists. They are not soldiers prepared for this mission at all. And it all happened in a single place  Tier   A  on the night shift. Why  Tier   A was the center for military intelligence. It was the interrogation hold. The CIA was there. Interrogators from Titan Corporation  all there  and they're getting no information about the insurgency. So they're going to put pressure on these soldiers  military police  to cross the line  give them permission to break the will of the enemy  to prepare them for interrogation  to soften them up  to take the gloves off. Those are the euphemisms  and this is how it was interpreted. Let's go down to that dungeon.  Abu Ghraib Iraq Prison Abuses      Military Police Guards' Photos   The following images include nudity and graphic depictions of violence  So  pretty horrific. That's one of the visual illustrations of evil. And it should not have escaped you that the reason I paired the prisoner with his arms out with Leonardo da Vinci's ode to humanity is that that prisoner was mentally ill. That prisoner covered himself with shit every day  they had to roll him in dirt so he wouldn't stink. But the guards ended up calling him  Shit Boy.  What was he doing in that prison rather than in some mental institution  In any event  here's former Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld. He comes down and says   I want to know  who is responsible  Who are the bad apples   Well  that's a bad question. You have to reframe it and ask   What is responsible    What  could be the who of people  but it could also be the what of the situation  and obviously that's wrongheaded. How do psychologists try to understand such transformations of human character  if you believe that they were good soldiers before they went down to that dungeon  There are three ways. The main way is called dispositional. We look at what's inside of the person  the bad apples. This is the foundation of all of social science  the foundation of religion  the foundation of war. Social psychologists like me come along and say   Yeah  people are the actors on the stage  but you'll have to be aware of the situation. Who are the cast of characters  What's the costume  Is there a stage director   And so we're interested in what are the external factors around the individual    the bad barrel  Social scientists stop there and they miss the big point that I discovered when I became an expert witness for Abu Ghraib. The power is in the system. The system creates the situation that corrupts the individuals  and the system is the legal  political  economic  cultural background. And this is where the power is of the bad barrel makers. If you want to change a person  change the situation. And to change it  you've got to know where the power is  in the system. So the Lucifer effect involves understanding human character transformations with these three factors. And it's a dynamic interplay. What do the people bring into the situation  What does the situation bring out of them  And what is the system that creates and maintains that situation  My recent book   The Lucifer Effect   is about  how do you understand how good people turn evil  And it has a lot of detail about what I'm going to talk about today. So Dr. Z's  Lucifer Effect   although it focuses on evil  really is a celebration of the human mind's infinite capacity to make any of us kind or cruel  caring or indifferent  creative or destructive  and it makes some of us villains. And the good news that I'm going to hopefully come to at the end is that it makes some of us heroes. This wonderful cartoon in the New Yorker summarizes my whole talk   I'm neither a good cop nor a bad cop  Jerome. Like yourself  I'm a complex amalgam of positive and negative personality traits that emerge or not  depending on the circumstances.  There's a study some of you think you know about  but very few people have ever read the story. You watched the movie. This is Stanley Milgram  little Jewish kid from the Bronx  and he asked the question   Could the Holocaust happen here  now   People say   No  that's Nazi Germany  Hitler  you know  that's     .  He said   Yeah  but suppose Hitler asked you  'Would you electrocute a stranger ' 'No way  I'm a good person.'  He said   Why don't we put you in a situation and give you a chance to see what you would do   And so what he did was he tested       ordinary people.     New Haven  Connecticut      Bridgeport. And the ad said   Psychologists want to understand memory. We want to improve people's memory  because it is the key to success.  OK   We're going to give you five bucks    four dollars for your time. We don't want college students. We want men between    and   .  In the later studies  they ran women. Ordinary people  barbers  clerks  white collar people. So  you go down  one of you will be a learner  one will be a teacher. The learner's a genial  middle aged guy. He gets tied up to the shock apparatus in another room. The learner could be middle aged  could be as young as   . And one of you is told by the authority  the guy in the lab coat   Your job as teacher is to give him material to learn. Gets it right  reward. Gets it wrong  you press a button on the shock box. The first button is    volts. He doesn't even feel it.  That's the key. All evil starts with    volts. And then the next step is another    volts. The problem is  at the end of the line  it's     volts. And as you go along  the guy is screaming   I've got a heart condition  I'm out of here   You're a good person. You complain.  Sir  who will be responsible if something happens to him   The experimenter says   Don't worry  I will be responsible. Continue  teacher.  And the question is  who would go all the way to     volts  You should notice here  when it gets up to      it says   Danger. Severe Shock.  When it gets up to here  there's  XXX     the pornography of power. So Milgram asks    psychiatrists   What percent of American citizens would go to the end   They said only one percent. Because that's sadistic behavior  and we know  psychiatry knows  only one percent of Americans are sadistic. OK. Here's the data. They could not be more wrong. Two thirds go all the way to     volts. This was just one study. Milgram did more than    studies. And look at this. In study     where you see somebody like you go all the way     percent go all the way. In study five  if you see people rebel     percent rebel. What about women  Study       no different than men. So Milgram is quantifying evil as the willingness of people to blindly obey authority  to go all the way to     volts. And it's like a dial on human nature. A dial in a sense that you can make almost everybody totally obedient  down to the majority  down to none. What are the external parallels  For all research is artificial. What's the validity in the real world      American citizens committed suicide or were murdered by family and friends in Guyana jungle in       because they were blindly obedient to this guy  their pastor    not their priest    their pastor  Reverend Jim Jones. He persuaded them to commit mass suicide. And so  he's the modern Lucifer effect  a man of God who becomes the Angel of Death. Milgram's study is all about individual authority to control people. Most of the time  we are in institutions  so the Stanford Prison Study is a study of the power of institutions to influence individual behavior. Interestingly  Stanley Milgram and I were in the same high school class in James Monroe in the Bronx      . I did this study with my graduate students  especially Craig Haney    and it also began work with an ad. We had a cheap  little ad  but we wanted college students for a study of prison life.    people volunteered  took personality tests. We did interviews. Picked two dozen  the most normal  the most healthy. Randomly assigned them to be prisoner and guard. So on day one  we knew we had good apples. I'm going to put them in a bad situation. And secondly  we know there's no difference between the boys who will be guards and those who will be prisoners. To the prisoners  we said   Wait at home. The study will begin Sunday.  We didn't tell them that the city police were going to come and do realistic arrests.  Day    Student  A police car pulls up in front  and a cop comes to the front door  and knocks  and says he's looking for me. So they  right there  you know  they took me out the door  they put my hands against the car. It was a real cop car  it was a real policeman  and there were real neighbors in the street  who didn't know that this was an experiment. And there was cameras all around and neighbors all around. They put me in the car  then they drove me around Palo Alto. They took me to the basement of the police station. Then they put me in a cell. I was the first one to be picked up  so they put me in a cell  which was just like a room with a door with bars on it. You could tell it wasn't a real jail. They locked me in there  in this degrading little outfit. They were taking this experiment too seriously. Here are the prisoners  who are going to be dehumanized  they'll become numbers. Here are the guards with the symbols of power and anonymity. Guards get prisoners to clean the toilet bowls out with their bare hands  to do other humiliating tasks. They strip them naked. They sexually taunt them. They begin to do degrading activities  like having them simulate sodomy. You saw simulating fellatio in soldiers in Abu Ghraib. My guards did it in five days. The stress reaction was so extreme that normal kids we picked because they were healthy had breakdowns within    hours. The study ended after six days  because it was out of control. Five kids had emotional breakdowns. Does it make a difference if warriors go to battle changing their appearance or not  If they're anonymous  how do they treat their victims  In some cultures  they go to war without changing their appearance. In others  they paint themselves like  Lord of the Flies.  In some  they wear masks. In many  soldiers are anonymous in uniform. So this anthropologist  John Watson  found    cultures that had two bits of data. Do they change their appearance    . Do they kill  torture  mutilate    . If they don't change their appearance  only one of eight kills  tortures or mutilates. The key is in the red zone. If they change their appearance     of       that's    percent    kill  torture  mutilate. And that's the power of anonymity. So what are the seven social processes that grease the slippery slope of evil  Mindlessly taking the first small step. Dehumanization of others. De individuation of self. Diffusion of personal responsibility. Blind obedience to authority. Uncritical conformity to group norms. Passive tolerance of evil through inaction  or indifference. And it happens when you're in a new or unfamiliar situation. Your habitual response patterns don't work. Your personality and morality are disengaged.  Nothing is easier than to denounce the evildoer  nothing more difficult than understanding him   Dostoyevsky. Understanding is not excusing. Psychology is not excuse ology. So social and psychological research reveals how ordinary  good people can be transformed without the drugs. You don't need it. You just need the social psychological processes. Real world parallels  Compare this with this. James Schlesinger    I'm going to end with this    says   Psychologists have attempted to understand how and why individuals and groups who usually act humanely can sometimes act otherwise in certain circumstances.  That's the Lucifer effect. And he goes on to say   The landmark Stanford study provides a cautionary tale for all military operations.  If you give people power without oversight  it's a prescription for abuse. They knew that  and let that happen. So another report  an investigative report by General Fay  says the system is guilty. In this report  he says it was the environment that created Abu Ghraib  by leadership failures that contributed to the occurrence of such abuse  and because it remained undiscovered by higher authorities for a long period of time. Those abuses went on for three months. Who was watching the store  The answer is nobody  I think on purpose. He gave the guards permission to do those things  and they knew nobody was ever going to come down to that dungeon. So you need a paradigm shift in all of these areas. The shift is away from the medical model that focuses only on the individual. The shift is toward a public health model that recognizes situational and systemic vectors of disease. Bullying is a disease. Prejudice is a disease. Violence is a disease. Since the Inquisition  we've been dealing with problems at the individual level. It doesn't work. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn says   The line between good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being.  That means that line is not out there. That's a decision that you have to make  a personal thing. So I want to end very quickly on a positive note. Heroism as the antidote to evil  by promoting the heroic imagination  especially in our kids  in our educational system. We want kids to think   I'm a hero in waiting  waiting for the right situation to come along  and I will act heroically. My whole life  I'm now going to focus away from evil    that I've been in since I was a kid    to understanding heroes. Banality of heroism. It's ordinary people who do heroic deeds. It's the counterpoint to Hannah Arendt's  Banality of Evil.  Our traditional societal heroes are wrong  because they are the exceptions. They organize their life around this. That's why we know their names. Our kids' heroes are also wrong models for them  because they have supernatural talents. We want our kids to realize most heroes are everyday people  and the heroic act is unusual. This is Joe Darby. He was the one that stopped those abuses you saw  because when he saw those images  he turned them over to a senior investigating officer. He was a low level private  and that stopped it. Was he a hero  No. They had to put him in hiding  because people wanted to kill him  and then his mother and his wife. For three years  they were in hiding. This is the woman who stopped the Stanford Prison Study. When I said it got out of control  I was the prison superintendent. I didn't know it was out of control. I was totally indifferent. She saw that madhouse and said   You know what  it's terrible what you're doing to those boys. They're not prisoners nor guards  they're boys  and you are responsible.  And I ended the study the next day. The good news is I married her the next year. I just came to my senses  obviously. So situations have the power to do  three things . But the point is  this is the same situation that can inflame the hostile imagination in some of us  that makes us perpetrators of evil  can inspire the heroic imagination in others. It's the same situation and you're on one side or the other. Most people are guilty of the evil of inaction  because your mother said   Don't get involved. Mind your own business.  And you have to say   Mama  humanity is my business.  So the psychology of heroism is    we're going to end in a moment    how do we encourage children in new hero courses  that I'm working on with Matt Langdon    he has a hero workshop    to develop this heroic imagination  this self labeling   I am a hero in waiting   and teach them skills. To be a hero  you have to learn to be a deviant  because you're always going against the conformity of the group. Heroes are ordinary people whose social actions are extraordinary. Who act. The key to heroism is two things. You have to act when other people are passive. B  You have to act socio centrically  not egocentrically. And I want to end with a known story about Wesley Autrey  New York subway hero. Fifty year old African American construction worker standing on a subway. A white guy falls on the tracks. The subway train is coming. There's    people there. You know what  They freeze. He's got a reason not to get involved. He's black  the guy's white  and he's got two kids. Instead  he gives his kids to a stranger  jumps on the tracks  puts the guy between the tracks  lays on him  the subway goes over him. Wesley and the guy       and a half inches height. The train clearance is    inches. A half an inch would have taken his head off. And he said   I did what anyone could do   no big deal to jump on the tracks. And the moral imperative is  I did what everyone should do.  And so one day  you will be in a new situation. Take path one  you're going to be a perpetrator of evil. Evil  meaning you're going to be Arthur Andersen. You're going to cheat  or you're going to allow bullying. Path two  you become guilty of the evil of passive inaction. Path three  you become a hero. The point is  are we ready to take the path to celebrating ordinary heroes  waiting for the right situation to come along to put heroic imagination into action  Because it may only happen once in your life  and when you pass it by  you'll always know  I could have been a hero and I let it pass me by. So the point is thinking it and then doing it. So I want to thank you. Thank you. Let's oppose the power of evil systems at home and abroad  and let's focus on the positive. Advocate for respect of personal dignity  for justice and peace  which sadly our administration has not been doing. Thanks so much. Hi. I'm here to talk to you about the importance of praise  admiration and thank you  and having it be specific and genuine. And the way I got interested in this was  I noticed in myself  when I was growing up  and until about a few years ago  that I would want to say thank you to someone  I would want to praise them  I would want to take in their praise of me and I'd just stop it. And I asked myself  why  I felt shy  I felt embarrassed. And then my question became  am I the only one who does this  So  I decided to investigate. I'm fortunate enough to work in the rehab facility  so I get to see people who are facing life and death with addiction. And sometimes it comes down to something as simple as  their core wound is their father died without ever saying he's proud of them. But then  they hear from all the family and friends that the father told everybody else that he was proud of him  but he never told the son. It's because he didn't know that his son needed to hear it. So my question is  why don't we ask for the things that we need  I know a gentleman  married for    years  who's longing to hear his wife say   Thank you for being the breadwinner  so I can stay home with the kids   but won't ask. I know a woman who's good at this. She  once a week  meets with her husband and says   I'd really like you to thank me for all these things I did in the house and with the kids.  And he goes   Oh  this is great  this is great.  And praise really does have to be genuine  but she takes responsibility for that. And a friend of mine  April  who I've had since kindergarten  she thanks her children for doing their chores. And she said   Why wouldn't I thank it  even though they're supposed to do it   So  the question is  why was I blocking it  Why were other people blocking it  Why can I say   I'll take my steak medium rare  I need size six shoes   but I won't say   Would you praise me this way   And it's because I'm giving you critical data about me. I'm telling you where I'm insecure. I'm telling you where I need your help. And I'm treating you  my inner circle  like you're the enemy. Because what can you do with that data  You could neglect me. You could abuse it. Or you could actually meet my need. And I took my bike into the bike store   I love this    same bike  and they'd do something called  truing  the wheels. The guy said   You know  when you true the wheels  it's going to make the bike so much better.  I get the same bike back  and they've taken all the little warps out of those same wheels I've had for two and a half years  and my bike is like new. So  I'm going to challenge all of you. I want you to true your wheels  be honest about the praise that you need to hear. What do you need to hear  Go home to your wife    go ask her  what does she need  Go home to your husband    what does he need  Go home and ask those questions  and then help the people around you. And it's simple. And why should we care about this  We talk about world peace. How can we have world peace with different cultures  different languages  I think it starts household by household  under the same roof. So  let's make it right in our own backyard. And I want to thank all of you in the audience for being great husbands  great mothers  friends  daughters  sons. And maybe somebody's never said that to you  but you've done a really  really good job. And thank you for being here  just showing up and changing the world with your ideas. Thank you. I'm a  or was  or kind of am a toy designer. And before I was a toy designer  oh  I was a mime  a street mime  actually. And then I was an entertainer  I guess. And before that  I was a silversmith  and before that  I was    I was out of the house at about    and a half  and I never wound up going into college. I didn't really    I didn't see the point at the time. I do now  after learning about all the quantum stuff. It's really cool. Anyway  I wanted to show you a little bit about the world of toy design  at least from my small aperture of the world. This is a video I made when I first started doing toy design. I'm in my garage  making weird stuff. And then you go to these toy companies and there's some guy across the table  and he goes   Pass. Pass. Pass.  You know  you think it's so cool  but they    anyway  I made this little tape that I'd always show when I go in. This is the name of my company  Giving Toys. So I used to work at Mattel  actually. And after I left Mattel  I started all these hamburger makers  and then got the license to make the maker. So this is a hamburger maker that you take the peanut butter and stuff and you put it in there  and it makes    and this is a French fry maker  little  tiny food you can eat. I beat up the pasta maker to make that. Then this is a McNugget maker  I think. This  now that's the McNugget maker  and this is a    this is my oldest daughter making a McApple Pie. And let's see  you can make the pie and cinnamon and sugar  and then you eat  and you eat  and you eat  and you    she's about     pounds now. No  she's not  she's beautiful. This is how they looked when they came out at the end. These are a    this is like a    million dollar line. And it got me through some    I didn't make any royalties on this  but it got me through. Next is a compilation of a bunch of stuff. That was a missile foam launcher that didn't get sold. This is a squishy head  for no apparent reason. This is some effects that I did for  Wig  Rattle and Roll.  That was a robot eye thing controlling it in the back. That paid the rent for about a month. This is a walking Barbie    I said   Oh  this is it   And they go   Oh  that's really nice   and out it goes. So this is some fighting robots. I thought everyone would want these. They fight  they get back up  you know  Wouldn't this be cool  And they made it into a toy  and then they dropped it like a hot rock. They're pretty cool. This is a   we're doing some flight testing on my little pug  seeing if this can really grab. It does pretty good. I'm using little phone connectors to make them so they can spin. It's how they  see  have those album things    kids don't know what they are. This is a clay maker. You know  I said    I went to Play Doh  and said   Look  I can animate this.  They said   Don't talk to us about Play Doh.  And then  I made a Lego animator. I thought  this would be so great  And you know  Lego    don't take Legos to Lego. That's the answer. They know everything about it. Then I started doing animatronics. I loved dinosaurs. I used to be in the film business  kind of  and actually  Nicholas Negroponte saw this when I was  like      and anyway  so then they said   No  you have to make two and they have to fight.  You know  how    why would a kid want a dinosaur  This is me using  unclear  or   D Studio  back in the '  s. That's David Letterman. You can see how old this stuff is. That's my youngest cousin. This is a segment called   Dangerous Toys You Won't See at Christmas.  We had my first saw blade launcher and we had a flamethrower chair. My career basically peaked here. And in the back are foam core cutouts of the people who couldn't make it to the show. This is MEK going through a windshield wiper motor. So this is a    I used to kind of be an actor. And I'm really not very good at it. But the    this is a guy named Dr. Yatz  who would take toys apart and show kids about engineering. And you can see the massively parallel processing Nintendos there. And over to the left is a view master of the CD ROM. And a guy named Stan Reznikov did this as a pilot. This is a    you can see the little window there. You can actually see the Steadicam with a bubble on the bottom. You see the keyboard strapped to my wrist. Way ahead of my time here. Narrator  I love toys  Caleb Chung  That's all I wanted to say there. I love toys. OK  so  so that was a  that was the first kind of a    that was the first batch of products. Most of them did not go. You get one out of     one out of    products. And every now and then  we do something like a  you know  an automated hair wrap machine  you know  that tangles your hair and pulls your scalp out  and    and we'd make some money on that  you know. And we'd give it out. But eventually  we left L.A.  and we moved to Idaho  where there was actually a lot of peace and quiet. And I started working on this project    oh  I have to tell you about this real quick. Throughout this whole thing  making toys  I think there is a real correlation with innovation and art and science. There's some kind of a blend that happens that allows  you know  to find innovation. And I tried to sum this up in some kind of symbol that means something  to me anyway. And so  art and science have a kind of dynamic balance  that's where I think innovation happens. And actually  this is  to me  how I can come up with great ideas. But it's not how you actually get leverage. Actually  you have to put a circle around that  and call it business. And those three together  I think  give you leverage in the world. But moving on. So  this is a quick tale I'm going to tell. This is the Furby tale. As he said  I was co inventor of the Furby. I did the body and creature    well  you'll see. So by way of showing you this  you can kind of get an understanding of what it is to  hopefully  try to create robotic life forms  or technology that has an emotional connection with the user. So this is my family. This is my wife  Christi  and Abby  and Melissa  and my    year old now  Emily  who was just a pack of trouble. All right  there's that robot again. I came out of the movie business  as I said  and I said  let's make these animatronic robots. Let's make these things. And so I've always had a big interest in this. This one actually didn't go anywhere  but I got my feet wet doing this. This is a smaller one  and I have a little moving torso on there. A little  tiny guy walks along. More servo drives  lots of servo hacking  lots of mechanical stuff. There's another one. He actually has skeletor legs  I think  he's wearing there. Oh  this is a little pony  little pony    very cute little thing. The point of showing these is I've always been interested in little artificial life pieces. So the challenge was    I worked for Microsoft for a little bit  working on the Microsoft Barney. And this is a    you know  the purple dinosaur with kind of bloat wear. And  you know  they had lots  just lots of stuff in there that you didn't need  I thought. And then Microsoft can just fill a  you know  a warehouse full of this stuff and see if they sell. So it's a really strange business model compared to coming from a toy company. But anyway  a friend of mine and I  Dave Hampton  decided to see if we could do like a single cell organism. What's the fewest pieces we could use to make a little life form  And that's our little  thirty cent Mabuchi motor. And so  I have all these design books  like I'm sure many of you have. And throughout the books    this is the first page on Furby    I have kind of the art and science. I have the why over here  and the how over there. I try to do a lot of philosophy  a lot of thinking about all of these projects. Because they're not just  bing  ideas  you have to really dig deep in these things. So there's some real pseudo code over here  and getting the idea of different kind of drives  things like that. And originally  Furby only had two eyes and some batteries on the bottom. And then we said  well  you're going to feed him  and he needs to talk  and it got more complicated. And then I had to figure out how I'm going to use that one motor to make the eyes move  and the ears move  and the body to move  and the mouth to move. And  you know  I want to make it blink and do all that at the same time. Well  I came up with this kind of linear expression thing with these cams and feedback. And that worked pretty well. Then I started to get a little more realistic and I have to start drawing the stuff. And there's my  note to self  at the top   lots of engineering.  So that turned out to be a little more than true. There's my first exploded view and all the little pieces and the little worm drive and all that stuff. And then I've got to start building it  so this is the real thing. I get up and start cutting my finger and gluing things together. And that's my little workshop. And there's the first little cam that drove Furby. And there's Furby on the half shell. You can see the little BB in the box is my tilt sensor. I just basically gnawed all this stuff out of plastic. So there's the back of his head with a billion holes in it. And there I am. I'm done. There's my little Furby. No  it's a little robot on heroin or something  I think. So right now  you see  I love little robots. So my wife says   Well  you may like it  but nobody else will.  So she comes to the rescue. This is my wife Christi  who is just  you know  my muse and my partner for eternity here. And she does drawings  right  She's an actual  you know  artist. And she starts doing all these different drawings and does color patterns and coloring books. And I like the guy with the cigar at the bottom there. He didn't test so well  but I like him. And then she started doing these other images. At that time  Beanie Babies was a big hit  and we thought  we'll do a bunch of different ones. So here's a little pink one  a little pouf on his head. And here's    this didn't do so well in testing either  I don't know why. There's my favorite  Demon Furby. That was a good one. Anyway  finally settled on kind of this kind of a look  little poufy body  a little imaginary character. And there he is  a little bush baby on    caught in the headlights there. I actually went to Toys R Us  got a little furry cat  ripped it apart and made this. And since then  every time I come home from Toys R Us with dolls or something  they disappear from my desk and they get hidden in the house. I have three girls and they just  they    it's like a rescue animal thing they're going there. So  a little tether coming off  it's just a control for the Fur's mouth and his eyes. It's just a little server control and I made a little video going   Hi  my name's Furby  and I'm good   you know  and then I'd reach my hand. He'd    you can tickle him. When I put my hand up   Ha  ha  ha  ha  and that's how we sold him. And Hasbro actually said  I meant Tiger Electronics at the time  said   Yeah  we want to do this. We have  you know     weeks or something to Toy Fair  and we're going to hire you guys to do this.  And so Dave and I got working. Mostly me  because it was all mechanics at this point. So now I have to really figure out all kinds of stuff I don't know how to do. And I started working with Solid Works and a whole other group to do that. And we started    this was way back before there was really much SLA going on  not a lot of rapid prototyping. We certainly didn't have the money to do this. They only paid me  like  a little bit of money to do this  so I had to call a friend of a friend who was running the GM prototype plant  SLA plant  that was down. And they said   Yeah  well  we'll run them.  So they ran all the shells for us  which was nice of them. And the cams I got cut at Hewlett Packard. We snuck in on the weekend. And so we just had a disc of the files. But they have a closed system  so you couldn't print the things out on the machine. So we actually printed them out on clear and taped them on the monitors. And on the weekend we ran the parts for that. So this is how they come out close to the end. And then they looked like little Garfields there. Eight months later    you may remember this  this was a    total  total  total chaos. For a while  they were making two million Furbys a month. They actually wound up doing about    million Furbys. I    it's unbelievable how    I don't know how that can be. And Hasbro made about  you know  a billion and a half dollars. And I just a little bit on each one. So full circle    why do I do this  Why do you  you know  try to do this stuff  And it's  of course  for your kids. And there's my youngest daughter with her Furbys. And she still actually has those. So I kind of retired  and we're already living in paradise up in Boise  on a river  you know. So and then I started another company called Toy Innovation and we did some projects with Mattel with actually with a lady who's here  Ivy Ross  and we did Miracle Moves Baby  made it in Wired magazine  did a bunch of other stuff. And then I started another company. We did a little hand held device for teens that could hook up to the Internet  won  Best Innovations  at CES  but really I kind of slowed down and said  OK  I just ... After a while  I had this old tape of this dinosaur  and I gave it to this guy  and this other guy saw it  and then people started to want to do it. And they said they'd spend all this time. So I said   OK  let's try to do this dinosaur project.  The crazy idea is we're going to try to clone a dinosaur as much as we can with today's technology. And it's not really    but as close as we can do. And we're going to try to really pull this off  intentfully try to make something that seems like it's alive. Not a robot that kind of does  but let's really go for it. So I picked a Camarasaurus  because the Camarasaurus was the most abundant of the sauropods in North America. And you could actually find full fossil evidence of these. That's a juvenile. And so we actually went in. There's a book called  Walking on Eggshells   where they found actual sauropod skin in Patagonia. And the picture from the book  so when I    I told the sculptor to use this bump pattern  whatever you can to copy that. Very  very obsessive. There's a kind of truncated Camarasaurus skeleton  but the geometry's correct. And then I went in  and measured all the geometry because I figured  hey  biomimicry. If I do it kind of right  it might move kind of like the real thing. So there's the motor. And about this time  you know  all these other people are starting to help. Here's an example of what we did with the skull. There's the skull  there's my drawing of a skull. There's kind of the skin version of the soft tissue. There's the mechanism that would go in there  kind of a Geneva drive. There's some Solid Works versions of it. Here's some SLA parts of the same thing. And then  these are really crude pieces. We were just doing some tests here. There's the skull  pretty much the same shape as the Camarasaurus. There's a photorealistic eye behind a lens. And there's kind of the first exploded view  or see through view. There's the first SLA version  and it already kind of has the feel  it has kind of a cuteness already. And the thing about blending science and art in this multidisciplinary stuff is you can do a robot  and then you go back and do the shape  and then you go back and forth. The servos in the front legs  we had to shape those like muscles. They had to fit within the envelope. There was a tremendous amount of work to get all that working right. All the neck and the tail are cable  so it moves smoothly and organically. And then  of course  you're not done yet. You have to get the look for the skin. The skin's a whole another thing  probably the hardest part. So you hire artists  and you try to get the look and feel of the character. Now  this is not    we're character designers  right  And we're still trying to keep with the real character. So  now you go back and you cover the whole thing with clay. Now you start doing the sculpture for this. And you can see we got a guy from    who's just a fanatic about dinosaurs to do the sculpting for us  down to the spoon shaped teeth and everything. And then more sculpting  and then more sculpting  and then more sculpting  and then more sculpting. And then  four years and    million dollars later  we have a little Pleo. John  do you want to bring him up  John Sosoka is our CTO  and is really the man that's done most of the work with our    person company. I'd like to give John a hand. He never gets recognition. This is John Sosoka. So  thank you  John  thank you  and get back to work  all right  man  All right       no  it's very painful  so       these are little Pleos and you can probably see them. This    I on purpose    they go through life stages. So when you first get them  they're babies. And you    more you have them  kind of the older they get  and they kind of learn through their behavior. So this one  this one's actually asleep  and    hang on. Pleo  wake up. Pleo  come on. So this guy's listening to my voice here. But they have    sensors all over their body. They have seven processors  they have    motors  they have    but you don't care  do you  They're just cute  right  That's the idea  that's the idea. So you see    hey  come on. Hey  did you feel that  There's something big and loud over here. Hey. That's good  wake up  wake up  wake up. Yeah  they're like kids  you know. You  yeah  yeah. Okay  he's hungry. I'll show you what he's been doing for  for four years. Here  here  here. Have some money  Pleo. There you go. That's what the investors think  that it's just       right  right. So they're really sweet little guys. And we're hoping that    you know  our belief is that humans need to feel empathy towards things in order to be more human. And we think we can help that out by having little creatures that you can love. Now these are not robots  they're kind of lovebots  you know. They do change over time. But mostly they evoke a feeling of caring. And we have a    I have a little something here. Now I do want to say that  you know  Ugobe is not there yet. We've just opened the door  and it's for all of you to step through it. We did include some things that are hopefully useful. Excuse me  Pleo. They    he has a USB and he has a SD card  so it's completely open architecture. So anyone can plug him     Applause     thank you. This is John over here. Anyone can take Pleo and they can totally redo his personality. You can make him bipolar  or as someone said  a    you can change his homeostatic drives  or whatever you want to call them. Kids can just drag and drop  put in new sounds. We    actually  it's very hard to keep people from doing this. We have one animator who's taken it and he's done a take on the Budweiser beer commercial  and they're going   Whassup   you know  You    so it's    yes  he likes that. So they're a handful. We hope you get one. I don't know what I'm missing to say  but as a last thing  I'd like to say is that if we continue along this path  we are designing our children's best friends. And there's a lot of social responsibility in that. That's why Pleo's soft and gentle and loving. And so I just    I hope we all dream well. Thank you. A year ago  I spoke to you about a book that I was just in the process of completing  that has come out in the interim  and I would like to talk to you today about some of the controversies that that book inspired. The book is called  The Blank Slate   based on the popular idea that the human mind is a blank slate  and that all of its structure comes from socialization  culture  parenting  experience. The  blank slate  was an influential idea in the   th century. Here are a few quotes indicating that   Man has no nature   from the historian Jose Ortega y Gasset   Man has no instincts   from the anthropologist Ashley Montagu   The human brain is capable of a full range of behaviors and predisposed to none   from the late scientist Stephen Jay Gould. There are a number of reasons to doubt that the human mind is a blank slate  and some of them just come from common sense. As many people have told me over the years  anyone who's had more than one child knows that kids come into the world with certain temperaments and talents  it doesn't all come from the outside. Oh  and anyone who has both a child and a house pet has surely noticed that the child  exposed to speech  will acquire a human language  whereas the house pet won't  presumably because of some innate different between them. And anyone who's ever been in a heterosexual relationship knows that the minds of men and the minds of women are not indistinguishable. There are also  I think  increasing results from the scientific study of humans that  indeed  we're not born blank slates. One of them  from anthropology  is the study of human universals. If you've ever taken anthropology  you know that it's a    kind of an occupational pleasure of anthropologists to show how exotic other cultures can be  and that there are places out there where  supposedly  everything is the opposite to the way it is here. But if you instead look at what is common to the world's cultures  you find that there is an enormously rich set of behaviors and emotions and ways of construing the world that can be found in all of the world's       odd cultures. The anthropologist Donald Brown has tried to list them all  and they range from aesthetics  affection and age statuses all the way down to weaning  weapons  weather  attempts to control  the color white and a worldview. Also  genetics and neuroscience are increasingly showing that the brain is intricately structured. This is a recent study by the neurobiologist Paul Thompson and his colleagues in which they    using MRI    measured the distribution of gray matter    that is  the outer layer of the cortex    in a large sample of pairs of people. They coded correlations in the thickness of gray matter in different parts of the brain using a false color scheme  in which no difference is coded as purple  and any color other than purple indicates a statistically significant correlation. Well  this is what happens when you pair people up at random. By definition  two people picked at random can't have correlations in the distribution of gray matter in the cortex. This is what happens in people who share half of their DNA    fraternal twins. And as you can see  large amounts of the brain are not purple  showing that if one person has a thicker bit of cortex in that region  so does his fraternal twin. And here's what happens if you get a pair of people who share all their DNA    namely  clones or identical twins. And you can see huge areas of cortex where there are massive correlations in the distribution of gray matter. Now  these aren't just differences in anatomy  like the shape of your ear lobes  but they have consequences in thought and behavior that are well illustrated in this famous cartoon by Charles Addams   Separated at birth  the Mallifert twins meet accidentally.  As you can see  there are two inventors with identical contraptions in their lap  meeting in the waiting room of a patent attorney. Now  the cartoon is not such an exaggeration  because studies of identical twins who were separated at birth and then tested in adulthood show that they have astonishing similarities. And this happens in every pair of identical twins separated at birth ever studied    but much less so with fraternal twins separated at birth. My favorite example is a pair of twins  one of whom was brought up as a Catholic in a Nazi family in Germany  the other brought up in a Jewish family in Trinidad. When they walked into the lab in Minnesota  they were wearing identical navy blue shirts with epaulettes  both of them liked to dip buttered toast in coffee  both of them kept rubber bands around their wrists  both of them flushed the toilet before using it as well as after  and both of them liked to surprise people by sneezing in crowded elevators to watch them jump. Now    the story might seem to good to be true  but when you administer batteries of psychological tests  you get the same results    namely  identical twins separated at birth show quite astonishing similarities. Now  given both the common sense and scientific data calling the doctrine of the blank slate into question  why should it have been such an appealing notion  Well  there are a number of political reasons why people have found it congenial. The foremost is that if we're blank slates  then  by definition  we are equal  because zero equals zero equals zero. But if something is written on the slate  then some people could have more of it than others  and according to this line of thinking  that would justify discrimination and inequality. Another political fear of human nature is that if we are blank slates  we can perfect mankind    the age old dream of the perfectibility of our species through social engineering. Whereas  if we're born with certain instincts  then perhaps some of them might condemn us to selfishness  prejudice and violence. Well  in the book  I argue that these are  in fact  non sequiturs. And just to make a long story short  first of all  the concept of fairness is not the same as the concept of sameness. And so when Thomas Jefferson wrote in the Declaration of Independence   We hold these truths to be self evident  that all men are created equal   he did not mean  We hold these truths to be self evident  that all men are clones.  Rather  that all men are equal in terms of their rights  and that every person ought to be treated as an individual  and not prejudged by the statistics of particular groups that they may belong to. Also  even if we were born with certain ignoble motives  they don't automatically lead to ignoble behavior. That is because the human mind is a complex system with many parts  and some of them can inhibit others. For example  there's excellent reason to believe that virtually all humans are born with a moral sense  and that we have cognitive abilities that allow us to profit from the lessons of history. So even if people did have impulses towards selfishness or greed  that's not the only thing in the skull  and there are other parts of the mind that can counteract them. In the book  I go over controversies such as this one  and a number of other hot buttons  hot zones  Chernobyls  third rails  and so on    including the arts  cloning  crime  free will  education  evolution  gender differences  God  homosexuality  infanticide  inequality  Marxism  morality  Nazism  parenting  politics  race  rape  religion  resource depletion  social engineering  technological risk and war. And needless to say  there were certain risks in taking on these subjects. When I wrote a first draft of the book  I circulated it to a number of colleagues for comments  and here are some of the reactions that I got   Better get a security camera for your house.   Don't expect to get any more awards  job offers or positions in scholarly societies.   Tell your publisher not to list your hometown in your author bio.   Do you have tenure   Well  the book came out in October  and nothing terrible has happened. I    I like    There was indeed reason to be nervous  and there were moments in which I did feel nervous  knowing the history of what has happened to people who've taken controversial stands or discovered disquieting findings in the behavioral sciences. There are many cases  some of which I talk about in the book  of people who have been slandered  called Nazis  physically assaulted  threatened with criminal prosecution for stumbling across or arguing about controversial findings. And you never know when you're going to come across one of these booby traps. My favorite example is a pair of psychologists who did research on left handers  and published some data showing that left handers are  on average  more susceptible to disease  more prone to accidents and have a shorter lifespan. It's not clear  by the way  since then  whether that is an accurate generalization  but the data at the time seemed to support that. Well  pretty soon they were barraged with enraged letters  death threats  ban on the topic in a number of scientific journals  coming from irate left handers and their advocates  and they were literally afraid to open their mail because of the venom and vituperation that they had inadvertently inspired. Well  the night is young  but the book has been out for half a year  and nothing terrible has happened. None of the dire professional consequences has taken place    I haven't been exiled from the city of Cambridge. But what I wanted to talk about are two of these hot buttons that have aroused the strongest response in the    odd reviews that The Blank Slate has received. I'll just put that list up for a few seconds  and see if you can guess which two    I would estimate that probably two of these topics inspired probably    percent of the reaction in the various reviews and radio interviews. It's not violence and war  it's not race  it's not gender  it's not Marxism  it's not Nazism. They are  the arts and parenting. So let me tell you what aroused such irate responses  and I'll let you decide if whether they    the claims are really that outrageous. Let me start with the arts. I note that among the long list of human universals that I presented a few slides ago are art. There is no society ever discovered in the remotest corner of the world that has not had something that we would consider the arts. Visual arts    decoration of surfaces and bodies    appears to be a human universal. The telling of stories  music  dance  poetry    found in all cultures  and many of the motifs and themes that give us pleasure in the arts can be found in all human societies  a preference for symmetrical forms  the use of repetition and variation  even things as specific as the fact that in poetry all over the world  you have lines that are very close to three seconds long  separated by pauses. Now  on the other hand  in the second half of the   th century  the arts are frequently said to be in decline. And I have a collection  probably    or    headlines  from highbrow magazines deploring the fact that the arts are in decline in our time. I'll give you a couple of representative quotes   We can assert with some confidence that our own period is one of decline  that the standards of culture are lower than they were    years ago  and that the evidences of this decline are visible in every department of human activity.  That's a quote from T. S. Eliot  a little more than    years ago. And a more recent one   The possibility of sustaining high culture in our time is becoming increasing problematical. Serious book stores are losing their franchise  nonprofit theaters are surviving primarily by commercializing their repertory  symphony orchestras are diluting their programs  public television is increasing its dependence on reruns of British sitcoms  classical radio stations are dwindling  museums are resorting to blockbuster shows  dance is dying.  That's from Robert Brustein  the famous drama critic and director  in The New Republic about five years ago. Well  in fact  the arts are not in decline. I don't think this will as a surprise to anyone in this room  but by any standard they have never been flourishing to a greater extent. There are  of course  entirely new art forms and new media  many of which you've heard over these few days. By any economic standard  the demand for art of all forms is skyrocketing  as you can tell from the price of opera tickets  by the number of books sold  by the number of books published  the number of musical titles released  the number of new albums and so on. The only grain of truth to this complaint that the arts are in decline come from three spheres. One of them is in elite art since the     s    say  the kinds of works performed by major symphony orchestras  where most of the repertory is before       or the works shown in major galleries and prestigious museums. In literary criticism and analysis  probably    or    years ago  literary critics were a kind of cultural hero  now they're kind of a national joke. And the humanities and arts programs in the universities  which by many measures  indeed are in decline. Students are staying away in droves  universities are disinvesting in the arts and humanities. Well  here's a diagnosis. They didn't ask me  but by their own admission  they need all the help that they can get. And I would like to suggest that it's not a coincidence that this supposed decline in the elite arts and criticism occurred in the same point in history in which there was a widespread denial of human nature. A famous quotation can be found    if you look on the web  you can find it in literally scores of English core syllabuses     In or about December       human nature changed.  A paraphrase of a quote by Virginia Woolf  and there's some debate as to what she actually meant by that. But it's very clear  looking at these syllabuses  that    it's used now as a way of saying that all forms of appreciation of art that were in place for centuries  or millennia  in the   th century were discarded. The beauty and pleasure in art    probably a human universal    were    began to be considered saccharine  or kitsch  or commercial. Barnett Newman had a famous quote that  the impulse of modern art is the desire to destroy beauty     which was considered bourgeois or tacky. And here's just one example. I mean  this is perhaps a representative example of the visual depiction of the female form in the   th century  here is a representative example of the depiction of the female form in the   th century. And  as you can see  there    something has changed in the way the elite arts appeal to the senses. Indeed  in movements of modernism and post modernism  there was visual art without beauty  literature without narrative and plot  poetry without meter and rhyme  architecture and planning without ornament  human scale  green space and natural light  music without melody and rhythm  and criticism without clarity  attention to aesthetics and insight into the human condition. Let me give just you an example to back up that last statement. But here  there    one of the most famous literary English scholars of our time is the Berkeley professor  Judith Butler. And here is an example of one of her analyses   The move from a structuralist account in which capital is understood to structure social relations in relatively homologous ways to a view of hegemony in which power relations are subject to repetition  convergence and rearticulation brought the question of temporality into the thinking of structure  and marked a shift from the form of Althusserian theory that takes structural totalities as theoretical objects ...  Well  you get the idea. By the way  this is one sentence    you can actually parse it. Well  the argument in  The Blank Slate  was that elite art and criticism in the   th century  although not the arts in general  have disdained beauty  pleasure  clarity  insight and style. People are staying away from elite art and criticism. What a puzzle    I wonder why. Well  this turned out to be probably the most controversial claim in the book. Someone asked me whether I stuck it in in order to deflect ire from discussions of gender and Nazism and race and so on. I won't comment on that. But it certainly inspired an energetic reaction from many university professors. Well  the other hot button is parenting. And the starting point is the    for that discussion was the fact that we have all been subject to the advice of the parenting industrial complex. Now  here is    here is a representative quote from a besieged mother   I'm overwhelmed with parenting advice. I'm supposed to do lots of physical activity with my kids so I can instill in them a physical fitness habit so they'll grow up to be healthy adults. And I'm supposed to do all kinds of intellectual play so they'll grow up smart. And there are all kinds of play    clay for finger dexterity  word games for reading success  large motor play  small motor play. I feel like I could devote my life to figuring out what to play with my kids.  I think anyone who's recently been a parent can sympathize with this mother. Well  here's some sobering facts about parenting. Most studies of parenting on which this advice is based are useless. They're useless because they don't control for heritability. They measure some correlation between what the parents do  how the children turn out and assume a causal relation  that the parenting shaped the child. Parents who talk a lot to their kids have kids who grow up to be articulate  parents who spank their kids have kids who grow up to be violent and so on. And very few of them control for the possibility that parents pass on genes for    that increase the chances a child will be articulate or violent and so on. Until the studies are redone with adoptive children  who provide an environment but not genes to their kids  we have no way of knowing whether these conclusions are valid. The genetically controlled studies have some sobering results. Remember the Mallifert twins  separated at birth  then they meet in the patent office    remarkably similar. Well  what would have happened if the Mallifert twins had grown up together  You might think  well  then they'd be even more similar  because not only would they share their genes  but they would also share their environment. That would make them super similar  right  Wrong. Identical twins  or any siblings  who are separated at birth are no less similar than if they had grown up together. Everything that happens to you in a given home over all of those years appears to leave no permanent stamp on your personality or intellect. A complementary finding  from a completely different methodology  is that adopted siblings reared together    the mirror image of identical twins reared apart  they share their parents  their home  their neighborhood  don't share their genes    end up not similar at all. OK    two different bodies of research with a similar finding. What it suggests is that children are shaped not by their parents over the long run  but in part    only in part    by their genes  in part by their culture    the culture of the country at large and the children's own culture  namely their peer group    as we heard from Jill Sobule earlier today  that's what kids care about    and  to a very large extent  larger than most people are prepared to acknowledge  by chance  chance events in the wiring of the brain in utero  chance events as you live your life. So let me conclude with just a remark to bring it back to the theme of choices. I think that the sciences of human nature    behavioral genetics  evolutionary psychology  neuroscience  cognitive science    are going to  increasingly in the years to come  upset various dogmas  careers and deeply held political belief systems. And that presents us with a choice. The choice is whether certain facts about humans  or topics  are to be considered taboos  forbidden knowledge  where we shouldn't go there because no good can come from it  or whether we should explore them honestly. I have my own answer to that question  which comes from a great artist of the   th century  Anton Chekhov  who said   Man will become better when you show him what he is like.  And I think that the argument can't be put any more eloquently than that. Thank you very much. What I want to tell you about today is how I see robots invading our lives at multiple levels  over multiple timescales. And when I look out in the future  I can't imagine a world      years from now  where we don't have robots everywhere. Assuming    despite all the dire predictions from many people about our future    assuming we're still around  I can't imagine the world not being populated with robots. And then the question is  well  if they're going to be here in     years  are they going to be everywhere sooner than that  Are they going to be around in    years  Yeah  I think that's pretty likely    there's going to be lots of robots everywhere. And in fact I think that's going to be a lot sooner than that. I think we're sort of on the cusp of robots becoming common  and I think we're sort of around      or      in personal computer years  where the first few robots are starting to appear. Computers sort of came around through games and toys. And you know  the first computer most people had in the house may have been a computer to play Pong  a little microprocessor embedded  and then other games that came after that. And we're starting to see that same sort of thing with robots  LEGO Mindstorms  Furbies    who here    did anyone here have a Furby  Yeah  there's    million of them sold worldwide. They are pretty common. And they're a little tiny robot  a simple robot with some sensors  a little bit of processing actuation. On the right there is another robot doll  who you could get a couple of years ago. And just as in the early days  when there was a lot of sort of amateur interaction over computers  you can now get various hacking kits  how to hack books. And on the left there is a platform from Evolution Robotics  where you put a PC on  and you program this thing with a GUI to wander around your house and do various stuff. And then there's a higher price point sort of robot toys    the Sony Aibo. And on the right there  is one that the NEC developed  the PaPeRo  which I don't think they're going to release. But nevertheless  those sorts of things are out there. And we've seen  over the last two or three years  lawn mowing robots  Husqvarna on the bottom  Friendly Robotics on top there  an Israeli company. And then in the last    months or so we've started to see a bunch of home cleaning robots appear. The top left one is a very nice home cleaning robot from a company called Dyson  in the U.K. Except it was so expensive          dollars    they didn't release it. But at the bottom left  you see Electrolux  which is on sale. Another one from Karcher. At the bottom right is one that I built in my lab about    years ago  and we finally turned that into a product. And let me just show you that. We're going to give this away I think  Chris said  after the talk. This is a robot that you can go out and buy  and that will clean up your floor. And it starts off sort of just going around in ever increasing circles. If it hits something    you people see that  Now it's doing wall following  it's following around my feet to clean up around me. Let's see  let's    oh  who stole my Rice Krispies  They stole my Rice Krispies  Don't worry  relax  no  relax  it's a robot  it's smart  See  the three year old kids  they don't worry about it. It's grown ups that get really upset. We'll just put some crap here. Okay. I don't know if you see    so  I put a bunch of Rice Krispies there  I put some pennies  let's just shoot it at that  see if it cleans up. Yeah  OK. So    we'll leave that for later. Part of the trick was building a better cleaning mechanism  actually  the intelligence on board was fairly simple. And that's true with a lot of robots. We've all  I think  become  sort of computational chauvinists  and think that computation is everything  but the mechanics still matter. Here's another robot  the PackBot  that we've been building for a bunch of years. It's a military surveillance robot  to go in ahead of troops    looking at caves  for instance. But we had to make it fairly robust  much more robust than the robots we build in our labs. On board that robot is a PC running Linux. It can withstand a    G shock. The robot has local intelligence  it can flip itself over  can get itself into communication range  can go upstairs by itself  et cetera. Okay  so it's doing local navigation there. A soldier gives it a command to go upstairs  and it does. That was not a controlled descent. Now it's going to head off. And the big breakthrough for these robots  really  was September   th. We had the robots down at the World Trade Center late that evening. Couldn't do a lot in the main rubble pile  things were just too    there was nothing left to do. But we did go into all the surrounding buildings that had been evacuated  and searched for possible survivors in the buildings that were too dangerous to go into. Let's run this video. Reporter  ...battlefield companions are helping to reduce the combat risks. Nick Robertson has that story. Rodney Brooks  Can we have another one of these  Okay  good. So  this is a corporal who had seen a robot two weeks previously. He's sending robots into caves  looking at what's going on. The robot's being totally autonomous. The worst thing that's happened in the cave so far was one of the robots fell down ten meters. So one year ago  the US military didn't have these robots. Now they're on active duty in Afghanistan every day. And that's one of the reasons they say a robot invasion is happening. There's a sea change happening in how    where technology's going. Thanks. And over the next couple of months  we're going to be sending robots in production down producing oil wells to get that last few years of oil out of the ground. Very hostile environments       C         PSI. Autonomous robots going down  doing this sort of work. But robots like this  they're a little hard to program. How  in the future  are we going to program our robots and make them easier to use  And I want to actually use a robot here    a robot named Chris    stand up. Yeah. Okay. Come over here. Now notice  he thinks robots have to be a bit stiff. He sort of does that. But I'm going to    Chris Anderson  I'm just British. RB  Oh. I'm going to show this robot a task. It's a very complex task. Now notice  he nodded there  he was giving me some indication he was understanding the flow of communication. And if I'd said something completely bizarre he would have looked askance at me  and regulated the conversation. So now I brought this up in front of him. I'd looked at his eyes  and I saw his eyes looked at this bottle top. And I'm doing this task here  and he's checking up. His eyes are going back and forth up to me  to see what I'm looking at    so we've got shared attention. And so I do this task  and he looks  and he looks to me to see what's happening next. And now I'll give him the bottle  and we'll see if he can do the task. Can you do that  Okay. He's pretty good. Yeah. Good  good  good. I didn't show you how to do that. Now see if you can put it back together. And he thinks a robot has to be really slow. Good robot  that's good. So we saw a bunch of things there. We saw when we're interacting  we're trying to show someone how to do something  we direct their visual attention. The other thing communicates their internal state to us  whether he's understanding or not  regulates a social interaction. There was shared attention looking at the same sort of thing  and recognizing socially communicated reinforcement at the end. And we've been trying to put that into our lab robots because we think this is how you're going to want to interact with robots in the future. I just want to show you one technical diagram here. The most important thing for building a robot that you can interact with socially is its visual attention system. Because what it pays attention to is what it's seeing and interacting with  and what you're understanding what it's doing. So in the videos I'm about to show you  you're going to see a visual attention system on a robot which has    it looks for skin tone in HSV space  so it works across all human colorings. It looks for highly saturated colors  from toys. And it looks for things that move around. And it weights those together into an attention window  and it looks for the highest scoring place    the stuff where the most interesting stuff is happening    and that is what its eyes then segue to. And it looks right at that. At the same time  some top down sort of stuff  might decide that it's lonely and look for skin tone  or might decide that it's bored and look for a toy to play with. And so these weights change. And over here on the right  this is what we call the Steven Spielberg memorial module. Did people see the movie  AI    Audience  Yes.  RB  Yeah  it was really bad  but    remember  especially when Haley Joel Osment  the little robot  looked at the blue fairy for       years without taking his eyes off it  Well  this gets rid of that  because this is a habituation Gaussian that gets negative  and more and more intense as it looks at one thing. And it gets bored  so it will then look away at something else. So  once you've got that    and here's a robot  here's Kismet  looking around for a toy. You can tell what it's looking at. You can estimate its gaze direction from those eyeballs covering its camera  and you can tell when it's actually seeing the toy. And it's got a little bit of an emotional response here. But it's still going to pay attention if something more significant comes into its field of view    such as Cynthia Breazeal  the builder of this robot  from the right. It sees her  pays attention to her. Kismet has an underlying  three dimensional emotional space  a vector space  of where it is emotionally. And at different places in that space  it expresses    can we have the volume on here  Can you hear that now  out there   Audience  Yeah.  Kismet  Do you really think so  Do you really think so  Do you really think so  RB  So it's expressing its emotion through its face and the prosody in its voice. And when I was dealing with my robot over here  Chris  the robot  was measuring the prosody in my voice  and so we have the robot measure prosody for four basic messages that mothers give their children pre linguistically. Here we've got naive subjects praising the robot  Voice  Nice robot. You're such a cute little robot. RB  And the robot's reacting appropriately. Voice  ...very good  Kismet. Voice  Look at my smile. RB  It smiles. She imitates the smile. This happens a lot. These are naive subjects. Here we asked them to get the robot's attention and indicate when they have the robot's attention. Voice  Hey  Kismet  ah  there it is. RB  So she realizes she has the robot's attention. Voice  Kismet  do you like the toy  Oh. RB  Now  here they're asked to prohibit the robot  and this first woman really pushes the robot into an emotional corner. Voice  No. No. You're not to do that. No. Not appropriate. No. No. RB  I'm going to leave it at that. We put that together. Then we put in turn taking. When we talk to someone  we talk. Then we sort of raise our eyebrows  move our eyes  give the other person the idea it's their turn to talk. And then they talk  and then we pass the baton back and forth between each other. So we put this in the robot. We got a bunch of naive subjects in  we didn't tell them anything about the robot  sat them down in front of the robot and said  talk to the robot. Now what they didn't know was  the robot wasn't understanding a word they said  and that the robot wasn't speaking English. It was just saying random English phonemes. And I want you to watch carefully  at the beginning of this  where this person  Ritchie  who happened to talk to the robot for    minutes       says   I want to show you something. I want to show you my watch.  And he brings the watch center  into the robot's field of vision  points to it  gives it a motion cue  and the robot looks at the watch quite successfully. We don't know whether he understood or not that the robot    Notice the turn taking. Ritchie  OK  I want to show you something. OK  this is a watch that my girlfriend gave me. Robot  Oh  cool. Ritchie  Yeah  look  it's got a little blue light in it too. I almost lost it this week. RB  So it's making eye contact with him  following his eyes. Ritchie  Can you do the same thing  Robot  Yeah  sure. RB  And they successfully have that sort of communication. And here's another aspect of the sorts of things that Chris and I were doing. This is another robot  Cog. They first make eye contact  and then  when Christie looks over at this toy  the robot estimates her gaze direction and looks at the same thing that she's looking at. So we're going to see more and more of this sort of robot over the next few years in labs. But then the big questions  two big questions that people ask me are  if we make these robots more and more human like  will we accept them  will we    will they need rights eventually  And the other question people ask me is  will they want to take over  And on the first    you know  this has been a very Hollywood theme with lots of movies. You probably recognize these characters here    where in each of these cases  the robots want more respect. Well  do you ever need to give robots respect  They're just machines  after all. But I think  you know  we have to accept that we are just machines. After all  that's certainly what modern molecular biology says about us. You don't see a description of how  you know  Molecule A  you know  comes up and docks with this other molecule. And it's moving forward  you know  propelled by various charges  and then the soul steps in and tweaks those molecules so that they connect. It's all mechanistic. We are mechanism. If we are machines  then in principle at least  we should be able to build machines out of other stuff  which are just as alive as we are. But I think for us to admit that  we have to give up on our special ness  in a certain way. And we've had the retreat from special ness under the barrage of science and technology many times over the last few hundred years  at least.     years ago we had to give up the idea that we are the center of the universe when the earth started to go around the sun      years ago  with Darwin  we had to give up the idea we were different from animals. And to imagine    you know  it's always hard for us. Recently we've been battered with the idea that maybe we didn't even have our own creation event  here on earth  which people didn't like much. And then the human genome said  maybe we only have        genes. And that was really    people didn't like that  we've got more genes than that. We don't like to give up our special ness  so  you know  having the idea that robots could really have emotions  or that robots could be living creatures    I think is going to be hard for us to accept. But we're going to come to accept it over the next    years or so. And the second question is  will the machines want to take over  And here the standard scenario is that we create these things  they grow  we nurture them  they learn a lot from us  and then they start to decide that we're pretty boring  slow. They want to take over from us. And for those of you that have teenagers  you know what that's like. But Hollywood extends it to the robots. And the question is  you know  will someone accidentally build a robot that takes over from us  And that's sort of like this lone guy in the backyard  you know     I accidentally built a    .  I don't think that's going to happen. And I don't think       I don't think we're going to deliberately build robots that we're uncomfortable with. We'll    you know  they're not going to have a super bad robot. Before that has to come to be a mildly bad robot  and before that a not so bad robot. And we're just not going to let it go that way. So  I think I'm going to leave it at that  the robots are coming  we don't have too much to worry about  it's going to be a lot of fun  and I hope you all enjoy the journey over the next    years. I was here about four years ago  talking about the relationship of design and happiness. At the very end of it  I showed a list under that title. I learned very few things in addition since but made a whole number of them into projects since. These are inflatable monkeys in every city in Scotland   Everybody always thinks they are right.  They were combined in the media.  Drugs are fun in the beginning but become a drag later on.  We're doing changing media. This is a projection that can see the viewer as the viewer walks by. You can't help but actually ripping that spider web apart. All of these things are pieces of graphic design. We do them for our clients. They are commissioned. I would never have the money to actually pay for the installment or pay for all the billboards or the production of these  so there's always a client attached to them. These are        coat hangers in a street that's lined with fashion stores.  Worrying solves nothing.   Money does not make me happy  appeared first as double page spreads in a magazine. The printer lost the file  didn't tell us. When the magazine    actually  when I got the subscription    it was    following pages. It said   Money does does make me happy.  And a friend of mine in Austria felt so sorry for me that he talked the largest casino owner in Linz into letting us wrap his building. So this is the big pedestrian zone in Linz. It just says  Money   and if you look down the side street  it says   does not make me happy.  We had a show that just came down last week in New York. We steamed up the windows permanently  and every hour we had a different designer come in and write these things that they've learned into the steam in the window. Everybody participated    Milton Glaser  Massimo Vignelli. Singapore was quite in discussion. This is a little spot that we filmed there that's to be displayed on the large JumboTrons in Singapore. And  of course  it's one that's dear to my heart  because all of these sentiments    some banal  some a bit more profound    all originally had come out of my diary. And I do go often into the diary and check if I wanted to change something about the situation. If it's    see it for a long enough time  I actually do something about it. And the very last one is a billboard. This is our roof in New York  the roof of the studio. This is newsprint plus stencils that lie on the newsprint. We let that lie around in the sun. As you all know  newsprint yellows significantly in the sun. After a week  we took the stencils and the leaves off  shipped the newsprints to Lisbon to a very sunny spot  so on day one the billboard said   Complaining is silly. Either act or forget.  Three days later it faded  and a week later  no more complaining anywhere. Thank you so much. I want to argue to you that in fact  politics and religion  which are the two primary factors    not the sole  but overwhelmingly  the primary factors    which are driving towards a war which looks extremely likely    bordering on the inevitable at this point  whether one is in favor of that or not    that politics and religion are  in fact  themselves better conceptualized as kinds of technology  and subject to kinds of questions that we regularly consider in the space of conceptual design. Here's what I mean. Politics and    let's focus on the political system in particular question here  which is the system of democracy. Democracy  as a type of politics  is a technology for the control and deployment of power. You can deploy power in a wide range of ways. The famous ones    despotism is a good one  anarchy is a way to not deploy the power in any organized way  to do it in a radically diffused fashion  and democracy is a set of technologies  which have the effect of  in principle  diffusing the power source to a large number of people and then re concentrating it in a smaller group of people who govern  and who themselves are  in principle  authorized to govern by virtue of what the broader public has done. Now  consider religion    in this case Islam  which is the religion that  in some direct sense  can be said to be precipitating what we're about to enter. Let me say parenthetically why I think that's the case  because I think it's a potentially controversial statement. I would put it in the following equation  no       no war. At the beginning of the Bush administration  when President Bush  now President Bush  was running for president  he made it very clear that he was not interested in intervening broadly in the world. In fact  the trend was for disengagement with the rest of the world. That's why we heard about the backing away from the Kyoto protocol  for example. After       the tables were turned. And the president decided  with his advisors  to undertake some kind of an active intervention in the world around us. That began with Afghanistan  and when Afghanistan went extremely smoothly and quickly  a decision was made through the technology of democracy    again  notice  not a perfect technology    but through the technology of democracy that this administration was going to push in the direction of another war    this time  a war in Iraq. Now  the reason I begin by saying  no       no war  is that we have to acknowledge that Islam  as interpreted by a very  very small  extremely radical group of people  was a precipitating cause of the      attacks    the precipitating cause of the      attacks    and as a consequence  at one degree of remove  the precipitating cause of the coming war that we're about to be engaged in. And I would add that bin Laden and his followers are consciously devoted to the goal of creating a conflict between democracy  or at least capitalist democracy  on the one hand  and the world of Islam as they see and define it. Now  how is Islam a technology in this conceptual apparatus  Well  it's a technology for  first  salvation in its most basic sense. It's meant to be a mechanism for construing the universe in a way that will bring about the salvation of the individual believer  but it's also meant by the Islamists    and I use that term to mean people who believe that Islam    they follow the slogan  Islam is the answer to a wide range of questions  whether they're social  or political  or personal  or spiritual. Within the sphere of people who have that view  and it's a large number of people in the Muslim world who disagree with bin Laden in his application  but agree that Islam is the answer. Islam represents a way of engaging the world through which one can achieve certain desirable goals. And the goals from the perspective of Muslims are  in principle  peace  justice and equality  but on terms that correspond to traditional Muslim teachings. Now  I don't want to leave a misimpression by identifying either of these propositions    rather  either of these phenomena  democracy or Islam    as technologies. I don't want to suggest that they are a single thing that you can point to. And I think a good way to prove this is simply to demonstrate to you what my thought process was when deciding what to put on the wall behind me when I spoke. And I ran immediately into a conceptual problem  you can't show a picture of democracy. You can show a slogan  or a symbol  or a sign that stands for democracy. You can show the Capitol    I had the same problem when I was designing the cover of my forthcoming book  in fact    what do you put on the cover to show democracy  And the same problem with respect to Islam. You can show a mosque  or you can show worshippers  but there's not a straightforward way of depicting Islam. That's because these are the kinds of concepts that are not susceptible to easy representation. Now  it follows from that  that they're deeply contestable. It follows from that that all of the people in the world who say that they are Muslims can  in principle  subscribe to a wide range of different interpretations of what Islam really is  and the same is true of democracy. In other words  unlike the word hope  which one could look up in a dictionary and derive origins for  and  perhaps  reach some kind of a consensual use analysis  these are essentially contested concepts. They're ideas about which people disagree in the deepest possible sense. And as a consequence of this disagreement  it's very  very difficult for anyone to say   I have the right version of Islam.  You know  post       we were treated to the amazing phenomenon of George W. Bush saying   Islam means peace.  Well  so says George W. Bush. Other people would say it means something else. Some people would say that Islam means submission. Other people would say it means an acknowledgement or recognition of God's sovereignty. There are a wide range of different things that Islam can mean. And ostensibly  the same is true of democracy. Some people say that democracy consists basically in elections. Other people say no  that's not enough  there have to be basic liberal rights  free speech  free press  equality of citizens. These are contested points  and it's impossible to answer them by saying   Ah ha  I looked in the right place  and I found out what these concepts mean.  Now  if Islam and democracy are at present in a moment of great confrontation  what does that mean  Well  you could fit it into a range of different interpretative frameworks. You could begin with the one that we began with a couple of days ago  which was fear. Fear is not an implausible reaction with a war just around the corner and with a very  very high likelihood that many  many people are going to die as a consequence of this confrontation    a confrontation which many  many people in the Muslim world do not want  many  many people in the American democracy do not want  many people elsewhere in the world do not want  but which nonetheless is favored by a large enough number of people    at least in the relevant space  which is the United States    to actually go forward. So fear is not a crazy response at all. And I think that that's  in fact  probably the first appropriate response. What I want to suggest to you  though  in the next couple of minutes is that there's also a hopeful response to this. And the hopeful response derives from recognizing that Islam and democracy are technologies. And by virtue of being technologies  they're manipulable. And they're manipulable in ways that can produce some extremely positive outcomes. What do I have in mind  Well  all over the Muslim world there are people who take Islam deeply seriously  people who care about Islam  for whom it's a source either of faith  or of civilization  or of deep values  or just a source of powerful personal identity  who think and are saying loudly that Islam and democracy are in fact not in conflict  but are in fact deeply compatible. And these Muslims    and it's the vast majority of Muslims    disagree profoundly with bin Laden's approach  profoundly. And they furthermore think overwhelmingly    again one can't speak of every person  but overwhelmingly  and one can find this by reading any of the sources that they have produced  and they're all over the Internet and in all sorts of languages    one can see that they're saying that their concern in their own countries is primarily to free up themselves to have choice in the spheres of personal life  in the sphere of economics  in the sphere of politics  and  yes  in the sphere of religion  which is itself closely regulated in most of the Muslim world. And many of these Muslims further say that their disagreement with the United States is that it  in the past and still in the present  has sided with autocratic rulers in the Muslim world in order to promote America's short term interests. Now  during the Cold War  that may have been a defensible position for the United States to take. That's an academic question. It may be that there was a great war to be fought between West and East  and it was necessary on the axis of democracy against communism. And it was necessary in some way for these to contradict each other  and as a consequence you have to make friends wherever you can get them. But now that the Cold War is over  there's nearly universal consensus in the Muslim world    and pretty close to the same here in the United States  if you talk to people and ask them    that in principle  there's no reason that democracy and Islam cannot co exist. And we see this among activist  practical Muslims  like the Muslims who are presently the elected  parliamentary  democratic government of Turkey  who are behaving pragmatically  not ideologically  who are promoting their own religious values  who are elected by their own people because they were perceived as honest and sincere because of their religious values  but who do not think that Islam and a democratic system of governance are fundamentally incompatible. Now  you may say  but surely  what we've seen on television about Saudi Islam convinces us that it can't possibly be compatible with what we consider the core of democracy    namely  free political choice  basic liberty and basic equality. But I'm here to tell you that technologies are more malleable than that. I'm here to tell you that many  many Muslims believe    the vast majority  in fact    in fact I think I would go so far as to say that many Muslims in Saudi Arabia believe that the core values of Islam  namely acknowledgement of God's sovereignty and basic human equality before God  are themselves compatible with liberty  equality and free political choice. And there are Muslims  many Muslims out there  who are saying precisely this. And they're making this argument wherever they're permitted to make it. But their governments  needless to say  are relatively threatened by this. And for the most part try to stop them from making this argument. So  for example  a group of young activists in Egypt try to form a party known as the Center Party  which advocated the compatibility of Islam and democracy. They weren't even allowed to form a party. They were actually blocked from even forming a party under the political system there. Why  Because they would have done extraordinarily well. In the most recent elections in the Muslim world    which are those in Pakistan  those in Morocco and those in Turkey    in each case  people who present themselves to the electorate as Islamic democrats were far and away the most successful vote getters every place they were allowed to run freely. So in Morocco  for example  they finished third in the political race but they were only allowed to contest half the seats. So had they contested a larger number of the seats  they would have done even better. Now what I want to suggest to you is that the reason for hope in this case is that we are on the edge of a real transformation in the Muslim world. And that's a transformation in which many sincerely believing Muslims    who care very  very deeply about their traditions  who do not want to compromise those values    believe  through the malleability of the technology of democracy and the malleability and synthetic capability of the technology of Islam  that these two ideas can work together. Now what would that look like  What does it mean to say that there's an Islamic democracy  Well  one thing is  it's not going to look identical to democracy as we know it in the United States. That may be a good thing  in light of some of the criticisms we've heard today    for example  in the regulatory context    of what democracy produces. It will also not look exactly the way either the people in this room  or Muslims out in the rest of the world    I don't mean to imply there aren't Muslims here  there probably are    conceptualize Islam. It will be transformative of Islam as well. And as a result of this convergence  this synthetic attempt to make sense of these two ideas together  there's a real possibility that  instead of a clash of Islamic civilization    if there is such a thing    and democratic civilization    if there is such a thing    we'll in fact have close compatibility. Now  I began with the war because it's the elephant in the room  and you can't pretend that there isn't about to be a war if you're talking about these issues. The war has tremendous risks for the model that I'm describing because it's very possible that as a consequence of a war  many Muslims will conclude that the United States is not the kind of place that they want to emulate with respect to its forms of political government. On the other hand  there's a further possibility that many Americans  swept up in the fever of a war  will say  and feel  and think that Islam is the enemy somehow    that Islam ought to be construed as the enemy. And even though  for political tactical reasons  the president has been very  very good about saying that Islam is not the enemy  nonetheless  there's a natural impulse when one enters war to think of the other side as an enemy. And one furthermore has the impulse to generalize  as much as possible  in defining who that enemy is. So the risks are very great. On the other hand  the capacities for positive results in the aftermath of a war are also not to be underestimated  even by  and I would say especially by  people who are deeply skeptical about whether we should go to war in the first place. Those who oppose the war ought to realize that if a war happens  it cannot be the right strategy  either pragmatically  or spiritually  or morally  to say after the war   Well  let's let it all run itself out  and play out however it wants to play out  because we opposed the war in the first place.  That's not the way human circumstances operate. You face the circumstances you have in front of you and you go forward. Well  what I'm here to say then is  for people who are skeptical about the war  it's especially important to recognize that in the aftermath of the war there is a possibility for the government of the United States and the Muslim peoples with whom it interacts to create real forms of government that are truly democratic and also truly Islamic. And it is crucial    it is crucial in a practical  activist way    for people who care about these issues to make sure that within the technology of democracy  in this system  they exercise their preferences  their choices and their voices to encourage that outcome. That's a hopeful message  but it's a message that's hopeful only if you understand it as incurring serious obligation for all of us. And I think that we are capable of taking on that obligation  but only if we put what we can into it. And if we do  then I don't think that the hope will be unwarranted altogether. Thanks. Aside from keeping the rain out and producing some usable space  architecture is nothing but a special effects machine that delights and disturbs the senses. Our work is across media. The work comes in all shapes and sizes. It's small and large. This is an ashtray  a water glass. From urban planning and master planning to theater and all sorts of stuff. The thing that all the work has in common is that it challenges the assumptions about conventions of space. And these are everyday conventions  conventions that are so obvious that we are blinded by their familiarity. And I've assembled a sampling of work that all share a kind of productive nihilism that's used in the service of creating a particular special effect. And that is something like nothing  or something next to nothing. It's done through a form of subtraction or obstruction or interference in a world that we naturally sleepwalk through. This is an image that won us a competition for an exhibition pavilion for the Swiss Expo      on Lake Neuchatel  near Geneva. And we wanted to use the water not only as a context  but as a primary building material. We wanted to make an architecture of atmosphere. So  no walls  no roof  no purpose    just a mass of atomized water  a big cloud. And this proposal was a reaction to the over saturation of emergent technologies in recent national and world expositions  which feeds  or has been feeding  our insatiable appetite for visual stimulation with an ever greater digital virtuosity. High definition  in our opinion  has become the new orthodoxy. And we ask the question  can we use technology  high technology  to make an expo pavilion that's decidedly low definition  that also challenges the conventions of space and skin  and rethinks our dependence on vision  So this is how we sought to do it. Water's pumped from the lake and is filtered and shot as a fine mist through an array of high pressure fog nozzles         of them. And a weather station is on the structure. It reads the shifting conditions of temperature  humidity  wind direction  wind speed  dew point  and it processes this data in a central computer that calibrates the degree of water pressure and distribution of water throughout. And it's a responsive system that's trained on actual weather. So  this is just in construction  and there's a tensegrity structure. It's about     feet wide  the size of a football field  and it sits on just four very delicate columns. These are the fog nozzles  the interface  and basically the system is kind of reading the real weather  and producing kind of semi artificial and real weather. So  we're very interested in creating weather. I don't know why. Now  here we go  one side  the outside and then from the inside of the space you can see what the quality of the space was. Unlike entering any normal space  entering Blur is like stepping into a habitable medium. It's formless  featureless  depthless  scaleless  massless  purposeless and dimensionless. All references are erased  leaving only an optical whiteout and white noise of the pulsing nozzles. So  this is an exhibition pavilion where there is absolutely nothing to see and nothing to do. And we pride ourselves    it's a spectacular anti spectacle in which all the conventions of spectacle are turned on their head. So  the audience is dispersed  focused attention and dramatic build up and climax are all replaced by a kind of attenuated attention that's sustained by a sense of apprehension caused by the fog. And this is very much like how the Victorian novel used fog in this way. So here the world is put out of focus  while our visual dependence is put into focus. The public  you know  once disoriented can actually ascend to the angel deck above and then just come down under those lips into the water bar. So  all the waters of the world are served there  so we thought that  you know  after being at the water and moving through the water and breathing the water  you could also drink this building. And so it is sort of a theme  but it goes a little bit  you know  deeper than that. We really wanted to bring out our absolute dependence on this master sense  and maybe share our kind of sensibility with our other senses. You know  when we did this project it was a kind of tough sell  because the Swiss said   Well  why are we going to spend  you know     million dollars producing an effect that we already have in natural abundance that we hate   And  you know  we thought    well  we tried to convince them. And in the end  you know  they adapted this as a national icon that came to represent Swiss doubt  which we    you know  it was kind of a meaning machine that everybody kind of laid on their own meanings off of. Anyway  it's a temporary structure that was ultimately destroyed  and so it's now a memory of an apparition  actually  but it continues to live in edible form. And this is the highest honor to be bestowed upon an architect in Switzerland    to have a chocolate bar. Anyway  moving along. So in the '  s and '  s  we were mostly known for independent work  such as installation artist  architect  commissioned projects by museums and non for profit organizations. And we did a lot of media work  also a lot of experimental theater projects. In       the Whitney mounted a retrospective of our work that featured a lot of this work from the '  s and '  s. However  the work itself resisted the very nature of a retrospective  and this is just some of the stuff that was in the show. This was a piece on tourism in the United States. This is  Soft Sell  for   nd Street. This was something done at the Cartier Foundation.  Master Slave  at the MOMA  the project series  a piece called  Parasite.  And so there were many  many of these kinds of projects. Anyway  they gave us the whole fourth floor  and  you know  the problem of the retrospective was something we were very uncomfortable with. It's a kind of invention of the museum that's supposed to bring a kind of cohesive understanding to the public of a body of work. And our work doesn't really resolve itself into a body in any way at all. And one of the recurring themes  by the way  that in the work was a kind of hostility toward the museum itself  and asking about the conventions of the museum  like the wall  the white wall. So  what you see here is basically a plan of many installations that were put there. And we actually had to install white walls to separate these pieces  which didn't belong together. But these white walls became a kind of target and weapon at the same time. We used the wall to partition the    installations of the project and produce a kind of acoustic and visual separation. And what you see is    actually  the red dotted line shows the track of this performing element  which was a new piece that created    that we created for the    which was a robotic drill  basically  that went all the way around  cruised the museum  went all around the walls and did a lot of damage. So  the drill was mounted on this robotic arm. We worked with  by the way  Honeybee Robotics. This is the brain. Honeybee Robotics designed the Mars Driller  and it was really very much fun to work with them. They weren't doing their primary work  which was for the government  while they were helping us with this. In any case  the way it works is that an intelligent navigator basically maps the entire surface of these walls. So  unfolded it's about     linear feet. And it randomly generates points within a three dimensional matrix. It selects a point  it guides the drill to that point  it pierces the dry wall  leaving a half inch hole before traveling to the next location. Initially these holes were lone blemishes  and as the exhibition continued the walls became increasingly perforated. So eventually holes on both sides of the wall aligned  opening views from gallery to gallery. Clusters of holes randomly opened up sections of wall. And so this was a three month performance piece in which the wall was made into kind of an increasingly unstable element. And also the acoustic separation was destroyed. Also the visual separation. And there was also this constant background groan  which was very annoying. And this is one of the blackout spaces where there's a video piece that became totally not useful. So rather than securing a neutral background for the artworks on display  the wall now actively competed for attention. And this acoustical nuisance and visual nuisance basically exposed the discomfort of the work to this encompassing nature of the retrospective. It was really great when it started to break up all of the curatorial text. Moving along to a project that we finished about a year ago. It's the ICA    the Institute of Contemporary Art    in Boston  which is on the waterfront. And there's not enough time to really introduce the building  but I'll simply say that the building negotiates between this outwardly focused nature of the site    you know  it's a really great waterfront site in Boston    and this contradictory other desire to have an inwardly focused museum. So  the nature of the building is that it looks at looking    I mean that's its primary objective  both its program and its architectural conceit. The building incorporates the site  but it dispenses it in very small doses in the way that the museum is choreographed. So  you come in and you're basically squeezed by the theater  by the belly of the theater  into this very compressed space where the view is turned off. Then you come up in this glass elevator right near the curtain wall. This elevator's about the size of a New York City studio apartment. And then  this is a view going up  and then you could come into the theater  which can actually deny the view or open it up and become a backdrop. And many musicians choose to use the theater glass walls totally open. The view is denied in the galleries where we receive just natural light  and then exposed again in the north gallery with a panoramic view. The original intention of this space  which was unfortunately never realized  was to use lenticular glass which allowed only a kind of perpendicular view out. In this very narrow space that connects east and west galleries the intention was really to not get a climax  but to have the view stalk you  so the view would open up as you walked from one end to the other. This was eliminated because the view was too good  and the mayor said   No  we just want this open.  The architect lost here. But culminating    and that's where this hooks into the theme of my little talk    is this Mediatheque  which is suspended from the cantilevered portion of the building. So this is an    foot cantilever    it's quite substantial. So  it's already sticking out into space enough  and then from that is this  is this small area called the Mediatheque. The Mediatheque has something like    stations where the public can get onto the server and look at digital artworks or also curated artworks off the web. And this was really a kind of very important part of this building  and here is a point where architecture    this is like technology free    architecture is only a framing device  it only edits the harbor view  the industrial harbor just through its walls  its floors and its ceiling  to only expose the water itself  the texture of water  much like a hypnotic effect created by electronic snow or a lava lamp or something like that. And here is where we really felt that there was a great convergence of the technological and the natural in the project. But there is just no information  it's just    it's just hypnosis. Moving along to Lincoln Center. These are the guys that did the project in the first place     years ago. We're taking over now  doing work that ranges in scale from small scale repairs to major renovations and major facility expansions. But we're doing it with a lot less testosterone. This is the extent of the work that's to be completed by     . And for the purposes of this talk  I wanted to isolate just a part of a project that's even a part of a project that touches a little bit on this theme of architectural special effects  and it happens to be our current obsession  and it plays a little bit with the purging and adding of distraction. It's Alice Tully Hall  and it's tucked under the Juilliard Building and descends several levels under the street. So  this is the entrance to Tully Hall as it used to be  before the renovation  which we just started. And we asked ourselves  why couldn't it be exhibitionistic  like the Met  or like some of the other buildings at Lincoln Center  And one of the things that we were asked to do was give it a street identity  expand the lobbies and make it visually accessible. And this building  which is just naturally hermetic  we stripped. We basically did a striptease  architectural striptease  where we're framing with this kind of canopy    the underside of three levels of expansion of Juilliard  about        square feet    cutting it to the angle of Broadway  and then exposing  using that canopy to frame Tully Hall. Before and after shot.  Applause  Wait a minute  it's just in that state  we have a long way to go. But what I wanted to do was take a couple of seconds that I have left to just talk about the hall itself  which is kind of where we're really doing a massive amount of work. So  the hall is a multi purpose hall. The clients have asked us to produce a great chamber music hall. Now  that's really tough to do with a hall that has       seats. Chamber and the notion of chamber has to do with salons and small scale performances. They asked us to bring an intimacy. How do you bring an intimacy into a hall  Intimacy for us means a lot of different things. It means acoustic intimacy and it means visual intimacy. One thing is that the subway is running and rumbling right under the hall. Another thing that could be fixed is the shape of the hall. It's like a coffin  it basically sends all the sound  like a gutter ball effect  down the aisles. The walls are made of absorptive surface  half absorptive  half reflective  which is not very good for concert sound. This is Avery Fisher Hall  but the notion of junk    visual junk    was very  very important to us  to get rid of visual noise. Because we can't eliminate a single seat  the architecture is restricted to    inches. So it's a very  very thin architecture. First we do a kind of partial box and box separation  to take away the distraction of the subway noise. Next we wrap the entire hall    almost like this Olivetti keyboard    with a material  with a wood material that basically covers all the surfaces  wall  ceiling  floor  stage  steps  everything  boxes. But it's acoustically engineered to focus the sound into the house and back to the stage. And here's an acoustic shelf. Looking up the hall. Just a section of the stage. Just everything is lined  it incorporates    every single thing that you could possibly imagine is tucked into this high performance skin. But one more added feature. So now that we've stripped the hall of all visual distraction  everything that prevents this intimacy which is supposed to connect the house  the audience  with the performers  we add one little detail  one piece of architectural excess  a special effect  lighting. We very strongly believe that the theatrics of a concert hall is as much in the space of intermission and the space of arrival as it is when the concert starts. So what we wanted to do was produce this effect  this lighting effect  which made us have to bioengineer the wood walls. And what it entails is the use of resin  of this very thick resin with a veneer of the same kind of wood that's used throughout the hall  in a kind of seamless continuity that wraps the hall in light  like a belt of light  rather than separating  like a proscenium would separate the audience from performers  it connects audience with players. And this is a mockup that is in Salt Lake City that gives you a sense of what this is going to look like in full scale. And this is a guy from Salt Lake City  this is what they look like out there. And for us  I mean it's really kind of a very strange thing  but the moments in the hall that the buzz kind of dies down when the audience is waiting for the performance to begin  very similar to the parting of curtains or the raising of a chandelier  the walls will just exude this glow  temporarily stealing attention from the stage. And this is Tully in construction now. I have no ending to say  except that I'm a couple of minutes over. Thank you very much. I was a student in the '  s  a time of social upheaval and questioning  and    on a personal level    an awakening sense of idealism. The war in Vietnam was raging  the Civil Rights movement was under way and pictures had a powerful influence on me. Our political and military leaders were telling us one thing and photographers were telling us another. I believed the photographers and so did millions of other Americans. Their images fuelled resistance to the war and to racism. They not only recorded history    they helped change the course of history. Their pictures became part of our collective consciousness and  as consciousness evolved into a shared sense of conscience  change became not only possible  but inevitable. It puts a human face on issues which  from afar  can appear abstract or ideological or monumental in their global impact. What happens at ground level  far from the halls of power  happens to ordinary citizens one by one. And I understood that documentary photography has the ability to interpret events from their point of view. It gives a voice to those who otherwise would not have a voice. My TED wish. There s a vital story that needs to be told and I wish for TED to help me gain access to it and then to help me come up with innovative and exciting ways to use news photography in the digital era. Thank you very much.     . .      The story breaks.      I have been a witness  and these pictures are my testimony.      South Africa     This is happening now.

I grew up in Northern Ireland  right up in the very  very north end of it there  where it's absolutely freezing cold. This was me running around in the back garden mid summer. I couldn't pick a career. In Ireland the obvious choice is the military  but to be honest it actually kind of sucks. My mother wanted me to be a dentist. But the problem was that people kept blowing everything up. So I actually went to school in Belfast  which was where all the action happened. And this was a pretty common sight. The school I went to was pretty boring. They forced us to learn things like Latin. The school teachers weren't having much fun  the sports were very dirty or very painful. So I cleverly chose rowing  which I got very good at. And I was actually rowing for my school here until this fateful day  and I flipped over right in front of the entire school. And that was the finishing post right there. So this was extremely embarrassing. But our school at that time got a grant from the government  and they got an incredible computer    the research machine  DZ    and they left the programming manuals lying around. And so students like myself with nothing to do  we would learn how to program it. Also around this time  at home  this was the computer that people were buying. It was called the Sinclair ZX  . This was a  K computer  and you'd buy your programs on cassette tape. Actually I'm just going to pause for one second  because I heard that there's a prerequisite to speak here at TED    you had to have a picture of yourself from the old days with big hair. So I brought a picture with big hair. I just want to get that out of the way. So after the Sinclair ZX   came along the very cleverly named Sinclair ZX  . And    you see the picture at the bottom  There's a picture of a guy doing homework with his son. That's what they thought they had built it for. The reality is we got the programming manual and we started making games for it. We were programming in BASIC  which is a pretty awful language for games  so we ended up learning Assembly language so we could really take control of the hardware. This is the guy that invented it  Sir Clive Sinclair  and he's showing his machine. You had this same thing in America  it was called the Timex Sinclair    . To play a game in those days you had to have an imagination to believe that you were really playing  Battlestar Galactica.  The graphics were just horrible. You had to have an even better imagination to play this game   Death Rider.  But of course the scientists couldn't help themselves. They started making their own video games. This is one of my favorite ones here  where they have rabbit breeding  so males choose the lucky rabbit. It was around this time we went from  K to   K  which was quite the leap. And if you're wondering how much   K is  this eBay logo here is   K. And in that amount of memory someone programmed a full flight simulation program. And that's what it looked like. I spent ages flying this flight simulator  and I honestly believed I could fly airplanes by the end of it. Here's Clive Sinclair now launching his color computer. He's recognized as being the father of video games in Europe. He's a multi millionaire  and I think that's why he's smiling in this photograph. So I went on for the next    years or so making a lot of different games. Some of the highlights were things like  The Terminator    Aladdin   the  Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles.  Because I was from the United Kingdom  they thought the word ninja was a little too mean for children  so they decided to call it hero instead. I personally preferred the Spanish version  which was  Tortugas Ninja.  That was much better. Then the last game I did was based on trying to get the video game industry and Hollywood to actually work together on something    instead of licensing from each other  to actually work. Now  Chris did ask me to bring some statistics with me  so I've done that. The video game industry in      became a    billion dollar business. It grows every year. Last year was the biggest year. By       we're going to kick the butt of the music industry. By       we're going to hit    billion.    percent of gamers are female. So there's a lot more female gamers than people are really aware. The average age of gamers  Well  obviously it's for children  right  Well  no  actually it's    years old. And interestingly  the people who buy the most games are   . So    is our target audience. All video games are violent. Of course the newspapers love to beat on this. But    percent of games don't have any mature content whatsoever  so it's just not true. Online gaming statistics. I brought some stuff on  World of Warcraft.  It's  .  million players. It makes about    million bucks a month in subscriptions. It costs    bucks just to install it on your computer  making the publisher about another     million. The game costs about    million dollars to make  so basically it pays for itself in about a month. A player in a game called  Project Entropia  actually bought his own island for        dollars. You have to remember that this is not a real island. He didn't actually buy anything  just some data. But he got great terms on it. This purchase included mining and hunting rights  ownership of all land on the island  and a castle with no furniture included. This market is now estimated at over     million dollars annually. And what's interesting about it is the market was actually created by the gamers themselves. They found clever ways to trade items and to sell their accounts to each other so that they could make money while they were playing their games. I dove onto eBay a couple of days ago just to see what was gong on  typed in World of Warcraft  got       items. I liked this one the best  a level    Warlock with lots of epics for         dollars. It's like that guy obviously had some pain while making it. So as far as popularity of games  what do you think these people are doing here  It turns out they're actually in Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles listening to the L.A. Philharmonic playing video game music. That's what the show looks like. You would expect it to be cheesy  but it's not. It's very  very epic and a very beautiful concert. And the people that went there absolutely loved it. What do you think these people are doing  They're actually bringing their computers so they can play games against each other. And this is happening in every city around the world. This is happening in your local cities too  you're probably just not aware of it. Now  Chris told me that you had a timeline video a few years ago here just to show how video game graphics have been improving. I wanted to update that video and give you a new look at it. But what I want you to do is to try to understand it. We're on this curve  and the graphics are getting so ridiculously better. And I'm going to show you up to maybe     . But I want you to try and think about what games could look like    years from now. So we're going to start that video. Video  Throughout human history people have played games. As man's intellect and technology have evolved so too have the games he plays. David Perry  The thing again I want you to think about is  don't look at these graphics and think of that's the way it is. Think about that's where we are right now  and the curve that we're on means that this is going to continue to get better. This is an example of the kind of graphics you need to be able to draw if you wanted to get a job in the video game industry today. You need to be really an incredible artist. And once we get enough of those guys  we're going to want more fantasy artists that can create places we've never been to before  or characters that we've just never seen before. So the obvious thing for me to talk about today is graphics and audio. But if you were to go to a game developers conference  what they're all talking about is emotion  purpose  meaning  understanding and feeling. You'll hear about talks like  can a video game make you cry  And these are the kind of topics we really actually care about. I came across a student who's absolutely excellent at expressing himself  and this student agreed that he would not show his video to anybody until you here at TED had seen it. So I'd like to play this video. So this is a student's opinion on what his experience of games are. Video  I  like many of you  live somewhere between reality and video games. Some part of me    a true living  breathing person    has become programmed  electronic and virtual. The boundary of my brain that divides real from fantasy has finally begun to crumble. I'm a video game addict and this is my story. In the year of my birth the Nintendo Entertainment System also went into development. I played in the backyard  learned to read  and even ate some of my vegetables. Most of my childhood was spent playing with Legos. But as was the case for most of my generation  I spent a lot of time in front of the TV. Mr. Rogers  Walt Disney  Nick Junior  and roughly half a million commercials have undoubtedly left their mark on me. When my parents bought my sister and I our first Nintendo  whatever inherent addictive quality this early interactive electronic entertainment possessed quickly took hold of me. At some point something clicked. With the combination of simple  interactive stories and the warmth of the TV set  my simple    bit Nintendo became more than just an escape. It became an alternate existence  my virtual reality. I'm a video game addict  and it's not because of a certain number of hours I have spent playing  or nights I have gone without sleep to finish the next level. It is because I have had life altering experiences in virtual space  and video games had begun to erode my own understanding of what is real and what is not. I'm addicted  because even though I know I'm losing my grip on reality  I still crave more. From an early age I learned to invest myself emotionally in what unfolded before me on screen. Today  after    years of watching TV geared to make me emotional  even a decent insurance commercial can bring tears to my eyes. I am just one of a new generation that is growing up. A generation who may experience much more meaning through video games than they will through the real world. Video games are nearing an evolutionary leap  a point where game worlds will look and feel just as real as the films we see in theatres  or the news we watch on TV. And while my sense of free will in these virtual worlds may still be limited  what I do learn applies to my real life. Play enough video games and eventually you will really believe you can snowboard  fly a plane  drive a nine second quarter mile  or kill a man. I know I can. Unlike any pop culture phenomenon before it  video games actually allow us to become part of the machine. They allow us to sublimate into the culture of interactive  downloaded  streaming  HD reality. We are interacting with our entertainment. I have come to expect this level of interaction. Without it  the problems faced in the real world    poverty  war  disease and genocide    lack the levity they should. Their importance blends into the sensationalized drama of prime time TV. But the beauty of video games today lies not in the lifelike graphics  the vibrating joysticks or virtual surround sound. It lies in that these games are beginning to make me emotional. I have fought in wars  feared for my own survival  watched my cohorts die on beaches and woods that look and feel more real than any textbook or any news story. The people who create these games are smart. They know what makes me scared  excited  panicked  proud or sad. Then they use these emotions to dimensionalize the worlds they create. A well designed video game will seamlessly weave the user into the fabric of the virtual experience. As one becomes more experienced the awareness of physical control melts away. I know what I want and I do it. No buttons to push  no triggers to pull  just me and the game. My fate and the fate of the world around me lie inside my hands. I know violent video games make my mother worry. What troubles me is not that video game violence is becoming more and more like real life violence  but that real life violence is starting to look more and more like a video game. These are all troubles outside of myself. I  however  have a problem very close to home. Something has happened to my brain. Perhaps there is a single part of our brain that holds all of our gut instincts  the things we know to do before we even think. While some of these instincts may be innate  most are learned  and all of them are hardwired into our brains. These instincts are essential for survival in both real and virtual worlds. Only in recent years has the technology behind video games allowed for a true overlap in stimuli. As gamers we are now living by the same laws of physics in the same cities and doing many of the same things we once did in real life  only virtually. Consider this    my real life car has about        miles on it. In all my driving games  I've driven a total of        miles. To some degree I've learned how to drive from the game. The sensory cues are very similar. It's a funny feeling when you have spent more time doing something on the TV than you have in real life. When I am driving down a road at sunset all I can think is  this is almost as beautiful as my games are. For my virtual worlds are perfect. More beautiful and rich than the real world around us. I'm not sure what the implications of my experience are  but the potential for using realistic video game stimuli in repetition on a vast number of loyal participants is frightening to me. Today I believe Big Brother would find much more success brainwashing the masses with video games rather than just simply TVs. Video games are fun  engaging  and leave your brain completely vulnerable to re programming. But maybe brainwashing isn't always bad. Imagine a game that teaches us to respect each other  or helps us to understand the problems we're all facing in the real world. There is a potential to do good as well. It is critical  as these virtual worlds continue to mirror the real world we live in  that game developers realize that they have tremendous responsibilities before them. I'm not sure what the future of video games holds for our civilization. But as virtual and real world experiences increasingly overlap there is a greater and greater potential for other people to feel the same way I do. What I have only recently come to realize is that beyond the graphics  sound  game play and emotion it is the power to break down reality that is so fascinating and addictive to me. I know that I am losing my grip. Part of me is just waiting to let go. I know though  that no matter how amazing video games may become  or how flat the real world may seem to us  that we must stay aware of what our games are teaching us and how they leave us feeling when we finally do unplug. DP  Wow. I found that video very  very thought provoking  and that's why I wanted to bring it here for you guys to see. And what was interesting about it is the obvious choice for me to talk about was graphics and audio. But as you heard  Michael talked about all these other elements as well. Video games give an awful lot of other things too  and that's why people get so addicted. The most important one being fun. The name of this track is  The Magic To Come.  Who is that going to come from  Is it going to come from the best directors in the world as we thought it probably would  I don't think so. I think it's going to come from the children who are growing up now that aren't stuck with all of the stuff that we remember from the past. They're going to do it their way  using the tools that we've created. The same with students or highly creative people  writers and people like that. As far as colleges go  there's about     colleges around the world teaching video game courses. That means there's literally thousands of new ideas. Some of the ideas are really dreadful and some of them are great. There's nothing worse than having to listen to someone try and pitch you a really bad video game idea. Chris Anderson  You're off  you're off. That's it. He's out of time. DP  I've just got a little tiny bit more if you'll indulge me. CA  Go ahead. I'm going to stay right here though. DP  This is just a cool shot  because this is students coming to school after class. The school is closed  they're coming back at midnight because they want to pitch their video game ideas. I'm sitting at the front of the class  and they're actually pitching their ideas. So it's hard to get students to come back to class  but it is possible. This is my daughter  her name's Emma  she's    months old. And I've been asking myself  what is Emma going to experience in the video game world  And as I've shown here  we have the audience. She's never going to know a world where you can't press a button and have millions of people ready to play. You know  we have the technology. She's never going to know a world where the graphics just aren't stunning and really immersive. And as the student video showed  we can impact and move. She's never going to know a world where video games aren't incredibly emotional and will probably make her cry. I just hope she likes video games. So  my closing thought. Games on the surface seem simple entertainment  but for those that like to look a little deeper  the new paradigm of video games could open entirely new frontiers to creative minds that like to think big. Where better to challenge those minds than here at TED  Thank you. Chris Anderson  David Perry. That was awesome. So  indeed  I have spent my life looking into the lives of presidents who are no longer alive. Waking up with Abraham Lincoln in the morning  thinking of Franklin Roosevelt when I went to bed at night. But when I try and think about what I've learned about the meaning in life  my mind keeps wandering back to a seminar that I took when I was a graduate student at Harvard with the great psychologist Erik Erikson. He taught us that the richest and fullest lives attempt to achieve an inner balance between three realms  work  love and play. And that to pursue one realm to the disregard of the other  is to open oneself to ultimate sadness in older age. Whereas to pursue all three with equal dedication  is to make possible a life filled not only with achievement  but with serenity. So since I tell stories  let me look back on the lives of two of the presidents I've studied to illustrate this point    Abraham Lincoln and Lyndon Johnson. As for that first sphere of work  I think what Abraham Lincoln's life suggests is that fierce ambition is a good thing. He had a huge ambition. But it wasn't simply for office or power or celebrity or fame    what it was for was to accomplish something worthy enough in life so that he could make the world a little better place for his having lived in it. Even as a child  it seemed  Lincoln dreamed heroic dreams. He somehow had to escape that hard scrabble farm from which he was born. No schooling was possible for him  except a few weeks here  a few weeks there. But he read books in every spare moment he could find. It was said when he got a copy of the King James Bible or  Aesop's Fables   he was so excited he couldn't sleep. He couldn't eat. The great poet Emily Dickinson once said   There is no frigate like a book to take us lands away.  How true for Lincoln. Though he never would travel to Europe  he went with Shakespeare's kings to merry England  he went with Lord Byron's poetry to Spain and Portugal. Literature allowed him to transcend his surroundings. But there were so many losses in his early life that he was haunted by death. His mother died when he was only nine years old  his only sister  Sarah  in childbirth a few years later  and his first love  Ann Rutledge  at the age of   . Moreover  when his mother lay dying  she did not hold out for him the hope that they would meet in an afterworld. She simply said to him   Abraham  I'm going away from you now  and I shall never return.  As a result he became obsessed with the thought that when we die our life is swept away    dust to dust. But only as he grew older did he develop a certain consolation from an ancient Greek notion    but followed by other cultures as well    that if you could accomplish something worthy in your life  you could live on in the memory of others. Your honor and your reputation would outlive your earthly existence. And that worthy ambition became his lodestar. It carried him through the one significant depression that he suffered when he was in his early   s. Three things had combined to lay him low. He had broken his engagement with Mary Todd  not certain he was ready to marry her  but knowing how devastating it was to her that he did that. His one intimate friend  Joshua Speed  was leaving Illinois to go back to Kentucky because Speed's father had died. And his political career in the state legislature was on a downward slide. He was so depressed that friends worried he was suicidal. They took all knives and razors and scissors from his room. And his great friend Speed went to his side and said   Lincoln  you must rally or you will die.  He said that   I would just as soon die right now  but I've not yet done anything to make any human being remember that I have lived.  So fueled by that ambition  he returned to the state legislature. He eventually won a seat in Congress. He then ran twice for the Senate  lost twice.  Everyone is broken by life   Ernest Hemingway once said   but some people are stronger in the broken places.  So then he surprised the nation with an upset victory for the presidency over three far more experienced  far more educated  far more celebrated rivals. And then when he won the general election  he stunned the nation even more by appointing each of these three rivals into his Cabinet. It was an unprecedented act at the time because everybody thought   He'll look like a figurehead compared to these people.  They said   Why are you doing this  Lincoln   He said   Look  these are the strongest and most able men in the country. The country is in peril. I need them by my side.  But perhaps my old friend Lyndon Johnson might have put it in less noble fashion   Better to have your enemies inside the tent pissing out  than outside the tent pissing in.  But it soon became clear that Abraham Lincoln would emerge as the undisputed captain of this unruly team. For each of them soon came to understand that he possessed an unparalleled array of emotional strengths and political skills that proved far more important than the thinness of his external r sum . For one thing  he possessed an uncanny ability to empathize with and to think about other peoples' point of view. He repaired injured feelings that might have escalated into permanent hostility. He shared credit with ease  assumed responsibility for the failure of his subordinates  constantly acknowledged his errors and learned from his mistakes. These are the qualities we should be looking for in our candidates in     . He refused to be provoked by petty grievances. He never submitted to jealousy or brooded over perceived slights. And he expressed his unshakeable convictions in everyday language  in metaphors  in stories. And with a beauty of language    almost as if the Shakespeare and the poetry he had so loved as a child had worked their way into his very soul. In       when the Emancipation Proclamation was signed  he brought his old friend  Joshua Speed  back to the White House  and remembered that conversation of decades before  when he was so sad. And he  pointing to the Proclamation  said   I believe  in this measure  my fondest hopes will be realized.  But as he was about to put his signature on the Proclamation his own hand was numb and shaking because he had shaken a thousand hands that morning at a New Year's reception. So he put the pen down. He said   If ever my soul were in an act  it is in this act. But if I sign with a shaking hand  posterity will say  'He hesitated.'  So he waited until he could take up the pen and sign with a bold and clear hand. But even in his wildest dreams  Lincoln could never have imagined how far his reputation would reach. I was so thrilled to find an interview with the great Russian writer  Leo Tolstoy  in a New York newspaper in the early     s. And in it  Tolstoy told of a trip that he'd recently made to a very remote area of the Caucasus  where there were only wild barbarians  who had never left this part of Russia. Knowing that Tolstoy was in their midst  they asked him to tell stories of the great men of history. So he said   I told them about Napoleon and Alexander the Great and Frederick the Great and Julius Caesar  and they loved it. But before I finished  the chief of the barbarians stood up and said  'But wait  you haven't told us about the greatest ruler of them all. We want to hear about that man who spoke with a voice of thunder  who laughed like the sunrise  who came from that place called America  which is so far from here  that if a young man should travel there  he would be an old man when he arrived. Tell us of that man. Tell us of Abraham Lincoln.'  He was stunned. He told them everything he could about Lincoln. And then in the interview he said   What made Lincoln so great  Not as great a general as Napoleon  not as great a statesman as Frederick the Great.  But his greatness consisted  and historians would roundly agree  in the integrity of his character and the moral fiber of his being. So in the end that powerful ambition that had carried Lincoln through his bleak childhood had been realized. That ambition that had allowed him to laboriously educate himself by himself  to go through that string of political failures and the darkest days of the war. His story would be told. So as for that second sphere  not of work  but of love    encompassing family  friends and colleagues    it  too  takes work and commitment. The Lyndon Johnson that I saw in the last years of his life  when I helped him on his memoirs  was a man who had spent so many years in the pursuit of work  power and individual success  that he had absolutely no psychic or emotional resources left to get him through the days once the presidency was gone. My relationship with him began on a rather curious level. I was selected as a White House Fellow when I was    years old. We had a big dance at the White House. President Johnson did dance with me that night. Not that peculiar    there were only three women out of the    White House Fellows. But he did whisper in my ear that he wanted me to work directly for him in the White House. But it was not to be that simple. For in the months leading up to my selection  like many young people  I'd been active in the anti Vietnam War movement  and had written an article against Lyndon Johnson  which unfortunately came out in The New Republic two days after the dance in the White House. And the theme of the article was how to remove Lyndon Johnson from power. So I was certain he would kick me out of the program. But instead  surprisingly  he said   Oh  bring her down here for a year  and if I can't win her over  no one can.  So I did end up working for him in the White House. Eventually accompanied him to his ranch to help him on those memoirs  never fully understanding why he'd chosen me to spend so many hours with. I like to believe it was because I was a good listener. He was a great storyteller. Fabulous  colorful  anecdotal stories. There was a problem with these stories  however  which I later discovered  which is that half of them weren't true. But they were great  nonetheless. So I think that part of his attraction for me was that I loved listening to his tall tales. But I also worried that part of it was that I was then a young woman. And he had somewhat of a minor league womanizing reputation. So I constantly chatted to him about boyfriends  even when I didn't have any at all. Everything was working perfectly  until one day he said he wanted to discuss our relationship. Sounded very ominous when he took me nearby to the lake  conveniently called Lake Lyndon Baines Johnson. And there was wine and cheese and a red checked tablecloth    all the romantic trappings. And he started out   Doris  more than any other woman I have ever known ...   And my heart sank. And then he said   You remind me of my mother.  It was pretty embarrassing  given what was going on in my mind. But I must say  the older I've gotten  the more I realize what an incredible privilege it was to have spent so many hours with this aging lion of a man. A victor in a thousand contests  three great civil rights laws  Medicare  aid to education. And yet  roundly defeated in the end by the war in Vietnam. And because he was so sad and so vulnerable  he opened up to me in ways he never would have had I known him at the height of his power    sharing his fears  his sorrows and his worries. And I'd like to believe that the privilege fired within me the drive to understand the inner person behind the public figure  that I've tried to bring to each of my books since then. But it also brought home to me the lessons which Erik Erikson had tried to instill in all of us about the importance of finding balance in life. For on the surface  Lyndon Johnson should have had everything in the world to feel good about in those last years  in the sense that he had been elected to the presidency  he had all the money he needed to pursue any leisure activity he wanted  he owned a spacious ranch in the countryside  a penthouse in the city  sailboats  speedboats. He had servants to answer any whim  and he had a family who loved him deeply. And yet  years of concentration solely on work and individual success meant that in his retirement he could find no solace in family  in recreation  in sports or in hobbies. It was almost as if the hole in his heart was so large that even the love of a family  without work  could not fill it. As his spirits sagged  his body deteriorated until  I believe  he slowly brought about his own death. In those last years  he said he was so sad watching the American people look toward a new president and forgetting him. He spoke with immense sadness in his voice  saying maybe he should have spent more time with his children  and their children in turn. But it was too late. Despite all that power  all that wealth  he was alone when he finally died    his ultimate terror realized. So as for that third sphere of play  which he never had learned to enjoy  I've learned over the years that even this sphere requires a commitment of time and energy    enough so that a hobby  a sport  a love of music  or art  or literature  or any form of recreation  can provide true pleasure  relaxation and replenishment. So deep  for instance  was Abraham Lincoln's love of Shakespeare  that he made time to spend more than a hundred nights in the theater  even during those dark days of the war. He said  when the lights went down and a Shakespeare play came on  for a few precious hours he could imagine himself back in Prince Hal's time. But an even more important form of relaxation for him  that Lyndon Johnson never could enjoy  was a love of    somehow    humor  and feeling out what hilarious parts of life can produce as a sidelight to the sadness. He once said that he laughed so he did not cry  that a good story  for him  was better than a drop of whiskey. His storytelling powers had first been recognized when he was on the circuit in Illinois. The lawyers and the judges would travel from one county courthouse to the other  and when anyone was knowing Lincoln was in town  they would come from miles around to listen to him tell stories. He would stand with his back against a fire and entertain the crowd for hours with his winding tales. And all these stories became part of his memory bank  so he could call on them whenever he needed to. And they're not quite what you might expect from our marble monument. One of his favorite stories  for example  had to do with the Revolutionary War hero  Ethan Allen. And as Lincoln told the story  Mr. Allen went to Britain after the war. And the British people were still upset about losing the Revolution  so they decided to embarrass him a little bit by putting a huge picture of General Washington in the only outhouse  where he'd have to encounter it. They figured he'd be upset about the indignity of George Washington being in an outhouse. But he came out of the outhouse not upset at all. And so they said   Well  did you see George Washington in there    Oh  yes   he said   perfectly appropriate place for him.   What do you mean   they said.  Well   he said   there's nothing to make an Englishman shit faster than the sight of General George Washington.  So you can imagine  if you are in the middle of a tense cabinet meeting    and he had hundreds of these stories    you would have to relax. So between his nightly treks to the theater  his story telling  and his extraordinary sense of humor and his love of quoting Shakespeare and poetry  he found that form of play which carried him through his days. In my own life  I shall always be grateful for having found a form of play in my irrational love of baseball. Which allows me  from the beginning of spring training to the end of the fall  to have something to occupy my mind and heart other than my work. It all began when I was only six years old  and my father taught me that mysterious art of keeping score while listening to baseball games    so that when he went to work in New York during the day  I could record for him the history of that afternoon's Brooklyn Dodgers game. Now  when you're only six years old  and your father comes home every single night and listens to you    as I now realize that I  in excruciating detail  recounted every single play of every inning of the game that had just taken place that afternoon. But he made me feel I was telling him a fabulous story. It makes you think there's something magic about history to keep your father's attention. In fact  I'm convinced I learned the narrative art from those nightly sessions with my father. Because at first  I'd be so excited I would blurt out   The Dodgers won   or   The Dodgers lost   Which took much of the drama of this two hour telling away. So I finally learned you had to tell a story from beginning to middle to end. I must say  so fervent was my love of the old Brooklyn Dodgers in those days that I had to confess in my first confession two sins that related to baseball. The first occurred because the Dodgers' catcher  Roy Campanella  came to my hometown of Rockville Centre  Long Island  just as I was in preparation for my first Holy Communion. And I was so excited    first person I'd ever see outside of Ebbets Field. But it so happened he was speaking in a Protestant Church. When you are brought up as a Catholic  you think that if you ever set foot in a Protestant Church  you'll be struck dead at the threshold. So I went to my father in tears   What are we going to do   He said   Don't worry. He's speaking in a parish hall. We're sitting in folding chairs. He's talking about sportsmanship. It's not a sin.  But as I left that night  I was certain that somehow I'd traded the life of my everlasting soul for this one night with Roy Campanella. And there were no indulgences around that I could buy. So I had this sin on my soul when I went to my first confession. I told the priest right away. He said   No problem. It wasn't a religious service.  But then  unfortunately  he said   And what else  my child   And then came my second sin. I tried to sandwich it in between talking too much in church  wishing harm to others  being mean to my sisters. And he said   To whom did you wish harm   And I had to say that I wished that various New York Yankees players would break arms  legs and ankles       so that the Brooklyn Dodgers could win their first World Series. He said   How often do you make these horrible wishes   And I had to say  every night when I said my prayers. So he said   Look  I'll tell you something. I love the Brooklyn Dodgers  as you do  but I promise you some day they will win fairly and squarely. You do not need to wish harm on others to make it happen.   Oh yes   I said. But luckily  my first confession    to a baseball loving priest  Well  though my father died of a sudden heart attack when I was still in my   s  before I had gotten married and had my three sons  I have passed his memory    as well as his love of baseball    on to my boys. Though when the Dodgers abandoned us to come to L.A.  I lost faith in baseball until I moved to Boston and became an irrational Red Socks fan. And I must say  even now  when I sit with my sons with our season tickets  I can sometimes close my eyes against the sun and imagine myself  a young girl once more  in the presence of my father  watching the players of my youth on the grassy fields below  Jackie Robinson  Roy Campanella  Pee Wee Reese  and Duke Snider. I must say there is magic in these moments. When I open my eyes and I see my sons in the place where my father once sat  I feel an invisible loyalty and love linking my sons to the grandfather whose face they never had a chance to see  but whose heart and soul they have come to know through all the stories I have told. Which is why  in the end  I shall always be grateful for this curious love of history  allowing me to spend a lifetime looking back into the past. Allowing me to learn from these large figures about the struggle for meaning for life. Allowing me to believe that the private people we have loved and lost in our families  and the public figures we have respected in our history  just as Abraham Lincoln wanted to believe  really can live on  so long as we pledge to tell and to retell the stories of their lives. Thank you for letting me be that storyteller today. Thank you. I want to take you back basically to my hometown  and to a picture of my hometown of the week that  Emergence  came out. And it's a picture we've seen several times. Basically   Emergence  was published on     . I live right there in the West Village  so the plume was luckily blowing west  away from us. We had a two and a half day old baby in the house that was ours    we hadn't taken it from somebody else. And one of the thoughts that I had dealing with these two separate emergences of a book and a baby  and having this event happen so close    that my first thought  when I was still kind of in the apartment looking out at it all or walking out on the street and looking out on it just in front of our building  was that I'd made a terrible miscalculation in the book that I'd just written. Because so much of that book was a celebration of the power and creative potential of density  of largely urban density  of connecting people and putting them together in one place  and putting them on sidewalks together and having them share ideas and share physical space together. And it seemed to me looking at that    that tower burning and then falling  those towers burning and falling    that in fact  one of the lessons here was that density kills. And that of all the technologies that were exploited to make that carnage come into being  probably the single group of technologies that cost the most lives were those that enable        people to live in two buildings     stories above the ground. If they hadn't been crowded    you compare the loss of life at the Pentagon to the Twin Towers  and you can see that very powerfully. And so I started to think  well  you know  density  density    I'm not sure if  you know  this was the right call. And I kind of ruminated on that for a couple of days. And then about two days later  the wind started to change a little bit  and you could sense that the air was not healthy. And so even though there were no cars still in the West Village where we lived  my wife sent me out to buy a  you know  a large air filter at the Bed Bath and Beyond  which was located about    blocks away  north. And so I went out. And obviously I'm physically a very strong person  as you can tell     Laughter     so I wasn't worried about carrying this thing    blocks. And I walked out  and this really miraculous thing happened to me as I was walking north to buy this air filter  which was that the streets were completely alive with people. There was an incredible    it was  you know  a beautiful day  as it was for about a week after  and the West Village had never seemed more lively. I walked up along Hudson Street    where Jane Jacobs had lived and written her great book that so influenced what I was writing in  Emergence     past the White Horse Tavern  that great old bar where Dylan Thomas drank himself to death  and the Bleecker Street playground was filled with kids. And all the people who lived in the neighborhood  who owned restaurants and bars in the neighborhood  were all out there    had them all open. People were out. There were no cars  so it seemed even better  in some ways. And it was a beautiful urban day  and the incredible thing about it was that the city was working. The city was there. All the things that make a great city successful and all the things that make a great city stimulating    they were all on display there on those streets. And I thought  well  this is the power of a city. I mean  the power of the city    we talked about cities as being centralized in space  but what makes them so strong most of the time is they're decentralized in function. They don't have a center executive branch that you can take out and cause the whole thing to fail. If they did  it probably was right there at Ground Zero. I mean  you know  the emergency bunker was right there  was destroyed by the attacks  and obviously the damage done to the building and the lives. But nonetheless  just    blocks north  two days later  the city had never looked more alive. If you'd gone into the minds of the people  well  you would have seen a lot of trauma  and you would have seen a lot of heartache  and you would have seen a lot of things that would take a long time to recover. But the system itself of this city was thriving. So I took heart in seeing that. So I wanted to talk a little bit about the reasons why that works so well  and how some of those reasons kind of map on to where the Web is going right now. The question that I found myself asking to people when I was talking about the book afterwards is    when you've talked about emergent behavior  when you've talked about collective intelligence  the best way to get people to kind of wrap their heads around that is to ask  who builds a neighborhood  Who decides that Soho should have this personality and that the Latin Quarter should have this personality  Well  there are some kind of executive decisions  but mostly the answer is    everybody and nobody. Everybody contributes a little bit. No single person is really the ultimate actor behind the personality of a neighborhood. Same thing to the question of  who was keeping the streets alive post      in my neighborhood  Well  it was the whole city. The whole system kind of working on it  and everybody contributing a small little part. And this is increasingly what we're starting to see on the Web in a bunch of interesting ways    most of which weren't around  actually  except in very experimental things  when I was writing  Emergence  and when the book came out. So it's been a very optimistic time  I think  and I want to just talk about a few of those things. I think that there is effectively a new kind of model of interactivity that's starting to emerge online right now. And the old one looked like this. This is not the future King of England  although it looks like it. It's some guy  it's a GeoCities homepage of some guy that I found online who's interested  if you look at the bottom  in soccer and Jesus and Garth Brooks and Clint Beckham and  my hometown     those are his links. But nothing really says this model of interactivity    which was so exciting and captures the real  the Web Zeitgeist of         than  Click here for a picture of my dog.  That is    you know  there's no sentence that kind of conjures up that period better than that  I think  which is that you suddenly have the power to put up a picture of your dog and link to it  and somebody reading the page has the power to click on that link or not click on that link. And  you know  I don't want to belittle that. That  in a sense    to reference what Jeff was talking about yesterday    that was  in a sense  the kind of interface electricity that powered a lot of the explosion of interest in the Web  that you could put up a link  and somebody could click on it  and it could take you anywhere you wanted to go. But it's still a very one to one kind of relationship. There's one person putting up the link  and there's another person on the other end trying to decide whether to click on it or not. The new model is much more like this  and we've already seen a couple of references to this. This is what happens when you search  Steven Johnson  on Google. About two months ago  I had the great breakthrough    one of my great  kind of shining achievements    which is that my website finally became a top result for  Steven Johnson.  There's some theoretical physicist at MIT named Steven Johnson who has dropped two spots  I'm happy to say. And  you know  I mean  I'll look at a couple of things like this  but Google is obviously the greatest technology ever invented for navel gazing. It's just that there are so many other people in your navel when you gaze. Because effectively  what's happening here  what's creating this page  obviously    and we all know this  but it's worth just thinking about it    is not some person deciding that I am the number one answer for Steven Johnson  but rather somehow the entire web of people putting up pages and deciding to link to my page or not link to it  and Google just sitting there and running the numbers. So there's this collective decision making that's going on. This page is effectively  collectively authored by the Web  and Google is just helping us kind of to put the authorship in one kind of coherent place. Now  they're more innovative    well  Google's pretty innovative    but there are some new twists on this. There's this incredibly interesting new site    Technorati    that's filled with lots of little widgets that are expanding on these. And these are looking in the blog world and the world of weblogs. He's analyzed basically all the weblogs out there that he's tracking. And he's tracking how many other weblogs linked to those weblogs  and so you have kind of an authority    a weblog that has a lot of links to it is more authoritative than a weblog that has few links to it. And so at any given time  on any given page on the Web  actually  you can say  what does the weblog community think about this page  And you can get a list. This is what they think about my site  it's ranked by blog authority. You can also rank it by the latest posts. So when I was talking in  Emergence   I talked about the limitations of the one way linking architecture that  basically  you could link to somebody else but they wouldn't necessarily know that you were pointing to them. And that was one of the reasons why the web wasn't quite as emergent as it could be because you needed two way linking  you needed that kind of feedback mechanism to be able to really do interesting things. Well  something like Technorati is supplying that. Now what's interesting here is that this is a quote from Dave Weinberger  where he talks about everything being purposive in the Web    there's nothing artificial. He has this line where he says  you know  you're going to put up a link there  if you see a link  somebody decided to put it there. And he says  the link to one site didn't just grow on the other page  like a tree fungus.  And in fact  I think that's not entirely true anymore. I could put up a feed of all those links generated by Technorati on the right hand side of my page  and they would change as the overall ecology of the Web changes. That little list there would change. I wouldn't really be directly in control of it. So it's much closer  in a way  to a data fungus  in a sense  wrapped around that page  than it is to a deliberate link that I've placed there. Now  what you're having here is basically a global brain that you're able to do lots of kind of experiments on to see what it's thinking. And there are all these interesting tools. Google does the Google Zeitgeist  which looks at search requests to test what's going on  what people are interested in  and they publish it with lots of fun graphs. And I'm saying a lot of nice things about Google  so I'll be I'll be saying one little critical thing. There's a problem with the Google Zeitgeist  which is it often comes back with news that a lot of people are searching for Britney Spears pictures  which is not necessarily news. The Columbia blows up  suddenly there are a lot of searches on Columbia. Well  you know  we should expect to see that. That's not necessarily something we didn't know already. So the key thing in terms of these new tools that are kind of plumbing the depths of the global brain  that are sending kind of trace dyes through that whole bloodstream    the question is  are you finding out something new  And one of the things that I experimented with is this thing called Google Share which is basically  you take an abstract term  and you search Google for that term  and then you search the results that you get back for somebody's name. So basically  the number of pages that mention this term  that also mention this page  the percentage of those pages is that person's Google Share of that term. So you can do kind of interesting contests. Like for instance  this is a Google Share of the TED Conference. So Richard Saul Wurman has about a    percent Google Share of the TED conference. Our good friend Chris has about a six percent    but with a bullet  I might add. But the interesting thing is  you can broaden the search a little bit. And it turns out  actually  that    percent is the Mola mola fish. I had no idea. No  that's not true. I made that up because I just wanted to put up a slide of the Mola mola fish. I also did    and I don't want to start a little fight in the next panel    but I did a Google Share analysis of evolution and natural selection. So right here    now this is a big category  you have smaller percentages  so this is  .  percent    Dan Dennett  who'll be speaking shortly. Right below him   .  percent  Steven Pinker. So Dennett's in the lead a little bit there. But what's interesting is you can then broaden the search and actually see interesting things and get a sense of what else is out there. So Gary Bauer is not too far behind    has slightly different theories about evolution and natural selection. And right behind him is L. Ron Hubbard. So    you can see we're in the ascot  which is always good. And by the way  Chris  that would've been a really good panel  I think  right there. Hubbard apparently started to reach  but besides that  I think it would be good next year. Another quick thing    this is a slightly different thing  but this analysis some of you may have seen. It just came out. This is bursty words  looking at the historical record of State of the Union Addresses. So these are words that suddenly start to appear out of nowhere  so they're kind of  you know  memes that start taking off  that didn't have a lot of historical precedent before. So the first one is    these are the bursty words around     s    slaves  emancipation  slavery  rebellion  Kansas. That's Britney Spears. I mean  you know  OK  interesting. They're talking about slavery in     .         relief  depression  recovery banks. And OK  I didn't learn anything new there as well    that's pretty obvious.       right at the center of the Reagan years    that's  we're  there's  we've  it's. Now  there's one way to interpret this  which is to say that  emancipation  and  depression  and  recovery  all have a lot of syllables. So you know  you can actually download    it's hard to remember those. But seriously  actually  what you can see there  in a way that would be very hard to detect otherwise  is Reagan reinventing the political language of the country and shifting to a much more intimate  much more folksy  much more telegenic    contracting all those verbs. You know     years before it was still   Ask not what you can do   but with Reagan  it's   that's where  there's Nancy and I   that kind of language. And so something we kind of knew  but you didn't actually notice syntactically what he was doing. I'll go very quickly. The question now    and this is the really interesting question    is  what kind of higher level shape is emerging right now in the overall Web ecosystem    and particularly in the ecosystem of the blogs because they are really kind of at the cutting edge. And I think what happens there will also happen in the wider system. Now there was a very interesting article by Clay Shirky that got a lot of attention about a month ago  and this is basically the distribution of links on the web to all these various different blogs. It follows a power law  so that there are a few extremely well linked to  popular blogs  and a long tail of blogs with very few links. So    percent of the blogs get    percent of the links. Now this is a very interesting thing. It's caused a lot of controversy because people thought that this was the ultimate kind of one man  one modem democracy  where anybody can get out there and get their voice heard. And so the question is   Why is this happening   It's not being imposed by fiat from above. It's an emergent property of the blogosphere right now. Now  what's great about it is that people are working on    within seconds of Clay publishing this piece  people started working on changing the underlying rules of the system so that a different shape would start appearing. And basically  the shape appears largely because of a kind of a first mover advantage. if you're the first site there  everybody links to you. If you're the second site there  most people link to you. And so very quickly you can accumulate a bunch of links  and it makes it more likely for newcomers to link to you in the future  and then you get this kind of shape. And so what Dave Sifry at Technorati started working on  literally as Shirky started    after he published his piece    was something that basically just gave a new kind of priority to newcomers. And he started looking at interesting newcomers that don't have a lot of links  that suddenly get a bunch of links in the last    hours. So in a sense  bursty weblogs coming from new voices. So he's working on a tool right there that can actually change the overall system. And it creates a kind of planned emergence. You're not totally in control  but you're changing the underlying rules in interesting ways because you have an end result which is maybe a more democratic spread of voices. So the most amazing thing about this    and I'll end on this note    is  most emergent systems  most self organizing systems are not made up of component parts that are capable of looking at the overall pattern and changing their behavior based on whether they like the pattern or not. So the most wonderful thing  I think  about this whole debate about power laws and software that could change it is the fact that we're having the conversation. I hope it continues here. Thanks a lot. Whoa  dude. Check out those killer equations. Sweet.  Laughter  Actually  for the next    minutes I'm going to do the best I can to describe the beauty of particle physics without equations. It turns out there's a lot we can learn from coral. Coral is a very beautiful and unusual animal. Each coral head consists of thousand of individual polyps. These polyps are continually budding and branching into genetically identical neighbors. If we imagine this to be a hyper intelligent coral  we can single out an individual and ask him a reasonable question. We can ask how exactly he got to be in this particular location compared to his neighbors    if it was just chance  or destiny  or what  Now  after admonishing us for turning the temperature up too high  he would tell us that our question was completely stupid. These corals can be quite kind of mean  you see  and I have surfing scars to prove that. But this polyp would continue and tell us that his neighbors were quite clearly identical copies of him. That he was in all these other locations as well  but experiencing them as separate individuals. For a coral  branching into different copies is the most natural thing in the world. Unlike us  a hyper intelligent coral would be uniquely prepared to understand quantum mechanics. The mathematics of quantum mechanics very accurately describes how our universe works. And it tells us our reality is continually branching into different possibilities  just like a coral. It's a weird thing for us humans to wrap our minds around  since we only ever get to experience one possibility. This quantum weirdness was first described by Erwin Schr dinger and his cat. The cat likes this version better. In this setup  Schr dinger is in a box with a radioactive sample that  by the laws of quantum mechanics  branches into a state in which it is radiated and a state in which it is not. In the branch in which the sample radiates  it sets off a trigger that releases poison and Schr dinger is dead. But in the other branch of reality  he remains alive. These realities are experienced separately by each individual. As far as either can tell  the other one doesn't exist. This seems weird to us  because each of us only experiences an individual existence  and we don't get to see other branches. It's as if each of us  like Schr dinger here  are a kind of coral branching into different possibilities. The mathematics of quantum mechanics tells us this is how the world works at tiny scales. It can be summed up in a single sentence  Everything that can happen  does. That's quantum mechanics. But this does not mean everything happens. The rest of physics is about describing what can happen and what can't. What physics tells us is that everything comes down to geometry and the interactions of elementary particles. And things can happen only if these interactions are perfectly balanced. Now I'll go ahead and describe how we know about these particles  what they are and how this balance works. In this machine  a beam of protons and anti protons are accelerated to near the speed of light and brought together in a collision  producing a burst of pure energy. This energy is immediately converted into a spray of subatomic particles  with detectors and computers used to figure out their properties. This enormous machine    the large Hadron Collider at CERN in Geneva    has a circumference of    miles and  when it's operating  draws five times as much power as the city of Monterey. We can't predict specifically what particles will be produced in any individual collision. Quantum mechanics tells us all possibilities are realized. But physics does tell us what particles can be produced. These particles must have just as much mass and energy as is carried in by the proton and anti proton. Any particles more massive than this energy limit aren't produced  and remain invisible to us. This is why this new particle accelerator is so exciting. It's going to push this energy limit seven times beyond what's ever been done before  so we're going to get to see some new particles very soon. But before talking about what we might see  let me describe the particles we already know of. There's a whole zoo of subatomic particles. Most of us are familiar with electrons. A lot of people in this room make a good living pushing them around. But the electron also has a neutral partner called the neutrino  with no electric charge and a very tiny mass. In contrast  the up and down quarks have very large masses  and combine in threes to make the protons and neutrons inside atoms. All of these matter particles come in left  and right handed varieties  and have anti particle partners that carry opposite charges. These familiar particles also have less familiar second and third generations  which have the same charges as the first but have much higher masses. These matter particles all interact with the various force particles. The electromagnetic force interacts with electrically charged matter via particles called photons. There is also a very weak force called  rather unimaginatively  the weak force  that interacts only with left handed matter. The strong force acts between quarks which carry a different kind of charge  called color charge  and come in three different varieties  red  green and blue. You can blame Murray Gell Mann for these names    they're his fault. Finally  there's the force of gravity  which interacts with matter via its mass and spin. The most important thing to understand here is that there's a different kind of charge associated with each of these forces. These four different forces interact with matter according to the corresponding charges that each particle has. A particle that hasn't been seen yet  but we're pretty sure exists  is the Higgs particle  which gives masses to all these other particles. The main purpose of the Large Hadron Collider is to see this Higgs particle  and we're almost certain it will. But the greatest mystery is what else we might see. And I'm going to show you one beautiful possibility towards the end of this talk. Now  if we count up all these different particles using their various spins and charges  there are    . That's a lot of particles to keep track of. And it seems strange that nature would have so many elementary particles. But if we plot them out according to their charges  some beautiful patterns emerge. The most familiar charge is electric charge. Electrons have an electric charge  a negative one  and quarks have electric charges in thirds. So when two up quarks and a down quark are combined to make a proton  it has a total electric charge of plus one. These particles also have anti particles  which have opposite charges. Now  it turns out the electric charge is actually a combination of two other charges  hypercharge and weak charge. If we spread out the hypercharge and weak charge and plot the charges of particles in this two dimensional charge space  the electric charge is where these particles sit along the vertical direction. The electromagnetic and weak forces interact with matter according to their hypercharge and weak charge  which make this pattern. This is called the Unified Electroweak Model  and it was put together back in     . The reason most of us are only familiar with electric charge and not both of these is because of the Higgs particle. The Higgs  over here on the left  has a large mass and breaks the symmetry of this electroweak pattern. It makes the weak force very weak by giving the weak particles a large mass. Since this massive Higgs sits along the horizontal direction in this diagram  the photons of electromagnetism remain massless and interact with electric charge along the vertical direction in this charge space. So the electromagnetic and weak forces are described by this pattern of particle charges in two dimensional space. We can include the strong force by spreading out its two charge directions and plotting the charges of the force particles in quarks along these directions. The charges of all known particles can be plotted in a four dimensional charge space  and projected down to two dimensions like this so we can see them. Whenever particles interact  nature keeps things in a perfect balance along all four of these charge directions. If a particle and an anti particle collide  it creates a burst of energy and a total charge of zero in all four charge directions. At this point  anything can be created as long as it has the same energy and maintains a total charge of zero. For example  this weak force particle and its anti particle can be created in a collision. In further interactions  the charges must always balance. One of the weak particles could decay into an electron and an anti neutrino  and these three still add to zero total charge. Nature always keeps a perfect balance. So these patterns of charges are not just pretty. They tell us what interactions are allowed to happen. And we can rotate this charge space in four dimensions to get a better look at the strong interaction  which has this nice hexagonal symmetry. In a strong interaction  a strong force particle  such as this one  interacts with a colored quark  such as this green one  to give a quark with a different color charge    this red one. And strong interactions are happening millions of times each second in every atom of our bodies  holding the atomic nuclei together. But these four charges corresponding to three forces are not the end of the story. We can also include two more charges corresponding to the gravitational force. When we include these  each matter particle has two different spin charges  spin up and spin down. So they all split  and give a nice pattern in six dimensional charge space. We can rotate this pattern in six dimensions  and see that it's quite pretty. Right now  this pattern matches our best current knowledge of how nature is built at the tiny scales of these elementary particles. This is what we know for certain. Some of these particles are at the very limit of what we've been able to reach with experiments. From this pattern  we already know the particle physics of these tiny scales. The way the universe works with these tiny scales is very beautiful. But now I'm going to discuss some new and old ideas about things we don't know yet. We want to expand this pattern using mathematics alone  and see if we can get our hands on the whole enchilada. We want to find all the particles and forces that make a complete picture of our universe. And we want to use this picture to predict new particles that we'll see when experiments reach higher energies. So there's an old idea in particle physics that this known pattern of charges  which is not very symmetric  could emerge from a more perfect pattern that gets broken    similar to how the Higgs particle breaks the electroweak pattern to give electromagnetism. In order to do this  we need to introduce new forces with new charge directions. When we introduce a new direction  we get to guess what charges the particles have along this direction  and then we can rotate it in with the others. If we guess wisely  we can construct the standard charges in six charge dimensions as a broken symmetry of this more perfect pattern in seven charge dimensions. This particular choice corresponds to a grand unified theory introduced by Pati and Salam in     . When we look at this new unified pattern  we can see a couple of gaps where particles seem to be missing. This is the way theories of unification work. A physicist looks for larger  more symmetric patterns that include the established pattern as a subset. The larger pattern allows us to predict the existence of particles that have never been seen. This unification model predicts the existence of these two new force particles  which should act a lot like the weak force  only weaker. Now we can rotate this set of charges in seven dimensions and consider an odd fact about the matter particles  the second and third generations of matter have exactly the same charges in six dimensional charge space as the first generation. These particles are not uniquely identified by their six charges. They sit on top of one another in the standard charge space. However  if we work in eight dimensional charge space  then we can assign unique new charges to each particle. Then we can spin these in eight dimensions  and see what the whole pattern looks like. Here we can see the second and third generations of matter now related to the first generation by a symmetry called  triality.  This particular pattern of charges in eight dimensions is actually part of the most beautiful geometric structure in mathematics. It's a pattern of the largest exceptional Lie group  E . This Lie group is a smooth  curved shape with     dimensions. Each point in this pattern corresponds to a symmetry of this very complex and beautiful shape. One small part of this E  shape can be used to describe the curved space time of Einstein's general relativity  explaining gravity. Together with quantum mechanics  the geometry of this shape could describe everything about how the universe works at the tiniest scales. The pattern of this shape living in eight dimensional charge space is exquisitely beautiful  and it summarizes thousands of possible interactions between these elementary particles  each of which is just a facet of this complicated shape. As we spin it  we can see many of the other intricate patterns contained in this one. And with a particular rotation  we can look down through this pattern in eight dimensions along a symmetry axis and see all the particles at once. It's a very beautiful object  and as with any unification  we can see some holes where new particles are required by this pattern. There are    gaps where new particles should be  two of which have been filled by the Pati Salam particles. From their location in this pattern  we know that these new particles should be scalar fields like the Higgs particle  but have color charge and interact with the strong force. Filling in these new particles completes this pattern  giving us the full E . This E  pattern has very deep mathematical roots. It's considered by many to be the most beautiful structure in mathematics. It's a fantastic prospect that this object of great mathematical beauty could describe the truth of particle interactions at the smallest scales imaginable. And this idea that nature is described by mathematics is not at all new. In       Galileo wrote this   Nature's grand book  which stands continually open to our gaze  is written in the language of mathematics. Its characters are triangles  circles and other geometrical figures  without which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it  without these  one is wandering around in a dark labyrinth.  I believe this to be true  and I've tried to follow Galileo's guidance in describing the mathematics of particle physics using only triangles  circles and other geometrical figures. Of course  when other physicists and I actually work on this stuff  the mathematics can resemble a dark labyrinth. But it's reassuring that at the heart of this mathematics is pure  beautiful geometry. Joined with quantum mechanics  this mathematics describes our universe as a growing E  coral  with particles interacting at every location in all possible ways according to a beautiful pattern. And as more of the pattern comes into view using new machines like the Large Hadron Collider  we may be able to see whether nature uses this E  pattern or a different one. This process of discovery is a wonderful adventure to be involved in. If the LHC finds particles that fit this E  pattern  that will be very  very cool. If the LHC finds new particles  but they don't fit this pattern    well  that will be very interesting  but bad for this E  theory. And  of course  bad for me personally. Now how bad would that be  Well  pretty bad. But predicting how nature works is a very risky game. This theory and others like it are long shots. One does a lot of hard work knowing that most of these ideas probably won't end up being true about nature. That's what doing theoretical physics is like  there are a lot of wipeouts. In this regard  new physics theories are a lot like start up companies. As with any large investment  it can be emotionally difficult to abandon a line of research when it isn't working out. But in science  if something isn't working  you have to toss it out and try something else. Now  the only way to maintain sanity and achieve happiness in the midst of this uncertainty is to keep balance and perspective in life. I've tried the best I can to live a balanced life. I try to balance my life equally between physics  love and surfing    my own three charge directions. This way  even if the physics I work on comes to nothing  I still know I've lived a good life. And I try to live in beautiful places. For most of the past ten years I've lived on the island of Maui  a very beautiful place. Now it's one of the greatest mysteries in the universe to my parents how I managed to survive all that time without engaging in anything resembling full time employment. I'm going to let you in on that secret. This was a view from my home office on Maui. And this is another  and another. And you may have noticed that these beautiful views are similar  but in slightly different places. That's because this used to be my home and office on Maui. I've chosen a very unusual life. But not worrying about rent allowed me to spend my time doing what I love. Living a nomadic existence has been hard at times  but it's allowed me to live in beautiful places and keep a balance in my life that I've been happy with. It allows me to spend a lot of my time hanging out with hyper intelligent coral. But I also greatly enjoy the company of hyper intelligent people. So I'm very happy to have been invited here to TED. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  I probably understood two percent of that  but I still absolutely loved it. So I'm going to sound dumb. Your theory of everything    Garrett Lisi  I'm used to coral. CA  That's right. The reason it's got a few people at least excited is because  if you're right  it brings gravity and quantum theory together. So are you saying that we should think of the universe  at its heart    that the smallest things that there are  are somehow an E  object of possibility  I mean  is there a scale to it  at the smallest scale  or ...  GL  Well  right now the pattern I showed you that corresponds to what we know about elementary particle physics    that already corresponds to a very beautiful shape. And that's the one that I said we knew for certain. And that shape has remarkable similarities    and the way it fits into this E  pattern could be the rest of the picture. And these patterns of points that I've shown for you actually represent symmetries of this high dimensional object that would be warping and moving and dancing over the space time that we experience. And that would be what explains all these elementary particles that we see. CA  But a string theorist  as I understand it  explains electrons in terms of much smaller strings vibrating    I know you don't like string theory    vibrating inside it. How should we think of an electron in relation to E   GL  No  it would be one of the symmetries of this E  shape. So what's happening is  as the shape is moving over space time  it's twisting. And the direction it's twisting as it moves is what particle we see. So it would be    CA  The size of the E  shape  how does that relate to the electron  I kind of feel like I need that for my picture. Is it bigger  Is it smaller  GL  Well  as far as we know electrons are point particles  so this would be going down to the smallest possible scales. So the way these things are explained in quantum field theory is  all possibilities are expanding and developing at once. And this is why I use the analogy to coral. And in this way  the way that E  comes in is it will be as a shape that's attached at each point in space time. And  as I said  the way the shape twists    the directional along which way the shape is twisting as it moves over this curved surface    is what the elementary particles are  themselves. So through quantum field theory  they manifest themselves as points and interact that way. I don't know if I'll be able to make this any clearer. CA  It doesn't really matter. It's evoking a kind of sense of wonder  and I certainly want to understand more of this. But thank you so much for coming. That was absolutely fascinating. I dabble in design. I'm a curator of architecture and design  I happen to be at the Museum of Modern Art. But what we're going to talk about today is really design. Really good designers are like sponges  they really are curious and absorb every kind of information that comes their way  and transform it so that it can be used by people like us. And so that gives me an opportunity  because every design show that I curate kind of looks at a different world. And it's great  because it seems like every time I change jobs. And what I'm going to do today is I'm going to give you a preview of the next exhibition that I'm working on  which is called  Design and the Elastic Mind.  The world that I decided to focus on this particular time is the world of science and the world of technology. Technology always comes into play when design is involved  but science does a little less. But designers are great at taking big revolutions that happen and transforming them so that we can use them. And this is what this exhibition looks at. If you think about your life today  you go every day through many different scales  many different changes of rhythm and pace. You work over different time zones  you talk to very different people  you multitask. We all know it  and we do it kind of automatically. Some of the minds in this audience are super elastic  others are a little slower  others have a few stretch marks  but nonetheless this is a quite exceptional audience from that viewpoint. Other people are not as elastic. I can't get my father in Italy to work on the Internet. He doesn't want to put high speed Internet at home. And that's because there's some little bit of fear  little bit of resistance or just clogged mechanisms. So designers work on this particular malaise that we have  these kinds of discomforts that we have  and try to make life easier for us. Elasticity of mind is something that we really need  you know  we really need  we really cherish and we really work on. And this exhibition is about the work of designers that help us be more elastic  and also of designers that really work on this elasticity as an opportunity. And one last thing is that it's not only designers  but it's also scientists. And before I launch into the display of some of the slides and into the preview  I would like to point out this beautiful detail about scientists and design. You can say that the relationship between science and design goes back centuries. You can of course talk about Leonardo da Vinci and many other Renaissance men and women    and there's a gigantic history behind it. But according to a really great science historian you might know  Peter Galison    he teaches at Harvard    what nanotechnology in particular and quantum physics have brought to designers is this renewed interest  this real passion for design. So basically  the idea of being able to build things bottom up  atom by atom  has made them all into tinkerers. And all of a sudden scientists are seeking designers  just like designers are seeking scientists. It's a brand new love affair that we're trying to cultivate at MOMA. Together with Adam Bly  who is the founder of Seed magazine    that's now a multimedia company  you might know it    we founded about a year ago a monthly salon for designers and scientists  and it's quite beautiful. And Keith has come  and also Jonathan has come and many others. And it was great  because at the beginning was this apology fest    you know  scientists would tell designers  you know  I don't know what style is  I'm not really elegant. And designers would like  oh  I don't know how to do an equation  I don't understand what you're saying. And then all of a sudden they really started talking each others' language  and now we're already at the point that they collaborate. Paul Steinhardt  a physicist from New York  and Aranda Lasch  architects  collaborated in an installation in London at the Serpentine. And it's really interesting to see how this happens. The exhibition will talk about the work of both designers and scientists  and show how they're presenting the possibilities of the future to us. I'm showing to you different sections of the show right now  just to give you a taste of it. Nanophysics and nanotechnology  for instance  have really opened the designer's mind. In this case I'm showing more the designers' work  because they're the ones that have really been stimulated. A lot of the objects in the show are concepts  not objects that exist already. But what you're looking at here is the work of some scientists from UCLA. This kind of alphabet soup is a new way to mark proteins    not only by color but literally by alphabet letters. So they construct it  and they can construct all kinds of forms at the nanoscale. This is the work of design students from the Royal College of Arts in London that have been working together with their tutor  Tony Dunne  and with a bunch of scientists around Great Britain on the possibilities of nanotechnology for design in the future. New sensing elements on the body    you can grow hairs on your nails  and therefore grab some of the particles from another person. They seem very  very obsessed with finding out more about the ideal mate. So they're working on enhancing everything  touch  smell    everything they can  in order to find the perfect mate. Very interesting. This is a typeface designer from Israel who has designed    he calls them  typosperma.  He's thinking    of course it's all a concept    of injecting typefaces into spermatozoa  I don't know how to say it in English    spermatazoi    in order to make them become    to almost have a song or a whole poem written with every ejaculation.  Laughter  I tell you  designers are quite fantastic  you know. So  tissue design. In this case too  you have a mixture of scientists and designers. This here is part of the same lab at the Royal College of Arts. The RCA is really quite an amazing school from that viewpoint. One of the assignments for a year was to work with in vitro meat. You know that already you can grow meat in vitro. In Australia they did it    this research company  called SymbioticA. But the problem is that it's a really ugly patty. And so  the assignment to the students was  how should the steak of tomorrow be  When you don't have to kill cows and it can have any shape  what should it be like  So this particular student  James King  went around the beautiful English countryside  picked the best  best cow that he could see  and then put her in the MRI machine. Then  he took the scans of the best organs and made the meat    of course  this is done with a Japanese resins food maker  but you know  in the future it could be made better    which reproduces the best MRI scan of the best cow he could find. Instead  this element here is much more banal. Something that you know can be done already is to grow bone tissue  so that you can make a wedding ring out of the bone tissue of your loved one    literally. So  this is indeed made of human bone tissue. This is SymbioticA  and they've been working    they were the first ones to do this in vitro meat    and now they've also done an in vitro coat  a leather coat. It's miniscule  but it's a real coat. It's shaped like one. So  we'll be able to really not have any excuse to be wearing everything leather in the future. One of the most important topics of the show    you know  as anything in our life today  we can look at it from many  many different viewpoints  and at different levels. One of the most interesting and most important concepts is the idea of scale. We change scale very often  we change resolution of screens  and we're not really fazed by it  we do it very comfortably. So you go  even in the exhibition  from the idea of nanotechnology and the nanoscale to the manipulation of really great amounts of data    the mapping and tagging of the universe and of the world. In this particular case a section will be devoted to information design. You see here the work of Ben Fry. This is  Human vs. Chimps     the few chromosomes that distinguish us from chimps. It was a beautiful visualization that he did for Seed magazine. And here's the whole code of Pac Man  visualized with all the go to  go back to  also made into a beautiful choreography. And then also graphs by scientists  this beautiful diagraph of protein homology. Scientists are starting to also consider aesthetics. We were discussing with Keith Shrubb  this morning the fact that many scientists tend not to use anything beautiful in their presentations  otherwise they're afraid of being considered dumb blondes. So they pick the worst background from any kind of PowerPoint presentation  the worst typeface. It's only recently that this kind of marriage between design and science is producing some of the first  pretty     if we can say so    scientific presentations. Another aspect of contemporary design that I think is mind opening  promising and will really be the future of design  is the idea of collective design. You know  the whole XO laptop  from One Laptop per Child  is based on the idea of collaboration and mash and networking. So  the more the merrier. The more computers  the stronger the signal  and children work on the interface so that it's all based on doing things together  tasks together. So the idea of collective design is something that will become even bigger in the future  and this is chosen as an example. Related to the idea of collective design and to the new balance between the individual and the collectiveness  collectivity is the idea of existence maximum. That's a term that I coined a few years ago while I was thinking of how pressed we are together  and at the same time how these small objects  like the Walkman first and then the iPod  create bubbles of space around us that enable us to have a metaphysical space that is much bigger than our physical space. You can be in the subway and you can be completely isolated and have your own room in your iPod. And this is the work of several designers that really enhance the idea of solitude and expansion by means of various techniques. This is a spa telephone. The idea is that it's become so difficult to have a private conversation anywhere that you go to the spa  you have a massage  you have a facial  maybe a rub  and then you have this beautiful pool with this perfect temperature  and you can have this isolation tank phone conversation with whomever you've been wanting to talk with for a long time. And same thing here  Social Tele presence. It's actually already used by the military a little bit  but it's the idea of being able to be somewhere else with your senses while you're removed from it physically. And this is called Blind Date. It's a  unclear   so if you're too shy to be really at the date  you can stay at a distance with your flowers and somebody else reenacts the date for you. Rapid manufacturing is another big area in which technology and design are  I think  bound to change the world. You've heard about it before many times. Rapid manufacturing is a computer file sent directly from the computer to the manufacturing machine. It used to be called rapid prototyping  rapid modeling. It started out in the '  s  but at the beginning it was machines carving out of a foam block a model that was very  very fragile  and could not have any real use. Slowly but surely  the materials became better    better resins. Techniques became better    not only carving but also stereolithography and laser    solidifying all kinds of resins  whether in powder or in liquid form. And the vats became bigger  to the point that now we can have actual chairs made by rapid manufacturing. It takes seven days today to manufacture a chair  but you know what  One day it will take seven hours. And then the dream is that you'll be able to  from home  customize your chair. You know  companies and designers will be designing the matrix or the margins that respect both solidity and brand  and design identity. And then you can send it to the Kinko's store at the corner and go get your chair. Now  the implications of this are enormous  not only regarding the participation of the final buyer in the design process  but also no tracking  no warehousing  no wasted materials. Also  I can imagine many design manufacturers will have to retool their own business plans and maybe invest in this Kinko's store. But it really is a big change. And here I'm showing a picture that was in Wired Magazine    you know  the Artifacts of the Future section that I love so much    that shows you can have your desktop  D printer and print your own basketball. But here instead are examples  you can already  D print textiles  which is very interesting. This is just a really nice touch    it's called slow prototyping. It's a designer that put        bees at work and they built this vase. They had a particular shape that they had to stay in. Mapping and tagging. As the capacity of computers becomes really  really big  and the capacity of our mind not that much bigger  we find that we need to tag as much as we can what we do in order to then retrace our path. Also  we do it in order to share with other people. Again  this communal sense of experience that seems to be so important today. So  various ways to map and tag are also the work of many designers nowadays. Also  the senses    designers and scientists all work on trying to expand our senses capabilities so that we can achieve more. And also animal senses in a way. This particular object that many people love so much is actually based on kind of a scientific experiment    the fact that bees have a very strong olfactory sense  and so    much like dogs that can smell certain kinds of skin cancer    bees can be trained by Pavlovian reflex to detect one type of cancer  and also pregnancy. And so this student at the RCA designed this beautiful blown glass object where the bees move from one chamber to the other if they detect that particular smell that signifies  in this case  pregnancy. Another shape is made for cancer. Design for Debate is a very interesting new endeavor that designers have really shaped for themselves. Some designers don't design objects  products  things that we're going to actually use  but rather  they design scenarios that are object based. They're still very useful. They help companies and other designers think better about the future. And usually they are accompanied by videos. This is quite beautiful. It's Dunne and Raby   All the Robots.  Those are a series of robots that are meant to be taken care of. We always think that robots will take care of us  and instead they designed these robots that are very  very needy. You need to take one in your arms and look at it in the eyes for about five minutes before it does something. Another one gets really  really nervous if you get in to the room  and starts shaking  so you have to calm it down. So it's really a way to make us think more about what robots mean to us. Noam Toran and  Accessories for Lonely Men   the idea is that when you lose your loved one or you go through a bad breakup  what you miss the most are those annoying things that you used to hate when you were with the other person. So he designed all these series of accessories. This one is something that takes away the sheets from you at night. Then there's another one that breathes on your neck. There's another one that throws plates and breaks them. So it's just this idea of what we really miss in life. Elio Caccavale  he took the idea of those dolls that explain leukemia. He's working on dolls that explain xenotransplantation  and also the spider gene into the goat  from a few years ago. He's working for the exhibition on a whole series of dolls that explain to children where babies come from today. Because it's not anymore Mom  Dad  the flowers and the bees  and then there's the baby. No  it can be two moms  three dads  in vitro    there's the whole idea of how babies can be made today that has changed. So it's a series of dolls that he's working on right now. One of the most beautiful things is that designers really work on life  even though they take technology into account. And many designers have been working recently on the idea of death and mourning  and what we can do about it today with new technologies. Or how we should behave about it with new technologies. These three objects over there are hard drives with a Bluetooth connection. But they're in reality very  very beautiful sculpted artifacts that contain the whole desktop and computer memory of somebody who passed away. So instead of having only the pictures  you will be able to put this object next to the computer and all of a sudden have  you know  Gertrude's whole life and all of her files and her address book come alive. And this is even better. This is Auger Loizeau   AfterLife.  It's the idea that some people don't believe in an afterlife. So to give them something tangible that shows that there is something after death  they take the gastric juices of people who passed away and concentrate them  and put them into a battery that can actually be used to power flashlights. They also go    you know  sex toys  whatever. It's quite amazing how these things can make you smile  can make you laugh  can make you cry sometimes. But I'm hoping that this particular exhibition will be able to trace a new portrait of where design is going    which is always  hopefully  a portrait a few years in advance of where the world is going. Thank you very much. You might be wondering why I'm wearing sunglasses  and one answer to that is  because I'm here to talk about glamour. So  we all think we know what glamour is. Here it is. It's glamorous movie stars  like Marlene Dietrich. And it comes in a male form  too    very glamorous. Not only can he shoot  drive  drink    you know  he drinks wine  there actually is a little wine in there    and of course  always wears a tuxedo. But I think that glamour actually has a much broader meaning    one that is true for the movie stars and the fictional characters  but also comes in other forms. A magazine  Well  it's certainly not this one. This is the least glamorous magazine on the newsstand    it's all about sex tips. Sex tips are not glamorous. And Drew Barrymore  for all her wonderful charm  is not glamorous either. But there is a glamour of industry. This is Margaret Bourke White's    one of her pictures she did. Fantastic  glamorous pictures of steel mills and paper mills and all kinds of glamorous industrial places. And there's the mythic glamour of the garage entrepreneur. This is the Hewlett Packard garage. We know everyone who starts a business in a garage ends up founding Hewlett Packard. There's the glamour of physics. What could be more glamorous than understanding the entire universe  grand unification  And  by the way  it helps if you're Brian Greene    he has other kinds of glamour. And there is  of course  this glamour. This is very  very glamorous  the glamour of outer space    and not the alien style glamour  but the nice  clean  early '  s version. So what do we mean by glamour  Well  one thing you can do if you want to know what glamour means is you can look in the dictionary. And it actually helps a lot more if you look in a very old dictionary  in this case the      dictionary. Because for centuries  glamour had a very particular meaning  and the word was actually used differently from the way we think of it. You had  a  glamour. It wasn't glamour as a quality    you  cast a glamour.  Glamour was a literal magic spell. Not a metaphorical one  the way we use it today  but a literal magic spell associated with witches and gypsies and to some extent  Celtic magic. And over the years  around the turn of the   th century  it started to take on this other kind of deception    this definition for any artificial interest in  or association with  an object through which it appears delusively magnified or glorified. But still  glamour is an illusion. Glamour is a magic spell. And there's something dangerous about glamour throughout most of history. When the witches cast a magic spell on you  it was not in your self interest    it was to get you to act against your interest. Well of course  in the   th century  glamour came to have this different meaning associated with Hollywood. And this is Hedy Lamarr. Hedy Lamarr said   Anyone can look glamorous  all you have to do is sit there and look stupid.   Laughter  But in fact  with all due respect to Hedy    about whom we'll hear more later    there's a lot more to it. There was a tremendous amount of technical achievement associated with creating this Hollywood glamour. There were scores of retouchers and lighting experts and make up experts. You can go to the museum of Hollywood history in Hollywood and see Max Factor's special rooms that he painted different colors depending on the complexion of the star he was going to make up. So you've got this highly stylized portrait of something that was not entirely of this earth    it was a portrait of a star. And actually  we see glamorized photos of stars all the time    they call them false color. Glamour is a form of falsification  but falsification to achieve a particular purpose. It may be to illuminate the star  it may be to sell a film. And it involves a great deal of technique. It's not    glamour is not something    you don't wake up in the morning glamorous. I don't care who you are. Even Nicole Kidman doesn't wake up in the morning glamorous. There is a process of  idealization  glorification and dramatization   and it's not just the case for people. Glamour doesn't have to be people. Architectural photography    Julius Schulman  who has talked about transfiguration  took this fabulous  famous picture of the Kauffman House. Architectural photography is extremely glamorous. It puts you into this special  special world. This is Alex Ross's comic book art  which appears to be extremely realistic  as part of his style is he gives you a kind of realism in his comic art. Except that light doesn't work this way in the real world. When you stack people in rows  the ones in the background look smaller than the ones in the foreground    but not in the world of glamour. What glamour is all about    I took this from a blurb in the table of contents of New York magazine  which was telling us that glamour is back    glamour is all about transcending the everyday. And I think that that's starting to get at what the core that combines all sorts of glamour is. This is Filippino Lippi's      portrait of Saint Apollonia. And I don't know who she is either  but this is the    th  century equivalent of a supermodel. It's a very glamorous portrait. Why is it glamorous  It's glamorous  first  because she is beautiful    but that does not make you glamorous  that only makes you beautiful. She is graceful  she is mysterious and she is transcendent  and those are the central qualities of glamour. You don't see her eyes  they're looking downward. She's not looking away from you exactly  but you have to mentally imagine her world. She's encouraging you to contemplate this higher world to which she belongs  where she can be completely tranquil while holding the iron instruments of her death by torture. Mel Gibson's  Passion Of The Christ     not glamorous. That's glamour  that's Michelangelo's  Pieta   where Mary is the same age as Jesus and they're both awfully happy and pleasant. Glamour invites us to live in a different world. It has to simultaneously be mysterious  a little bit distant    that's why  often in these glamour shots  the person is not looking at the audience  it's why sunglasses are glamorous    but also not so far above us that we can't identify with the person. In some sense  there has to be something like us. So as I say  in religious art  you know  God is not glamorous. God cannot be glamorous because God is omnipotent  omniscient    too far above us. And yet you will see in religious art  saints or the Virgin Mary will often be portrayed    not always    in glamorous forms. As I said earlier  glamour does not have to be about people  but it has to have this transcendent quality. What is it about Superman  Aside from Alex Ross's style  which is very glamorous  one thing about Superman is he makes you believe that a man can fly. Glamour is all about transcending this world and getting to an idealized  perfect place. And this is one reason that modes of transportation tend to be extremely glamorous. The less experience we have with them  the more glamorous they are. So you can do a glamorized picture of a car  but you can't do a glamorized picture of traffic. You can do a glamorized picture of an airplane  but not the inside. The notion is that it's going to transport you  and the story is not about  you know  the guy in front of you in the airplane  who has this nasty little kid  or the big cough. The story is about where you're arriving  or thinking about where you're arriving. And this sense of being transported is one reason that we have glamour styling. This sort of streamlining styling is not just glamorous because we associate it with movies of that period  but because  in it's streamlining  it transports us from the everyday. The same thing    arches are very glamorous. Arches with stained glass    even more glamorous. Staircases that curve away from you are glamorous. I happen to find that particular staircase picture very glamorous because  to me  it captures the whole promise of the academic contemplative life    but maybe that's because I went to Princeton. Anyway  skylines are super glamorous  city streets    not so glamorous. You know  when you get  actually to this town it has reality. The horizon  the open road  is very  very glamorous. There are few things more glamorous than the horizon    except  possibly  multiple horizons. Of course  here you don't feel the cold  or the heat    you just see the possibilities. In order to pull glamour off  you need this Renaissance quality of sprezzatura  which is a term coined by Castiglione in his book   The Book Of The Courtier.  There's the not glamorous version of what it looks like today  after a few centuries. And sprezzatura is the art that conceals art. It makes things look effortless. You don't think about how Nicole Kidman is maneuvering that dress    she just looks completely natural. And I remember reading  after the Lara Croft movies  how Angelina Jolie would go home completely black and blue. Of course  they covered that with make up  because Lara Croft did all those same stunts    but she doesn't get black and blue  because she has sprezzatura.  To conceal all art and make whatever is done or said appear to be without effort   And this is one of the critical aspects of glamour. Glamour is about editing. How do you create the sense of transcendence  the sense of evoking a perfect world  The sense of  you know  life could be better  I could join this    I could be a perfect person  I could join this perfect world. We don't tell you all the grubby details. Now  this was kindly lent to me by Jeff Bezos  from last year. This is underneath Jeff's desk. This is what the real world of computers  lamps  electrical appliances of all kinds  looks like. But if you look in a catalog    particularly a catalog of modern  beautiful objects for your home    it looks like this. There are no cords. Look next time you get these catalogs in your mail    you can usually figure out where they hid the cord. But there's always this illusion that if you buy this lamp  you will live in a world without cords.  Laughter  And the same thing is true of  if you buy this laptop or you buy this computer    and even in these wireless eras  you don't get to live in the world without cords. You have to have mystery and you have to have grace. And there she is    Grace. This is the most glamorous picture  I think  ever. Part of the thing is that  in  Rear Window   the question is  is she too glamorous to live in his world  And the answer is no  but of course it's really just a movie. Here's Hedy Lamarr again. And  you know  this kind of head covering is extremely glamorous because  like sunglasses  it conceals and reveals at the same time. Translucence is glamorous    that's why all these people wear pearls. It's why barware is glamorous. Glamour is translucent    not transparent  not opaque. It invites us into the world but it doesn't give us a completely clear picture. And I think if Grace Kelly is the most glamorous person  maybe a spiral staircase with glass block may be the most glamorous interior shot  because a spiral staircase is incredibly glamorous. It has that sense of going up and away  and yet you never think about how you would really trip if you were    particularly going down. And of course glass block has that sense of translucence. So  this session's supposed to be about pure pleasure but glamour's really partly about meaning. All individuals and all cultures have ideals that cannot possibly be realized in reality. They have contradictions  they uphold principles that are incommensurable with each other    whatever it is    and yet these ideals give meaning and purpose to our lives as cultures and as individuals. And the way we deal with that is we displace them    we put them into a golden world  an imagined world  an age of heroes  the world to come. And in the life of an individual  we often associate that with some object. The white picket fence  the perfect house. The perfect kitchen    no bills on the counter in the perfect kitchen. You know  you buy that Viking range  this is what your kitchen will look like. The perfect love life    symbolized by the perfect necklace  the perfect diamond ring. The perfect getaway in your perfect car. This is an interior design firm that is literally called Utopia. The perfect office    again  no cords  as far as I can tell. And certainly  no  it doesn't look a thing like my office. I mean  there's no paper on the desk. We want this golden world. And some people get rich enough  and if they have their ideals    in a sort of domestic sense  they get to acquire their perfect world. Dean Koontz built this fabulous home theater  which is    I don't think accidentally    in Art Deco style. That symbolizes this sense of being safe and at home. This is not always good  because what is your perfect world  What is your ideal  and also  what has been edited out  Is it something important   The Matrix  is a movie that is all about glamour. I could do a whole talk on  The Matrix  and glamour. It was criticized for glamorizing violence  because  look    sunglasses and those long coats  and  of course  they could walk up walls and do all these kinds of things that are impossible in the real world. This is another Margaret Bourke White photo. This is from Soviet Union. Attractive. I mean  look how happy the people are  and good looking too. You know  we're marching toward Utopia. I'm not a fan of PETA  but I think this is a great ad. Because what they're doing is they're saying  your coat's not so glamorous  what's been edited out is something important. But actually  what's even more important than remembering what's been edited out is thinking  are the ideals good  Because glamour can be very totalitarian and deceptive. And it's not just a matter of glamorizing cleaning your floor. This is from  Triumph Of The Will     brilliant editing to cut together things. There's a glamour shot. National Socialism is all about glamour. It was a very aesthetic ideology. It was all about cleaning up Germany  and the West  and the world  and ridding it of anything unglamorous. So glamour can be dangerous. I think glamour has a genuine appeal  has a genuine value. I'm not against glamour. But there's a kind of wonder in the stuff that gets edited away in the cords of life. And there is both a way to avoid the dangers of glamour and a way to broaden your appreciation of it. And that's to take Isaac Mizrahi's advice and confront the manipulation of it all  and sort of admit that manipulation is something that we enjoy  but also enjoy how it happens. And here's Hedy Lamarr. She's very glamorous but  you know  she invented spread spectrum technology. So she's even more glamorous if you know that she really wasn't stupid  even though she thought she could look stupid. David Hockney talks about how the appreciation of this very glamorous painting is heightened if you think about the fact that it takes two weeks to paint this splash  which only took a fraction of a second to happen. There is a book out in the bookstore    it's called  Symphony In Steel   and it's about the stuff that's hidden under the skin of the Disney Center. And that has a fascination. It's not necessarily glamorous  but unveiling the glamour has an appeal. There's a wonderful book called  Crowns  that's all these glamour pictures of black women in their church hats. And there's a quote from one of these women  and she talks about   As a little girl  I'd admire women at church with beautiful hats. They looked like beautiful dolls  like they'd just stepped out of a magazine. But I also knew how hard they worked all week. Sometimes under those hats there's a lot of joy and a lot of sorrow.  And  actually  you get more appreciation for glamour when you realize what went into creating it. Thank you. This session is on natural wonders  and the bigger conference is on the pursuit of happiness. I want to try to combine them all  because to me  healing is really the ultimate natural wonder. Your body has a remarkable capacity to begin healing itself  and much more quickly than people had once realized  if you simply stop doing what s causing the problem. And so  really  so much of what we do in medicine and life in general is focused on mopping up the floor without also turning off the faucet. I love doing this work  because it really gives many people new hope and new choices that they didn t have before  and it allows us to talk about things that    not just diet  but that happiness is not    we're talking about the pursuit of happiness  but when you really look at all the spiritual traditions  what Aldous Huxley called the  perennial wisdom   when you get past the named and forms and rituals that really divide people  it s really about    our nature is to be happy  our nature is to be peaceful  our nature is to be healthy. And so it s not something    happiness is not something you get  health is generally not something that you get. But rather all of these different practices    you know  the ancient swamis and rabbis and priests and monks and nuns didn t develop these techniques to just manage stress or lower your blood pressure  unclog your arteries  even though it can do all those things. They re powerful tools for transformation  for quieting down our mind and bodies to allow us to experience what it feels like to be happy  to be peaceful  to be joyful and to realize that it s not something that you pursue and get  but rather it s something that you have already until you disturb it. I studied yoga for many years with a teacher named Swami Satchidananda and people would say   What are you  a Hindu   He d say   No  I m an undo.  And it s really about identifying what s causing us to disturb our innate health and happiness  and then to allow that natural healing to occur. To me  that s the real natural wonder. So  within that larger context  we can talk about diet  stress management    which are really these spiritual practices    moderate exercise  smoking cessation  support groups and community    which I ll talk more about    and some vitamins and supplements. And it s not a diet. You know  when most people think about the diet I recommend  they think it s a really strict diet. For reversing disease  that s what it takes  but if you re just trying to be healthy  you have a spectrum of choices. And to the degree that you can move in a healthy direction  you re going to live longer  you re going to feel better  you re going to lose weight  and so on. And in our studies  what we ve been able to do is to use very expensive  high tech  state of the art measures to prove how powerful these very simple and low tech and low cost    and in many ways  ancient    interventions  can be. We first began by looking at heart disease  and when I began doing this work    or    years ago  it was thought that once you have heart disease it can only get worse. And what we found was that  instead of getting worse and worse  in many cases it could get better and better  and much more quickly than people had once realized. This is a representative patient who at the time was       totally needed to have a bypass  decided to do this instead. We used quantitative arteriography  showing the narrowing. This is one of the arteries that feed the heart  one of the main arteries  and you can see the narrowing here. A year later  it s not as clogged  normally  it goes the other direction. These minor changes in blockages caused a     percent improvement in blood flow  and using cardiac positron emission tomography  or  PET   scans  blue and black is no blood flow  orange and white is maximal. Huge differences can occur without drugs  without surgery. Clinically  he literally couldn t walk across the street without getting severe chest pain  within a month  like most people  was pain free  and within a year  climbing more than     floors a day on a Stairmaster. This is not unusual  and it s part of what enables people to maintain these kinds of changes  because it makes such a big difference in their quality of life. Overall  if you looked at all the arteries in all the patients  they got worse and worse  from one year to five years  in the comparison group. This is the natural history of heart disease  but it s really not natural because we found it could get better and better  and much more quickly than people had once thought. We also found that the more people change  the better they got. It wasn t a function of how old or how sick they were    it was mainly how much they changed  and the oldest patients improved as much as the young ones. I got this as a Christmas card a few years ago from two of the patients in one of our programs. The younger brother is     the older one s     they wanted to show me how much more flexible they were. And the following year they sent me this one  which I thought was kind of funny. You just never know. And what we found was that    percent of the patients start to reverse the progression of their heart disease. Now I thought  you know  if we just did good science  that would change medical practice. But  that was a little naive. It s important  but not enough. Because we doctors do what we get paid to do  and we get trained to do what we get paid to do  so if we change insurance  then we change medical practice and medical education. Insurance will cover the bypass  it ll cover the angioplasty  it won t  until recently  cover diet and lifestyle. So  we began through our nonprofit institute's training hospitals around the country  and we found that most people could avoid surgery  and not only was it medically effective  it was also cost effective. And the insurance companies found that they began to save almost        dollars per patient  and Medicare is now in the middle of doing a demonstration project where they re paying for       people to go through the program on the sites that we train. The fortuneteller says   I give smokers a discount because there s not as much to tell.   Laughter  I like this slide  because it s a chance to talk about what really motivates people to change  and what doesn t. And what doesn t work is fear of dying  and that s what s normally used. Everybody who smokes knows it s not good for you  and still    percent of Americans smoke       percent in some parts of the world. Why do people do it  Well  because it helps them get through the day. And I ll talk more about this  but the real epidemic isn t just heart disease or obesity or smoking    it s loneliness and depression. As one woman said   I ve got    friends in this package of cigarettes  and they re always there for me and nobody else is. You re going to take away my    friends  What are you going to give me   Or they eat when they get depressed  or they use alcohol to numb the pain  or they work too hard  or watch too much TV. There are lots of ways we have of avoiding and numbing and bypassing pain  but the point of all of this is to deal with the cause of the problem. And the pain is not the problem  it s the symptom. And telling people they re going to die is too scary to think about  or  they re going to get emphysema or heart attack is too scary  and so they don t want to think about it  so they don t. The most effective anti smoking ad was this one. You ll notice the limp cigarette hanging out of his mouth  and  impotence     the headline is   Impotent     it s not emphysema. What was the biggest selling drug of all time when it was introduced a few years ago  Viagra  right  Why  Because a lot of guys need it. It s not like you say   Hey Joe  I m having erectile dysfunction  how about you   And yet  look at the number of prescriptions that are being sold. It s not so much psychological  it s vascular  and nicotine makes your arteries constrict. So does cocaine  so does a high fat diet  so does emotional stress. So the very behaviors that we think of as being so sexy in our culture are the very ones that leave so many people feeling tired  lethargic  depressed and impotent  and that s not much fun. But when you change those behaviors  your brain gets more blood  you think more clearly  you have more energy  your heart gets more blood in ways I ve shown you. Your sexual function improves. And these things occur within hours. This is a study  a high fat meal  and within one or two hours blood flow is measurably less    and you ve all experienced this at Thanksgiving. When you eat a big fatty meal  how do you feel  You feel kind of sleepy afterwards. On a low fat meal  the blood flow doesn t go down    it even goes up. Many of you have kids  and you know that s a big change in your lifestyle  and so people are not afraid to make big changes in lifestyle if they re worth it. And the paradox is that when you make big changes  you get big benefits  and you feel so much better so quickly. For many people  those are choices worth making    not to live longer  but to live better. I want to talk a little bit about the obesity epidemic  because it really is a problem. Two thirds of adults are overweight or obese  and diabetes in kids and    year olds has increased    percent in the last    years. It s no joke  it s real. And just to show you this  this is from the CDC. These are not election returns  these are the percentage of people who are overweight. And if you see from '   to '   to '    '    '    '    '      you get a new category     to    percent  '    '    '    '    '    '      you get a new category  '    '          and     . Mississippi  more than    percent of people are overweight. Why is this  Well  this is one way to lose weight that works very well ... but it doesn t last  which is the problem. Now  there s no mystery in how you lose weight  you either burn more calories by exercise or you eat fewer calories. Now  one way to eat fewer calories is to eat less food  which is why you can lose weight on any diet if you eat less food  or if you restrict entire categories of foods. But the problem is  you get hungry  so it s hard to keep it off. The other way is to change the type of food. And fat has nine calories per gram  whereas protein and carbs only have four. So  when you eat less fat  you eat fewer calories without having to eat less food. So you can eat the same amount of food  but you ll be getting fewer calories because the food is less dense in calories. And it s the volume of food that affects satiety  rather than the type of food. You know  I don t like talking about the Atkins diet  but I get asked about it every day  and so I just thought I d spend a few minutes on that. The myth that you hear about is  Americans have been told to eat less fat  the percent of calories from fat is down  Americans are fatter than ever  therefore fat doesn t make you fat. It s a half truth. Actually  Americans are eating more fat than ever  and even more carbs. And so the percentage is lower  the actual amount is higher  and so the goal is to reduce both. Dr. Atkins and I debated each other many times before he died  and we agreed that Americans eat too many simple carbs  the  bad carbs   and these are things like       sugar  white flour  white rice  alcohol. And you get a double whammy  you get all these calories that don t fill you up because you ve removed the fiber  and they get absorbed quickly so your blood sugar zooms up. Your pancreas makes insulin to bring it back down  which is good. But insulin accelerates the conversion of calories into fat. So  the goal is not to go to pork rinds and bacon and sausages    these are not health foods    but to go from  bad carbs  to what are called  good carbs.  And these are things like whole foods  or unrefined carbs  fruits  vegetables  whole wheat flour  brown rice  in their natural forms  are rich in fiber. And the fiber fills you up before you get too many calories  and it slows the absorption so you don t get that rapid rise in blood sugar. So  and you get all the disease protective substances. It s not just what you exclude from your diet  but also what you include that s protective. Just as all carbs are not bad for you  all fats are not bad for you. There are good fats. And these are predominantly what are called the Omega   fatty acids. You find these  for example  in fish oil. And the bad fats are things like trans fatty acids and processed food and saturated fats  which we find in meat. If you don t remember anything else from this talk  three grams a day of fish oil can reduce your risk of a heart attack and sudden death by    to    percent. Three grams a day. They come in one gram capsules  more than that just gives you extra fat you don t need. It also helps reduce the risk of the most common cancers like breast  prostate and colon cancer. Now  the problem with the Atkins diet  everybody knows people who have lost weight on it  but you can lose weight on amphetamines  you know  and fen phen. I mean  there are lots of ways of losing weight that aren t good for you. You want to lose weight in a way that enhances your health rather than the one that harms it. And the problem is that it s based on this half truth  which is that Americans eat too many simple carbs  so if you eat fewer simple carbs you re going to lose weight. You ll lose even more weight if you go to whole foods and less fat  and you ll enhance your health rather than harming it. He says   I ve got some good news. While your cholesterol level has remained the same  the research findings have changed.  Now  what happens to your heart when you go on an Atkins diet  The red is good at the beginning  and a year later    this is from a study done in a peer reviewed journal called Angiology    there s more red after a year on a diet like I would recommend  there s less red  less blood flow after a year on an Atkins type diet. So  yes  you can lose weight  but your heart isn t happy. Now  one of the studies funded by the Atkins Center found that    percent of the people were constipated     percent had bad breath     percent had headaches   this is not a healthy way to eat. And so  you might start to lose weight and start to attract people towards you  but when they get too close it s going to be a problem. And more seriously  there are case reports now of    year old girls who died after a few weeks on the Atkins diet    of bone disease  kidney disease  and so on. And that s how your body excretes waste  is through your breath  your bowels and your perspiration. So when you go on these kinds of diet  they begin to smell bad. So  an optimal diet is low in fat  low in the bad carbs  high in the good carbs and enough of the good fats. And then  again  it s a spectrum  when you move in this direction  you re going to lose weight  you re going to feel better and you re going to gain health. Now  there are ecological reasons for eating lower on the food chain too  whether it s the deforestation of the Amazon  or making more protein available  to the four billion people who live on a dollar a day    not to mention whatever ethical concerns people have. So  there are lots of reasons for eating this way that go beyond just your health. Now  we re about to publish the first study looking at the effects of this program on prostate cancer  and  in collaboration with Sloane Kettering and with UCSF. We took    men who had biopsy proven prostate cancer and who had elected  for reasons unrelated to the study  not to have surgery. We could randomly divide them into two groups  and then we could have one group that is a non intervention control group to compare to  which we can t do with  say  breast cancer  because everyone gets treated. What we found was that  after a year  none of the experimental group patients who made these lifestyle changes needed treatment  whereas six of the control group patients needed surgery or radiation. When we looked at their PSA levels    which is a marker for prostate cancer    they got worse in the control group  but they actually got better in the experimental group  and these differences were highly significant. And then I wondered  was there any relationship between how much people changed their diet and lifestyle    whichever group they were in    and the changes in PSA  And sure enough  we found a dose response relationship  just like we found in the arterial blockages in our cardiac studies. And in order for the PSA to go down  they had to make pretty big changes. I then wondered  well  maybe they re just changing their PSA  but it s not really affecting the tumor growth. So we took some of their blood serum and sent it down to UCLA  they added it to a standard line of prostate tumor cells growing in tissue culture  and it inhibited the growth seven times more in the experimental group than in the control group       versus   percent. And finally  I said  I wonder if there s any relationship between how much people change and how it inhibited their tumor growth  whichever group they happened to be in. And this really got me excited because again  we found the same pattern  the more people change  the more it affected the growth of their tumors. And finally  we did MRI and MR spectroscopy scans on some of these patients  and the tumor activity is shown in red in this patient  and you can see clearly it s better a year later  along with the PSA going down. So  if it s true for prostate cancer  it ll almost certainly be true for breast cancer as well. And whether or not you have conventional treatment  in addition  if you make these changes  it may help reduce the risk of recurrence. The last thing I want to talk about  apropos of the issue of the pursuit of happiness  is that study after study have shown that people who are lonely and depressed    and depression is the other real epidemic in our culture    are many times more likely to get sick and die prematurely  in part because  as we talked about  they re more likely to smoke and overeat and drink too much and work too hard and so on. But also  through mechanisms that we don t fully understand  people who are lonely and depressed are many times    three to five to ten times  in some studies    more likely to get sick and die prematurely. And depression is treatable. We need to do something about that. Now  on the other hand  anything that promotes intimacy is healing. It can be sexual intimacy   I happen to think that healing energy and erotic energy are just different forms of the same thing. Friendship  altruism  compassion  service   all the perennial truths that we talked about that are part of all religion and all cultures    once you stop trying to see the differences  these are the things in our own self interest  because they free us from our suffering and from disease. And it s in a sense the most selfish thing that we can do. Just take a look at one study. This was done by David Spiegel at Stanford. He took women with metastatic breast cancer  randomly divided them into two groups. One group of people just met for an hour and a half once a week in a support group. It was a nurturing  loving environment  where they were encouraged to let down their emotional defenses and talk about how awful it is to have breast cancer with people who understood  because they were going through it too. They just met once a week for a year. Five years later  those women lived twice as long  and you can see that the people    and that was the only difference between the groups. It was a randomized control study published in The Lancet. Other studies have shown this as well. So  these simple things that create intimacy are really healing  and even the word healing  it comes from the root  to make whole.  The word yoga comes from the Sanskrit  meaning  union  to yoke  to bring together.  And the last slide I want to show you is from    I was    again  this swami that I studied with for so many years  and I did a combined oncology and cardiology Grand Rounds at the University of Virginia medical school a couple of years ago. And at the end of it  somebody said   Hey  Swami  what s the difference between wellness and illness   And so he went up on the board and he wrote the word  illness   and circled the first letter  and then wrote the word  wellness   and circled the first two letters ... To me  it s just shorthand for what we re talking about  that anything that creates a sense of connection and community and love is really healing. And then we can enjoy our lives more fully without getting sick in the process. Thank you.  Applause  You all know this story. In the summer of       Enrico Fermi  the Italian American physicist and atomic pile builder  went to lunch at Los Alamos National Laboratory and joined some colleagues there  and asked them a question   Where is everybody   This confused his colleagues  obviously  because they were sitting right there with him. And then he had to clarify that he wasn't talking about them. He was talking about the space aliens. You see  this was only a few years after the supposed flying saucer crash at Roswell  New Mexico. And even though that turned out to be nothing  nothing at all    merely a downed weather balloon piloted by small hairless men with slits for mouths ... Still  America had gone saucer mad  even famous scientists who were eating lunch. Fermi's reasoning  if I may paraphrase badly  is that the universe is so vast that it stands to reason  there should be other intelligent life out there. And the universe is so old that unless we were the very first civilization ever to evolve  we should have some evidence of their existence by now. And yet  to the best of our knowledge  we are alone.  Where is everybody   asked Fermi  and his colleagues had no answer. Fermi then went on with the same blunt logic to disprove fairies  Sasquatch  God  the possibility of love    and thereafter  as you know  Enrico Fermi ate alone. Now  I am not a scientist. I have never built an atomic pile. Although  I might argue that  technically  every pile is atomic. However  with respect  I might point out two possibilities that Enrico Fermi perhaps did not consider. One is that the aliens might be very far away. Perhaps  I dare say  even on other planets. The other possibility    is  perhaps  Enrico Fermi himself was an alien. Think about it. Isn't it a little convenient that in the midst of the World War  out of nowhere  suddenly an Italian scientist showed up with an amazing new technology that would transform everything in the world and darken the history of the human species forever after  And isn't it a little strange that he required no payment for this  That he asked for only one thing    a gift of two healthy sperm whales  That's    that's not true. But it is strange. And if Enrico Fermi were indeed a space alien  wouldn't he be the first to have tried to convince his fellow scientists that the space aliens are not already here  For it is given in certain UFO ology or UFOlogy circles  that the aliens are already here and have been for millennia  that they have walked among us in disguise  observing us  guiding our evolution from ape to man    if you believe in that sort of thing    and  occasionally  kidnapping us in their flying saucers and taking us away to have sex with us in pyramids. It's a difficult theory to discount  I think you'll agree. For even in my own life  there are memories I have that are difficult to explain    happenings that are so odd and unaccountably weird  that it is difficult to imagine they were not the result of prolonged and frequent contact with aliens throughout my life. For how else will you explain the amazing and absolutely true close encounters that I had and will describe to you now  Encounter one  Ocean City  New Jersey      . This was the summer when the special edition of  Close Encounters of the Third Kind  was released. And I went on vacation with my parents to the Jersey shore. Within    hours  I was horribly sunburned  just like Richard Dreyfuss in the movie. And so I spent the rest of the vacation largely sitting outside our little rental house at night  the sidewalk still warm from the sun  watching the skies for UFOs. What did I see  Stars  satellites  blinking airplanes    typical sky junk. Occasionally  kids would come and join me and watch  but their necks soon got sore  and they would go off to the boardwalk to play video games and mingle with humans. I was pretty good at the video games. I was not very good at the other part  so I stayed alone with the cosmos. And that's when it happened. An elderly couple came walking down the street. I would say they were in their late seventies  and I would say that they were on a date  because he was wearing a very neat little suit with a yellow tie    a brown suit. And she was wearing a cardigan  because it was now fully night and a chill was coming in off the ocean. I remember  for some reason  that they were exactly the same height. And then they stopped  and the man turned to me and said   What are you looking for  flying saucers   You have to admit  that's a pretty boss piece of detective work for an old man on a date. But what was stranger still    and even I realized it at the time  as a nine year old child    was that they stopped at all. That this old man would interrupt his moonlight stroll with his sweetheart with the precise reason of making fun of a child.  Oh   he said   little green men.  And then his girlfriend joined in  too.  There's no such thing as space men   she said.  There's no such thing.  And then they both laughed.  Ha  ha  ha.  I looked around. The street was entirely empty. I had stopped hearing the sound of the ocean. It was as though time had stopped. I did not know why they were teasing me. I looked into their strangely angry faces  and I remember wondering  are they wearing rubber masks  And what would be behind those rubber masks  if they were  Giant  almond shaped  unblinking eyes  Slits for mouths  The old man crooked his finger as though he were firing a gun  and then he made laser sounds.  Kew  kew  kew    watch out.  And they turned at once and walked away. The old man reached out his knobbly claw for the woman's hand  and found it  and left me alone. Now  you could describe this as a simple misunderstanding    a strange encounter among humans. Maybe it was swamp gas  but    I know what I saw. Close encounter two  Brookline  Massachusetts      . I went to see the movie  Dune   and a girl talked to me. Now  on its face    this is impossible on its face  I realize    but it is absolutely true. It was opening night  naturally. I went with my friend Tim McGonigal  who sat on my left. On my right was the girl in question. She had long  curly black hair  a blue jean jacket. I remember  she had some sort of injury to her ankle  an Ace bandage  and she had crutches. She was very tall  I would say. I was starting high school at the time. I would say she was a junior  but I had never seen her before. She didn't go to my school. I didn't know her name  and I never will. She was sitting with someone who I presume was her mother  and they were talking about the novel   Dune.  They were both big fans  mother and daughter    very unusual. They were talking about how their favorite characters were the giant sandworms. And then it got stranger. That's when she turned to me and said   Are you looking forward to seeing the movie   First of all  I was embarrassed because I had not read the novel  Dune  at that time. I was merely a connoisseur of movies featuring desert planets  as I still am. But it was also the tone of how she asked the question  apropos of nothing  like she didn't even care about the answer  as though she just wanted to talk to me. I did not know what to say. I said   Yes.  I did not even turn my head. The movie began. I need not remind you that this was David Lynch's version of  Dune   in which all of the characters were sexy and deformed at the same time. There was a character called the Third Stage Guild Navigator  which was a kind of giant  floating fetus creature that lived in a giant tank with this orange mist of psychedelic spice swirling around him  allowing him to bend space and time. He could never leave the tank or interact with the outside world. He had become  in his isolation  so deformed and so sexy  that he had to talk through a kind of old timey radio to the outside world  and could never touch them. I mean  I liked him a lot better than the sandworms. The sandworms were fine  but your favorite character  Please. When the movie ended  everyone seemed very happy to get up and get out of the theatre as soon as possible. Except for the girl. As I walked out  her pace slowed. Perhaps it was the crutches  but it seemed    it seemed as though she might want to talk to me again. When I say it out loud  it sounds so ridiculous  but I can only come to the conclusion that it was what  in the alien abductee community  they call a  screen memory   a ridiculous false recollection designed by their brain to cover up some trauma    say  of being kidnapped and flown off to a sex pyramid. And so I sure am glad I did not slow down to talk to her. I sure am glad I never saw her again. Close encounter three  Philadelphia  Pennsylvania      . In the mid to late '  s  the novelist Whitley Strieber wrote a book called  Communion   in which he described his own lifelong experiences being abducted by aliens. And he also described the phenomenon known in this community as  lost time   where Whitley Strieber would suddenly become aware that he could not remember the previous ten minutes  or the previous ten hours  or the previous ten days. And would come to the conclusion that that was when the aliens were taking him and giving him rectal probes. This book became  naturally  an enormous best seller. This image by Ted Joseph was from that book  and was his  sort of  police sketch of what the creatures looked like that Whitley Strieber had described to him. And it was so successful that they made it into a movie. And in       the way I remember it  I was in Philadelphia visiting my girlfriend  and we decided  apropos of nothing  to go see this movie. And the way I remember it  the movie featured these details. One  Whitley Strieber was played by Christopher Walken. Two  the alien was played by a rubber puppet. Three  there was a surprisingly long sequence of the film in which the rubber puppet gives Christopher Walken a rectal probe. Four  this was being shown in a regular movie theater in Center City  Philadelphia. Five  all of which is to say  they made a movie out of the book   Communion   and it starred Christopher Walken. Does something seem strange about this to you  Something odd  Something off  Something wrong with this picture  Think about it. Yes. The answer is  I had a girlfriend. What  How did this happen  When did this happen  I remember walking out of the theater and becoming suddenly aware of this fact  as we walked hand in hand  and pondering these very same questions. And to this day  I have no answer for you. Close encounter four  the Algarve  Portugal      . Some years later  I and this woman    we'll call her  Catherine Fletcher     went traveling through the south of Portugal together. We stayed in old  crumbling  walled cities  in tiny little hotels  and we would climb up to the roof and drink Vinho Verde and watch the sun set and play checkers. What  Did we do this  Really  Does anyone do this  We went to some topless beaches. Excuse me  No  not in my life. For what it's worth  we went to Sagres  which was considered  at the time  to be the end of the world. And there I was chased by a pack of feral dogs on the dock  and the lead dog bit me on the ass  requiring me to go to a strange Portuguese clinic and receive an ass shot. Make of that what you will. Our last day in Portugal  we were in the district capital of Faro  and Catherine decided that she wanted to go to the beach one last time. Now  Faro is a bustling little city  and to get to the beach  she explained  you would have to take a bus and then a boat. And did I want to come with  But I was exhausted and dog bitten  and so I said   No.  I remember what she looked like before she left. The freckles had grown and multiplied on her face and shoulders  clustering into a kind of a tan. A tan  we were both tan    is this true  Her eyes were extra bright and extra blue  as a result. She was smiling. She was a single woman about to go alone into a country  not even speaking the language  to travel alone by bus and boat to go to a beach she did not know or had never seen. I loved her  and then she went out into that strange  alien land. It took me some time to come to my senses. I had my own  lost time  moment  where I woke up and suddenly realized it was very late in the day  almost dinnertime  and she had not come back. Nervous  I went down to the street to look for her. Now  I did not speak Portuguese. I did not know where the beach was. I could not call her on a cell phone because this was       and the aliens had not given us that technology yet. I realized that the day would only have two possible outcomes  either Catherine would come back to the hotel  or she would never come back to the hotel. And so I sat down to wait. I did not watch the skies  but the very end of the street where the buses and cars and pedestrians and little scooters were moving along. And I watched those constellations shift  hoping that they would part and I would see her face. It was at that moment  in that very small town of        or so  that I truly appreciated the vastness of the universe and the searching we might do in it. And that's when the Liberians came along. Five young men    all laughing  happy  traveling together  coming back to this hotel where they were staying. One of them was named Joseph  and he asked me what was I doing  and I explained. And he said   Don't worry.  He was sure that Catherine would be safe. But he did not seem so very sure  for he sat down to wait with me. And for the next two hours  they all waited with me  taking turns  going up to their room  coming back  telling me jokes  distracting me. Two hours  they gave me a message. We are not alone. And then  in the middle of a sentence  at the very birth of twilight  I turned and looked down the street. The stars aligned  and she came back. She was smiling. She did not understand why I was so worried. Neither did the Liberians  although there was a huge amount of relief in their laughter as they clapped us on the back  and went back up to their room and left us alone in the street  holding hands. An event like this leaves a scar on the memory  much like a piece of alien technology that has been inserted into your buttocks by a  Portuguese doctor.  And even now  a decade and a half later  even now that we are married  I look for her still  whenever she is not in the room. And even though  I think you'll agree  it is probable that during the time she was away  she was kidnapped and replaced by an alien clone  I love her and wait for her still. Thank you for your kind attention. You hear that this is the era of environment    or biology  or information technology ... Well  it's the era of a lot of different things that we're in right now. But one thing for sure  it's the era of change. There's more change going on than ever has occurred in the history of human life on earth. And you all sort of know it  but it's hard to get it so that you really understand it. And I've tried to put together something that's a good start for this. I've tried to show in this    though the color doesn't come out    that what I'm concerned with is the little    year time bubble that you are in. You tend to be interested in a generation past  a generation future    your parents  your kids  things you can change over the next few decades    and this    year time bubble you kind of move along in. And in that    years  if you look at the population curve  you find the population of humans on the earth more than doubles and we're up three and a half times since I was born. When you have a new baby  by the time that kid gets out of high school more people will be added than existed on earth when I was born. This is unprecedented  and it's big. Where it goes in the future is questioned. So that's the human part. Now  the human part related to animals  look at the left side of that. What I call the human portion    humans and their livestock and pets    versus the natural portion    all the other wild animals and just    these are vertebrates and all the birds  etc.  in the land and air  not in the water. How does it balance  Certainly         years ago  the civilization's beginning  the human portion was less than one tenth of one percent. Let's look at it now. You follow this curve and you see the whiter spot in the middle    that's your    year time bubble. Humans  livestock and pets are now    percent of that integrated total mass on earth and all wild nature is three percent. We have won. The next generation doesn't even have to worry about this game    it is over. And the biggest problem came in the last    years  it went from    percent up to that    percent. And this really is a sobering picture upon realizing that we  humans  are in charge of life on earth  we're like the capricious Gods of old Greek myths  kind of playing with life    and not a great deal of wisdom injected into it. Now  the third curve is information technology. This is Moore's Law plotted here  which relates to density of information  but it has been pretty good for showing a lot of other things about information technology    computers  their use  Internet  etc. And what's important is it just goes straight up through the top of the curve  and has no real limits to it. Now try and contrast these. This is the size of the earth going through that same       frame. And to make it really clear  I've put all four on one graph. There's no need to see the little detailed words on it. That first one is humans versus nature  we've won  there's no more gain. Human population. And so if you're looking for growth industries to get into  that's not a good one    protecting natural creatures. Human population is going up  it's going to continue for quite a while. Good business in obstetricians  morticians  and farming  housing  etc.    they all deal with human bodies  which require being fed  transported  housed and so on. And the information technology  which connects to our brains  has no limit    now  that is a wonderful field to be in. You're looking for growth opportunity  It's just going up through the roof. And then  the size of the Earth. Somehow making these all compatible with the Earth looks like a pretty bad industry to be involved with. So  that's the stage out of all this. I find  for reasons I don't understand  I really do have a goal. And the goal is that the world be desirable and sustainable when my kids reach my age    and I think that's    in other words  the next generation. I think that's a goal that we probably all share. I think it's a hopeless goal. Technologically  it's achievable  economically  it's achievable  politically  it means sort of the habits  institutions of people    it's impossible. The institutions of the past with all their inertia are just irrelevant for the future  except they're there and we have to deal with them. I spend about    percent of my time trying to save the world  the other    percent  the usual    and whatever else we devote ourselves to. And in that    percent  the main focus is on human mind  thinking skills  somehow trying to unleash kids from the straightjacket of school  which is putting information and dogma into them  get them so they really think  ask tough questions  argue about serious subjects  don't believe everything that's in the book  think broadly or creative. They can be. Our school systems are very flawed and do not reward you for the things that are important in life or for the survival of civilization  they reward you for a lot of learning and sopping up stuff. We can't go into that today because there isn't time    it's a broad subject. One thing for sure  in the future there is an essential feature    necessary  but not sufficient    which is doing more with less. We've got to be doing things with more efficiency using less energy  less material. Your great great grandparents got by on muscle power  and yet we all think there's this huge power that's essential for our lifestyle. And with all the wonderful technology we have we can do things that are much more efficient  conserve  recycle  etc. Let me just rush very quickly through things that we've done. Human powered airplane    Gossamer Condor sort of started me in this direction in      and     winning the Kremer prize in aviation history  followed by the Albatross. And we began making various odd planes and creatures. Here's a giant flying replica of a pterosaur that has no tail. Trying to have it fly straight is like trying to shoot an arrow with the feathered end forward. It was a tough job  and boy it made me have a lot of respect for nature. This was the full size of the original creature. We did things on land  in the air  on water    vehicles of all different kinds  usually with some electronics or electric power systems in them. I find they're all the same  whether its land  air or water. I'll be focusing on the air here. This is a solar powered airplane        miles carrying a person from France to England as a symbol that solar power is going to be an important part of our future. Then we did the solar car for General Motors    the Sunracer    that won the race in Australia. We got a lot of people thinking about electric cars  what you could do with them. A few years later  when we suggested to GM that now is the time and we could do a thing called the Impact  they sponsored it  and here's the Impact that we developed with them on their programs. This is the demonstrator. And they put huge effort into turning it into a commercial product. With that preamble  let's show the first two minute videotape  which shows a little airplane for surveillance and moving to a giant airplane. Narrator  A tiny airplane  the AV Pointer serves for surveillance    in effect  a pair of roving eyeglasses. A cutting edge example of where miniaturization can lead if the operator is remote from the vehicle. It is convenient to carry  assemble and launch by hand. Battery powered  it is silent and rarely noticed. It sends high resolution video pictures back to the operator. With onboard GPS  it can navigate autonomously  and it is rugged enough to self land without damage. The modern sailplane is superbly efficient. Some can glide as flat as    feet forward for every foot of descent. They are powered only by the energy they can extract from the atmosphere    an atmosphere nature stirs up by solar energy. Humans and soaring birds have found nature to be generous in providing replenishable energy. Sailplanes have flown over       miles  and the altitude record is over        feet. The Solar Challenger was made to serve as a symbol that photovoltaic cells can produce real power and will be part of the world's energy future. In       it flew     miles from Paris to England  solely on the power of sunbeams  and established a basis for the Pathfinder. The message from all these vehicles is that ideas and technology can be harnessed to produce remarkable gains in doing more with less    gains that can help us attain a desirable balance between technology and nature. The stakes are high as we speed toward a challenging future. Buckminster Fuller said it clearly   there are no passengers on spaceship Earth  only crew. We  the crew  can and must do more with less    much less.  Paul MacCready  If we could have the second video  the one minute  put in as quickly as you can  which    this will show the Pathfinder airplane in some flights this past year in Hawaii  and will show a sequence of some of the beauty behind it after it had just flown to        feet    higher than any propeller airplane has ever flown. It's amazing  just on the puny power of the sun    by having a super lightweight plane  you're able to get it up there. It's part of a long term program NASA sponsored. And we worked very closely with the whole thing being a team effort  and with wonderful results like that flight. And we're working on a bigger plane        foot span    and an intermediate size  one with a regenerative fuel cell that can store excess energy during the day  feed it back at night  and stay up        feet for months at a time. Ray Morgan's voice will come in here. There he's the project manager. Anything they do is certainly a team effort. He ran this program. Here's ... some things he showed as a celebration at the very end. Ray Morgan  We'd just ended a seven month deployment of Hawaii. For those who live on the mainland  it was tough being away from home. The friendly support  the quiet confidence  congenial hospitality shown by our Hawaiian and military hosts    this is starting    made the experience enjoyable and unforgettable. PM  We have real time IR scans going out through the Internet while the plane is flying. And it's exploring without polluting the stratosphere. That's its goal  the stratosphere  the blanket that really controls the radiation of the earth and permits life on earth to be the success that it is    probing that is very important. And also we consider it as a sort of poor man's stationary satellite  because it can stay right overhead for months at a time        times closer than the real GFC synchronous satellite. We couldn't bring one here to fly it and show you. But now let's look at the other end. In the video you saw that nine pound or eight pound Pointer airplane surveillance drone that Keenan has developed and just done a remarkable job. Where some have servos that have gotten down to  oh     or    grams  his weigh one third of a gram. And what he's going to bring out here is a surveillance drone that weighs about   ounces    that includes the video camera  the batteries that run it  the telemetry  the receiver and so on. And we'll fly it  we hope  with the same success that we had last night when we did the practice. So Matt Keenan  just any time you're    all right    ready to let her go. But first  we're going to make sure that it's appearing on the screen  so you see what it sees. You can imagine yourself being a mouse or fly inside of it  looking out of its camera. Matt Keenan  It's switched on. PM  But now we're trying to get the video. There we go. MK  Can you bring up the house lights  PM  Yeah  the house lights and we'll see you all better and be able to fly the plane better. MK  All right  we'll try to do a few laps around and bring it back in. Here we go. PM  The video worked right for the first few and I don't know why it    there it goes. Oh  that was only a minute  but I think you'd be safe to have that near the end of the flight  perhaps. We get to do the classic. All right. If this hits you  it will not hurt you. OK. Thank you very much. Thank you. But now  as they say in infomercials  we have something much better for you  which we're working on  planes that are only six inches       centimeters    in size. And Matt's plane was on the cover of Popular Science last month  showing what this can lead to. And in a while  something this size will have GPS and a video camera in it. We've had one of these fly nine miles through the air at    miles an hour with just a little battery in it. But there's a lot of technology going. There are just milestones along the way of some remarkable things. This one doesn't have the video in it  but you get a little feel from what it can do. OK  here we go. MK  Sorry. OK. PM  If you can pass it down when you're done. Yeah  I think    I lost a little orientation  I looked up into this light. It hit the building. And the building was poorly placed  actually. But you're beginning to see what can be done. We're working on projects now    even wing flapping things the size of hawk moths    DARPA contracts  working with Caltech  UCLA. Where all this leads  I don't know. Is it practical  I don't know. But like any basic research  when you're really forced to do things that are way beyond existing technology  you can get there with micro technology  nanotechnology. You can do amazing things when you realize what nature has been doing all along. As you get to these small scales  you realize we have a lot to learn from nature    not with    s    but when you get down to the nature's realm  nature has     million years of experience. It never makes a mistake. Because if you make a mistake  you don't leave any progeny. We should have nothing but success stories from nature  for you or for birds  and we're learning a lot from its fascinating subjects. In concluding  I want to get back to the big picture and I have just two final slides to try and put it in perspective. The first I'll just read. At last  I put in three sentences and had it say what I wanted. Over billions of years on a unique sphere  chance has painted a thin covering of life    complex  improbable  wonderful and fragile. Suddenly  we humans    a recently arrived species  no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature    have grown in population  technology and intelligence to a position of terrible power. We now wield the paintbrush. And that's serious  we're not very bright. We're short on wisdom  we're high on technology. Where's it going to lead  Well  inspired by the sentences  I decided to wield the paintbrush. Every    years I do a picture. Here's the one    tries to show that the world isn't getting any bigger. Sort of a timeline  very non linear scale  nature rates and trilobites and dinosaurs  and eventually we saw some humans with caves ... Birds were flying overhead  after pterosaurs. And then we get to the civilization above the little TV set with a gun on it. Then traffic jams  and power systems  and some dots for digital. Where it's going to lead    I have no idea. And so I just put robotic and natural cockroaches out there  but you can fill in whatever you want. This is not a forecast. This is a warning  and we have to think seriously about it. And that time when this is happening is not     years or     years. Things are going on this decade  next decade  it's a very short time that we have to decide what we are going to do. And if we can get some agreement on where we want the world to be    desirable  sustainable when your kids reach your age    I think we actually can reach it. Now  I said this was a warning  not a forecast. That was before    I painted this before we started in on making robotic versions of hawk moths and cockroaches  and now I'm beginning to wonder seriously    was this more of a forecast than I wanted  I personally think the surviving intelligent life form on earth is not going to be carbon based  it's going to be silicon based. And so where it all goes  I don't know. The one final bit of sparkle we'll put in at the very end here is an utterly impractical flight vehicle  which is a little ornithopter wing flapping device that    rubber band powered    that we'll show you. MK     gram. Sorry  one gram. PM  Last night we gave it a few too many turns and it tried to bash the roof out also. It's about a gram. The tube there's hollow  about paper thin. And if this lands on you  I assure you it will not hurt you. But if you reach out to grab it or hold it  you will destroy it. So  be gentle  just act like a wooden Indian or something. And when it comes down    and we'll see how it goes. We consider this to be sort of the spirit of TED. And you wonder  is it practical  And it turns out if I had not been    Unfortunately  we have some light bulb changes. We can probably get it down  but it's possible it's gone up to a greater destiny up there       than it ever had. And I wanted to make    just    But I want to make just two points. One is  you think it's frivolous  there's nothing to it. And yet if I had not been making ornithopters like that  a little bit cruder  in         a long  long time ago    there wouldn't have been a Gossamer Condor  there wouldn't have been an Albatross  a Solar Challenger  there wouldn't be an Impact car  there wouldn't be a mandate on zero emission vehicles in California. A lot of these things    or similar    would have happened some time  probably a decade later. I didn't realize at the time I was doing inquiry based  hands on things with teams  like they're trying to get in education systems. So I think that  as a symbol  it's important. And I believe that also is important. You can think of it as a sort of a symbol for learning and TED that somehow gets you thinking of technology and nature  and puts it all together in things that are    that make this conference  I think  more important than any that's taken place in this country in this decade. Thank you.  Applause  I grew up in Europe  and World War II caught me when I was between seven and    years old. And I realized how few of the grown ups that I knew were able to withstand the tragedies that the war visited on them    how few of them could even resemble a normal  contented  satisfied  happy life once their job  their home  their security was destroyed by the war. So I became interested in understanding what contributed to a life that was worth living. And I tried  as a child  as a teenager  to read philosophy and to get involved in art and religion and many other ways that I could see as a possible answer to that question. And finally I ended up encountering psychology by chance. I was at a ski resort in Switzerland without any money to actually enjoy myself  because the snow had melted and I didn't have money to go to a movie. But I found that on the    I read in the newspapers that there was to be a presentation by someone in a place that I'd seen in the center of Zurich  and it was about flying saucers  that  he was going to talk. And I thought  well  since I can't go to the movies  at least I will go for free to listen to flying saucers. And the man who talked at that evening lecture was very interesting. Instead of talking about little green men  he talked about how the psyche of the Europeans had been traumatized by the war  and now they're projecting flying saucers into the sky. He talked about how the mandalas of ancient Hindu religion were kind of projected into the sky as an attempt to regain some sense of order after the chaos of war. And this seemed very interesting to me. And I started reading his books after that lecture. And that was Carl Jung  whose name or work I had no idea about. Then I came to this country to study psychology and I started trying to understand the roots of happiness. This is a typical result that many people have presented  and there are many variations on it. But this  for instance  shows that about    percent of the people surveyed in the United States since      say that their life is very happy. And that hasn't changed at all. Whereas the personal income  on a scale that has been held constant to accommodate for inflation  has more than doubled  almost tripled  in that period. But you find essentially the same results  namely  that after a certain basic point    which corresponds more or less to just a few       dollars above the minimum poverty level    increases in material well being don't seem to affect how happy people are. In fact  you can find that the lack of basic resources  material resources  contributes to unhappiness  but the increase in material resources does not increase happiness. So my research has been focused more on    after finding out these things that actually corresponded to my own experience  I tried to understand  where    in everyday life  in our normal experience    do we feel really happy  And to start those studies about    years ago  I began to look at creative people    first artists and scientists  and so forth    trying to understand what made them feel that it was worth essentially spending their life doing things for which many of them didn't expect either fame or fortune  but which made their life meaningful and worth doing. This was one of the leading composers of American music back in the '  s. And the interview was    pages long. But this little excerpt is a very good summary of what he was saying during the interview. And it describes how he feels when composing is going well. And he says by describing it as an ecstatic state. Now   ecstasy  in Greek meant simply to stand to the side of something. And then it became essentially an analogy for a mental state where you feel that you are not doing your ordinary everyday routines. So ecstasy is essentially a stepping into an alternative reality. And it's interesting  if you think about it  how  when we think about the civilizations that we look up to as having been pinnacles of human achievement    whether it's China  Greece  the Hindu civilization  or the Mayas  or Egyptians    what we know about them is really about their ecstasies  not about their everyday life. We know the temples they built  where people could come to experience a different reality. We know about the circuses  the arenas  the theaters. These are the remains of civilizations and they are the places that people went to experience life in a more concentrated  more ordered form. Now  this man doesn't need to go to a place like this  which is also    this place  this arena  which is built like a Greek amphitheatre  is a place for ecstasy also. We are participating in a reality that is different from that of the everyday life that we're used to. But this man doesn't need to go there. He needs just a piece of paper where he can put down little marks  and as he does that  he can imagine sounds that had not existed before in that particular combination. So once he gets to that point of beginning to create  like Jennifer did in her improvisation  a new reality    that is  a moment of ecstasy    he enters that different reality. Now he says also that this is so intense an experience that it feels almost as if he didn't exist. And that sounds like a kind of a romantic exaggeration. But actually  our nervous system is incapable of processing more than about     bits of information per second. And in order to hear me and understand what I'm saying  you need to process about    bits per second. That's why you can't hear more than two people. You can't understand more than two people talking to you. Well  when you are really involved in this completely engaging process of creating something new  as this man is  he doesn't have enough attention left over to monitor how his body feels  or his problems at home. He can't feel even that he's hungry or tired. His body disappears  his identity disappears from his consciousness  because he doesn't have enough attention  like none of us do  to really do well something that requires a lot of concentration  and at the same time to feel that he exists. So existence is temporarily suspended. And he says that his hand seems to be moving by itself. Now  I could look at my hand for two weeks  and I wouldn't feel any awe or wonder  because I can't compose.  Laughter  So what it's telling you here is that obviously this automatic  spontaneous process that he's describing can only happen to someone who is very well trained and who has developed technique. And it has become a kind of a truism in the study of creativity that you can't be creating anything with less than    years of technical knowledge immersion in a particular field. Whether it's mathematics or music  it takes that long to be able to begin to change something in a way that it's better than what was there before. Now  when that happens  he says the music just flows out. And because all of these people I started interviewing    this was an interview which is over    years old    so many of the people described this as a spontaneous flow that I called this type of experience the  flow experience.  And it happens in different realms. For instance  a poet describes it in this form. This is by a student of mine who interviewed some of the leading writers and poets in the United States. And it describes the same effortless  spontaneous feeling that you get when you enter into this ecstatic state. This poet describes it as opening a door that floats in the sky    a very similar description to what Albert Einstein gave as to how he imagined the forces of relativity  when he was struggling with trying to understand how it worked. But it happens in other activities. For instance  this is another student of mine  Susan Jackson from Australia  who did work with some of the leading athletes in the world. And you see here in this description of an Olympic skater  the same essential description of the phenomenology of the inner state of the person. You don't think  it goes automatically  if you merge yourself with the music  and so forth. It happens also  actually  in the most recent book I wrote  called  Good Business   where I interviewed some of the CEOs who had been nominated by their peers as being both very successful and very ethical  very socially responsible. You see that these people define success as something that helps others and at the same time makes you feel happy as you are working at it. And like all of these successful and responsible CEOs say  you can't have just one of these things be successful if you want a meaningful and successful job. Anita Roddick is another one of these CEOs we interviewed. She is the founder of Body Shop  the natural cosmetics king. It's kind of a passion that comes from doing the best and having flow while you're working. This is an interesting little quote from Masaru Ibuka  who was at that time starting out Sony without any money  without a product    they didn't have a product  they didn't have anything  but they had an idea. And the idea he had was to establish a place of work where engineers can feel the joy of technological innovation  be aware of their mission to society and work to their heart's content. I couldn't improve on this as a good example of how flow enters the workplace. Now  when we do studies    we have  with other colleagues around the world  done over       interviews of people    from Dominican monks  to blind nuns  to Himalayan climbers  to Navajo shepherds    who enjoy their work. And regardless of the culture  regardless of education or whatever  there are these seven conditions that seem to be there when a person is in flow. There's this focus that  once it becomes intense  leads to a sense of ecstasy  a sense of clarity  you know exactly what you want to do from one moment to the other  you get immediate feedback. You know that what you need to do is possible to do  even though difficult  and sense of time disappears  you forget yourself  you feel part of something larger. And once the conditions are present  what you are doing becomes worth doing for its own sake. In our studies  we represent the everyday life of people in this simple scheme. And we can measure this very precisely  actually  because we give people electronic pagers that go off    times a day  and whenever they go off you say what you're doing  how you feel  where you are  what you're thinking about. And two things that we measure is the amount of challenge people experience at that moment and the amount of skill that they feel they have at that moment. So for each person we can establish an average  which is the center of the diagram. That would be your mean level of challenge and skill  which will be different from that of anybody else. But you have a kind of a set point there  which would be in the middle. If we know what that set point is  we can predict fairly accurately when you will be in flow  and it will be when your challenges are higher than average and skills are higher than average. And you may be doing things very differently from other people  but for everyone that flow channel  that area there  will be when you are doing what you really like to do    play the piano  be with your best friend  perhaps work  if work is what provides flow for you. And then the other areas become less and less positive. Arousal is still good because you are over challenged there. Your skills are not quite as high as they should be  but you can move into flow fairly easily by just developing a little more skill. So  arousal is the area where most people learn from  because that's where they're pushed beyond their comfort zone and to enter that    going back to flow    then they develop higher skills. Control is also a good place to be  because there you feel comfortable  but not very excited. It's not very challenging any more. And if you want to enter flow from control  you have to increase the challenges. So those two are ideal and complementary areas from which flow is easy to go into. The other combinations of challenge and skill become progressively less optimal. Relaxation is fine    you still feel OK. Boredom begins to be very aversive and apathy becomes very negative  you don't feel that you're doing anything  you don't use your skills  there's no challenge. Unfortunately  a lot of people's experience is in apathy. The largest single contributor to that experience is watching television  the next one is being in the bathroom  sitting. Even though sometimes watching television about seven to eight percent of the time is in flow  but that's when you choose a program you really want to watch and you get feedback from it. So the question we are trying to address    and I'm way over time    is how to put more and more of everyday life in that flow channel. And that is the kind of challenge that we're trying to understand. And some of you obviously know how to do that spontaneously without any advice  but unfortunately a lot of people don't. And that's what our mandate is  in a way  to do. Thank you. When I first arrived in beautiful Zimbabwe  it was difficult to understand that    percent of the population is HIV positive. It really wasn't until I was invited to the homes of people that I started to understand the human toll of the epidemic. For instance  this is Herbert with his grandmother. When I first met him  he was sitting on his grandmother's lap. He has been orphaned  as both of his parents died of AIDS  and his grandmother took care of him until he too died of AIDS. He liked to sit on her lap because he said that it was painful for him to lie in his own bed. When she got up to make tea  she placed him in my own lap and I had never felt a child that was that emaciated. Before I left  I actually asked him if I could get him something. I thought he would ask for a toy  or candy  and he asked me for slippers  because he said that his feet were cold. This is Joyce who's    in this picture      . Single mother  HIV positive. I photographed her before and after the birth of her beautiful baby girl  Issa. And I was last week walking on Lafayette Street in Manhattan and got a call from a woman who I didn't know  but she called to tell me that Joyce had passed away at the age of   . Joyce's mother is now taking care of her daughter  like so many other Zimbabwean children who've been orphaned by the epidemic. So a few of the stories. With every picture  there are individuals who have full lives and stories that deserve to be told. All these pictures are from Zimbabwe. Chris Anderson  Kirsten  will you just take one minute  just to tell your own story of how you got to Africa  Kirsten Ashburn  Mmm  gosh. CA  Just    KA  Actually  I was working at the time  doing production for a fashion photographer. And I was constantly reading the New York Times  and stunned by the statistics  the numbers. It was just frightening. So I quit my job and decided that that's the subject that I wanted to tackle. And I first actually went to Botswana  where I spent a month    this is in December         then went to Zimbabwe for a month and a half  and then went back again this March      for another month and a half in Zimbabwe. CA  That's an amazing story  thank you. KB  Thanks for letting me show these. I think all of us have been interested  at one time or another  in the romantic mysteries of all those societies that collapsed  such as the classic Maya in the Yucatan  the Easter Islanders  the Anasazi  Fertile Crescent society  Angor Wat  Great Zimbabwe and so on. And within the last decade or two  archaeologists have shown us that there were environmental problems underlying many of these past collapses. But there were also plenty of places in the world where societies have been developing for thousands of years without any sign of a major collapse  such as Japan  Java  Tonga and Tikopea. So evidently  societies in some areas are more fragile than in other areas. How can we understand what makes some societies more fragile than other societies  The problem is obviously relevant to our situation today  because today as well  there are some societies that have already collapsed  such as Somalia and Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. There are also societies today that may be close to collapse  such as Nepal  Indonesia and Columbia. What about ourselves  What is there that we can learn from the past that would help us avoid declining or collapsing in the way that so many past societies have  Obviously the answer to this question is not going to be a single factor. If anyone tells you that there is a single factor explanation for societal collapses  you know right away that they're an idiot. This is a complex subject. But how can we make sense out of the complexities of this subject  In analyzing societal collapses  I've arrived at a five point framework    a checklist of things that I go through to try and understand collapses. And I'll illustrate that five point framework by the extinction of the Greenland Norse society. This is a European society with literate records  so we know a good deal about the people and their motivation. In AD     Vikings went out to Greenland  settled Greenland  and around      they died out    the society collapsed  and every one of them ended up dead. Why did they all end up dead  Well  in my five point framework  the first item on the framework is to look for human impacts on the environment  people inadvertently destroying the resource base on which they depend. And in the case of the Viking Norse  the Vikings inadvertently caused soil erosion and deforestation  which was a particular problem for them because they required forests to make charcoal  to make iron. So they ended up an Iron Age European society  virtually unable to make their own iron. A second item on my checklist is climate change. Climate can get warmer or colder or dryer or wetter. In the case of the Vikings    in Greenland  the climate got colder in the late     s  and especially in the     s. But a cold climate isn't necessarily fatal  because the Inuit    the Eskimos inhabiting Greenland at the same time    did better  rather than worse  with cold climates. So why didn't the Greenland Norse as well  The third thing on my checklist is relations with neighboring friendly societies that may prop up a society. And if that friendly support is pulled away  that may make a society more likely to collapse. In the case of the Greenland Norse  they had trade with the mother country    Norway    and that trade dwindled  partly because Norway got weaker  partly because of sea ice between Greenland and Norway. The fourth item on my checklist is relations with hostile societies. In the case of Norse Greenland  the hostiles were the Inuit    the Eskimos sharing Greenland    with whom the Norse got off to bad relationships. And we know that the Inuit killed the Norse and  probably of greater importance  may have blocked access to the outer fjords  on which the Norse depended for seals at a critical time of the year. And then finally  the fifth item on my checklist is the political  economic  social and cultural factors in the society that make it more or less likely that the society will perceive and solve its environmental problems. In the case of the Greenland Norse  cultural factors that made it difficult for them to solve their problems were  their commitments to a Christian society investing heavily in cathedrals  their being a competitive ranked chiefly society  and their scorn for the Inuit  from whom they refused to learn. So that's how the five part framework is relevant to the collapse and eventual extinction of the Greenland Norse. What about a society today  For the past five years  I've been taking my wife and kids to Southwestern Montana  where I worked as a teenager on the hay harvest. And Montana  at first sight  seems like the most pristine environment in the United States. But scratch the surface  and Montana suffers from serious problems. Going through the same checklist  human environmental impacts  Yes  acute in Montana. Toxic problems from mine waste have caused damage of billions of dollars. Problems from weeds  weed control  cost Montana nearly     million dollars a year. Montana has lost agricultural areas from salinization  problems of forest management  problems of forest fires. Second item on my checklist  climate change. Yes    the climate in Montana is getting warmer and drier  but Montana agriculture depends especially on irrigation from the snow pack  and as the snow is melting    for example  as the glaciers in Glacier National Park are disappearing    that's bad news for Montana irrigation agriculture. Third thing on my checklist  relations with friendlies that can sustain the society. In Montana today  more than half of the income of Montana is not earned within Montana  but is derived from out of state  transfer payments from social security  investments and so on    which makes Montana vulnerable to the rest of the United States. Fourth  relations with hostiles. Montanans have the same problems as do all Americans  in being sensitive to problems created by hostiles overseas affecting our oil supplies  and terrorist attacks. And finally  last item on my checklist  question of how political  economic  social  cultural attitudes play into this. Montanans have long held values  which today seem to be getting in the way of their solving their own problems. Long held devotion to logging and to mines and to agriculture  and to no government regulation  values that worked well in the past  but they don't seem to be working well today. So  I'm looking at these issues of collapses for a lot of past societies and for many present societies. Are there any general conclusions that arise  In a way  just like Tolstoy's statement about every unhappy marriage being different  every collapsed or endangered society is different    they all have different details. But nevertheless  there are certain common threads that emerge from these comparisons of past societies that did or did not collapse and threatened societies today. One interesting common thread has to do with  in many cases  the rapidity of collapse after a society reaches its peak. There are many societies that don't wind down gradually  but they build up    get richer and more powerful    and then within a short time  within a few decades after their peak  they collapse. For example  the classic lowland Maya of the Yucatan began to collapse in the early    s    literally a few decades after the Maya were building their biggest monuments  and Maya population was greatest. Or again  the collapse of the Soviet Union took place within a couple of decades  maybe within a decade  of the time when the Soviet Union was at its greatest power. An analogue would be the growth of bacteria in a petri dish. These rapid collapses are especially likely where there's a mismatch between available resources and resource consumption  or a mismatch between economic outlays and economic potential. In a petri dish  bacteria grow. Say they double every generation  and five generations before the end the petri dish is      ths empty  and then the next generation's    ths empty  and the next generation half empty. Within one generation after the petri dish still being half empty  it is full. There's no more food and the bacteria have collapsed. So  this is a frequent theme  societies collapse very soon after reaching their peak in power. What it means to put it mathematically is that  if you're concerned about a society today  you should be looking not at the value of the mathematical function    the wealth itself    but you should be looking at the first derivative and the second derivatives of the function. That's one general theme. A second general theme is that there are many  often subtle environmental factors that make some societies more fragile than others. Many of those factors are not well understood. For example  why is it that in the Pacific  of those hundreds of Pacific islands  why did Easter Island end up as the most devastating case of complete deforestation  It turns out that there were about nine different environmental factors    some  rather subtle ones    that were working against the Easter Islanders  and they involve fallout of volcanic tephra  latitude  rainfall. Perhaps the most subtle of them is that it turns out that a major input of nutrients which protects island environments in the Pacific is from the fallout of continental dust from central Asia. Easter  of all Pacific islands  has the least input of dust from Asia restoring the fertility of its soils. But that's a factor that we didn't even appreciate until     . So  some societies  for subtle environmental reasons  are more fragile than others. And then finally  another generalization. I'm now teaching a course at UCLA  to UCLA undergraduates  on these collapses of societies. What really bugs my UCLA undergraduate students is  how on earth did these societies not see what they were doing  How could the Easter Islanders have deforested their environment  What did they say when they were cutting down the last palm tree  Didn't they see what they were doing  How could societies not perceive their impacts on the environments and stop in time  And I would expect that  if our human civilization carries on  then maybe in the next century people will be asking  why on earth did these people today in the year      not see the obvious things that they were doing and take corrective action  It seems incredible in the past. In the future  it'll seem incredible what we are doing today. And so I've been trying to develop a hierarchical set of considerations about why societies fail to solve their problems    why they fail to perceive the problems or  if they perceive them  why they fail to tackle them. Or  if they tackle them  why do they fail to succeed in solving them  I'll just mention two generalizations in this area. One blueprint for trouble  making collapse likely  is where there is a conflict of interest between the short term interest of the decision making elites and the long term interest of the society as a whole  especially if the elites are able to insulate themselves from the consequences of their actions. Where what's good in the short run for the elite is bad for the society as a whole  there's a real risk of the elite doing things that would bring the society down in the long run. For example  among the Greenland Norse    a competitive rank society    what the chiefs really wanted is more followers and more sheep and more resources to outcompete the neighboring chiefs. And that led the chiefs to do what's called flogging the land  overstocking the land  forcing tenant farmers into dependency. And that made the chiefs powerful in the short run  but led to the society's collapse in the long run. Those same issues of conflicts of interest are acute in the United States today. Especially because the decision makers in the United States are frequently able to insulate themselves from consequences by living in gated compounds  by drinking bottled water and so on. And within the last couple of years  it's been obvious that the elite in the business world correctly perceive that they can advance their short term interest by doing things that are good for them but bad for society as a whole  such as draining a few billion dollars out of Enron and other businesses. They are quite correct that these things are good for them in the short term  although bad for society in the long term. So  that's one general conclusion about why societies make bad decisions  conflicts of interest. And the other generalization that I want to mention is that it's particularly hard for a society to make quote unquote good decisions when there is a conflict involving strongly held values that are good in many circumstances but are poor in other circumstances. For example  the Greenland Norse  in this difficult environment  were held together for four and a half centuries by their shared commitment to religion  and by their strong social cohesion. But those two things    commitment to religion and strong social cohesion    also made it difficult for them to change at the end and to learn from the Inuit. Or today    Australia. One of the things that enabled Australia to survive in this remote outpost of European civilization for     years has been their British identity. But today  their commitment to a British identity is serving Australians poorly in their need to adapt to their situation in Asia. So it's particularly difficult to change course when the things that get you in trouble are the things that are also the source of your strength. What's going to be the outcome today  Well  all of us know the dozen sorts of ticking time bombs going on in the modern world  time bombs that have fuses of a few decades to    all of them  not more than    years  and any one of which can do us in  the time bombs of water  of soil  of climate change  invasive species  the photosynthetic ceiling  population problems  toxics  etc.  etc.    listing about    of them. And while these time bombs    none of them has a fuse beyond    years  and most of them have fuses of a few decades    some of them  in some places  have much shorter fuses. At the rate at which we're going now  the Philippines will lose all its accessible loggable forest within five years. And the Solomon Islands are only one year away from losing their loggable forest  which is their major export. And that's going to be spectacular for the economy of the Solomons. People often ask me  Jared  what's the most important thing that we need to do about the world's environmental problems  And my answer is  the most important thing we need to do is to forget about there being any single thing that is the most important thing we need to do. Instead  there are a dozen things  any one of which could do us in. And we've got to get them all right  because if we solve     we fail to solve the   th    we're in trouble. For example  if we solve our problems of water and soil and population  but don't solve our problems of toxics  then we are in trouble. The fact is that our present course is a non sustainable course  which means  by definition  that it cannot be maintained. And the outcome is going to get resolved within a few decades. That means that those of us in this room who are less than    or    years old will see how these paradoxes are resolved  and those of us who are over the age of    may not see the resolution  but our children and grandchildren certainly will. The resolution is going to achieve either of two forms  either we will resolve these non sustainable time fuses in pleasant ways of our own choice by taking remedial action  or else these conflicts are going to get settled in unpleasant ways not of our choice    namely  by war  disease or starvation. But what's for sure is that our non sustainable course will get resolved in one way or another in a few decades. In other words  since the theme of this session is choices  we have a choice. Does that mean that we should get pessimistic and overwhelmed  I draw the reverse conclusion. The big problems facing the world today are not at all things beyond our control. Our biggest threat is not an asteroid about to crash into us  something we can do nothing about. Instead  all the major threats facing us today are problems entirely of our own making. And since we made the problems  we can also solve the problems. That then means that it's entirely in our power to deal with these problems. In particular  what can all of us do  For those of you who are interested in these choices  there are lots of things you can do. There's a lot that we don't understand  and that we need to understand. And there's a lot that we already do understand  but aren't doing  and that we need to be doing. Thank you. Zach Kaplan  Keith and I lead a research team. We investigate materials and technologies that have unexpected properties. Over the last three years  we found over     of these things  and so we looked back into our library and selected six we thought would be most surprising for TED. Of these six  the first one that we're going to talk about is in the black envelope you're holding. It comes from a company in Japan called GelTech. Now go ahead and open it up. Keith Schacht  Now be sure and take the two pieces apart. What's unexpected about this is that it's soft  but it's also a strong magnet. Zach and I have always been fascinated observing unexpected things like this. We spent a long time thinking about why this is  and it's just recently that we realized  it's when we see something unexpected  it changes our understanding of the way things work. As you're seeing this gel magnet for the first time  if you assume that all magnets had to be hard  then seeing this surprised you and it changed your understanding of the way magnets could work. ZK  Now  it's important to understand what the unexpected properties are. But to really think about the implications of what this makes possible  we found that it helps to think about how it could be applied in the world. So  a first idea is to use it on cabinet doors. If you line the sides of the cabinets using the gel material    if a cabinet slams shut it wouldn't make a loud noise  and in addition the magnets would draw the cabinets closed. Imagine taking the same material  but putting it on the bottom of a sneaker. You know  this way you could go to the container store and buy one of those metal sheets that they hang on the back of your door  in your closet  and you could literally stick your shoes up instead of using a shelf. For me  I really love this idea. If you come to my apartment and see my closet  I'm sure you'd figure out why  it's a mess. KS  Seeing the unexpected properties and then seeing a couple of applications    it helps you see why this is significant  what the potential is. But we've found that the way we present our ideas it makes a big difference. ZK  It was like six months ago that Keith and I were out in L.A.  and we were at Starbucks having coffee with Roman Coppola. He works on mostly music videos and commercials with his company  The Directors Bureau. As we were talking  Roman told us that he's kind of an inventor on the side. And we were showing him the same gel magnet that you're holding in your hand    and you know  we shared the same ideas. And you could see it in his face  Roman starts to get really excited and he whips out this manila folder  he opens it up and Keith and I look in  and he starts showing us concepts that he's been working on. These things just get him really excited. And so we're looking at these concepts  and we were just like  whoa  this guy's good. Because the way that he presented the concept    his approach was totally different than ours. He sold it to you as if it was for sale right now. When we were going in the car back to the airport  we were thinking  why was this so powerful  And as we thought about it more  we realized that it let you fill in all the details about the experience  just as if you saw it on TV. So  for TED we decided to take our favorite idea for the gel magnet and work with Roman and his team at the Directors Bureau to create a commercial for a product from the future. Narrator  Do you have a need for speed  Inventables Water Adventures dares you to launch yourself on a magnetically levitating board down a waterslide so fast  so tall  that when you hit the bottom  it uses brakes to stop. Aqua Rocket  coming this summer. KS  Now  we showed the concept to a few people before this  and they asked us  when's it coming out  So I just wanted to let you know  it's not actually coming out  just the concept is. ZK  So now  when we dream up these concepts  it's important for us to make sure that they work from a technical standpoint. So I just want to quickly explain how this would work. This is the magnetically levitating board that they mentioned in the commercial. The gel that you're holding would be lining the bottom of the board. Now this is important for two reasons. One  the soft properties of the magnet that make it so that  if it were to hit the rider in the head  it wouldn't injure him. In addition  you can see from the diagram on the right  the underpart of the slide would be an electromagnet. So this would actually repel the rider a little bit as you're going down. The force of the water rushing down  in addition to that repulsion force  would make this slide go faster than any slide on the market. It's because of this that you need the magnetic braking system. When you get to the very bottom of the slide       the rider passes through an aluminum tube. And I'm going to kick it to Keith to explain why that's important from a technical standpoint. KS  So I'm sure all you engineers know that even though aluminum is a metal  it's not a magnetic material. But something unexpected happens when you drop a magnet down an aluminum tube. So we set up a quick experiment here to show that to you. Now  you see the magnet fell really slowly. Now  I'm not going to get into the physics of it  but all you need to know is that the faster the magnet's falling  the greater the stopping force. ZK  Now  our next technology is actually a    foot pole  and I have it right here in my pocket. There're a few different versions of it. KS  Some of them automatically unroll like this one. They can be made to automatically roll up  or they can be made stable  like Zach's  to hold any position in between. ZK  As we were talking to the vendor    to try to learn about how you could apply these  or how they're being applied currently    he was telling us that  in the military they use this one so soldiers can keep it on their chests    very concealed    and then  when they're out on the field  erect it as an antenna to clearly send signals back to the base. In our brainstorms  we came up with the idea you could use it for a soccer goal  so at the end of the game  you just roll up the goal and put it in your gym bag. KS  Now  the interesting thing about this is  you don't have to be an engineer to appreciate why a    foot pole that can fit in your pocket is so interesting. So we decided to go out onto the streets of Chicago and ask a few people on the streets what they thought you could do with this. Man  I clean my ceiling fans with that and I get the spider webs off my house    I do it that way. Woman  I'd make my very own walking stick. Woman  I would create a ladder to use to get up on top of the tree. Woman  An olive server. Man  Some type of extension pole    like what the painters use. Woman  I would make a spear that  when you went deep sea diving  you could catch the fish really fast  and then roll it back up  and you could swim easier ... Yeah. ZK  Now  for our next technology we're going to do a little demonstration  and so we need a volunteer from the audience. You sir  come on up. Come on up. Tell everybody your name. Steve Jurvetson  Steve. ZK  It's Steve. All right Steve  now  follow me. We need you to stand right in front of the TED sign. Right there. That's great. And hold onto this. Good luck to you. KS  No  not yet. ZK  I'd just like to let you all know that this presentation has been brought to you by Target. KS  Little bit    that's perfect  just perfect. Now  Zach  we're going to demonstrate a water gun fight from the future. So here  come on up to the front. All right  so now if you'll see here    no  no  it's OK. So  describe to the audience the temperature of your shirt. Go ahead. SJ  It's cold. KS  Now the reason it's cold is that's it's not actually water loaded into these squirt guns    it's a dry liquid developed by  M. It's perfectly clear  it's odorless  it's colorless. It's so safe you could drink this stuff. And the reason it feels cold is because it evaporates    times faster than water. All right  well thanks for coming up. ZK  Wait  wait  Steven    before you go we filled this with the dry liquid so during the break you can shoot your friends. SJ  Excellent  thank you. KS  Thanks for coming up. Let's give him a big round of applause. So what's the significance of this dry liquid  Early versions of the fluid were actually used on a Cray Supercomputer. Now  the unexpected thing about this is that Zach could stand up on stage and drench a perfectly innocent member of the audience without any concern that we'd damage the electronics  that we'd get him wet  that we'd hurt the books or the computers. It works because it's non conductive. So you can see here  you can immerse a whole circuit board in this and it wouldn't cause any damage. You can circulate it to draw the heat away. But today it's most widely used in office buildings    in the sprinkler system    as a fire suppression fluid. Again  it's perfectly safe for people. It puts out the fires  doesn't hurt anything. But our favorite idea for this was using it in a basketball game. So during halftime  it could rain down on the players  cool everyone down  and in a matter of minutes it would dry. Wouldn't hurt the court. ZK  Our next technology comes to us from a company in Japan called Sekisui Chemical. One of their R D engineers was working on a way to make plastic stiffer. While he was doing this  he noticed an unexpected thing. We have a video to show you. KS  So you see there  it didn't bounce back. Now  this was an unintended side effect of some experiments they were doing. It's technically called   shape retaining property.  Now  think about your interactions with aluminum foil. Shape retaining is common in metal  you bend a piece of aluminum foil  and it holds its place. Contrast that with a plastic garbage can    and you can push in the sides and it always bounces back. ZK  For example  you could make a watch that wraps around your wrist  but doesn't use a buckle. Taking it a little further  if you wove those strips together    kind of like a little basket    you could make a shape retaining sheet  and then you could embed it in a cloth  so you could make a picnic sheet that wraps around the table  so that way on a windy day it wouldn't blow away. For our next technology  it's hard to observe the unexpected property by itself  because it's an ink. So  we've prepared a video to show it applied to paper. KS  As this paper is bending  the resistance of the ink changes. So with simple electronics  you can detect how much the page is being bent. Now  to think about the potential for this  think of all the places ink is supplied  on business cards  on the back of cereal boxes  board games. Any place you use ink  you could change the way you interact with it. ZK  So my favorite idea for this is to apply the ink to a book. This could totally change the way that you interface with paper. You see the dark line on the side and the top. As you turn the pages of the book  the book can actually detect what page you're on  based on the curvature of the pages. In addition  if you were to fold in one of the corners  then you could program the book to actually email you the text on the page for your notes. KS  For our last technology  we worked again with Roman and his team at the Directors Bureau to develop a commercial from the future to explain how it works. Old Milk Carton  Oh yeah  it smells good. Who are you  New Milk Carton  I'm New Milk. OMC  I used to smell like you. Narrator  Fresh Watch  from Inventables Dairy Farms. Packaging that changes color when your milk's gone off. Don't let milk spoil your morning. ZK  Now  this technology was developed by these two guys  Professor Ken Suslick and Neil Rakow  of the University of Illinois. KS  Now the way it works  there's a matrix of color dyes. And these dyes change color in response to odors. So the smell of vanilla  that might change the four on the left to brown and the one on the right to yellow. This matrix can produce thousands of different color combinations to represent thousands of different smells. But like in the milk commercial  if you know what odor you want to detect  then they can formulate a specific dye to detect just that odor. ZK  Right. It was that that started a conversation with Professor Suslick and myself  and he was explaining to me the things that this is making possible  beyond just detecting spoiled food. It's really where the significance of it lies. His company actually did a survey of firemen all across the country to try to learn  how are they currently testing the air when they respond to an emergency scene  And he kind of comically explained that time after time  what the firemen would say is  they would rush to the scene of the crime  they would look around  if there were no dead policemen  it was OK to go. I mean  this is a true story. They're using policemen as canaries. But more seriously  they determined that you could develop a device that can smell better than the humans  and say if it's safe for the firemen. In addition  he's spun off a company from the University called ChemSensing  where they're working on medical equipment. So  a patient can come in and actually blow into their device. By detecting the odor of particular bacteria  or viruses  or even lung cancer  the dots will change and they can use software to analyze the results. This can radically improve the way that doctors diagnose patients. Currently  they're using a method of trial and error  but this could tell you precisely what disease you have. KS  So that was the six we had for you today  but I hope you're starting to see why we find these things so fascinating. Because every one of these six changed our understanding of what was possible in the world. Prior to seeing this  we would have assumed  a    foot pole couldn't fit in your pocket  something as inexpensive as ink couldn't sense the way paper is being bent  every one of these things    and we're constantly trying to find more. ZK  This is something that Keith and I really enjoy doing. I'm sure it's obvious to you now  but it was actually yesterday that I was reminded of why. I was having a conversation with Steve Jurvetson  over downstairs by the escalators  and he was telling me that when Chris sent out that little box  one of the items in it was the hydrophobic sand    the sand that doesn't get wet. He said that he was playing with it with his son. And you know  his son was mesmerized  because he would dunk it in the water  he would take it out and it was bone dry. A few weeks later  he said that his son was playing with a lock of his mother's hair  and he noticed that there were some drops of water on the hair. And he took the thing and he looked up to Steve and he said   Look  hydrophobic string.  I mean  after hearing that story    that really summed it up for me. Thank you very much. KS  Thank you. This is very strange for me  because I m not used to doing this  I usually stand on the other side of the light  and now I'm feeling the pressure I put other people into. And it's hard ... The previous speaker has  I think  really painted a very good background as to the impulse behind my work and what drives me  and my sense of loss  and trying to find the answer to the big questions. But this  for me  I mean  coming here to do this  feels like    there s this sculptor that I like very much  Giacometti  who after many years of living in France    and learning  you know  studying and working    he returned home and he was asked  what did you produce  What have you done with so many years of being away  And he sort of  he showed a handful of figurines. And obviously they were   Is this what you spent years doing  And we expected huge masterpieces   But what struck me is the understanding that in those little pieces was the culmination of a man s life  search  thought  everything    just in a reduced  small version. In a way  I feel like that. I feel like I m coming home to talk about what I ve been away doing for    years. And I will start with a brief taster of what I ve been about  a handful of films    nothing much  two feature films and a handful of short films. So  we ll go with the first piece.

The first clip  really  is totally trying to capture what cinema is for me  and where I'm coming from in terms of cinema. The first piece was  really  there's a young woman talking about Nigeria  that she has a feeling she'll be happy there. These are the sentiments of someone that's been away from home. And that was something that I went through  you know  and I'm still going through. I've not been home for quite a while  for about five years now. I've been away    years in total. And so it s really    it's really how suddenly  you know  this was made in       which is the time of Abacha    the military dictatorship  the worst part of Nigerian history  this post colonial history. So  for this girl to have these dreams is simply how we preserve a sense of what home is. How    and it's sort of  perhaps romantic  but I think beautiful  because you just need something to hold on to  especially in a society where you feel alienated. Which takes us to the next piece  where the young man talks about lack of opportunity  living as a black person in Europe  the glass ceiling that we all know about  that we all talk about  and his reality. Again  this was my    this was me talking about    this was  again  the time of multiculturalism in the United Kingdom  and there was this buzzword    and it was trying to say  what exactly does this multiculturalism mean in the real lives of people  And what would a child    what does a child like Jamie    the young boy    think  I mean  with all this anger that's built up inside of him  What happens with that  What  of course  happens with that is violence  which we see when we talk about the ghettos and we talk about  you know  South Central L.A. and this kind of stuff  and which eventually  when channeled  becomes  you know  evolves and manifests itself as riots    like the one in France two years ago  where I live  which shocked everybody  because everyone thought   Oh well  France is a liberal society.  But I lived in England for    years. I've lived in France for about four  and I feel actually thrown back    years  living in France. And then  the third piece. The third piece for me is the question  What is cinema to you  What do you do with cinema  There's a young director  Hollywood director  with his friends    fellow filmmakers    talking about what cinema means. I suppose that will take me to my last piece    what cinema means for me. My life started as a    I started life in       a few months before the Biafran  which lasted for three years and it was three years of war. So that whole thing  that whole childhood echoes and takes me into the next piece. Onicha  Yes  mama. Commander  Soldiers  you are going to fight a battle  so you must get ready and willing to die.

State your name and age for the commission. Ezra  My name is Ezra Gelehun. I am    or   . I don t remember. Ask my sister  she is the witch  she knows everything. CC  Mr. Gelehun  I d like to remind you you re not on trial here for any crimes you committed. E  We were fighting for our freedom. If killing in a war is a crime  then you have to charge every soldier in the world. War is a crime  yes  but I did not start it. You too are a retired General  not so  CC  Yes  correct. E  So you too must stand trial then. Our government was corrupt. Lack of education was their way to control power. If I may ask  do you pay for school in your country  CC  No  we don t. E  You are richer than us. But we pay for school. Your country talks about democracy  but you support corrupt governments like my own. Why  Because you want our diamond. Ask if anyone in this room have ever seen real diamond before  No. CC  Mr. Gelehun  I'd like to remind you  you're not on trial here today. You are not on trial. E  Then let me go. CC  I can't do that  son. E  So you are a liar. NA  Thank you. Just very quickly to say that my point really here  is that while we re making all these huge advancements  what we're doing  which for me  you know  I think we should    Africa should move forward  but we should remember  so we do not go back here again. Thank you. Emeka Okafor  Thank you  Newton. One of the themes that comes through very strongly in the piece we just watched is this sense of the psychological trauma of the young that have to play this role of being child soldiers. And considering where you are coming from  and when we consider the extent to which it s not taken as seriously as it should be  what would you have to say about that  NA  In the process of my research  I actually spent a bit of time in Sierra Leone researching this. And I remember I met a lot of child soldiers    ex combatants  as they like to be called. I met psychosocial workers who worked with them. I met psychiatrists who spent time with them  aid workers  NGOs  the whole lot. But I remember on the flight back on my last trip  I remember breaking down in tears and thinking to myself  if any kid in the West  in the western world  went through a day of what any of those kids have gone through  they will be in therapy for the rest of their natural lives. So for me  the thought that we have all these children    it s a generation  we have a whole generation of children    who have been put through so much psychological trauma or damage  and Africa has to live with that. But I m just saying to factor that in  factor that in with all this great advancement  all this pronouncement of great achievement. That s really my thinking. EO  Well  we thank you again for coming to the TED stage. That was a very moving piece. NA  Thank you. EO  Thank you. One of my favorite cartoon characters is Snoopy. I love the way he sits and lies on his kennel and contemplates the great things of life. So when I thought about compassion  my mind immediately went to one of the cartoon strips  where he's lying there and he says   I really understand  and I really appreciate how one should love one's neighbor as one love's oneself. The only trouble is the people next door  I can't stand them.  This  in a way  is one of the challenges of how to interpret a really good idea. We all  I think  believe in compassion. If you look at all the world religions  all the main world religions  you'll find within them some teaching concerning compassion. So in Judaism  we have  from our Torah  that you should love your neighbor as you love yourself. And within Jewish teachings  the rabbinic teachings  we have Hillel  who taught that you shouldn't do to others what you don't like being done to yourself. And all the main religions have similar teachings. And again  within Judaism  we have a teaching about God  who is called the compassionate one  Ha rachaman. After all  how could the world exist without God being compassionate  And we  as taught within the Torah that we are made in the image of God  so we too have to be compassionate. But what does it mean  How does it impact on our everyday life  Sometimes  of course  being compassionate can produce feelings within us that are very difficult to control. I know there are many times when I've gone and conducted a funeral  or when I have been sitting with the bereaved  or with people who are dying  and I am overwhelmed by the sadness  by the difficulty  the challenge that is there for the family  for the person. And I'm touched  so that tears come to my eyes. And yet  if I just allowed myself to be overwhelmed by these feelings  I wouldn't be doing my job    because I have to actually be there for them and make sure that rituals happen  that practicalities are seen to. And yet  on the other hand  if I didn't feel this compassion  then I feel that it would be time for me to hang up my robe and give up being a rabbi. And these same feelings are there for all of us as we face the world. Who cannot be touched by compassion when we see the terrible horrors of the results of war  or famine  or earthquakes  or tsunamis  I know some people who say  Well  you know there's just so much out there    I can't do anything  I'm not going to even begin to try.  And there are some charity workers who call this compassion fatigue. There are others who feel they can't confront compassion anymore  and so they turn off the television and don't watch. In Judaism  though  we tend to always say  there has to be a middle way. You have to  of course  be aware of the needs of others  but you have to be aware in such a way that you can carry on with your life and be of help to people. So part of compassion has to be an understanding of what makes people tick. And  of course  you can't do that unless you understand yourself a bit more. And there's a lovely rabbinic interpretation of the beginnings of creation  which says that when God created the world  God thought that it would be best to create the world only with the divine attribute of justice. Because  after all  God is just. Therefore  there should be justice throughout the world. And then God looked to the future and realized  if the world was created just with justice  the world couldn't exist. So  God thought   Nope  I'm going to create the world just with compassion.  And then God looked to the future and realized that  in fact  if the world were just filled with compassion  there would be anarchy and chaos. There had to be limits to all things. The rabbis describe this as being like a king who has a beautiful  fragile glass bowl. If you put too much cold water in  it will shatter. If you put boiling water in  it will shatter. What do you have to do  Put in a mixture of the two. And so God put both of these possibilities into the world. There is something more though that has to be there. And that is the translation of the feelings that we may have about compassion into the wider world  into action. So  like Snoopy  we can't just lie there and think great thoughts about our neighbors. We actually have to do something about it. And so there is also  within Judaism  this notion of love and kindness that becomes very important   chesed.  All these three things  then  have to be melded together. The idea of justice  which gives boundaries to our lives and gives us a feeling of what's right about life  what's right about living  what should we be doing  social justice. There has to be a willingness to do good deeds  but not  of course  at the expense of our own sanity. You know  there's no way that you can do anything for anyone if you overdo things. And balancing them all in the middle is this notion of compassion  which has to be there  if you like  at our very roots. This idea of compassion comes to us because we're made in the image of God  who is ultimately the compassionate one. What does this compassion entail  It entails understanding the pain of the other. But even more than that  it means understanding one's connection to the whole of creation  understanding that one is part of that creation  that there is a unity that underlies all that we see  all that we hear  all that we feel. I call that unity God. And that unity is something that connects all of creation. And  of course  in the modern world  with the environmental movement  we're becoming even more aware of the connectivity of things  that something I do here actually does matter in Africa  that if I use too much of my carbon allowance  it seems to be that we are causing a great lack of rain in central and eastern Africa. So there is a connectivity  and I have to understand that    as part of the creation  as part of me being made in the image of God. And I have to understand that my needs sometimes have to be sublimated to other needs. This     minutes  business  I find quite fascinating. Because in Judaism  the number     in Hebrew letters  stands for life    the word  life.  So  in a sense  the    minutes is challenging me to say   In life  this is what's important in terms of compassion.  But  something else as well  actually     minutes is important. Because at Passover  when we have to eat unleavened bread  the rabbis say  what is the difference between dough that is made into bread  and dough that is made into unleavened bread  or  matzah   And they say  It's    minutes.  Because that's how long they say it takes for this dough to become leaven. What does it mean   dough becomes leaven   It means it gets filled with hot air. What's matzah  What's unleavened bread  You don't get it. Symbolically  what the rabbis say is that at Passover  what we have to do is try to get rid of our hot air    our pride  our feeling that we are the most important people in the whole entire world  and that everything should revolve round us. So we try and get rid of those  and so doing  try to get rid of the habits  the emotions  the ideas that enslave us  that make our eyes closed  give us tunnel vision so we don't see the needs of others    and free ourselves and free ourselves from that. And that too is a basis for having compassion  for understanding our place in the world. Now there is  in Judaism  a gorgeous story of a rich man who sat in synagogue one day. And  as many people do  he was dozing off during the sermon. And as he was dozing off  they were reading from the book of Leviticus in the Torah. And they were saying that in the ancient times in the temple in Jerusalem  the priests used to have bread  which they used to place into a special table in the temple in Jerusalem. The man was asleep  but he heard the words bread  temple  God  and he woke up. He said   God wants bread. That's it. God wants bread. I know what God wants.  And he rushed home. And after the Sabbath  he made    loaves of bread  took them to the synagogue  went into the synagogue  opened the ark and said   God  I don't know why you want this bread  but here you are.  And he put it in the ark with the scrolls of the Torah. Then he went home. The cleaner came into the synagogue.  Oh God  I'm in such trouble. I've got children to feed. My wife's ill. I've got no money. What can I do   He goes into the synagogue.  God  will you please help me  Ah  what a wonderful smell.  He goes to the ark. He opens the ark.  There's bread  God  you've answered my plea. You've answered my question.  Takes the bread and goes home. Meanwhile  the rich man thinks to himself   I'm an idiot. God wants bread  God  the one who rules the entire universe  wants my bread   He rushes to the synagogue.  I'll get it out of the ark before anybody finds it.  He goes in there  and it's not there. And he says   God  you really did want it. You wanted my bread. Next week  with raisins.  This went on for years. Every week  the man would bring bread with raisins  with all sorts of good things  put it into the ark. Every week  the cleaner would come.  God you've answered my plea again.  Take the bread. Take it home. Went on until a new rabbi came. Rabbis always spoil things. The rabbi came in and saw what was going on. And he called the two of them to his office. And he said  you know   This is what's happening.  And the rich man    oh  dear    crestfallen.  You mean God didn't want my bread   And the poor man said   And you mean God didn't answer my pleas   And the rabbi said   You've misunderstood me. You've misunderstood totally   he said.  Of course  what you are doing   he said to the rich man   is answering God's plea that we should be compassionate. And God   he said to the poor man   is answering your plea that people should be compassionate and give.  He looked at the rich man. He held the rich man's hands and said   Don't you understand   He said   These are the hands of God.  So that is the way I feel  that I can only try to approach this notion of being compassionate  of understanding that there is a connectivity  that there is a unity in this world  that I want to try and serve that unity  and that I can try and do that by understanding  I hope  trying to understand something of the pain of others  but understanding that there are limits  that people have to bear responsibility for some of the problems that come upon them  and that I have to understand that there are limits to my energy  to the giving I can give. I have to reevaluate them  try and separate out the material things and my emotions that may be enslaving me  so that I can see the world clearly. And then I have to try to see in what ways I can make these the hands of God. And so try to bring compassion to life in this world. A human child is born  and for quite a long time is a consumer. It cannot be consciously a contributor. It is helpless. It doesn't know how to survive  even though it is endowed with an instinct to survive. It needs the help of mother  or a foster mother  to survive. It can't afford to doubt the person who tends the child. It has to totally surrender  as one surrenders to an anesthesiologist. It has to totally surrender. That implies a lot of trust. That implies the trusted person won't violate the trust. As the child grows  it begins to discover that the person trusted is violating the trust. It doesn't know even the word  violation.  Therefore  it has to blame itself  a wordless blame  which is more difficult to really resolve    the wordless self blame. As the child grows to become an adult  so far  it has been a consumer  but the growth of a human being lies in his or her capacity to contribute  to be a contributor. One cannot contribute unless one feels secure  one feels big  one feels  I have enough. To be compassionate is not a joke. It's not that simple. One has to discover a certain bigness in oneself. That bigness should be centered on oneself  not in terms of money  not in terms of power you wield  not in terms of any status that you can command in the society  but it should be centered on oneself. The self  you are self aware. On that self  it should be centered    a bigness  a wholeness. Otherwise  compassion is just a word and a dream. You can be compassionate occasionally  more moved by empathy than by compassion. Thank God we are empathetic. When somebody's in pain  we pick up the pain. In a Wimbledon final match  these two guys fight it out. Each one has got two games. It can be anybody's game. What they have sweated so far has no meaning. One person wins. The tennis etiquette is  both the players have to come to the net and shake hands. The winner boxes the air and kisses the ground  throws his shirt as though somebody is waiting for it. And this guy has to come to the net. When he comes to the net  you see  his whole face changes. It looks as though he's wishing that he didn't win. Why  Empathy. That's human heart. No human heart is denied of that empathy. No religion can demolish that by indoctrination. No culture  no nation and nationalism    nothing can touch it because it is empathy. And that capacity to empathize is the window through which you reach out to people  you do something that makes a difference in somebody's life    even words  even time. Compassion is not defined in one form. There's no Indian compassion. There's no American compassion. It transcends nation  the gender  the age. Why  Because it is there in everybody. It's experienced by people occasionally. Then this occasional compassion  we are not talking about    it will never remain occasional. By mandate  you cannot make a person compassionate. You can't say   Please love me.  Love is something you discover. It's not an action  but in the English language  it is also an action. I will come to it later. So one has got to discover a certain wholeness. I am going to cite the possibility of being whole  which is within our experience  everybody's experience. In spite of a very tragic life  one is happy in moments which are very few and far between. And the one who is happy  even for a slapstick joke  accepts himself and also the scheme of things in which one finds oneself. That means the whole universe  known things and unknown things. All of them are totally accepted because you discover your wholeness in yourself. The subject     me     and the object    the scheme of things    fuse into oneness  an experience nobody can say   I am denied of   an experience common to all and sundry. That experience confirms that  in spite of all your limitations    all your wants  desires  unfulfilled  and the credit cards and layoffs and  finally  baldness    you can be happy. But the extension of the logic is that you don't need to fulfill your desire to be happy. You are the very happiness  the wholeness that you want to be. There's no choice in this  that only confirms the reality that the wholeness cannot be different from you  cannot be minus you. It has got to be you. You cannot be a part of wholeness and still be whole. Your moment of happiness reveals that reality  that realization  that recognition   Maybe I am the whole. Maybe the swami is right. Maybe the swami is right.  You start your new life. Then everything becomes meaningful. I have no more reason to blame myself. If one has to blame oneself  one has a million reasons plus many. But if I say  in spite of my body being limited    if it is black it is not white  if it is white it is not black  body is limited any which way you look at it. Limited. Your knowledge is limited  health is limited  and power is therefore limited  and the cheerfulness is going to be limited. Compassion is going to be limited. Everything is going to be limitless. You cannot command compassion unless you become limitless  and nobody can become limitless  either you are or you are not. Period. And there is no way of your being not limitless too. Your own experience reveals  in spite of all limitations  you are the whole. And the wholeness is the reality of you when you relate to the world. It is love first. When you relate to the world  the dynamic manifestation of the wholeness is  what we say  love. And itself becomes compassion if the object that you relate to evokes that emotion. Then that again transforms into giving  into sharing. You express yourself because you have compassion. To discover compassion  you need to be compassionate. To discover the capacity to give and share  you need to be giving and sharing. There is no shortcut  it is like swimming by swimming. You learn swimming by swimming. You cannot learn swimming on a foam mattress and enter into water. You learn swimming by swimming. You learn cycling by cycling. You learn cooking by cooking  having some sympathetic people around you to eat what you cook. And  therefore  what I say  you have to fake it and make it. You need to. My predecessor meant that. You have to act it out. You have to act compassionately. There is no verb for compassion  but you have an adverb for compassion. That's interesting to me. You act compassionately. But then  how to act compassionately if you don't have compassion  That is where you fake. You fake it and make it. This is the mantra of the United States of America. You fake it and make it. You act compassionately as though you have compassion  grind your teeth  take all the support system. If you know how to pray  pray. Ask for compassion. Let me act compassionately. Do it. You'll discover compassion and also slowly a relative compassion  and slowly  perhaps if you get the right teaching  you'll discover compassion is a dynamic manifestation of the reality of yourself  which is oneness  wholeness  and that's what you are. With these words  thank you very much. Compassion  what does it look like  Come with me to     South Bloodworth Street in Raleigh  North Carolina  where I grew up. If you come in you will see us  evening time  at table    set for ten but not always all seats filled    at the point when dinner is ready to be served. Since mom had eight kids  sometimes she said she couldn't tell who was who and where they were. Before we could eat  she would ask   Are all the children in   And if someone happened to be missing  we would have to  we say   Fix a plate  for that person  put it in the oven  then we could say grace  and we could eat. Also  while we were at the table  there was a ritual in our family  when something significant had happened for any one of us    whether mom had just been elected as the president of the PTA  or whether dad had gotten an assignment at the college of our denomination  or whether someone had won the jabberwocky contest for talent    the ritual at the family was  once the announcement is made  we must take five  ten minutes to do what we call  make over  that person    that is  to make a fuss over the one who had been honored in some way. For when one is honored  all are honored. Also  we had to make a report on our extended  visited  members  that is  extended members of the family  sick and elderly  shut in. My task was  at least once a week  to visit Mother Lassiter who lived on East Street  Mother Williamson who lived on Bledsoe Avenue  and Mother Lathers who lived on Oberlin Road. Why  Because they were old and infirm  and we needed to go by to see if they needed anything. For mom said   To be family  is to care and share and to look out for one another. They are our family.  And  of course  sometimes there was a bonus for going. They would offer sweets or money. Mom says   If they ask you what it costs to either go shopping for them  you must always say  'Nothing.' And if they insist  say  'Whatever you mind to give me.'  This was the nature of being at that table. In fact  she indicated that if we would do that  not only would we have the joy of receiving the gratitude from the members of the extended family  but she said   Even God will smile  and when God smiles  there is peace  and justice  and joy.  So  at the table at      I learned something about compassion. Of course  it was a minister's family  so we had to add God into it. And so  I came to think that mama eternal  mama eternal  is always wondering  Are all the children in  And if we had been faithful in caring and sharing  we had the sense that justice and peace would have a chance in the world. Now  it was not always wonderful at that table. Let me explain a point at which we did not rise to the occasion. It was Christmas  and at our family  oh  what a morning. Christmas morning  where we open up our gifts  where we have special prayers  and where we get to the old upright piano and we would sing carols. It was a very intimate moment. In fact  you could come down to the tree to get your gifts and get ready to sing  and then get ready for breakfast without even taking a bath or getting dressed  except that daddy messed it up. There was a member of his staff who did not have any place on that particular Christmas to celebrate. And daddy brought Elder Revels to the Christmas family celebration. We thought he must be out of his mind. This is our time. This is intimate time. This is when we can just be who we are  and now we have this stuffy brother with his shirt and tie on  while we are still in our PJs. Why would daddy bring Elder Revels  Any other time  but not to the Christmas celebration. And mom overheard us and said   Well  you know what  If you really understand the nature of this celebration  it is that this is a time where you extend the circle of love. That's what the celebration is all about. It's time to make space  to share the enjoyment of life in a beloved community.  So  we sucked up. But growing up at      compassion was not a word to be debated  it was a sensibility to how we are together. We are sisters and brothers united together. And  like Chief Seattle said   We did not spin the web of life. We're all strands in it. And whatever we do to the web  we do to ourselves.  Now that's compassion. So  let me tell you  I kind of look at the world this way. I see pictures  and something says   Now  that's compassion.  A harvested field of grain  with some grain in the corners  reminding me of the Hebrew tradition that you may indeed harvest  but you must always leave some on the edges  just in case there's someone who has not had the share necessary for good nurture. Talk about a picture of compassion. I see    always  it stirs my heart    a picture of Dr. Martin Luther King  Jr. walking arm in arm with Andy Young and Rabbi Heschel and maybe Thich Nhat Hanh and some of the other saints assembled  walking across the bridge and going into Selma. Just a photograph. Arm in arm for struggle. Suffering together in a common hope that we can be brothers and sisters without the accidents of our birth or our ethnicity robbing us of a sense of unity of being. So  there's another picture. Here  this one. I really do like this picture. When Dr. Martin Luther King  Jr. was assassinated  that day  everybody in my community was upset. You heard about riots all across the land. Bobby Kennedy was scheduled to bring an inner city message in Indianapolis. This is the picture. They said   It's going to be too volatile for you to go.  He insisted   I must go.  So  sitting on a flatbed truck  the elders of the community are there  and Bobby stands up and says to the people   I have bad news for you. Some of you may not have heard that Dr. King has been assassinated. I know that you are angry  and I know that you would almost wish to have the opportunity to enter now into activities of revenge. But   he said   what I really want you to know is that I know how you feel. Because I had someone dear to me snatched away. I know how you feel.  And he said   I hope that you will have the strength to do what I did. I allowed my anger  my bitterness  my grief to simmer a while  and then I made up my mind that I was going to make a different world  and we can do that together.  That's a picture. Compassion  I think I see it. I saw it when the Dalai Lama came to the Riverside Church while I was a pastor  and he invited representatives of faith traditions from all around the world. He asked them to give a message  and they each read in their own language a central affirmation  and that was some version of the golden rule   As you would that others would do unto you  do also unto them.  Twelve in their ecclesiastical or cultural or tribal attire affirming one message. We are so connected that we must treat each other as if an action toward you is an action toward myself. One more picture while I'm stinking and thinking about the Riverside Church      . Last night at Chagrin Fall  a newspaperman and a television guy said   That evening  when a service was held at the Riverside Church  we carried it on our station in this city. It was   he said   one of the most powerful moments of life together. We were all suffering. But you invited representatives of all of the traditions to come  and you invited them. 'Find out what it is in your tradition that tells us what to do when we have been humiliated  when we have been despised and rejected.' And they all spoke out of their own traditions  a word about the healing power of solidarity  one with the other.  I developed a sense of compassion sort of as second nature  but I became a preacher. Now  as a preacher  I got a job. I got to preach the stuff  but I got to do it too. Or  as Father Divine in Harlem used to say to folks   Some people preach the Gospel. I have to tangibilitate the Gospel.  So  the real issue is  How do you tangibilitate compassion  How do you make it real  My faith has constantly lifted up the ideal  and challenged me when I fell beneath it. In my tradition  there is a gift that we have made to other traditions    to everybody around the world who knows the story of the  Good Samaritan.  Many people think of it primarily in terms of charity  random acts of kindness. But for those who really study that text a little more thoroughly  you will discover that a question has been raised that leads to this parable. The question was   What is the greatest commandment   And  according to Jesus  the word comes forth   You must love yourself  you must love the Lord your God with all your heart  mind and soul  and your neighbor as yourself.  And then the person asked   Well  what do you mean  'neighbor '  And he answered it by telling the story of the man who fell among thieves  and how religious authorities went the other way  and how their supporters in the congregation went the other way  but an unsuspecting  despised person came along  saw the man in need  provided oil and wine for his wounds  put him on his own transportation  and took him to the inn and asked the innkeeper   Take care of him.  And he said   Here  this is the initial investment  but if needs continue  make sure that you provide them. And whatever else is needed  I will provide it and pay for it when I return.  This always seemed to me to be a deepening of the sense of what it means to be a Good Samaritan. A Good Samaritan is not simply one whose heart is touched in an immediate act of care and charity  but one who provides a system of sustained care    I like that  'a system of sustained care '    in the inn  take care. I think maybe it's one time when the Bible talks about a healthcare system and a commitment to do whatever is necessary    that all God's children would have their needs cared for  so that we could answer when mommy eternal asks   In regards to health  are all the children in   And we could say yes. Oh  what a joy it has been to be a person seeking to tangibilitate compassion. I recall that my work as a pastor has always involved caring for their spiritual needs  being concerned for housing  for healthcare  for the prisoners  for the infirm  for children    even the foster care children for whom no one can even keep a record where they started off  where they are going. To be a pastor is to care for these individual needs. But now  to be a Good Samaritan    and I always say  and to be a good American    for me  is not simply to congratulate myself for the individual acts of care. Compassion takes on a corporate dynamic. I believe that whatever we did around that table at Bloodworth Street must be done around tables and rituals of faith until we become that family  that family together that understands the nature of our unity. We are one people together. So  let me explain to you what I mean when I think about compassion  and why I think it is so important that right at this point in history. We would decide to establish this charter of compassion. The reason it's important is because this is a very special time in history. It is the time that  biblically  we would speak of as the day  or the year  of God's favor. This is a season of grace. Unusual things are beginning to happen. Please pardon me  as a black man  for celebrating that the election of Obama was an unusual sign of the fact that it is a year of favor. And yet  there is so much more that needs to be done. We need to bring health and food and education and respect for all God's citizens  all God's children  remembering mama eternal. Now  let me close my comments by telling you that whenever I feel something very deeply  it usually takes the form of verse. And so I want to close with a little song. I close with this song    it's a children's song    because we are all children at the table of mama eternal. And if mama eternal has taught us correctly  this song will make sense  not only to those of us who are a part of this gathering  but to all who sign the charter for compassion. And this is why we do it. The song says     I made heaven so happy today      Receiving God's love and giving it away     When I looked up  heaven smiled at me     Now  I'm so happy. Can't you see      I'm happy. Look at me. I'm happy. Can't you see      Sharing makes me happy  makes heaven happy too     I'm happy. Look at me. I'm happy. Can't you see      Let me share my happy loving smile with you.   That's compassion.  Applause  I'm speaking about compassion from an Islamic point of view  and perhaps my faith is not very well thought of as being one that is grounded in compassion. The truth of the matter is otherwise. Our holy book  the Koran  consists of     chapters  and each chapter begins with what we call the basmala  the saying of  In the name of God  the all compassionate  the all merciful   or  as Sir Richard Burton    not the Richard Burton who was married to Elizabeth Taylor  but the Sir Richard Burton who lived a century before that and who was a worldwide traveler and translator of many works of literature    translates it.  In the name of God  the compassionating  the compassionate.  And in a saying of the Koran  which to Muslims is God speaking to humanity  God says to his prophet Muhammad    whom we believe to be the last of a series of prophets  beginning with Adam  including Noah  including Moses  including Abraham  including Jesus Christ  and ending with Muhammad    that   We have not sent you  O Muhammad  except as a 'rahmah ' except as a source of compassion to humanity.  For us human beings  and certainly for us as Muslims  whose mission  and whose purpose in following the path of the prophet is to make ourselves as much like the prophet. And the prophet  in one of his sayings  said   Adorn yourselves with the attributes of God.  And because God Himself said that the primary attribute of his is compassion    in fact  the Koran says that  God decreed upon himself compassion   or   reigned himself in by compassion     therefore  our objective and our mission must be to be sources of compassion  activators of compassion  actors of compassion and speakers of compassion and doers of compassion. That is all well and good  but where do we go wrong  and what is the source of the lack of compassion in the world  For the answer to this  we turn to our spiritual path. In every religious tradition  there is the outer path and the inner path  or the exoteric path and the esoteric path. The esoteric path of Islam is more popularly known as Sufism  or  tasawwuf  in Arabic. And these doctors or these masters  these spiritual masters of the Sufi tradition  refer to teachings and examples of our prophet that teach us where the source of our problems lies. In one of the battles that the prophet waged  he told his followers   We are returning from the lesser war to the greater war  to the greater battle.  And they said   Messenger of God  we are battle weary. How can we go to a greater battle   He said   That is the battle of the self  the battle of the ego.  The sources of human problems have to do with egotism   I.  The famous Sufi master Rumi  who is very well known to most of you  has a story in which he talks of a man who goes to the house of a friend  and he knocks on the door  and a voice answers   Who's there    It's me   or  more grammatically correctly   It is I   as we might say in English. The voice says   Go away.  After many years of training  of disciplining  of search and struggle  he comes back. With much greater humility  he knocks again on the door. The voice asks   Who is there   He said   It is you  O heartbreaker.  The door swings open  and the voice says   Come in  for there is no room in this house for two I's      two capital I's  not these eyes     for two egos.  And Rumi's stories are metaphors for the spiritual path. In the presence of God  there is no room for more than one  I   and that is the  I  of divinity. In a teaching    called a  hadith qudsi  in our tradition    God says that   My servant   or  My creature  my human creature  does not approach me by anything that is dearer to me than what I have asked them to do.  And those of you who are employers know exactly what I mean. You want your employees to do what you ask them to do  and if they've done that  then they can do extra. But don't ignore what you've asked them to do.  And   God says   my servant continues to get nearer to me  by doing more of what I've asked them to do     extra credit  we might call it     until I love him or love her. And when I love my servant   God says   I become the eyes by which he or she sees  the ears by which he or she listens  the hand by which he or she grasps  and the foot by which he or she walks  and the heart by which he or she understands.  It is this merging of our self with divinity that is the lesson and purpose of our spiritual path and all of our faith traditions. Muslims regard Jesus as the master of Sufism  the greatest prophet and messenger who came to emphasize the spiritual path. When he says   I am the spirit  and I am the way   and when the prophet Muhammad said   Whoever has seen me has seen God   it is because they became so much an instrument of God  they became part of God's team    so that God's will was manifest through them  and they were not acting from their own selves and their own egos. Compassion on earth is given  it is in us. All we have to do is to get our egos out of the way  get our egotism out of the way. I'm sure  probably all of you here  or certainly the very vast majority of you  have had what you might call a spiritual experience  a moment in your lives when  for a few seconds  a minute perhaps  the boundaries of your ego dissolved. And at that minute  you felt at one with the universe    one with that jug of water  one with every human being  one with the Creator    and you felt you were in the presence of power  of awe  of the deepest love  the deepest sense of compassion and mercy that you have ever experienced in your lives. That is a moment which is a gift of God to us    a gift when  for a moment  he lifts that boundary which makes us insist on  I  I  I  me  me  me   and instead  like the person in Rumi's story  we say   Oh  this is all you. This is all you. And this is all us. And us  and I  and us are all part of you. O  Creator  O  the Objective  The source of our being and the end of our journey  you are also the breaker of our hearts. You are the one whom we should all be towards  for whose purpose we live  and for whose purpose we shall die  and for whose purpose we shall be resurrected again to account to God to what extent we have been compassionate beings.  Our message today  and our purpose today  and those of you who are here today  and the purpose of this charter of compassion  is to remind. For the Koran always urges us to remember  to remind each other  because the knowledge of truth is within every human being. We know it all. We have access to it all. Jung may have called it  the subconscious.  Through our subconscious  in your dreams    the Koran calls our state of sleep  the lesser death    the temporary death     in our state of sleep we have dreams  we have visions  we travel even outside of our bodies  for many of us  and we see wonderful things. We travel beyond the limitations of space as we know it  and beyond the limitations of time as we know it. But all this is for us to glorify the name of the creator whose primary name is the compassionating  the compassionate. God  Bokh  whatever name you want to call him with  Allah  Ram  Om  whatever the name might be through which you name or access the presence of divinity  it is the locus of absolute being  absolute love and mercy and compassion  and absolute knowledge and wisdom  what Hindus call  satchidananda.  The language differs  but the objective is the same. Rumi has another story about three men  a Turk  an Arab and    and I forget the third person  but for my sake  it could be a Malay. One is asking for angur    one is  say  an Englishman    one is asking for eneb  and one is asking for grapes. And they have a fight and an argument because     I want grapes.   I want eneb.  I want angur.     not knowing that the word that they're using refers to the same reality in different languages. There's only one absolute reality by definition  one absolute being by definition  because absolute is  by definition  single  and absolute and singular. There's this absolute concentration of being  the absolute concentration of consciousness  awareness  an absolute locus of compassion and love that defines the primary attributes of divinity. And these should also be the primary attributes of what it means to be human. For what defines humanity  perhaps biologically  is our physiology  but God defines humanity by our spirituality  by our nature. And the Koran says  He speaks to the angels and says   When I have finished the formation of Adam from clay  and breathed into him of my spirit  then  fall in prostration to him.  The angels prostrate  not before the human body  but before the human soul. Why  Because the soul  the human soul  embodies a piece of the divine breath  a piece of the divine soul. This is also expressed in biblical vocabulary when we are taught that we were created in the divine image. What is the imagery of God  The imagery of God is absolute being  absolute awareness and knowledge and wisdom and absolute compassion and love. And therefore  for us to be human    in the greatest sense of what it means to be human  in the most joyful sense of what it means to be human    means that we too have to be proper stewards of the breath of divinity within us  and seek to perfect within ourselves the attribute of being  of being alive  of beingness  the attribute of wisdom  of consciousness  of awareness  and the attribute of being compassionate and loving beings. This is what I understand from my faith tradition  and this is what I understand from my studies of other faith traditions  and this is the common platform on which we must all stand  and when we stand on this platform as such  I am convinced that we can make a wonderful world. And I believe  personally  that we're on the verge and that  with the presence and help of people like you here  we can bring about the prophecy of Isaiah. For he foretold of a period when people shall transform their swords into plowshares and will not learn war or make war anymore. We have reached a stage in human history that we have no option  we must  we must lower our egos  control our egos    whether it is individual ego  personal ego  family ego  national ego    and let all be for the glorification of the one. Thank you  and God bless you. I want to open by quoting Einstein's wonderful statement  just so people will feel at ease that the great scientist of the   th century also agrees with us  and also calls us to this action. He said   A human being is a part of the whole  called by us  the 'universe '    a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself  his thoughts and feelings  as something separated from the rest  a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us  restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion  to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.  This insight of Einstein's is uncannily close to that of Buddhist psychology  wherein compassion     karuna   it is called    is defined as   the sensitivity to another's suffering and the corresponding will to free the other from that suffering.  It pairs closely with love  which is the will for the other to be happy  which requires  of course  that one feels some happiness oneself and wishes to share it. This is perfect in that it clearly opposes self centeredness and selfishness to compassion  the concern for others  and  further  it indicates that those caught in the cycle of self concern suffer helplessly  while the compassionate are more free and  implicitly  more happy. The Dalai Lama often states that compassion is his best friend. It helps him when he is overwhelmed with grief and despair. Compassion helps him turn away from the feeling of his suffering as the most absolute  most terrible suffering anyone has ever had and broadens his awareness of the sufferings of others  even of the perpetrators of his misery and the whole mass of beings. In fact  suffering is so huge and enormous  his own becomes less and less monumental. And he begins to move beyond his self concern into the broader concern for others. And this immediately cheers him up  as his courage is stimulated to rise to the occasion. Thus  he uses his own suffering as a doorway to widening his circle of compassion. He is a very good colleague of Einstein's  we must say. Now  I want to tell a story  which is a very famous story in the Indian and Buddhist tradition  of the great Saint Asanga who was a contemporary of Augustine in the West and was sort of like the Buddhist Augustine. And Asanga lived     years after the Buddha's time. And he was discontented with the state of people's practice of the Buddhist religion in India at that time. And so he said   I'm sick of all this. Nobody's really living the doctrine. They're talking about love and compassion and wisdom and enlightenment  but they are acting selfish and pathetic. So  Buddha's teaching has lost its momentum. I know the next Buddha will come a few thousand years from now  but exists currently in a certain heaven     that's Maitreya     so  I'm going to go on a retreat and I'm going to meditate and pray until the Buddha Maitreya reveals himself to me  and gives me a teaching or something to revive the practice of compassion in the world today.  So he went on this retreat. And he meditated for three years and he did not see the future Buddha Maitreya. And he left in disgust. And as he was leaving  he saw a man    a funny little man sitting sort of part way down the mountain. And he had a lump of iron. And he was rubbing it with a cloth. And he became interested in that. He said   Well what are you doing   And the man said   I'm making a needle.  And he said   That's ridiculous. You can't make a needle by rubbing a lump of iron with a cloth.  And the man said   Really   And he showed him a dish full of needles. So he said   Okay  I get the point.  He went back to his cave. He meditated again. Another three years  no vision. He leaves again. This time  he comes down. And as he's leaving  he sees a bird making a nest on a cliff ledge. And where it's landing to bring the twigs to the cliff  its feathers brushes the rock    and it had cut the rock six to eight inches in. There was a cleft in the rock by the brushing of the feathers of generations of the birds. So he said   All right. I get the point.  He went back. Another three years. Again  no vision of Maitreya after nine years. And he again leaves  and this time  water dripping  making a giant bowl in the rock where it drips in a stream. And so  again  he goes back. And after    years there is still no vision. And he's freaked out. And he won't even look left or right to see any encouraging vision. And he comes to the town. He's a broken person. And there  in the town  he's approached by a dog who comes like this    one of these terrible dogs you can see in some poor countries  even in America  I think  in some areas    and he's looking just terrible. And he becomes interested in this dog because it's so pathetic  and it's trying to attract his attention. And he sits down looking at the dog. And the dog's whole hindquarters are a complete open sore. Some of it is like gangrenous  and there are maggots in the flesh. And it's terrible. He thinks   What can I do to fix up this dog  Well  at least I can clean this wound and wash it.  So  he takes it to some water. He's about to clean  but then his awareness focuses on the maggots. And he sees the maggots  and the maggots are kind of looking a little cute. And they're maggoting happily in the dog's hindquarters there.  Well  if I clean the dog  I'll kill the maggots. So how can that be  That's it. I'm a useless person and there's no Buddha  no Maitreya  and everything is all hopeless. And now I'm going to kill the maggots   So  he had a brilliant idea. And he took a shard of something  and cut a piece of flesh from his thigh  and he placed it on ground. He was not really thinking too carefully about the ASPCA. He was just immediately caught with the situation. So he thought   I will take the maggots and put them on this piece of flesh  then clean the dog's wounds  and then I'll figure out what to do with the maggots.  So he starts to do that. He can't grab the maggots. Apparently they wriggle around. They're kind of hard to grab  these maggots. So he says   Well  I'll put my tongue on the dog's flesh. And then the maggots will jump on my warmer tongue     the dog is kind of used up     and then I'll spit them one by one down on the thing.  So he goes down  and he's sticking his tongue out like this. And he had to close his eyes  it's so disgusting  and the smell and everything. And then  suddenly  there's a pfft  a noise like that. He jumps back and there  of course  is the future Buddha Maitreya in a beautiful vision    rainbow lights  golden  jeweled  a plasma body  an exquisite mystic vision    that he sees. And he says   Oh.  He bows. But  being human  he's immediately thinking of his next complaint. So as he comes up from his first bow he says   My Lord  I'm so happy to see you  but where have you been for    years  What is this   And Maitreya says   I was with you. Who do you think was making needles and making nests and dripping on rocks for you  mister dense    Looking for the Buddha in person   he said. And he said   You didn't have  until this moment  real compassion. And  until you have real compassion  you cannot recognize love.   Maitreya  means love   the loving one   in Sanskrit. And so he looked very dubious  Asanga did. And he said   If you don't believe me  just take me with you.  And so he took the Maitreya    it shrunk into a globe  a ball    took him on his shoulder. And he ran into town in the marketplace  and he said   Rejoice  Rejoice  The future Buddha has come ahead of all predictions. Here he is.  And then pretty soon they started throwing rocks and stones at him    it wasn't Chautauqua  it was some other town    because they saw a demented looking  scrawny looking yogi man  like some kind of hippie  with a bleeding leg and a rotten dog on his shoulder  shouting that the future Buddha had come. So  naturally  they chased him out of town. But on the edge of town  one elderly lady  a charwoman in the charnel ground  saw a jeweled foot on a jeweled lotus on his shoulder and then the dog  but she saw the jewel foot of the Maitreya  and she offered a flower. So that encouraged him  and he went with Maitreya. Maitreya then took him to a certain heaven  which is the typical way a Buddhist myth unfolds. And Maitreya then kept him in heaven for five years  dictating to him five complicated tomes of the methodology of how you cultivate compassion. And then I thought I would share with you what that method is  or one of them. A famous one  it's called the  Sevenfold Causal Method of Developing Compassion.  And it begins first by one meditating and visualizing that all beings are with one    even animals too  but everyone is in human form. The animals are in one of their human lives. The humans are human. And then  among them  you think of your friends and loved ones  the circle at the table. And you think of your enemies  and you think of the neutral ones. And then you try to say   Well  the loved ones I love. But  you know  after all  they're nice to me. I had fights with them. Sometimes they were unfriendly. I got mad. Brothers can fight. Parents and children can fight. So  in a way  I like them so much because they're nice to me. While the neutral ones I don't know. They could all be just fine. And then the enemies I don't like because they're mean to me. But they are nice to somebody. I could be them.  And then the Buddhists  of course  think that  because we've all had infinite previous lives  we've all been each other's relatives  actually. Therefore all of you  in the Buddhist view  in some previous life  although you don't remember it and neither do I  have been my mother    for which I do apologize for the trouble I caused you. And also  actually  I've been your mother. I've been female  and I've been every single one of yours' mother in a previous life  the way the Buddhists reflect. So  my mother in this life is really great. But all of you in a way are part of the eternal mother. You gave me that expression   the eternal mama   you said. That's wonderful. So  that's the way the Buddhists do it. A theist Christian can think that all beings  even my enemies  are God's children. So  in that sense  we're related. So  they first create this foundation of equality. So  we sort of reduce a little of the clinging to the ones we love    just in the meditation    and we open our mind to those we don't know. And we definitely reduce the hostility and the  I don't want to be compassionate to them  to the ones we think of as the bad guys  the ones we hate and we don't like. And we don't hate anyone  therefore. So we equalize. That's very important. And then the next thing we do is what is called  mother recognition.  And that is  we think of every being as familiar  as family. We expand. We take the feeling about remembering a mama  and we defuse that to all beings in this meditation. And we see the mother in every being. We see that look that the mother has on her face  looking at this child that is a miracle that she has produced from her own body  being a mammal  where she has true compassion  truly is the other  and identifies completely. Often the life of that other will be more important to her than her own life. And that's why it's the most powerful form of altruism. The mother is the model of all altruism for human beings  in spiritual traditions. And so  we reflect until we can sort of see that motherly expression in all beings. People laugh at me because  you know  I used to say that I used to meditate on mama Cheney as my mom  when  of course  I was annoyed with him about all of his evil doings in Iraq. I used to meditate on George Bush. He's quite a cute mom in a female form. He has his little ears and he smiles and he rocks you in his arms. And you think of him as nursing you. And then Saddam Hussein's serious mustache is a problem  but you think of him as a mom. And this is the way you do it. You take any being who looks weird to you  and you see how they could be familiar to you. And you do that for a while  until you really feel that. You can feel the familiarity of all beings. Nobody seems alien. They're not  other.  You reduce the feeling of otherness about beings. Then you move from there to remembering the kindness of mothers in general  if you can remember the kindness of your own mother  if you can remember the kindness of your spouse  or  if you are a mother yourself  how you were with your children. And you begin to get very sentimental  you cultivate sentimentality intensely. You will even weep  perhaps  with gratitude and kindness. And then you connect that with your feeling that everyone has that motherly possibility. Every being  even the most mean looking ones  can be motherly. And then  third  you step from there to what is called  a feeling of gratitude.  You want to repay that kindness that all beings have shown to you. And then the fourth step  you go to what is called  lovely love.  In each one of these you can take some weeks  or months  or days depending on how you do it  or you can do them in a run  this meditation. And then you think of how lovely beings are when they are happy  when they are satisfied. And every being looks beautiful when they are internally feeling a happiness. Their face doesn't look like this. When they're angry  they look ugly  every being  but when they're happy they look beautiful. And so you see beings in their potential happiness. And you feel a love toward them and you want them to be happy  even the enemy. We think Jesus is being unrealistic when he says   Love thine enemy.  He does say that  and we think he's being unrealistic and sort of spiritual and highfalutin.  Nice for him to say it  but I can't do that.  But  actually  that's practical. If you love your enemy that means you want your enemy to be happy. If your enemy was really happy  why would they bother to be your enemy  How boring to run around chasing you. They would be relaxing somewhere having a good time. So it makes sense to want your enemy to be happy  because they'll stop being your enemy because that's too much trouble. But anyway  that's the  lovely love.   And then finally  the fifth step is compassion   universal compassion.  And that is where you then look at the reality of all the beings you can think of. And you look at them  and you see how they are. And you realize how unhappy they are actually  mostly  most of the time. You see that furrowed brow in people. And then you realize they don't even have compassion on themselves. They're driven by this duty and this obligation.  I have to get that. I need more. I'm not worthy. And I should do something.  And they're rushing around all stressed out. And they think of it as somehow macho  hard discipline on themselves. But actually they are cruel to themselves. And  of course  they are cruel and ruthless toward others. And they  then  never get any positive feedback. And the more they succeed and the more power they have  the more unhappy they are. And this is where you feel real compassion for them. And you then feel you must act. And the choice of the action  of course  hopefully will be more practical than poor Asanga  who was fixing the maggots on the dog because he had that motivation  and whoever was in front of him  he wanted to help. But  of course  that is impractical. He should have founded the ASPCA in the town and gotten some scientific help for dogs and maggots. And I'm sure he did that later.  Laughter  But that just indicates the state of mind  you know. And so the next step    the sixth step beyond  universal compassion     is this thing where you're linked with the needs of others in a true way  and you have compassion for yourself also  and it isn't sentimental only. You might be in fear of something. Some bad guy is making himself more and more unhappy being more and more mean to other people and getting punished in the future for it in various ways. And in Buddhism  they catch it in the future life. Of course in theistic religion they're punished by God or whatever. And materialism  they think they get out of it just by not existing  by dying  but they don't. And so they get reborn as whatever  you know. Never mind. I won't get into that. But the next step is called  universal responsibility.  And that is very important    the Charter of Compassion must lead us to develop through true compassion  what is called  universal responsibility.  In the great teaching of his Holiness the Dalai Lama that he always teaches everywhere  he says that that is the common religion of humanity  kindness. But  kindness  means  universal responsibility.  And that means whatever happens to other beings is happening to us  we are responsible for that  and we should take it and do whatever we can at whatever little level and small level that we can do it. We absolutely must do that. There is no way not to do it. And then  finally  that leads to a new orientation in life where we live equally for ourselves and for others and we are joyful and happy. One thing we mustn't think is that compassion makes you miserable. Compassion makes you happy. The first person who is happy when you get great compassion is yourself  even if you haven't done anything yet for anybody else. Although  the change in your mind already does something for other beings  they can sense this new quality in yourself  and it helps them already  and gives them an example. And that uncompassionate clock has just showed me that it's all over. So  practice compassion  read the charter  disseminate it and develop it within yourself. Don't just think   Well  I'm compassionate   or  I'm not compassionate   and sort of think you're stuck there. You can develop this. You can diminish the non compassion  the cruelty  the callousness  the neglect of others  and take universal responsibility for them. And then  not only will God smile and the eternal mama will smile  but Karen Armstrong will smile. Thank you very much.  Applause  I'm going to talk about compassion and the golden rule from a secular perspective and even from a kind of scientific perspective. I'm going to try to give you a little bit of a natural history of compassion and the golden rule. So  I'm going to be sometimes using kind of clinical language  and so it's not going to sound as warm and fuzzy as your average compassion talk. I want to warn you about that. So  I do want to say  at the outset  that I think compassion's great. The golden rule is great. I'm a big supporter of both. And I think it's great that the leaders of the religions of the world are affirming compassion and the golden rule as fundamental principles that are integral to their faiths. At the same time  I think religions don't deserve all the credit. I think nature gave them a helping hand here. I'm going to argue tonight that compassion and the golden rule are  in a certain sense  built into human nature. But I'm also going to argue that once you understand the sense in which they are built into human nature  you realize that just affirming compassion  and affirming the golden rule  is really not enough. There's a lot of work to be done after that. OK so  a quick natural history  first of compassion. In the beginning  there was compassion  and I mean not just when human beings first showed up  but actually even before that. I think it's probably the case that  in the human evolutionary lineage  even before there were homo sapiens  feelings like compassion and love and sympathy had earned their way into the gene pool  and biologists have a pretty clear idea of how this first happened. It happened through a principle known as kin selection. And the basic idea of kin selection is that  if an animal feels compassion for a close relative  and this compassion leads the animal to help the relative  then  in the end  the compassion actually winds up helping the genes underlying the compassion itself. So  from a biologist's point of view  compassion is actually a gene's way of helping itself. OK. I warned you this was not going to be very warm and fuzzy. I'll get there    I hope to get a little fuzzier. This doesn't bother me so much  that the underlying Darwinian rationale of compassion is kind of self serving at the genetic level. Actually  I think the bad news about kin selection is just that it means that this kind of compassion is naturally deployed only within the family. That's the bad news. The good news is compassion is natural. The bad news is that this kin selected compassion is naturally confined to the family. Now  there's more good news that came along later in evolution  a second kind of evolutionary logic. Biologists call that  reciprocal altruism.  OK. And there  the basic idea is that compassion leads you to do good things for people who then will return the favor. Again  I know this is not as inspiring a notion of compassion as you may have heard in the past  but from a biologist's point of view  this reciprocal altruism kind of compassion is ultimately self serving too. It's not that people think that  when they feel the compassion. It's not consciously self serving  but to a biologist  that's the logic. And so  you wind up most easily extending compassion to friends and allies. I'm sure a lot of you  if a close friend has something really terrible happen to them  you feel really bad. But if you read in the newspaper that something really horrible happened to somebody you've never heard of  you can probably live with that. That's just human nature. So  it's another good news bad news story. It's good that compassion was extended beyond the family by this kind of evolutionary logic. The bad news is this doesn't bring us universal compassion by itself. So  there's still work to be done. Now  there's one other result of this dynamic called reciprocal altruism  which I think is kind of good news  which is that the way that this is played out in the human species  it has given people an intuitive appreciation of the golden rule. I don't quite mean that the golden rule itself is written in our genes  but you can go to a hunter gatherer society that has had no exposure to any of the great religious traditions  no exposure to ethical philosophy  and you'll find  if you spend time with these people  that  basically  they believe that one good turn deserves another  and that bad deeds should be punished. And evolutionary psychologists think that these intuitions have a basis in the genes. So  they do understand that if you want to be treated well  you treat other people well. And it's good to treat other people well. That's close to being a kind of built in intuition. So  that's good news. Now  if you've been paying attention  you're probably anticipating that there's bad news here  we still aren't to universal love  and it's true because  although an appreciation of the golden rule is natural  it's also natural to carve out exceptions to the golden rule. I mean  for example  none of us  probably  want to go to prison  but we all think that there are some people who should go to prison. Right  So  we think we should treat them differently than we would want to be treated. Now  we have a rationale for that. We say they did these bad things that make it just that they should go to prison. None of us really extends the golden rule in truly diffuse and universal fashion. We have the capacity to carve out exceptions  put people in a special category. And the problem is that    although in the case of sending people to prison  you have this impartial judiciary determining who gets excluded from the golden rule    that in everyday life  the way we all make these decisions about who we're not going to extend the golden rule to  is we use a much rougher and readier formula. Basically it's just like  if you're my enemy  if you're my rival    if you're not my friend  if you're not in my family    I'm much less inclined to apply the golden rule to you. We all do that  and you see it all over the world. You see it in the Middle East  people who  from Gaza  are firing missiles at Israel. They wouldn't want to have missiles fired at them  but they say   Well  but the Israelis  or some of them have done things that put them in a special category.  The Israelis would not want to have an economic blockade imposed on them  but they impose one on Gaza  and they say   Well  the Palestinians  or some of them  have brought this on themselves.  So  it's these exclusions to the golden rule that amount to a lot of the world's trouble. And it's natural to do that. So  the fact that the golden rule is in some sense built in to us is not  by itself  going to bring us universal love. It's not going to save the world. Now  there's one piece of good news I have that may save the world. Okay. Are you on the edges of your seats here  Good  because before I tell you about that good news  I'm going to have to take a little excursion through some academic terrain. So  I hope I've got your attention with this promise of good news that may save the world. It's this non zero sumness stuff you just heard a little bit about. It's just a quick introduction to game theory. This won't hurt. Okay. It's about zero sum and non zero sum games. If you ask what kind of a situation is conducive to people becoming friends and allies  the technical answer is a non zero sum situation. And if you ask what kind of situation is conducive to people defining people as enemies  it's a zero sum situation. So  what do those terms mean  Basically  a zero sum game is the kind you're used to in sports  where there's a winner and a loser. So  their fortunes add up to zero. So  in tennis  every point is either good for you and bad for the other person  or good for them  bad for you. Either way  your fortunes add up to zero. That's a zero sum game. Now  if you're playing doubles  then the person on your side of the net is in a non zero sum relationship with you  because every point is either good for both of you    positive  win win    or bad for both of you  it's lose lose. That's a non zero sum game. And in real life  there are lots of non zero sum games. In the realm of economics  say  if you buy something  that means you'd rather have the merchandise than the money  but the merchant would rather have the money than the merchandise. You both feel you've won. In a war  two allies are playing a non zero sum game. It's going to either be win win or lose lose for them. So  there are lots of non zero sum games in real life. And you could basically reformulate what I said earlier  about how compassion is deployed and the golden rule is deployed  by just saying  well  compassion most naturally flows along non zero sum channels where people perceive themselves as being in a potentially win win situation with some of their friends or allies. The deployment of the golden rule most naturally happens along these non zero sum channels. So  kind of webs of non zero sumness are where you would expect compassion and the golden rule to kind of work their magic. With zero sum channels you would expect something else. Okay. So  now you're ready for the good news that I said might save the world. And now I can admit that it might not too  now that I've held your attention for three minutes of technical stuff. But it may. And the good news is that history has naturally expanded these webs of non zero sumness  these webs that can be these channels for compassion. You can go back all the way to the stone age  technological evolution    roads  the wheel  writing  a lot of transportation and communication technologies    has just inexorably made it so that more people can be in more non zero sum relationships with more and more people at greater and greater distances. That's the story of civilization. It's why social organization has grown from the hunter gatherer village to the ancient state  the empire  and now here we are in a globalized world. And the story of globalization is largely a story of non zero sumness. You've probably heard the term  interdependence  applied to the modern world. Well  that's just another term for non zero sum. If your fortunes are interdependent with somebody  then you live in a non zero sum relationship with them. And you see this all the time in the modern world. You saw it with the recent economic crash  where bad things happen in the economy    bad for everybody  for much of the world. Good things happen  and it's good for much of the world. And  you know  I'm happy to say  I think there's really evidence that this non zero sum kind of connection can expand the moral compass. I mean  if you look at the American attitudes toward Japanese during World War II    look at the depictions of Japanese in the American media as just about subhuman  and look at the fact that we dropped atomic bombs  really without giving it much of a thought    and you compare that to the attitude now  I think part of that is due to a kind of economic interdependence. Any form of interdependence  or non zero sum relationship forces you to acknowledge the humanity of people. So  I think that's good. And the world is full of non zero sum dynamics. Environmental problems  in many ways  put us all in the same boat. And there are non zero sum relationships that maybe people aren't aware of. For example  probably a lot of American Christians don't think of themselves as being in a non zero sum relationship with Muslims halfway around the world  but they really are  because if these Muslims become happier and happier with their place in the world and feel that they have a place in it  that's good for Americans  because there will be fewer terrorists to threaten American security. If they get less and less happy  that will be bad for Americans. So  there's plenty of non zero sumness. And so  the question is  If there's so much non zero sumness  why has the world not yet been suffused in love  peace  and understanding  The answer's complicated. It's the occasion for a whole other talk. Certainly  a couple of things are that  first of all  there are a lot of zero sum situations in the world. And also  sometimes people don't recognize the non zero sum dynamics in the world. In both of these areas  I think politicians can play a role. This isn't only about religion. I think politicians can help foster non zero sum relationships  Economic engagement is generally better than blockades and so on  in this regard. And politicians can be aware  and should be aware that  when people around the world are looking at them  are looking at their nation and picking up their cues for whether they are in a zero sum or a non zero sum relationship with a nation    like  say  America  or any other nation    human psychology is such that they use cues like  Do we feel we're being respected  Because  you know  historically  if you're not being respected  you're probably not going to wind up in a non zero sum  mutually profitable relationship with people. So  we need to be aware of what kind of signals we're sending out. And some of this  again  is in the realm of political work. If there's one thing I can encourage everyone to do  politicians  religious leaders  and us  it would be what I call  expanding the moral imagination     that is to say  your ability to put yourself in the shoes of people in very different circumstances. This is not the same as compassion  but it's conducive to compassion. It opens the channels for compassion. And I'm afraid we have another good news bad news story  which is that the moral imagination is part of human nature. That's good  but again we tend to deploy it selectively. Once we define somebody as an enemy  we have trouble putting ourselves in their shoes  just naturally. So  if you want to take a particularly hard case for an American  somebody in Iran who is burning an American flag  and you see them on TV. Well  the average American is going to resist the moral exercise of putting themselves in that person's head and is going to resist the idea that they have much in common with that person. And if you tell them   Well  they think America disrespects them and even wants to dominate them  and they hate America. Has there ever been somebody who disrespected you so much that you kind of hated them briefly   You know  they'll resist that comparison and that's natural  that's human. And  similarly  the person in Iran  when you try to humanize somebody in America who said that Islam is evil  they'll have trouble with that. So  it's a very difficult thing to get people to expand the moral imagination to a place it doesn't naturally go. I think it's worth the trouble because  again  it just helps us to understand. If you want to reduce the number of people who are burning flags  it helps to understand what makes them do it. And I think it's good moral exercise. I would say here is where religious leaders come in  because religious leaders are good at reframing issues for people  at harnessing the emotional centers of the brain to get people to alter their awareness and reframe the way they think. I mean  religious leaders are kind of in the inspiration business. It's their great calling right now  to get people all around the world better at expanding their moral imaginations  appreciating that in so many ways they're in the same boat. I would just sum up the way things look  at least from this secular perspective  as far as compassion and the golden rule go  by saying that it's good news that compassion and the golden rule are in some sense built into human nature. It's unfortunate that they tend to be selectively deployed. And it's going to take real work to change that. But  nobody ever said that doing God's work was going to be easy. Thanks. I think the future of this planet depends on humans  not technology  and we already have the knowledge    we re kind of at the endgame with knowledge. But we re nowhere near the endgame when it comes to our perception. We still have one foot in the dark ages. And when you listen to some of the presentations here    and the extraordinary range of human capability  our understandings    and then you contrast it with the fact we still call this planet   Earth   it s pretty extraordinary    we have one foot in the dark ages. Just quickly  Aristotle  his thing was   It s not flat  stupid  it s round.  Galileo    he had the Inquisition  so he had to be a little bit more polite    his was   It s not in the middle  you know.  And Hawkes   it s not earth  stupid  it s ocean.  This is an ocean planet. T.S. Eliot really said it for me    and this should give you goose bumps   we shall not cease from exploration and the end of our exploring shall be to return where we started and know the place for the first time.  And the next lines are   Through the unknown remembered gate  where the last of earth discovered is that which is the beginning.  So I have one message. It seems to me that we re all pointed in the wrong direction. For the rocketeers in the audience  I love what you re doing  I admire the guts  I admire the courage    but your rockets are pointed in the wrong goddamn direction. And it s all a question of perspective. Let me try and tell you    I don t mean to insult you  but look  if I    and I m not doing this for real because it would be an insult  so I m going to pretend  and it softens the blow    I m going to tell you what you re thinking. If I held up a square that was one foot square and the color of earth  and I held up another square that was the root two square    so it s  .  times bigger    and was the color of the oceans  and I said  what is the relative value of these two things  Well  it s the relative importance. You would say    yeah  yeah  yeah  we all know this  water covers twice the area of the planet than dry land. But it s a question of perception  and if that s what you re thinking  if that s what you think I mean when I say   This is an ocean planet stupidly called 'Earth.'  If you think that that s the relative importance  two to one  you re wrong by a factor of ten. Now  you re not as thick as two short planks  but you sound like it when you say  Earth   because that demonstration  if I turned around this way    that earth plane would be as thin as paper. It s a thin film  two dimensional existence. The ocean representation would have a depth to it. And if you hefted those two things you might find that the relative scale of those is    to  . It turns out that something more than    percent of life on earth is aquatic. That means that us terrestrials occupy a minority. The problem we have in believing that is    you just have to give up this notion that this Earth was created for us. Because it s a problem we have. If this is an ocean planet and we only have a small minority of this planet  it just interferes with a lot of what humanity thinks. Okay. Let me criticize this thing. I m not talking about James Cameron    although I could  but I won t. You really do have to go and see his latest film   Aliens of the Deep.  It s incredible. It features two of these deep rovers  and I can criticize them because these sweet things are mine. This  I think  represents one of the most beautiful classic submersibles built. If you look at that sub  you ll see a sphere. This is an acryclic sphere. It generates all of the buoyancy  all of the payload for the craft  and the batteries are down here hanging underneath  exactly like a balloon. This is the envelope  and this is the gondola  the payload. Also coming up later for criticism are these massive lights. And this one actually carries two great manipulators. It actually is a very good working sub    that s what it was designed for. The problem with it is    and the reason I will never build another one like it    is that this is a product of two dimensional thinking. It s what we humans do when we go in the ocean as engineers  we take all our terrestrial hang ups  all our constraints    importantly  these two dimensional constraints that we have  and they re so constrained we don t even understand it    and we take them underwater. You notice that Jim Cameron is sitting in a seat. A seat works in a two dimensional world  where gravity blasts down on that seat  OK  And in a two dimensional world  we do know about the third dimension but we don t use it because to go up requires an awful lot of energy against gravity. And then our mothers tell us   Careful you don t fall down     because you ll fall over. Now  go into the real atmosphere of this planet. This planet has an inner atmosphere of water  it s its inner atmosphere. It has two atmospheres    a lesser  outer gaseous atmosphere  a lighter one. Most of life on earth is in that inner atmosphere. And that life enjoys a three dimensional existence  which is alien to us. Fish do not sit in seats. They don t. Their mothers don t say to little baby fish   Careful you don t fall over.  They don t fall over. They don t fall. They live in a three dimensional world where there is no difference in energy between going this way  that way  that way or that way. It s truly a three dimensional space. And we re only just beginning to grasp it. I don t know of any other submersible  or even remote  that just takes advantage that this is a three dimensional space. This is the way we should be going into the oceans. This is a three dimensional machine. What we need to do is go down into the ocean with the freedom of the animals  and move in this three dimensional space. OK  this is good stuff. This is man s first attempt at flying underwater. Right now  I m just coming down on this gorgeous  big  giant manta ray. She has twice the wingspan that I do. There I m coming  she sees me. And just notice how she rolls under and turns  she doesn t sit there and try and blow air into a tank and kind of flow up or sink down    she just rolls. And the craft that I m in    this hasn t been shown before. Chris asked us to show stuff that hasn t been shown before. I wanted you to notice that she actually turned to come back up. There I am  I see her coming back  coming up underneath me. I put reverse thrust and I try and pull gently down. I m trying to do everything very gently. We spent about three hours together and she s beginning to trust me. And this ballet is controlled by this lady here. She gets about that close and then she pulls away. So now I try and go after her  but I m practicing flying. This is the first flying machine. This was the first prototype. This was a fly by wire. It has wings. There re no silly buoyancy tanks    it s permanently  positively buoyant. And then by moving through the water it s able to take that control. Now  look at that  look  it s    she just blew me away. She just rolled right away from underneath. Really that s the only real dive I ve ever made in this machine. It took    years to build. But this lady here taught me  hah  taught me so much. We just learned so much in three hours in the water there. I just had to go and build another machine. But look here. Instead of blowing tanks and coming up slowly without thinking about it  it s a little bit of back pressure  and that sub just comes straight back up out of the water. This is an internal Sony camera. Thank you  Sony. I don t really look that ugly  but the camera is so close that it s just distorted. Now  there she goes  right overhead. This is a wide angle camera. She s just a few inches off the top of my head.  Aah  ha  oh  he just crossed over the top of my head about  oh  I don t know  just so close.  I come back up  not for air.  This is an incredible encounter with a manta. I m speechless. We ve been just feet apart. I m going back down now.  Okay  can we cut that  Lights back up please. Trying to fly and keep up with that animal    it wasn t the lack of maneuverability that we had. It was the fact she was going so slow. I actually designed that to move faster through the water because I thought that was the thing that we needed to do  to move fast and get range. But after that encounter I really did want to go back with that animal and dance. She wanted to dance. And so what we needed to do was increase the wing area so that we just had more grip  develop higher forces. So the sub that was outside last year    this is the one. You see the larger wing area here. Also  clearly  it was such a powerful thing  we wanted to try and bring other people but we couldn't figure out how to do it. So we opened the world s first flight school. The rational for the world s first flight school goes something like  when the coastguards come up to me and say    they used to leave us alone when we were diving these goofy little spherical things  but when we started flying around in underwater jet fighters they got a little nervous    they would come up and say   Do you have a license for that   And then I d put my sunglasses on  the beard that would all sprout out  and I would say   I don t need no stinking license.   I write these stinking license   which I do. So Bob Gelfond's around here    but somebody in the audience here has license number   . They re one of the first subsea aviators. So we ve run two flight schools. Where the hell that goes  I don t know  but it s a lot of fun. What comes next in    seconds  I can t tell you. But the patent for underwater flight    Karen and I  we were looking at it  some business partners wanted us to patent it    we weren t sure about that. We ve decided we re just going to let that go. It just seems wrong to try and patent       the freedom for underwater flight. So anybody who wants to copy us and come and join us  go for it. The other thing is that we ve got much lower costs. We developed some other technology called spider optics  and Craig Ventner asked me to make an announcement here this morning  we re going to be building a beautiful  little  small version of this    unmanned  super deep    for his boat to go and get back some deep sea DNA stuff. Thank you. This was in an area called Wellawatta  a prime residential area in Colombo. We stood on the railroad tracks that ran between my friend's house and the beach. The tracks are elevated about eight feet from the waterline normally  but at that point the water had receded to a level three or four feet below normal. I'd never seen the reef here before. There were fish caught in rock pools left behind by the receding water. Some children jumped down and ran to the rock pools with bags. They were trying to catch fish. No one realized that this was a very bad idea. The people on the tracks just continued to watch them. I turned around to check on my friend's house. Then someone on the tracks screamed. Before I could turn around  everyone on the tracks was screaming and running. The water had started coming back. It was foaming over the reef. The children managed to run back onto the tracks. No one was lost there. But the water continued to climb. In about two minutes  it had reached the level of the railroad tracks and was coming over it. We had run about     meters by this time. It continued to rise. I saw an old man standing at his gate  knee deep in water  refusing to move. He said he'd lived his whole life there by the beach  and that he would rather die there than run. A boy broke away from his mother to run back into his house to get his dog  who was apparently afraid. An old lady  crying  was carried out of her house and up the road by her son. The slum built on the railroad reservation between the sea and the railroad tracks was completely swept away. Since this was a high risk location  the police had warned the residents  and no one was there when the water rose. But they had not had any time to evacuate any belongings. For hours afterwards  the sea was strewn with bits of wood for miles around    all of this was from the houses in the slum. When the waters subsided  it was as if it had never existed. This may seem hard to believe    unless you've been reading lots and lots of news reports    but in many places  after the tsunami  villagers were still terrified. When what was a tranquil sea swallows up people  homes and long tail boats    mercilessly  without warning    and no one can tell you anything reliable about whether another one is coming  I'm not sure you'd want to calm down either. One of the scariest things about the tsunami that I've not seen mentioned is the complete lack of information. This may seem minor  but it is terrifying to hear rumor after rumor after rumor that another tidal wave  bigger than the last  will be coming at exactly   p.m.  or perhaps tonight  or perhaps ... You don't even know if it is safe to go back down to the water  to catch a boat to the hospital. We think that Phi Phi hospital was destroyed. We think this boat is going to Phuket hospital  but if it's too dangerous to land at its pier  then perhaps it will go to Krabi instead  which is more protected. We don't think another wave is coming right away. At the Phi Phi Hill Resort  I was tucked into the corner furthest away from the television  but I strained to listen for information. They reported that there was an  .  magnitude earthquake in Sumatra  which triggered the massive tsunami. Having this news was comforting in some small way to understand what had just happened to us. However  the report focused on what had already occurred and offered no information on what to expect now. In general  everything was merely hearsay and rumor  and not a single person I spoke to for over    hours knew anything with any certainty. Those were two accounts of the Asian tsunami from two Internet blogs that essentially sprang up after it occurred. I'm now going to show you two video segments from the tsunami that also were shown on blogs. I should warn you  they're pretty powerful. One from Thailand  and the second one from Phuket as well. Voice    It's coming in. It's coming again. Voice    It's coming again  Voice    Yeah. It's coming again. Voice    Come get inside here. Voice    It's coming again. Voice    New wave  Voice    It's coming again. New wave   Unclear  They called me out here. James Surowiecki  Phew. Those were both on this site  waveofdestruction.org. In the world of blogs  there's going to be before the tsunami and after the tsunami  because one of the things that happened in the wake of the tsunami was that  although initially    that is  in that first day    there was actually a kind of dearth of live reporting  there was a dearth of live video and some people complained about this. They said   The blogsters let us down.  What became very clear was that  within a few days  the outpouring of information was immense  and we got a complete and powerful picture of what had happened in a way that we never had been able to get before. And what you had was a group of essentially unorganized  unconnected writers  video bloggers  etc.  who were able to come up with a collective portrait of a disaster that gave us a much better sense of what it was like to actually be there than the mainstream media could give us. And so in some ways the tsunami can be seen as a sort of seminal moment  a moment in which the blogosphere came  to a certain degree  of age. Now  I'm going to move now from this kind of    the sublime in the traditional sense of the word  that is to say  awe inspiring  terrifying    to the somewhat more mundane. Because when we think about blogs  I think for most of us who are concerned about them  we're primarily concerned with things like politics  technology  etc. And I want to ask three questions in this talk  in the    minutes that remain  about the blogosphere. The first one is  What does it tell us about our ideas  about what motivates people to do things  The second is  Do blogs genuinely have the possibility of accessing a kind of collective intelligence that has previously remained  for the most part  untapped  And then the third part is  What are the potential problems  or the dark side of blogs as we know them  OK  the first question  What do they tell us about why people do things  One of the fascinating things about the blogosphere specifically  and  of course  the Internet more generally    and it's going to seem like a very obvious point  but I think it is an important one to think about    is that the people who are generating these enormous reams of content every day  who are spending enormous amounts of time organizing  linking  commenting on the substance of the Internet  are doing so primarily for free. They are not getting paid for it in any way other than in the attention and  to some extent  the reputational capital that they gain from doing a good job. And this is    at least  to a traditional economist    somewhat remarkable  because the traditional account of economic man would say that  basically  you do things for a concrete reward  primarily financial. But instead  what we're finding on the Internet    and one of the great geniuses of it    is that people have found a way to work together without any money involved at all. They have come up with  in a sense  a different method for organizing activity. The Yale Law professor Yochai Benkler  in an essay called  Coase's Penguin   talks about this open source model  which we're familiar with from Linux  as being potentially applicable in a whole host of situations. And  you know  if you think about this with the tsunami  what you have is essentially a kind of an army of local journalists  who are producing enormous amounts of material for no reason other than to tell their stories. That's a very powerful idea  and it's a very powerful reality. And it's one that offers really interesting possibilities for organizing a whole host of activities down the road. So  I think the first thing that the blogosphere tells us is that we need to expand our idea of what counts as rational  and we need to expand our simple equation of value equals money  or  you have to pay for it to be good  but that in fact you can end up with collectively really brilliant products without any money at all changing hands. There are a few bloggers    somewhere maybe around     now    who do  in fact  make some kind of money  and a few who are actually trying to make a full time living out of it  but the vast majority of them are doing it because they love it or they love the attention  or whatever it is. So  Howard Rheingold has written a lot about this and  I think  is writing about this more  but this notion of voluntary cooperation is an incredibly powerful one  and one worth thinking about. The second question is  What does the blogosphere actually do for us  in terms of accessing collective intelligence  You know  as Chris mentioned  I wrote a book called  The Wisdom of Crowds.  And the premise of  The Wisdom of Crowds  is that  under the right conditions  groups can be remarkably intelligent. And they can actually often be smarter than even the smartest person within them. The simplest example of this is if you ask a group of people to do something like guess how many jellybeans are in a jar. If I had a jar of jellybeans and I asked you all to guess how many jellybeans were in that jar  your average guess would be remarkably good. It would be somewhere probably within three and five percent of the number of beans in the jar  and it would be better than    to    percent of you. There may be one or two of you who are brilliant jelly bean guessers  but for the most part the group's guess would be better than just about all of you. And what's fascinating is that you can see this phenomenon at work in many more complicated situations. For instance  if you look at the odds on horses at a racetrack  they predict almost perfectly how likely a horse is to win. In a sense  the group of betters at the racetrack is forecasting the future  in probabilistic terms. You know  if you think about something like Google  which essentially is relying on the collective intelligence of the Web to seek out those sites that have the most valuable information    we know that Google does an exceptionally good job of doing that  and it does that because  collectively  this disorganized thing we call the  World Wide Web  actually has a remarkable order  or a remarkable intelligence in it. And this  I think  is one of the real promises of the blogosphere. Dan Gillmor    whose book  We the Media  is included in the gift pack    has talked about it as saying that  as a writer  he's recognized that his readers know more than he does. And this is a very challenging idea. It's a very challenging idea to mainstream media. It's a very challenging idea to anyone who has invested an enormous amount of time and expertise  and who has a lot of energy invested in the notion that he or she knows better than everyone else. But what the blogosphere offers is the possibility of getting at the kind of collective  distributive intelligence that is out there  and that we know is available to us if we can just figure out a way of accessing it. Each blog post  each blog commentary may not  in and of itself  be exactly what we're looking for  but collectively the judgment of those people posting  those people linking  more often than not is going to give you a very interesting and enormously valuable picture of what's going on. So  that's the positive side of it. That's the positive side of what is sometimes called participatory journalism or citizen journalism  etc.    that  in fact  we are giving people who have never been able to talk before a voice  and we're able to access information that has always been there but has essentially gone untapped. But there is a dark side to this  and that's what I want to spend the last part of my talk on. One of the things that happens if you spend a lot of time on the Internet  and you spend a lot of time thinking about the Internet  is that it is very easy to fall in love with the Internet. It is very easy to fall in love with the decentralized  bottom up structure of the Internet. It is very easy to think that networks are necessarily good things    that being linked from one place to another  that being tightly linked in a group  is a very good thing. And much of the time it is. But there's also a downside to this    a kind of dark side  in fact    and that is that the more tightly linked we've become to each other  the harder it is for each of us to remain independent. One of the fundamental characteristics of a network is that  once you are linked in the network  the network starts to shape your views and starts to shape your interactions with everybody else. That's one of the things that defines what a network is. A network is not just the product of its component parts. It is something more than that. It is  as Steven Johnson has talked about  an emergent phenomenon. Now  this has all these benefits  it's very beneficial in terms of the efficiency of communicating information  it gives you access to a whole host of people  it allows people to coordinate their activities in very good ways. But the problem is that groups are only smart when the people in them are as independent as possible. This is the paradox of the wisdom of crowds  or the paradox of collective intelligence  that what it requires is actually a form of independent thinking. And networks make it harder for people to do that  because they drive attention to the things that the network values. So  one of the phenomena that's very clear in the blogosphere is that once a meme  once an idea gets going  it is very easy for people to just sort of pile on  because other people have  say  a link. People have linked to it  and so other people in turn link to it  etc.  etc. And that phenomenon of piling on the existing links is one that is characteristic of the blogosphere  particularly of the political blogosphere  and it is one that essentially throws off this beautiful  decentralized  bottom up intelligence that blogs can manifest in the right conditions. The metaphor that I like to use is the metaphor of the circular mill. A lot of people talk about ants. You know  this is a conference inspired by nature. When we talk about bottom up  decentralized phenomena  the ant colony is the classic metaphor  because  no individual ant knows what it's doing  but collectively ants are able to reach incredibly intelligent decisions. They're able to reach food as efficiently as possible  they're able to guide their traffic with remarkable speed. So  the ant colony is a great model  you have all these little parts that collectively add up to a great thing. But we know that occasionally ants go astray  and what happens is that  if army ants are wandering around and they get lost  they start to follow a simple rule    just do what the ant in front of you does. And what happens is that the ants eventually end up in a circle. And there's this famous example of one that was       feet long and lasted for two days  and the ants just kept marching around and around in a circle until they died. And that  I think  is a sort of thing to watch out for. That's the thing we have to fear    is that we're just going to keep marching around and around until we die. Now  I want to connect this back  though  to the tsunami  because one of the great things about the tsunami    in terms of the blogosphere's coverage  not in terms of the tsunami itself    is that it really did represent a genuine bottom up phenomenon. You saw sites that had never existed before getting huge amounts of traffic. You saw people being able to offer up their independent points of view in a way that they hadn't before. There  you really did see the intelligence of the Web manifest itself. So  that's the upside. The circular mill is the downside. And I think that the former is what we really need to strive for. Thank you very much.  Applause  Thank you for being here. And I say  thank you for being here  because I was silent for    years. And the first words that I spoke were in Washington  D.C.  on the   th anniversary of Earth Day. And my family and friends had gathered there to hear me speak. And I said   Thank you for being here.  My mother  out in the audience  she jumped up   Hallelujah  Johnny s talking   Imagine if you were quiet for    years and your mother was out in the audience  say. My dad said to me   That s one     I ll explain that. But I turned around because I didn t recognize where my voice was coming from. I hadn t heard my voice in    years  so I turned around and I looked and I said   God  who's saying what I m thinking   And then I realized it was me  you know  and I kind of laughed. And I could see my father   Yeah  he really is crazy.  Well  I want to take you on this journey. And the journey  I believe  is a metaphor for all of our journeys. Even though this one is kind of unusual  I want you to think about your own journey. My journey began in      when I witnessed two oil tankers collide beneath the Golden Gate  and a half a million gallons of oil spilled into the bay. It disturbed me so much that I decided that I was going to give up riding and driving in motorized vehicles. That s a big thing in California. And it was a big thing in my little community of Point Reyes Station in Inverness  California  because there were only about     people there in the winter   this was back in '   now. And so when I came in and I started walking around  people    they just knew what was going on. And people would drive up next to me and say   John  what are you doing   And I d say   Well  I m walking for the environment.  And they said   No  you re walking to make us look bad  right  You re walking to make us feel bad.  And maybe there was some truth to that  because I thought that if I started walking  everyone would follow. Because of the oil  everybody talked about the polllution. And so I argued with people about that  I argued and I argued. I called my parents up. I said   I ve given up riding and driving in cars.  My dad said   Why didn t you do that when you were      I didn t know about the environment then. They re back in Philadelphia. And so I told my mother   I m happy though  I m really happy.  She said   If you were happy  son  you wouldn t have to say it.  Mothers are like that. And so  on my   th birthday I decided  because I argued so much and I talk so much  that I was going to stop speaking for just one day    one day    to give it a rest. And so I did. I got up in the morning and I didn t say a word. And I have to tell you  it was a very moving experience  because for the first time  I began listening    in a long time. And what I heard  it kind of disturbed me. Because what I used to do  when I thought I was listening  was I would listen just enough to hear what people had to say and think that I could    I knew what they were going to say  and so I stopped listening. And in my mind  I just kind of raced ahead and thought of what I was going to say back  while they were still finishing up. And then I would launch in. Well  that just ended communication. So on this first day I actually listened. And it was very sad for me  because I realized that for those many years I had not been learning. I was   . I thought I knew everything. I didn t. And so I decided I d better do this for another day  and another day  and another day until finally  I promised myself for a year I would keep quiet because I started learning more and more and I needed to learn more. So for a year I said I would keep quiet  and then on my birthday I would reassess what I had learned and maybe I would talk again. Well  that lasted    years. Now during that time    those    years    I walked and I played the banjo and I painted and I wrote in my journal  and I tried to study the environment by reading books. And I decided that I was going to go to school. So I did. I walked up to Ashland  Oregon  where they were offering an environmental studies degree. It s only     miles. And I went into the Registrar s office and     What  what  what   I had a newspaper clipping.  Oh  so you really want to go to school here  You don t    We have a special program for you.  They did. And in those two years  I graduated with my first degree    a bachelor s degree. And my father came out  he was so proud. He said   Listen  we re really proud of you son  but what are you going to do with a bachelor s degree  You don t ride in cars  you don t talk    you re going to have to do those things.  I hunched my shoulder  I picked my backpack up again and I started walking. I walked all the way up to Port Townsend  Washington  where I built a wooden boat  rode it across Puget Sound and walked across Washington  to  Idaho and down to Missoula  Montana. I had written the University of Montana two years earlier and said I'd like to go to school there. I said I'd be there in about two years. And I was there. I showed up in two years and they    I tell this story because they really helped me. There are two stories in Montana. The first story is I didn t have any money    that s a sign I used a lot. And they said  Don't worry about that.  The director of the program said   Come back tomorrow.  He gave me     dollars  and he said   Register for one credit. You re going to go to South America  aren t you   And I said    Rivers and lakes  the hydrological systems  South America. So I did that. He came back  he said to me   OK John  now that you've registered for that one credit  you can have a key to an office  you can matriculate    you re matriculating  so you can use the library. And what we re going to do is  we re going to have all of the professors allow you to go to class. They re going to save your grade  and when we figure out how to get you the rest of the money  then you can register for that class and they ll give you the grade.  Wow  they don t do that in graduate schools  I don t think. But I use that story because they really wanted to help me. They saw that I was really interested in the environment  and they really wanted to help me along the way. And during that time  I actually taught classes without speaking. I had    students when I first walked into the class. I explained  with a friend who could interpret my sign language  that I was John Francis  I was walking around the world  I didn t talk and this was the last time this person s going to be here interpreting for me. All the students sat around and they went ... I could see they were looking for the schedule  to see when they could get out. They had to take that class with me. Two weeks later  everyone was trying to get into our class. And I learned in that class    because I would do things like this ... and they were all gathered around  going   What's he trying to say    I don't know  I think he's talking about clear cutting.   Yeah  clear cutting.   No  no  no  that's not clear cutting  that s    he's using a handsaw.   Well  you can t clearcut with a ...   Yes  you can clear cut ...   No  I think he s talking about selective forestry.  Now this was a discussion class and we were having a discussion. I just backed out of that  you know  and I just kind of kept the fists from flying. But what I learned was that sometimes I would make a sign and they said things that I absolutely did not mean  but I should have. And so what came to me is  if you were a teacher and you were teaching  if you weren t learning you probably weren t teaching very well. And so I went on. My dad came out to see me graduate and  you know  I did the deal  and my father said   We re really proud of you son  but ...   You know what went on  he said   You ve got to start riding and driving and start talking. What are you going to do with a master s degree   I hunched my shoulder  I got my backpack and I went on to the University of Wisconsin. I spent two years there writing on oil spills. No one was interested in oil spills. But something happened    Exxon Valdez. And I was the only one in the United States writing on oil spills. My dad came out again. He said   I don't know how you do this  son    I mean  you don't ride in cars  you don t talk. My sister said maybe I should leave you alone  because you seem to be doing a lot better when you re not saying anything.  Well  I put on my backpack again. I put my banjo on and I walked all the way to the East Coast  put my foot in the Atlantic Ocean    it was seven years and one day it took me to walk across the United States. And on Earth Day          the   th anniversary of Earth Day    that s when I began to speak. And that s why I said   Thank you for being here.  Because it's sort of like that tree in the forest falling  and if there's no one there to hear  does it really make a sound  And I m thanking you  and I'm thanking my family because they had come to hear me speak. And that s communication. And they also taught me about listening    that they listened to me. And it s one of those things that came out of the silence  the listening to each other. Really  very important    we need to listen to each other. Well  my journey kept going on. My dad said   That s one   and I still didn t let that go. I worked for the Coastguard  was made a U.N. Goodwill Ambassador. I wrote regulations for the United States    I mean  I wrote oil spill regulations.    years ago  if someone had said to me   John  do you really want to make a difference    Yeah  I want to make a difference.  He said   You just start walking east  get out of your car and just start walking east.  And as I walked off a little bit  they'd say   Yeah  and shut up  too.   You re going to make a difference  buddy.  How could that be  how could that be  How could doing such a simple thing like walking and not talking make a difference  Well  my time at the Coast Guard was a really good time. And after that    I only worked one year    I said   That's enough. One year's enough for me to do that.  I got on a sailboat and I sailed down to the Caribbean  and walked through all of the islands  and to Venezuela. And you know  I forgot the most important thing  which is why I started talking  which I have to tell you. I started talking because I had studied environment. I d studied environment at this formal level  but there was this informal level. And the informal level    I learned about people  and what we do and how we are. And environment changed from just being about trees and birds and endangered species to being about how we treated each other. Because if we are the environment  then all we need to do is look around us and see how we treat ourselves and how we treat each other. And so that s the message that I had. And I said   Well  I'm going to have to spread that message.  And I got in my sailboat  sailed all the way through the Caribbean    it wasn't really my sailboat  I kind of worked on that boat    got to Venezuela and I started walking. This is the last part of this story  because it s how I got here  because I still didn't ride in motorized vehicles. I was walking through El Dorado    it's a prison town  famous prison  or infamous prison    in Venezuela  and I don t know what possessed me  because this was not like me. There I am  walking past the guard gate and the guard stops and says   Pasaporte  pasaporte   and with an M   pointed at me. And I looked at him and I said   Passport  huh  I don't need to show you my passport. It s in the back of my pack. I'm Dr. Francis  I'm a U.N. Ambassador and I'm walking around the world.  And I started walking off. What possessed me to say this thing  The road turned into the jungle. I didn t get shot. And I got to    I start saying   Free at last    thank God Almighty  I m free at last.   What was that about   I m saying. What was that about  It took me     miles to figure out that  in my heart  in me  I had become a prisoner. I was a prisoner and I needed to escape. The prison that I was in was the fact that I did not drive or use motorized vehicles. Now how could that be  Because when I started  it seemed very appropriate to me not to use motorized vehicles. But the thing that was different was that every birthday  I asked myself about silence  but I never asked myself about my decision to just use my feet. I had no idea I was going to become a U.N. Ambassador. I had no idea I would have a Ph.D. And so I realized that I had a responsibility to more than just me  and that I was going to have to change. You know  we can do it. I was going to have to change. And I was afraid to change  because I was so used to the guy who only just walked. I was so used to that person that I didn t want to stop. I didn t know who I would be if I changed. But I know I needed to. I know I needed to change  because it would be the only way that I could be here today. And I know that a lot of times we find ourselves in this wonderful place where we ve gotten to  but there s another place for us to go. And we kind of have to leave behind the security of who we ve become  and go to the place of who we are becoming. And so  I want to encourage you to go to that next place  to let yourself out of any prison that you might find yourself in  as comfortable as it may be  because we have to do something now. We have to change now. As our former Vice President said  we have to become activists. So if my voice can touch you  if my actions can touch you  if my being here can touch you  please let it be. And I know that all of you have touched me while I ve been here. So  let s go out into the world and take this caring  this love  this respect that we ve shown each other right here at TED  and take this out into the world. Because we are the environment  and how we treat each other is really how we re going to treat the environment. So I want to thank you for being here and I want to end this in five seconds of silence. Thank you. This is a guy named Bob McKim. He was a creativity researcher in the '  s and '  s  and also led the Stanford Design Program. And in fact  my friend and IDEO founder  David Kelley  who s out there somewhere  studied under him at Stanford. And he liked to do an exercise with his students where he got them to take a piece of paper and draw the person who sat next to them  their neighbor  very quickly  just as quickly as they could. And in fact  we re going to do that exercise right now. You all have a piece of cardboard and a piece of paper. It s actually got a bunch of circles on it. I need you to turn that piece of paper over  you should find that it s blank on the other side. And there should be a pencil. And I want you to pick somebody that s seated next to you  and when I say  go  you ve got    seconds to draw your neighbor  OK  So  everybody ready  OK. Off you go. You ve got    seconds  you d better be fast. Come on  those masterpieces ... OK  Stop. All right  now. Yes  lot s of laughter. Yeah  exactly. Lots of laughter  quite a bit of embarrassment. Am I hearing a few  sorry s   I think I m hearing a few sorry s. Yup  yup  I think I probably am. And that s exactly what happens every time  every time you do this with adults. McKim found this every time he did it with his students. He got exactly the same response  lots and lots of sorry s. And he would point this out as evidence that we fear the judgment of our peers  and that we re embarrassed about showing our ideas to people we think of as our peers  to those around us. And this fear is what causes us to be conservative in our thinking. So we might have a wild idea  but we re afraid to share it with anybody else. OK  so if you try the same exercise with kids  they have no embarrassment at all. They just quite happily show their masterpiece to whoever wants to look at it. But as they learn to become adults  they become much more sensitive to the opinions of others  and they lose that freedom and they do start to become embarrassed. And in studies of kids playing  it s been shown time after time that kids who feel secure  who are in a kind of trusted environment    they re the ones that feel most free to play. And if you re starting a design firm  let s say  then you probably also want to create a place where people have the same kind of security. Where they have the same kind of security to take risks. Maybe have the same kind of security to play. Before founding IDEO  David said that what he wanted to do was to form a company where all the employees are my best friends. Now  that wasn t just self indulgence. He knew that friendship is a short cut to play. And he knew that it gives us a sense of trust  and it allows us then to take the kind of creative risks that we need to take as designers. And so  that decision to work with his friends    now he has     of them    was what got IDEO started. And our studios  like  I think  many creative workplaces today  are designed to help people feel relaxed  familiar with their surroundings  comfortable with the people that they re working with. It takes more than decor  but I think we ve all seen that creative companies do often have symbols in the workplace that remind people to be playful  and that it s a permissive environment. So  whether it s this microbus meeting room that we have in one our buildings at IDEO  or at Pixar  where the animators work in wooden huts and decorated caves  or at the Googleplex  where it s famous for its  beach  volleyball courts  and even this massive dinosaur skeleton with pink flamingos on it. Don t know the reason for the pink flamingos  but anyway  they re there in the garden. Or even in the Swiss office of Google  which perhaps has the most wacky ideas of all. And my theory is  that s so the Swiss can prove to their Californian colleagues that they re not boring. So they have the slide  and they even have a fireman s pole. Don t know what they do with that  but they have one. So all of these places have these symbols. Now  our big symbol at IDEO is actually not so much the place  it s a thing. And it s actually something that we invented a few years ago  or created a few years ago. It s a toy  it s called a  finger blaster.  And I forgot to bring one up with me. So if somebody can reach under the chair that s next to them  you ll find something taped underneath it. That s great. If you could pass it up. Thanks  David  I appreciate it. So this is a finger blaster  and you will find that every one of you has got one taped under your chair. And I m going to run a little experiment. Another little experiment. But before we start  I need just to put these on. Thank you. All right. Now  what I m going to do is  I m going to see how    I can t see out of these  OK. I m going to see how many of you at the back of the room can actually get those things onto the stage. So the way they work is  you know  you just put your finger in the thing  pull them back  and off you go. So  don t look backwards. That s my only recommendation here. I want to see how many of you can get these things on the stage. So come on  There we go  there we go. Thank you. Thank you. Oh. I have another idea. I wanted to    there we go. There we go. Thank you  thank you  thank you. Not bad  not bad. No serious injuries so far. Well  they re still coming in from the back there  they re still coming in. Some of you haven t fired them yet. Can you not figure out how to do it  or something  It s not that hard. Most of your kids figure out how to do this in the first    seconds  when they pick it up. All right. This is pretty good  this is pretty good. Okay  all right. Let s    I suppose we'd better... I'd better clear these up out of the way  otherwise  I m going to trip over them. All right. So the rest of you can save them for when I say something particularly boring  and then you can fire at me. All right. I think I m going to take these off now  because I can t see a damn thing when I ve    all right  OK. So  ah  that was fun. All right  good. So  OK  so why  So we have the finger blasters. Other people have dinosaurs  you know. Why do we have them  Well  as I said  we have them because we think maybe playfulness is important. But why is it important  We use it in a pretty pragmatic way  to be honest. We think playfulness helps us get to better creative solutions. Helps us do our jobs better  and helps us feel better when we do them. Now  an adult encountering a new situation    when we encounter a new situation we have a tendency to want to categorize it just as quickly as we can  you know. And there s a reason for that  we want to settle on an answer. Life s complicated  we want to figure out what s going on around us very quickly. I suspect  actually  that the evolutionary biologists probably have lots of reasons  for  why we want to categorize new things very  very quickly. One of them might be  you know  when we see this funny stripy thing  is that a tiger just about to jump out and kill us  Or is it just some weird shadows on the tree  We need to figure that out pretty fast. Well  at least  we did once. Most of us don t need to anymore  I suppose. This is some aluminum foil  right  You use it in the kitchen. That s what it is  isn t it  Of course it is  of course it is. Well  not necessarily. Kids are more engaged with open possibilities. Now  they ll certainly    when they come across something new  they ll certainly ask   What is it   Of course they will. But they ll also ask   What can I do with it   And you know  the more creative of them might get to a really interesting example. And this openness is the beginning of exploratory play. Any parents of young kids in the audience  There must be some. Yeah  thought so. So we ve all seen it  haven t we  We ve all told stories about how  on Christmas morning  our kids end up playing with the boxes far more than they play with the toys that are inside them. And you know  from an exploration perspective  this behavior makes complete sense. Because you can do a lot more with boxes than you can do with a toy. Even one like  say  Tickle Me Elmo    which  despite its ingenuity  really only does one thing  whereas boxes offer an infinite number of choices. So again  this is another one of those playful activities that  as we get older  we tend to forget and we have to relearn. So another one of Bob McKim s favorite exercises is called the     Circles Test.  So we re back to work. You guys are going to get back to work again. Turn that piece of paper that you did the sketch on back over  and you ll find those    circles printed on the piece of paper. So it should look like this. You should be looking at something like this. So what I m going to do is  I m going to give you minute  and I want you to adapt as many of those circles as you can into objects of some form. So for example  you could turn one into a football  or another one into a sun. All I m interested in is quantity. I want you to do as many of them as you can  in the minute that I m just about to give you. So  everybody ready  OK  Off you go. Okay. Put down your pencils  as they say. So  who got more than five circles figured out  Hopefully everybody  More than     Keep your hands up if you did   .         Anybody get all     No  Oh  Somebody did. Fantastic. Did anybody to a variation on a theme  Like a smiley face  Happy face  Sad face  Sleepy face  Anybody do that  Anybody use my examples  The sun and the football  Great. Cool. So I was really interested in quantity. I wasn t actually very interested in whether they were all different. I just wanted you to fill in as many circles as possible. And one of the things we tend to do as adults  again  is we edit things. We stop ourselves from doing things. We self edit as we re having ideas. And in some cases  our desire to be original is actually a form of editing. And that actually isn t necessarily really playful. So that ability just to go for it and explore lots of things  even if they don t seem that different from each other  is actually something that kids do well  and it is a form of play. So now  Bob McKim did another version of this test in a rather famous experiment that was done in the     s. Anybody know what this is  It s the peyote cactus. It s the plant from which you can create mescaline  one of the psychedelic drugs. For those of you around in the '  s  you probably know it well. McKim published a paper in       describing an experiment that he and his colleagues conducted to test the effects of psychedelic drugs on creativity. So he picked    professionals    they were engineers  physicists  mathematicians  architects  furniture designers even  artists    and he asked them to come along one evening  and to bring a problem with them that they were working on. He gave each of them some mescaline  and had them listen to some nice  relaxing music for a while. And then he did what s called the Purdue Creativity Test. You might know it as   How many uses can you find for a paper clip   It s basically the same thing as the    circles thing that I just had you do. Now  actually  he gave the test before the drugs and after the drugs  to see what the difference was in people s facility and speed with coming up with ideas. And then he asked them to go away and work on those problems that they d brought. And they d come up with a bunch of interesting solutions    and actually  quite valid solutions    to the things that they d been working on. And so  some of the things that they figured out  some of these individuals figured out  in one case  a new commercial building and designs for houses that were accepted by clients  a design of a solar space probe experiment  a redesign of the linear electron accelerator  an engineering improvement to a magnetic tape recorder    you can tell this is a while ago  the completion of a line of furniture  and even a new conceptual model of the photon. So it was a pretty successful evening. In fact  maybe this experiment was the reason that Silicon Valley got off to its great start with innovation. We don t know  but it may be. We need to ask some of the CEOs whether they were involved in this mescaline experiment. But really  it wasn t the drugs that were important  it was this idea that what the drugs did would help shock people out of their normal way of thinking  and getting them to forget the adult behaviors that were getting in the way of their ideas. But it s hard to break our habits  our adult habits. At IDEO we have brainstorming rules written on the walls. Edicts like   Defer judgment   or  Go for quantity.  And somehow that seems wrong. I mean  can you have rules about creativity  Well  it sort of turns out that we need rules to help us break the old rules and norms that otherwise we might bring to the creative process. And we ve certainly learnt that over time  you get much better brainstorming  much more creative outcomes when everybody does play by the rules. Now  of course  many designers  many individual designers  achieve this is in a much more organic way. I think the Eameses are wonderful examples of experimentation. And they experimented with plywood for many years without necessarily having one single goal in mind. They were exploring following what was interesting to them. They went from designing splints for wounded soldiers coming out of World War II and the Korean War  I think  and from this experiment they moved on to chairs. Through constant experimentation with materials  they developed a wide range of iconic solutions that we know today  eventually resulting in  of course  the legendary lounge chair. Now  if the Eameses had stopped with that first great solution  then we wouldn t be the beneficiaries of so many wonderful designs today. And of course  they used experimentation in all aspects of their work  from films to buildings  from games to graphics. So  they re great examples  I think  of exploration and experimentation in design. Now  while the Eameses were exploring those possibilities  they were also exploring physical objects. And they were doing that through building prototypes. And building is the next of the behaviors that I thought I d talk about. So the average Western first grader spends as much as    percent of their play time taking part in what s called  construction play.  Construction play    it s playful  obviously  but also a powerful way to learn. When play is about building a tower out of blocks  the kid begins to learn a lot about towers. And as they repeatedly knock it down and start again  learning is happening as a sort of by product of play. It s classically learning by doing. Now  David Kelley calls this behavior  when it s carried out by designers   thinking with your hands.  And it typically involves making multiple  low resolution prototypes very quickly  often by bringing lots of found elements together in order to get to a solution. On one of his earliest projects  the team was kind of stuck  and they came up with a mechanism by hacking together a prototype made from a roll on deodorant. Now  that became the first commercial computer mouse for the Apple Lisa and the Macintosh. So  they learned their way to that by building prototypes. Another example is a group of designers who were working on a surgical instrument with some surgeons. They were meeting with them  they were talking to the surgeons about what it was they needed with this device. And one of the designers ran out of the room and grabbed a white board marker and a film canister    which is now becoming a very precious prototyping medium    and a clothespin. He taped them all together  ran back into the room and said   You mean  something like this   And the surgeons grabbed hold of it and said  well  I want to hold it like this  or like that. And all of a sudden a productive conversation was happening about design around a tangible object. And in the end it turned into a real device. And so this behavior is all about quickly getting something into the real world  and having your thinking advanced as a result. At IDEO there s a kind of a back to preschool feel sometimes about the environment. The prototyping carts  filled with colored paper and Play Doh and glue sticks and stuff    I mean  they do have a bit of a kindergarten feel to them. But the important idea is that everything s at hand  everything s around. So when designers are working on ideas  they can start building stuff whenever they want. They don t necessarily even have to go into some kind of formal workshop to do it. And we think that s pretty important. And then the sad thing is  although preschools are full of this kind of stuff  as kids go through the school system it all gets taken away. They lose this stuff that facilitates this sort of playful and building mode of thinking. And of course  by the time you get to the average workplace  maybe the best construction tool we have might be the Post it notes. It s pretty barren. But by giving project teams and the clients who they re working with permission to think with their hands  quite complex ideas can spring into life and go right through to execution much more easily. This is a nurse using a very simple    as you can see    plasticine prototype  explaining what she wants out of a portable information system to a team of technologists and designers that are working with her in a hospital. And just having this very simple prototype allows her to talk about what she wants in a much more powerful way. And of course  by building quick prototypes  we can get out and test our ideas with consumers and users much more quickly than if we re trying to describe them through words. But what about designing something that isn t physical  Something like a service or an experience  Something that exists as a series of interactions over time  Instead of building play  this can be approached with role play. So  if you re designing an interaction between two people    such as  I don t know    ordering food at a fast food joint or something  you need to be able to imagine how that experience might feel over a period of time. And I think the best way to achieve that  and get a feeling for any flaws in your design  is to act it out. So we do quite a lot of work at IDEO trying to convince our clients of this. They can be a little skeptical  I ll come back to that. But a place  I think  where the effort is really worthwhile is where people are wrestling with quite serious problems    things like education or security or finance or health. And this is another example in a healthcare environment of some doctors and some nurses and designers acting out a service scenario around patient care. But you know  many adults are pretty reluctant to engage with role play. Some of it s embarrassment and some of it is because they just don t believe that what emerges is necessarily valid. They dismiss an interesting interaction by saying  you know   That s just happening because they re acting it out.  Research into kids' behavior actually suggests that it s worth taking role playing seriously. Because when children play a role  they actually follow social scripts quite closely that they ve learnt from us as adults. If one kid plays  store   and another one s playing  house   then the whole kind of play falls down. So they get used to quite quickly to understanding the rules for social interactions  and are actually quite quick to point out when they re broken. So when  as adults  we role play  then we have a huge set of these scripts already internalized. We ve gone through lots of experiences in life  and they provide a strong intuition as to whether an interaction is going to work. So we re very good  when acting out a solution  at spotting whether something lacks authenticity. So role play is actually  I think  quite valuable when it comes to thinking about experiences. Another way for us  as designers  to explore role play is to put ourselves through an experience which we re designing for  and project ourselves into an experience. So here are some designers who are trying to understand what it might feel like to sleep in a confined space on an airplane. And so they grabbed some very simple materials  you can see  and did this role play  this kind of very crude role play  just to get a sense of what it would be like for passengers if they were stuck in quite small places on airplanes. This is one of our designers  Kristian Simsarian  and he s putting himself through the experience of being an ER patient. Now  this is a real hospital  in a real emergency room. One of the reasons he chose to take this rather large video camera with him was because he didn t want the doctors and nurses thinking he was actually sick  and sticking something into him that he was going to regret later. So anyhow  he went there with his video camera  and it s kind of interesting to see what he brought back. Because when we looked at the video when he got back  we saw    minutes of this. And also  the amazing thing about this video    as soon as you see it you immediately project yourself into that experience. And you know what it feels like  all of that uncertainty while you re left out in the hallway while the docs are dealing with some more urgent case in one of the emergency rooms  wondering what the heck s going on. And so this notion of using role play    or in this case  living through the experience as a way of creating empathy    particularly when you use video  is really powerful. Or another one of our designers  Altay Sendil  he s here having his chest waxed  not because he s very vain  although actually he is    no  I m kidding    but in order to empathize with the pain that chronic care patients go through when they re having dressings removed. And so sometimes these analogous experiences  analogous role play  can also be quite valuable. So when a kid dresses up as a firefighter  you know  he s beginning to try on that identity. He wants to know what it feels like to be a firefighter. We re doing the same thing as designers. We re trying on these experiences. And so the idea of role play is both as an empathy tool  as well as a tool for prototyping experiences. And you know  we kind of admire people who do this at IDEO anyway. Not just because they lead to insights about the experience  but also because of their willingness to explore and their ability to unselfconsciously surrender themselves to the experience. In short  we admire their willingness to play. Playful exploration  playful building and role play  those are some of the ways that designers use play in their work. And so far  I admit  this might feel like it s a message just to go out and play like a kid. And to certain extent it is  but I want to stress a couple of points. The first thing to remember is that play is not anarchy. Play has rules  especially when it s group play. When kids play tea party  or they play cops and robbers  they re following a script that they ve agreed to. And it s this code negotiation that leads to productive play. So  remember the sketching task we did at the beginning  The kind of little face  the portrait you did  Well  imagine if you did the same task with friends while you were drinking in a pub. But everybody agreed to play a game where the worst sketch artist bought the next round of drinks. That framework of rules would have turned an embarrassing  difficult situation into a fun game. As a result  we d all feel perfectly secure and have a good time    but because we all understood the rules and we agreed on them together. But there aren t just rules about how to play  there are rules about when to play. Kids don t play all the time  obviously. They transition in and out of it  and good teachers spend a lot of time thinking about how to move kids through these experiences. As designers  we need to be able to transition in and out of play also. And if we re running design studios we need to be able to figure out  how can we transition designers through these different experiences  I think this is particularly true if we think about the sort of    I think what s very different about design is that we go through these two very distinctive modes of operation. We go through a sort of generative mode  where we re exploring many ideas  and then we come back together again  and come back looking for that solution  and developing that solution. I think they re two quite different modes  divergence and convergence. And I think it s probably in the divergent mode that we most need playfulness. Perhaps in convergent mode we need to be more serious. And so being able to move between those modes is really quite important. So  it s where there s a more nuanced version view of play  I think  is required. Because it s very easy to fall into the trap that these states are absolute. You re either playful or you re serious  and you can t be both. But that s not really true  you can be a serious professional adult and  at times  be playful. It s not an either or  it s an  and.  You can be serious and play. So to sum it up  we need trust to play  and we need trust to be creative. So  there s a connection. And there are a series of behaviors that we ve learnt as kids  and that turn out to be quite useful to us as designers. They include exploration  which is about going for quantity  building  and thinking with your hands  and role play  where acting it out helps us both to have more empathy for the situations in which we re designing  and to create services and experiences that are seamless and authentic. Thank you very much.  Applause  The fragrance that you will smell  you will never be able to smell this way again. It s a fragrance called Beyond Paradise  which you can find in any store in the nation. Except here it s been split up in parts by Est e Lauder and by the perfumer who did it  Calice Becker  and I'm most grateful to them for this. And it s been split up in successive bits and a chord. So what you re smelling now is the top note. And then will come what they call the heart  the lush heart note. I will show it to you. The Eden top note is named after the Eden Project in the U.K. The lush heart note  Melaleuca bark note    which does not contain any Melaleuca bark  because it s totally forbidden. And after that  the complete fragrance. Now what you are smelling is a combination of    I asked how many molecules there were in there  and nobody would tell me. So I put it through a G.C.  a Gas Chromatograph that I have in my office  and it s about    . So what you re smelling is several hundred molecules floating through the air  hitting your nose. And do not get the impression that this is very subjective. You are all smelling pretty much the same thing  OK  Smell has this reputation of being somewhat different for each person. It s not really true. And perfumery shows you that can t be true  because if it were like that it wouldn t be an art  OK  Now  while the smell wafts over you  let me tell you the history of an idea. Everything that you re smelling in here is made up of atoms that come from what I call the Upper East Side of the periodic table    a nice  safe neighborhood. You really don t want to leave it if you want to have a career in perfumery. Some people have tried in the     s to add things from the bad parts  and it didn t really work. These are the five atoms from which just about everything that you re going to smell in real life  from coffee to fragrance  are made of. The top note that you smelled at the very beginning  the cut grass green  what we call in perfumery    they re weird terms    and this would be called a green note  because it smells of something green  like cut grass. This is cis   hexene   ol. And I had to learn chemistry on the fly in the last three years. A very expensive high school chemistry education. This has six carbon atoms  so  hexa   hexene   ol. It has one double bond  it has an alcohol on the end  so it s  ol   and that s why they call it cis   hexene   ol. Once you figure this out  you can really impress people at parties. This smells of cut grass. Now  this is the skeleton of the molecule. If you dress it up with atoms  hydrogen atoms    that s what it looks like when you have it on your computer    but actually it s sort of more like this  in the sense that the atoms have a certain sphere that you cannot penetrate. They repel. OK  now. Why does this thing smell of cut grass  OK  Why doesn t it smell of potatoes or violets  Well  there are really two theories. But the first theory is  it must be the shape. And that s a perfectly reasonable theory in the sense that almost everything else in biology works by shape. Enzymes that chew things up  antibodies  it s all  you know  the fit between a protein and whatever it is grabbing  in this case a smell. And I will try and explain to you what s wrong with this notion. And the other theory is that we smell molecular vibrations. Now  this is a totally insane idea. And when I first came across it in the early '  s  I thought my predecessor  Malcolm Dyson and Bob Wright  had really taken leave of their senses  and I ll explain to you why this was the case. However  I came to realize gradually that they may be right    and I have to convince all my colleagues that this is so  but I m working on it. Here s how shape works in normal receptors. You have a molecule coming in  it gets into the protein  which is schematic here  and it causes this thing to switch  to turn  to move in some way by binding in certain parts. And the attraction  the forces  between the molecule and the protein cause the motion. This is a shape based idea. Now  what s wrong with shape is summarized in this slide. The way   I expect everybody to memorize these compounds. This is one page of work from a chemist s workbook  OK  Working for a fragrance company. He s making    molecules  and he s looking for a sandalwood  something that smells of sandalwood. Because there s a lot of money in sandalwoods. And of these    molecules  only      actually smells of sandalwood. And he puts an exclamation mark  OK  This is an awful lot of work. This actually is roughly  in man years of work          dollars roughly  if you keep them on the low salaries with no benefits. So this is a profoundly inefficient process. And my definition of a theory is  it s not just something that you teach people  it s labor saving. A theory is something that enables you to do less work. I love the idea of doing less work. So let me explain to you why    a very simple fact that tells you why this shape theory really does not work very well. This is cis   hexene   ol. It smells of cut grass. This is cis   hexene   thiol  and this smells of rotten eggs  OK  Now  you will have noticed that vodka never smells of rotten eggs. If it does  you put the glass down  you go to a different bar. This is    in other words  we never get the O H    we never mistake it for an S H  OK  Like  at no concentration  even pure  you know  if you smelt pure ethanol  it doesn t smell of rotten eggs. Conversely  there is no concentration at which the sulfur compound will smell like vodka. It s very hard to explain this by molecular recognition. Now  I showed this to a physicist friend of mine who has a profound distaste for biology  and he says   That s easy  The things are a different color   We have to go a little beyond that. Now let me explain why vibrational theory has some sort of interest in it. These molecules  as you saw in the beginning  the building blocks had springs connecting them to each other. In fact  molecules are able to vibrate at a set of frequencies which are very specific for each molecule and for the bonds connecting them. So this is the sound of the O H stretch  translated into the audible range. S H  quite a different frequency. Now  this is kind of interesting  because it tells you that you should be looking for a particular fact  which is this  nothing in the world smells like rotten eggs except S H  OK  Now  Fact B  nothing in the world has that frequency except S H. If you look on this  imagine a piano keyboard. The S H stretch is in the middle of a part of the keyboard that has been  so to speak  damaged  and there are no neighboring notes  nothing is close to it. You have a unique smell  a unique vibration. So I went searching when I started in this game to convince myself that there was any degree of plausibility to this whole crazy story. I went searching for a type of molecule  any molecule  that would have that vibration and that    the obvious prediction was that it should absolutely smell of sulfur. If it didn t  the whole idea was toast  and I might as well move on to other things. Now  after searching high and low for several months  I discovered that there was a type of molecule called a Borane which has exactly the same vibration. Now the good news is  Boranes you can get hold of. The bad news is they re rocket fuels. Most of them explode spontaneously in contact with air  and when you call up the companies  they only give you minimum ten tons  OK  So this was not what they call a laboratory scale experiment  and they wouldn t have liked it at my college. However  I managed to get a hold of a Borane eventually  and here is the beast. And it really does have the same    if you calculate  if you measure the vibrational frequencies  they are the same as S H. Now  does it smell of sulfur  Well  if you go back in the literature  there s a man who knew more about Boranes than anyone alive then or since  Alfred Stock  he synthesized all of them. And in an enormous    page paper in German he says  at one point    my wife is German and she translated it for me    and at one point he says   ganz widerlich Geruch   an  absolutely repulsive smell   which is good. Reminiscent of hydrogen sulfide. So this fact that Boranes smell of sulfur had been known since       and utterly forgotten until           . Now  the slight fly in the ointment is this  that if we smell molecular vibrations  we must have a spectroscope in our nose. Now  this is a spectroscope  OK  on my laboratory bench. And it s fair to say that if you look up somebody s nose  you re unlikely to see anything resembling this. And this is the main objection to the theory. OK  great  we smell vibrations. How  All right  Now when people ask this kind of question  they neglect something  which is that physicists are really clever  unlike biologists. This is a joke. I m a biologist  OK  So it s a joke against myself. Bob Jacklovich and John Lamb at Ford Motor Company  in the days when Ford Motor was spending vast amounts of money on fundamental research  discovered a way to build a spectroscope that was intrinsically nano scale. In other words  no mirrors  no lasers  no prisms  no nonsense  just a tiny device  and he built this device. And this device uses electron tunneling. Now  I could do the dance of electron tunneling  but I ve done a video instead  which is much more interesting. Here s how it works. Electrons are fuzzy creatures  and they can jump across gaps  but only at equal energy. If the energy differs  they can t jump. Unlike us  they won t fall off the cliff. OK. Now. If something absorbs the energy  the electron can travel. So here you have a system  you have something    and there s plenty of that stuff in biology    some substance giving an electron  and the electron tries to jump  and only when a molecule comes along that has the right vibration does the reaction happen  OK  This is the basis for the device that these two guys at Ford built. And every single part of this mechanism is actually plausible in biology. In other words  I ve taken off the shelf components  and I ve made a spectroscope. What s nice about this idea  if you have a philosophical bent of mind  is that then it tells you that the nose  the ear and the eye are all vibrational senses. Of course  it doesn t matter  because it could also be that they re not. But it has a certain       it has a certain ring to it which is attractive to people who read too much   th century German literature. And then a magnificent thing happened  I left academia and joined the real world of business  and a company was created around my ideas to make new molecules using my method  along the lines of  let s put someone else s money where your mouth is. And one of the first things that happened was we started going around to fragrance companies asking for what they needed  because  of course  if you could calculate smell  you don t need chemists. You need a computer  a Mac will do it  if you know how to program the thing right  OK  So you can try a thousand molecules  you can try ten thousand molecules in a weekend  and then you only tell the chemists to make the right one. And so that s a direct path to making new odorants. And one of the first things that happened was we went to see some perfumers in France    and here s where I do my Charles Fleischer impression    and one of them says   You cannot make a coumarin.  He says to me   I bet you cannot make a coumarin.  Now  coumarin is a very common thing  a material  in fragrance which is derived from a bean that comes from South America. And it is the classic synthetic aroma chemical  OK  It s the molecule that has made men s fragrances smell the way they do since       to be exact. And the problem is it s a carcinogen. So nobody likes particularly to    you know  aftershave with carcinogens. There are some reckless people  but it s not worth it  OK  So they asked us to make a new coumarin. And so we started doing calculations. And the first thing you do is you calculate the vibrational spectrum of coumarin  and you smooth it out  so that you have a nice picture of what the sort of chord  so to speak  of coumarin is. And then you start cranking the computer to find other molecules  related or unrelated  that have the same vibrations. And we actually  in this case  I m sorry to say  it happened    it was serendipitous. Because I got a phone call from our chief chemist and he said  look  I ve just found this such a beautiful reaction  that even if this compound doesn t smell of coumarin  I want to do it  it s just such a nifty  one step    I mean  chemists have weird minds    one step     percent yield  you know  and you get this lovely crystalline compound. Let us try it. And I said  first of all  let me do the calculation on that compound  bottom right  which is related to coumarin  but has an extra pentagon inserted into the molecule. Calculate the vibrations  the purple spectrum is that new fellow  the white one is the old one. And the prediction is it should smell of coumarin. They made it ... and it smelled exactly like coumarin. And this is our new baby  called tonkene. You see  when you re a scientist  you re always selling ideas. And people are very resistant to ideas  and rightly so. Why should new ideas be accepted  But when you put a little    gram vial on the table in front of perfumers and it smells like coumarin  and it isn t coumarin  and you ve found it in three weeks  this focuses everybody s mind wonderfully. And people often ask me  is your theory accepted  And I said  well  by whom  I mean most  you know    there s three attitudes  You re right  and I don t know why  which is the most rational one at this point. You re right  and I don t care how you do it  in a sense  you bring me the molecules  you know. And  You re completely wrong  and I m sure you re completely wrong. OK  Now  we re dealing with people who only want results  and this is the commercial world. And they tell us that even if we do it by astrology  they re happy. But we re not actually doing it by astrology. But for the last three years  I ve had what I consider to be the best job in the entire universe  which is to put my hobby    which is  you know  fragrance and all the magnificent things    plus a little bit of biophysics  a small amount of self taught chemistry at the service of something that actually works. Thank you very much. So  about three years ago I was in London  and somebody called Howard Burton came to me and said  I represent a group of people  and we want to start an institute in theoretical physics. We have about     million dollars  and we want to do it well. We want to be in the forefront fields  and we want to do it differently. We want to get out of this thing where the young people have all the ideas  and the old people have all the power and decide what science gets done. It took me about    seconds to decide that that was a good idea. Three years later  we have the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo  Ontario. It s the most exciting job I ve ever had. And it s the first time I ve had a job where I m afraid to go away because of everything that s going to happen in this week when I m here. But in any case  what I m going to do in my little bit of time is take you on a quick tour of some of the things that we talk about and we think about. So  we think a lot about what really makes science work  The first thing that anybody who knows science  and has been around science  is that the stuff you learn in school as a scientific method is wrong. There is no method. On the other hand  somehow we manage to reason together as a community  from incomplete evidence to conclusions that we all agree about. And this is  by the way  something that a democratic society also has to do. So how does it work  Well  my belief is that it works because scientists are a community bound together by an ethics. And here are some of the ethical principles. I m not going to read them all to you because I m not in teacher mode. I m in entertain  amaze mode. But one of the principles is that everybody who is part of the community gets to fight and argue as hard as they can for what they believe. But we re all disciplined by the understanding that the only people who are going to decide  you know  whether I m right or somebody else is right  are the people in our community in the next generation  in    and    years. So it s this combination of respect for the tradition and community we re in  and rebellion that the community requires to get anywhere  that makes science work. And being in this process of being in a community that reasons from shared evidence to conclusions  I believe  teaches us about democracy. Not only is there a relationship between the ethics of science and the ethics of being a citizen in democracy  but there has been  historically  a relationship between how people think about space and time  and what the cosmos is  and how people think about the society that they live in. And I want to talk about three stages in that evolution. The first science of cosmology that was anything like science was Aristotelian science  and that was hierarchical. The earth is in the center  then there are these crystal spheres  the sun  the moon  the planets and finally the celestial sphere  where the stars are. And everything in this universe has a place. And Aristotle s law of motion was that everything goes to its natural place  which was of course  the rule of the society that Aristotle lived in  and more importantly  the medieval society that  through Christianity  embraced Aristotle and blessed it. And the idea is that everything is defined. Where something is  is defined with respect to this last sphere  the celestial sphere  outside of which is this eternal  perfect realm  where lives God  who is the ultimate judge of everything. So that is both Aristotelian cosmology  and in a certain sense  medieval society. Now  in the   th century there was a revolution in thinking about space and time and motion and so forth of Newton. And at the same time there was a revolution in social thought of John Locke and his collaborators. And they were very closely associated. In fact  Newton and Locke were friends. Their way of thinking about space and time and motion on the one hand  and a society on the other hand  were closely related. And let me show you. In a Newtonian universe  there s no center    thank you. There are particles and they move around with respect to a fixed  absolute framework of space and time. It s meaningful to say absolutely where something is in space  because that s defined  not with respect to say  where other things are  but with respect to this absolute notion of space  which for Newton was God. Now  similarly  in Locke s society there are individuals who have certain rights  properties in a formal sense  and those are defined with respect to some absolute  abstract notions of rights and justice  and so forth  which are independent of what else has happened in the society. Of who else there is  of the history and so forth. There is also an omniscient observer who knows everything  who is God  who is in a certain sense outside the universe  because he has no role in anything that happens  but is in a certain sense everywhere  because space is just the way that God knows where everything is  according to Newton  OK  So this is the foundations of what s called  traditionally  liberal political theory and Newtonian physics. Now  in the   th century we had a revolution that was initiated at the beginning of the   th century  and which is still going on. It was begun with the invention of relativity theory and quantum theory. And merging them together to make the final quantum theory of space and time and gravity  is the culmination of that  something that s going on right now. And in this universe there s nothing fixed and absolute. Zilch  OK. This universe is described by being a network of relationships. Space is just one aspect  so there s no meaning to say absolutely where something is. There s only where it is relative to everything else that is. And this network of relations is ever evolving. So we call it a relational universe. All properties of things are about these kinds of relationships. And also  if you re embedded in such a network of relationships  your view of the world has to do with what information comes to you through the network of relations. And there s no place for an omniscient observer or an outside intelligence knowing everything and making everything. So this is general relativity  this is quantum theory. This is also  if you talk to legal scholars  the foundations of new ideas in legal thought. They re thinking about the same things. And not only that  they make the analogy to relativity theory and cosmology often. So there s an interesting discussion going on there. This last view of cosmology is called the relational view. So the main slogan here is that there s nothing outside the universe  which means that there s no place to put an explanation for something outside. So in such a relational universe  if you come upon something that s ordered and structured  like this device here  or that device there  or something beautiful  like all the living things  all of you guys in the room     guys  in physics  by the way  is a generic term  men and women. Then you want to know  you re a person  you want to know how is it made. And in a relational universe the only possible explanation was  somehow it made itself. There must be mechanisms of self organization inside the universe that make things. Because there s no place to put a maker outside  as there was in the Aristotelian and the Newtonian universe. So in a relational universe we must have processes of self organization. Now  Darwin taught us that there are processes of self organization that suffice to explain all of us and everything we see. So it works. But not only that  if you think about how natural selection works  then it turns out that natural selection would only make sense in such a relational universe. That is  natural selection works on properties  like fitness  which are about relationships of some species to some other species. Darwin wouldn t make sense in an Aristotelian universe  and wouldn t really make sense in a Newtonian universe. So a theory of biology based on natural selection requires a relational notion of what are the properties of biological systems. And if you push that all the way down  really  it makes the best sense in a relational universe where all properties are relational. Now  not only that  but Einstein taught us that gravity is the result of the world being relational. If it wasn t for gravity  there wouldn t be life  because gravity causes stars to form and live for a very long time  keeping pieces of the world  like the surface of the Earth  out of thermal equilibrium for billions of years so life can evolve. In the   th century  we saw the independent development of two big themes in science. In the biological sciences  they explored the implications of the notion that order and complexity and structure arise in a self organized way. That was the triumph of Neo Darwinism and so forth. And slowly  that idea is leaking out to the cognitive sciences  the human sciences  economics  et cetera. At the same time  we physicists have been busy trying to make sense of and build on and integrate the discoveries of quantum theory and relativity. And what we ve been working out is the implications  really  of the idea that the universe is made up of relations.   st century science is going to be driven by the integration of these two ideas  the triumph of relational ways of thinking about the world  on the one hand  and self organization or Darwinian ways of thinking about the world  on the other hand. And also  is that in the   st century our thinking about space and time and cosmology  and our thinking about society are both going to continue to evolve. And what they re evolving towards is the union of these two big ideas  Darwinism and relationalism. Now  if you think about democracy from this perspective  a new pluralistic notion of democracy would be one that recognizes that there are many different interests  many different agendas  many different individuals  many different points of view. Each one is incomplete  because you re embedded in a network of relationships. Any actor in a democracy is embedded in a network of relationships. And you understand some things better than other things  and because of that there s a continual jostling and give and take  which is politics. And politics is  in the ideal sense  the way in which we continually address our network of relations in order to achieve a better life and a better society. And I also think that science will never go away and    I m finishing on this line. In fact  I m finished. Science will never go away. I spent the better part of a decade looking at American responses to mass atrocity and genocide. And I'd like to start by sharing with you one moment that to me sums up what there is to know about American and democratic responses to mass atrocity. And that moment came on April         . So    years ago  almost  in the middle of the Rwandan genocide  in which         people would be systematically exterminated by the Rwandan government and some extremist militia. On April     in the New York Times  the paper reported that somewhere between         and         people had already been killed in the genocide. It was in the paper    not on the front page. It was a lot like the Holocaust coverage  it was buried in the paper. Rwanda itself was not seen as newsworthy  and amazingly  genocide itself was not seen as newsworthy. But on April     a wonderfully honest moment occurred. And that was that an American congresswoman named Patricia Schroeder from Colorado met with a group of journalists. And one of the journalists said to her  what's up  What's going on in the U.S. government  Two to         people have just been exterminated in the last couple of weeks in Rwanda. It's two weeks into the genocide at that time  but of course  at that time you don't know how long it's going to last. And the journalist said  why is there so little response out of Washington  Why no hearings  no denunciations  no people getting arrested in front of the Rwandan embassy or in front of the White House  What's the deal  And she said    she was so honest    she said   It's a great question. All I can tell you is that in my congressional office in Colorado and my office in Washington  we're getting hundreds and hundreds of calls about the endangered ape and gorilla population in Rwanda  but nobody is calling about the people. The phones just aren't ringing about the people.  And the reason I give you this moment is there's a deep truth in it. And that truth is  or was  in the   th century  that while we were beginning to develop endangered species movements  we didn't have an endangered people's movement. We had Holocaust education in the schools. Most of us were groomed not only on images of nuclear catastrophe  but also on images and knowledge of the Holocaust. There's a museum  of course  on the Mall in Washington  right next to Lincoln and Jefferson. I mean  we have owned Never Again culturally  appropriately  interestingly. And yet the politicization of Never Again  the operationalization of Never Again  had never occurred in the   th century. And that's what that moment with Patricia Schroeder I think shows  that if we are to bring about an end to the world's worst atrocities  we have to make it such. There has to be a role    there has to be the creation of political noise and political costs in response to massive crimes against humanity  and so forth. So that was the   th century. Now here    and this will be a relief to you at this point in the afternoon    there is good news  amazing news  in the   st century  and that is that  almost out of nowhere  there has come into being an anti genocide movement  an anti genocide constituency  and one that looks destined  in fact  to be permanent. It grew up in response to the atrocities in Darfur. It is comprised of students. There are something like     anti genocide chapters on college campuses around the country. It's bigger than the anti apartheid movement. There are something like     high school chapters devoted to stopping the genocide in Darfur. Evangelicals have joined it. Jewish groups have joined it.  Hotel Rwanda  watchers have joined it. It is a cacophonous movement. To call it a movement  as with all movements  perhaps  is a little misleading. It's diverse. It's got a lot of different approaches. It's got all the ups and the downs of movements. But it has been amazingly successful in one regard  in that it has become  it has congealed into this endangered people's movement that was missing in the   th century. It sees itself  such as it is  the it  as something that will create the impression that there will be political cost  there will be a political price to be paid  for allowing genocide  for not having an heroic imagination  for not being an upstander but for being  in fact  a bystander. Now because it's student driven  there's some amazing things that the movement has done. They have launched a divestment campaign that has now convinced  I think     universities in    states to divest their holdings of stocks with regard to companies doing business in Sudan. They have a       GENOCIDE number    this is going to sound very kitsch  but for those of you who may not be  I mean  may be apolitical  but interested in doing something about genocide  you dial       GENOCIDE and you type in your zip code  and you don't even have to know who your congressperson is. It will refer you directly to your congressperson  to your U.S. senator  to your governor where divestment legislation is pending. They've lowered the transaction costs of stopping genocide. I think the most innovative thing they've introduced recently are genocide grades. And it takes students to introduce genocide grades. So what you now have when a Congress is in session is members of Congress calling up these    year olds or    year olds and saying  I'm just told I have a D minus on genocide  what do I do to get a C  I just want to get a C. Help me. And the students and the others who are part of this incredibly energized base are there to answer that  and there's always something to do. Now  what this movement has done is it has extracted from the Bush administration from the United States  at a time of massive over stretch    military  financial  diplomatic    a whole series of commitments to Darfur that no other country in the world is making. For instance  the referral of the crimes in Darfur to the International Criminal Court  which the Bush administration doesn't like. The expenditure of   billion dollars in refugee camps to try to keep  basically  the people who've been displaced from their homes by the Sudanese government  by the so called Janjaweed  the militia  to keep those people alive until something more durable can be achieved. And recently  or now not that recently  about six months ago  the authorization of a peacekeeping force of        that will go. And that's all the Bush administration's leadership  and it's all because of this bottom up pressure and the fact that the phones haven't stopped ringing from the beginning of this crisis. The bad news  however  to this question of will evil prevail  is that evil lives on. The people in those camps are surrounded on all sides by so called Janjaweed  these men on horseback with spears and Kalashnikovs. Women who go to get firewood in order to heat the humanitarian aid in order to feed their families    humanitarian aid  the dirty secret of it is it has to be heated  really  to be edible    are themselves subjected to rape  which is a tool of the genocide that is being used. And the peacekeepers I've mentioned  the force has been authorized  but almost no country on Earth has stepped forward since the authorization to actually put its troops or its police in harm's way. So we have achieved an awful lot relative to the   th century  and yet far too little relative to the gravity of the crime that is unfolding as we sit here  as we speak. Why the limits to the movement  Why is what has been achieved  or what the movement has done  been necessary but not sufficient to the crime  I think there are a couple    there are many reasons    but a couple just to focus on briefly. The first is that the movement  such as it is  stops at America's borders.  It is not a global movement. It does not have too many compatriots abroad who themselves are asking their governments to do more to stop genocide. And the Holocaust culture that we have in this country makes Americans  sort of  more prone to  I think  want to bring Never Again to life. The guilt that the Clinton administration expressed  that Bill Clinton expressed over Rwanda  created a space in our society for a consensus that Rwanda was bad and wrong and we wish we had done more  and that is something that the movement has taken advantage of. European governments  for the most part  haven't acknowledged responsibility  and there's nothing to kind of to push back and up against. So this movement  if it's to be durable and global  will have to cross borders  and you will have to see other citizens in democracies  not simply resting on the assumption that their government would do something in the face of genocide  but actually making it such. Governments will never gravitate towards crimes of this magnitude naturally or eagerly. As we saw  they haven't even gravitated towards protecting our ports or reigning in loose nukes. Why would we expect in a bureaucracy that it would orient itself towards distant suffering  So one reason is it hasn't gone global. The second is  of course  that at this time in particular in America's history  we have a credibility problem  a legitimacy problem in international institutions. It is structurally really  really hard to do  as the Bush administration rightly does  which is to denounce genocide on a Monday and then describe water boarding on a Tuesday as a no brainer and then turn up on Wednesday and look for troop commitments. Now  other countries have their own reasons for not wanting to get involved. Let me be clear. They're in some ways using the Bush administration as an alibi. But it is essential for us to be a leader in this sphere  of course to restore our standing and our leadership in the world. The recovery's going to take some time. We have to ask ourselves  what now  What do we do going forward as a country and as citizens in relationship to the world's worst places  the world's worst suffering  killers  and the kinds of killers that could come home to roost sometime in the future  The place that I turned to answer that question was to a man that many of you may not have ever heard of  and that is a Brazilian named Sergio Vieira de Mello who  as Chris said  was blown up in Iraq in     . He was the victim of the first ever suicide bomb in Iraq. It's hard to remember  but there was actually a time in the summer of       even after the U.S. invasion  where  apart from looting  civilians were relatively safe in Iraq. Now  who was Sergio  Sergio Vieira de Mello was his name. In addition to being Brazilian  he was described to me before I met him in      as someone who was a cross between James Bond on the one hand and Bobby Kennedy on the other. And in the U.N.  you don't get that many people who actually manage to merge those qualities. He was James Bond like in that he was ingenious. He was drawn to the flames  he chased the flames  he was like a moth to the flames. Something of an adrenalin junkie. He was successful with women. He was Bobby Kennedy like because in some ways one could never tell if he was a realist masquerading as an idealist or an idealist masquerading as a realist  as people always wondered about Bobby Kennedy and John Kennedy in that way. What he was was a decathlete of nation building  of problem solving  of troubleshooting in the world's worst places and in the world's most broken places. In failing states  genocidal states  under governed states  precisely the kinds of places that threats to this country exist on the horizon  and precisely the kinds of places where most of the world's suffering tends to get concentrated. These are the places he was drawn to. He moved with the headlines. He was in the U.N. for    years. He joined at the age of   . Started off when the causes in the wars du jour in the '  s were wars of independence and decolonization. He was there in Bangladesh dealing with the outflow of millions of refugees    the largest refugee flow in history up to that point. He was in Sudan when the civil war broke out there. He was in Cyprus right after the Turkish invasion. He was in Mozambique for the War of Independence. He was in Lebanon. Amazingly  he was in Lebanon    the U.N. base was used    Palestinians staged attacks out from behind the U.N. base. Israel then invaded and overran the U.N. base. Sergio was in Beirut when the U.S. Embassy was hit by the first ever suicide attack against the United States. People date the beginning of this new era to       but surely       with the attack on the US Embassy and the Marine barracks    which Sergio witnessed    those are  in fact  in some ways  the dawning of the era that we find ourselves in today. From Lebanon he went to Bosnia in the '  s. The issues were  of course  ethnic sectarian violence. He was the first person to negotiate with the Khmer Rouge. Talk about evil prevailing. I mean  here he was in the room with the embodiment of evil in Cambodia. He negotiates with the Serbs. He actually crosses so far into this realm of talking to evil and trying to convince evil that it doesn't need to prevail that he earns the nickname    not Sergio but Serbio while he's living in the Balkans and conducting these kinds of negotiations. He then goes to Rwanda and to Congo in the aftermath of the genocide  and he's the guy who has to decide    huh  OK  the genocide is over          people have been killed  the people responsible are fleeing into neighboring countries    into Congo  into Tanzania. I'm Sergio  I'm a humanitarian  and I want to feed those    well  I don't want to feed the killers but I want to feed the two million people who are with them  so we're going to go  we're going to set up camps  and we're going to supply humanitarian aid. But  uh oh  the killers are within the camps. Well  I'd like to separate the sheep from the wolves. Let me go door to door to the international community and see if anybody will give me police or troops to do the separation. And their response  of course  was no more than we wanted to stop the genocide and put our troops in harm's way to do that  nor do we now want to get in the way and pluck genocidaires from camps. So then you have to make the decision. Do you turn off the international spigot of life support and risk two million civilian lives  Or do you continue feeding the civilians  knowing that the genocidaires are in the camps  literally sharpening their knives for future battle  What do you do  It's all lesser evil terrain in these broken places. Late '  s  nation building is the cause du jour. He's the guy put in charge. He's the Paul Bremer or the Jerry Bremer of first Kosovo and then East Timor. He governs the places. He's the viceroy. He has to decide on tax policy  on currency  on border patrol  on policing. He has to make all these judgments. He's a Brazilian in these places. He speaks seven languages. He's been up to that point in    war zones so he's positioned to make better judgments  perhaps  than people who have never done that kind of work. But nonetheless  he is the cutting edge of our experimentation with doing good with very few resources being brought to bear in  again  the world's worst places. And then after Timor       has happened  he's named U.N. Human Rights Commissioner  and he has to balance liberty and security and figure out  what do you do when the most powerful country in the United Nations is bowing out of the Geneva Conventions  bowing out of international law  Do you denounce  Well  if you denounce  you're probably never going to get back in the room. Maybe you stay reticent. Maybe you try to charm President Bush    and that's what he did. And in so doing he earned himself  unfortunately  his final and tragic appointment to Iraq    the one that resulted in his death. One note on his death  which is so devastating  is that despite predicating the war on Iraq on a link between Saddam Hussein and terrorism in       believe it or not  the Bush administration or the invaders did no planning  no pre war planning  to respond to terrorism. So Sergio    this receptacle of all of this learning on how to deal with evil and how to deal with brokenness  lay under the rubble for three and a half hours without rescue. Stateless. The guy who tried to help the stateless people his whole career. Like a refugee. Because he represents the U.N. If you represent everyone  in some ways you represent no one. You're un owned. And what the American    the most powerful military in the history of mankind was able to muster for his rescue  believe it or not  was literally these heroic two American soldiers went into the shaft. Building was shaking. One of them had been at      and lost his buddies on September   th  and yet went in and risked his life in order to save Sergio. But all they had was a woman's handbag    literally one of those basket handbags    and they tied it to a curtain rope from one of the offices at U.N. headquarters  and created a pulley system into this shaft in this quivering building in the interests of rescuing this person  the person we most need to turn to now  this shepherd  at a time when so many of us feel like we're lacking guidance. And this was the pulley system. This was what we were able to muster for Sergio. The good news  for what it's worth  is after Sergio and    others were killed that day in the attack on the U.N.  the military created a search and rescue unit that had the cutting equipment  the shoring wood  the cranes  the things that you would have needed to do the rescue. But it was too late for Sergio. I want to wrap up  but I want to close with what I take to be the four lessons from Sergio's life on this question of how do we prevent evil from prevailing  which is how I would have framed the question. Here's this guy who got a    year head start thinking about the kinds of questions we as a country are grappling with  we as citizens are grappling with now. What do we take away  First  I think  is his relationship to  in fact  evil is something to learn from. He  over the course of his career  changed a great deal. He had a lot of flaws  but he was very adaptive. I think that was his greatest quality. He started as somebody who would denounce harmdoers  he would charge up to people who were violating international law  and he would say  you're violating  this is the U.N. Charter. Don't you see it's unacceptable what you're doing  And they would laugh at him because he didn't have the power of states  the power of any military or police. He just had the rules  he had the norms  and he tried to use them. And in Lebanon  Southern Lebanon in '    he said to himself and to everybody else  I will never use the word  unacceptable  again. I will never use it. I will try to make it such  but I will never use that word again. But he lunged in the opposite direction. He started  as I mentioned  to get in the room with evil  to not denounce  and became almost obsequious when he won the nickname Serbio  for instance  and even when he negotiated with the Khmer Rouge would black box what had occurred prior to entering the room. But by the end of his life  I think he had struck a balance that we as a country can learn from. Be in the room  don't be afraid of talking to your adversaries  but don't bracket what happened before you entered the room. Don't black box history. Don't check your principles at the door. And I think that's something that we have to be in the room  whether it's Nixon going to China or Khrushchev and Kennedy or Reagan and Gorbachev. All the great progress in this country with relation to our adversaries has come by going into the room. And it doesn't have to be an act of weakness. You can actually do far more to build an international coalition against a harmdoer or a wrongdoer by being in the room and showing to the rest of the world that that person  that regime  is the problem and that you  the United States  are not the problem. Second take away from Sergio's life  briefly. What I take away  and this in some ways is the most important  he espoused and exhibited a reverence for dignity that was really  really unusual. At a micro level  the individuals around him were visible. He saw them. At a macro level  he thought  you know  we talk about democracy promotion  but we do it in a way sometimes that's an affront to people's dignity. We put people on humanitarian aid and we boast about it because we've spent three billion. It's incredibly important  those people would no longer be alive if the United States  for instance  hadn't spent that money in Darfur  but it's not a way to live. If we think about dignity in our conduct as citizens and as individuals with relation to the people around us  and as a country  if we could inject a regard for dignity into our dealings with other countries  it would be something of a revolution. Third point  very briefly. He talked a lot about freedom from fear. And I recognize there is so much to be afraid of. There are so many genuine threats in the world. But what Sergio was talking about is  let's calibrate our relationship to the threat. Let's not hype the threat  let's actually see it clearly. We have reason to be afraid of melting ice caps. We have reason to be afraid that we haven't secured loose nuclear material in the former Soviet Union. Let's focus on what are the legitimate challenges and threats  but not lunge into bad decisions because of a panic  of a fear. In times of fear  for instance  one of the things Sergio used to say is  fear is a bad advisor. We lunge towards the extremes when we aren't operating and trying to  again  calibrate our relationship to the world around us. Fourth and final point  he somehow  because he was working in all the world's worst places and all lesser evils  had a humility  of course  and an awareness of the complexity of the world around him. I mean  such an acute awareness of how hard it was. How Sisyphean this task was of mending  and yet aware of that complexity  humbled by it  he wasn't paralyzed by it. And we as citizens  as we go through this experience of the kind of  the crisis of confidence  crisis of competence  crisis of legitimacy  I think there's a temptation to pull back from the world and say  ah  Katrina  Iraq    we don't know what we're doing. We can't afford to pull back from the world. It's a question of how to be in the world. And the lesson  I think  of the anti genocide movement that I mentioned  that is a partial success but by no means has it achieved what it has set out to do    it'll be many decades  probably  before that happens    but is that if we want to see change  we have to become the change. We can't rely upon our institutions to do the work of necessarily talking to adversaries on their own without us creating a space for that to happen  for having respect for dignity  and for bringing that combination of humility and a sort of emboldened sense of responsibility to our dealings with the rest of the world. So will evil prevail  Is that the question  I think the short answer is  no  not unless we let it. Thank you. I thought I'd start with telling you or showing you the people who started  Jet Propulsion Lab . When they were a bunch of kids  they were kind of very imaginative  very adventurous  as they were trying at Caltech to mix chemicals and see which one blows up more. Well  I don't recommend that you try to do that now. Naturally  they blew up a shack  and Caltech  well  then  hey  you go to the Arroyo and really do all your tests in there. So  that's what we call our first five employees during the tea break  you know  in here. As I said  they were adventurous people. As a matter of fact  one of them  who was  kind of  part of a cult which was not too far from here on Orange Grove  and unfortunately he blew up himself because he kept mixing chemicals and trying to figure out which ones were the best chemicals. So  that gives you a kind of flavor of the kind of people we have there. We try to avoid blowing ourselves up. This one I thought I'd show you. Guess which one is a JPL employee in the heart of this crowd. I tried to come like him this morning  but as I walked out  then it was too cold  and I said  I'd better put my shirt back on. But more importantly  the reason I wanted to show this picture  look where the other people are looking  and look where he is looking. Wherever anybody else looks  look somewhere else  and go do something different  you know  and doing that. And that's kind of what has been the spirit of what we are doing. And I want to tell you a quote from Ralph Emerson that one of my colleagues  you know  put on my wall in my office  and it says   Do not go where the path may lead. Go instead where there is no path  and leave a trail.  And that's my recommendation to all of you  look what everybody is doing  what they are doing  go do something completely different. Don't try to improve a little bit on what somebody else is doing  because that doesn't get you very far. In our early days we used to work a lot on rockets  but we also used to have a lot of parties  you know. As you can see  one of our parties  you know  a few years ago. But then a big difference happened about    years ago  after Sputnik was launched. We launched the first American satellite  and that's the one you see on the left in there. And here we made     degrees change  we changed from a rocket house to be an exploration house. And that was done over a period of a couple of years  and now we are the leading organization  you know  exploring space on all of your behalf. But even when we did that  we had to remind ourselves  sometimes there are setbacks. So you see  on the bottom  that rocket was supposed to go upward  somehow it ended going sideways. So that's what we call the misguided missile. But then also  just to celebrate that  we started an event at JPL for  Miss Guided Missile.  So  we used to have a celebration every year and select    there used to be competition and parades and so on. It's not very appropriate to do it now. Some people tell me to do it  I think  well  that's not really proper  you know  these days. So  we do something a little bit more serious. And that's what you see in the last Rose Bowl  you know  when we entered one of the floats. That's more on the play side. And on the right side  that's the Rover just before we finished its testing to take it to the Cape to launch it. These are the Rovers up here that you have on Mars now. So that kind of tells you about  kind of  the fun things  you know  and the serious things that we try to do. But I said I'm going to show you a short clip of one of our employees to kind of give you an idea about some of the talent that we have. Video  Morgan Hendry  Beware of Safety is an instrumental rock band. It branches on more the experimental side. There's the improvisational side of jazz. There's the heavy hitting sound of rock. Being able to treat sound as an instrument  and be able to dig for more abstract sounds and things to play live  mixing electronics and acoustics. The music's half of me  but the other half    I landed probably the best gig of all. I work for the Jet Propulsion Lab. I'm building the next Mars Rover. Some of the most brilliant engineers I know are the ones who have that sort of artistic quality about them. You've got to do what you want to do. And anyone who tells you you can't  you don't listen to them. Maybe they're right   I doubt it. Tell them where to put it  and then just do what you want to do. I'm Morgan Hendry. I am NASA. Charles Elachi  Now  moving from the play stuff to the serious stuff  always people ask  why do we explore  Why are we doing all of these missions and why are we exploring them  Well  the way I think about it is fairly simple. Somehow     billion years ago there was a Big Bang  and you've heard a little bit about  you know  the origin of the universe. But somehow what strikes everybody's imagination    or lots of people's imagination    somehow from that original Big Bang we have this beautiful world that we live in today. You look outside  you have all that beauty that you see  all that life that you see around you  and here we have intelligent people like you and I who are having a conversation here. All that started from that Big Bang. So  the question is  How did that happen  How did that evolve  How did the universe form  How did the galaxies form  How did the planets form  Why is there a planet on which there is life which have evolved  Is that very common  Is there life on every planet that you can see around the stars  So we literally are all made out of stardust. We started from those stars  we are made of stardust. So  next time you are really depressed  look in the mirror and you can look and say  hi  I'm looking at a star here. You can skip the dust part. But literally  we are all made of stardust. So  what we are trying to do in our exploration is effectively write the book of how things have came about as they are today. And one of the first  or the easiest  places we can go and explore that is to go towards Mars. And the reason Mars takes particular attention  it's not very far from us. You know  it'll take us only six months to get there. Six to nine months at the right time of the year. It's a planet somewhat similar to Earth. It's a little bit smaller  but the land mass on Mars is about the same as the land mass on Earth  you know  if you don't take the oceans into account. It has polar caps. It has an atmosphere somewhat thinner than ours  so it has weather. So  it's very similar to some extent  and you can see some of the features on it  like the Grand Canyon on Mars  or what we call the Grand Canyon on Mars. It is like the Grand Canyon on Earth  except a hell of a lot larger. So it's about the size  you know  of the United States. It has volcanoes on it. And that's Mount Olympus on Mars  which is a kind of huge volcanic shield on that planet. And if you look at the height of it and you compare it to Mount Everest  you see  it'll give you an idea of how large that Mount Olympus  you know  is  relative to Mount Everest. So  it basically dwarfs  you know  Mount Everest here on Earth. So  that gives you an idea of the tectonic events or volcanic events which have happened on that planet. Recently from one of our satellites  this shows that it's Earth like    we caught a landslide occurring as it was happening. So it is a dynamic planet  and activity is going on as we speak today. And these Rovers  people wonder now  what are they doing today  so I thought I would show you a little bit what they are doing. This is one very large crater. Geologists love craters  because craters are like digging a big hole in the ground without really working at it  and you can see what's below the surface. So  this is called Victoria Crater  which is about a few football fields in size. And if you look at the top left  you see a little teeny dark dot. This picture was taken from an orbiting satellite. If I zoom on it  you can see  that's the Rover on the surface. So  that was taken from orbit  we had the camera zoom on the surface  and we actually saw the Rover on the surface. And we actually used the combination of the satellite images and the Rover to actually conduct science  because we can observe large areas and then you can get those Rovers to move around and basically go to a certain location. So  specifically what we are doing now is that Rover is going down in that crater. As I told you  geologists love craters. And the reason is  many of you went to the Grand Canyon  and you see in the wall of the Grand Canyon  you see these layers. And what these layers    that's what the surface used to be a million years ago     million years ago      million years ago  and you get deposits on top of them. So if you can read the layers it's like reading your book  and you can learn the history of what happened in the past in that location. So what you are seeing here are the layers on the wall of that crater  and the Rover is going down now  measuring  you know  the properties and analyzing the rocks as it's going down  you know  that canyon. Now  it's kind of a little bit of a challenge driving down a slope like this. If you were there you wouldn't do it yourself. But we really made sure we tested those Rovers before we got them down    or that Rover    and made sure that it's all working well. Now  when I came last time  shortly after the landing    I think it was  like  a hundred days after the landing    I told you I was surprised that those Rovers are lasting even a hundred days. Well  here we are four years later  and they're still working. Now you say  Charles  you are really lying to us  and so on  but that's not true. We really believed they were going to last    days or     days  because they are solar powered  and Mars is a dusty planet  so we expected the dust would start accumulating on the surface  and after a while we wouldn't have enough power  you know  to keep them warm. Well  I always say it's important that you are smart  but every once in a while it's good to be lucky. And that's what we found out. It turned out that every once in a while there are dust devils which come by on Mars  as you are seeing here  and when the dust devil comes over the Rover  it just cleans it up. It is like a brand new car that you have  and that's literally why they have lasted so long. And now we designed them reasonably well  but that's exactly why they are lasting that long and still providing all the science data. Now  the two Rovers  each one of them is  kind of  getting old. You know  one of them  one of the wheels is stuck  is not working  one of the front wheels  so what we are doing  we are driving it backwards. And the other one has arthritis of the shoulder joint  you know  it's not working very well  so it's walking like this  and we can move the arm  you know  that way. But still they are producing a lot of scientific data. Now  during that whole period  a number of people got excited  you know  outside the science community about these Rovers  so I thought I'd show you a video just to give you a reflection about how these Rovers are being viewed by people other than the science community. So let me go on the next short video. By the way  this video is pretty accurate of how the landing took place  you know  about four years ago. Video  Okay  we have parachute aligned. Okay  deploy the airbags. Open. Camera. We have a picture right now. Yeah  CE  That's about what happened in the Houston operation room. It's exactly like this. Video  Now  if there is life  the Dutch will find it. What is he doing  What is that  CE  Not too bad. So anyway  let me continue on showing you a little bit about the beauty of that planet. As I said earlier  it looked very much like Earth  so you see sand dunes. It looks like I could have told you these are pictures taken from the Sahara Desert or somewhere  and you'd have believed me  but these are pictures taken from Mars. But one area which is particularly intriguing for us is the northern region  you know  of Mars  close to the North Pole  because we see ice caps  and we see the ice caps shrinking and expanding  so it's very much like you have in northern Canada. And we wanted to find out    and we see all kinds of glacial features on it. So  we wanted to find out  actually  what is that ice made of  and could that have embedded in it some organic  you know  material. So we have a spacecraft which is heading towards Mars  called Phoenix  and that spacecraft will land    days  seven hours and    seconds from now  so you can adjust your watch. So it's on May    around just before five o'clock our time here on the West Coast  actually we will be landing on another planet. And as you can see  this is a picture of the spacecraft put on Mars  but I thought that just in case you're going to miss that show  you know  in    days  I'll show you  kind of  a little bit of what's going to happen. Video  That's what we call the seven minutes of terror. So the plan is to dig in the soil and take samples that we put them in an oven and actually heat them and look what gases will come from it. So this was launched about nine months ago. We'll be coming in at        miles per hour  and in seven minutes we have to stop and touch the surface very softly so we don't break that lander. Ben Cichy  Phoenix is the first Mars Scout mission. It's the first mission that's going to try to land near the North Pole of Mars  and it's the first mission that's actually going to try and reach out and touch water on the surface of another planet. Lynn Craig  Where there tends to be water  at least on Earth  there tends to be life  and so it's potentially a place where life could have existed on the planet in the past. Erik Bailey  The main purpose of EDL is to take a spacecraft that is traveling at        miles an hour and bring it to a screeching halt in a soft way in a very short amount of time. BC  We enter the Martian atmosphere. We're    miles above the surface of Mars. And our lander is safely tucked inside what we call an aeroshell. EB  Looks kind of like an ice cream cone  more or less. BC  And on the front of it is this heat shield  this saucer looking thing that has about a half inch of essentially what's cork on the front of it  which is our heat shield. Now  this is really special cork  and this cork is what's going to protect us from the violent atmospheric entry that we're about to experience. Rob Grover  Friction really starts to build up on the spacecraft  and we use the friction when it's flying through the atmosphere to our advantage to slow us down. BC  From this point  we're going to decelerate from        miles an hour down to     miles an hour. EB  The outside can get almost as hot as the surface of the Sun. RG  The temperature of the heat shield can reach       degrees Fahrenheit. EB  The inside doesn't get very hot. It probably gets about room temperature. Richard Kornfeld  There is this window of opportunity within which we can deploy the parachute. EB  If you fire the 'chute too early  the parachute itself could fail. The fabric and the stitching could just pull apart. And that would be bad. BC  In the first    seconds after we deploy the parachute  we'll decelerate from     miles an hour to a relatively slow     miles an hour. We no longer need the heat shield to protect us from the force of atmospheric entry  so we jettison the heat shield  exposing for the first time our lander to the atmosphere of Mars. LC  After the heat shield has been jettisoned and the legs are deployed  the next step is to have the radar system begin to detect how far Phoenix really is from the ground. BC  We've lost    percent of our entry velocity. So  we're    percent of the way to where we want to be. But that last one percent  as it always seems to be  is the tricky part. EB  Now the spacecraft actually has to decide when it's going to get rid of its parachute. BC  We separate from the lander going     miles an hour at roughly a kilometer above the surface of Mars        feet. That's like taking two Empire State Buildings and stacking them on top of one another. EB  That's when we separate from the back shell  and we're now in free fall. It's a very scary moment  a lot has to happen in a very short amount of time. LC  So it's in a free fall  but it's also trying to use all of its actuators to make sure that it's in the right position to land. EB  And then it has to light up its engines  right itself  and then slowly slow itself down and touch down on the ground safely. BC  Earth and Mars are so far apart that it takes over ten minutes for a signal from Mars to get to Earth. And EDL itself is all over in a matter of seven minutes. So by the time you even hear from the lander that EDL has started it'll already be over. EB  We have to build large amounts of autonomy into the spacecraft so that it can land itself safely. BC  EDL is this immense  technically challenging problem. It's about getting a spacecraft that's hurtling through deep space and using all this bag of tricks to somehow figure out how to get it down to the surface of Mars at zero miles an hour. It's this immensely exciting and challenging problem. CE  Hopefully it all will happen the way you saw it in here. So it will be a very tense moment  you know  as we are watching that spacecraft landing on another planet. So now let me talk about the next things that we are doing. So we are in the process  as we speak  of actually designing the next Rover that we are going to be sending to Mars. So I thought I would go a little bit and tell you  kind of  the steps we go through. It's very similar to what you do when you design your product. As you saw a little bit earlier  when we were doing the Phoenix one  we have to take into account the heat that we are going to be facing. So we have to study all kinds of different materials  the shape that we want to do. In general we don't try to please the customer here. What we want to do is to make sure we have an effective  you know  an efficient kind of machine. First we start by we want to have our employees to be as imaginative as they can. And we really love being close to the art center  because we have  as a matter of fact  one of the alumni from the art center  Eric Nyquist  had put a series of displays  far out displays  you know  in our what we call mission design or spacecraft design room  just to get people to think wildly about things. We have a bunch of Legos. So  as I said  this is a playground for adults  where they sit down and try to play with different shapes and different designs. Then we get a little bit more serious  so we have what we call our CAD CAMs and all the engineers who are involved  or scientists who are involved  who know about thermal properties  know about design  know about atmospheric interaction  parachutes  all of these things  which they work in a team effort and actually design a spacecraft in a computer to some extent  so to see  does that meet the requirement that we need. On the right  also  we have to take into account the environment of the planet where we are going. If you are going to Jupiter  you have a very high radiation  you know  environment. It's about the same radiation environment close by Jupiter as inside a nuclear reactor. So just imagine  you take your P.C. and throw it into a nuclear reactor and it still has to work. So these are kind of some of the little challenges  you know  that we have to face. If we are doing entry  we have to do tests of parachutes. You saw in the video a parachute breaking. That would be a bad day  you know  if that happened  so we have to test  because we are deploying this parachute at supersonic speeds. We are coming at extremely high speeds  and we are deploying them to slow us down. So we have to do all kinds of tests. To give you an idea of the size  you know  of that parachute relative to the people standing there. Next step  we go and actually build some kind of test models and actually test them  you know  in the lab at JPL  in what we call our Mars Yard. We kick them  we hit them  we drop them  just to make sure we understand how  where would they break. And then we back off  you know  from that point. And then we actually do the actual building and the flight. And this next Rover that we're flying is about the size of a car. That big shield that you see outside  that's a heat shield which is going to protect it. And that will be basically built over the next year  and it will be launched June a year from now. Now  in that case  because it was a very big Rover  we couldn't use airbags. And I know many of you  kind of  last time afterwards said well  that was a cool thing to have    those airbags. Unfortunately this Rover is  like  ten times the size of the  you know  mass wise  of the other Rover  or three times the mass. So we can't use airbags. So we have to come up with another ingenious idea of how do we land it. And we didn't want to take it propulsively all the way to the surface because we didn't want to contaminate the surface  we wanted the Rover to immediately land on its legs. So we came up with this ingenious idea  which is used here on Earth for helicopters. Actually  the lander will come down to about     feet and hover above that surface for     feet  and then we have a sky crane which will take that Rover and land it down on the surface. Hopefully it all will work  you know  it will work that way. And that Rover will be more kind of like a chemist. What we are going to be doing with that Rover as it drives around  it's going to go and analyze the chemical composition of rocks. So it will have an arm which will take samples  put them in an oven  crush and analyze them. But also  if there is something that we cannot reach because it is too high on a cliff  we have a little laser system which will actually zap the rock  evaporate some of it  and actually analyze what's coming from that rock. So it's a little bit like  Star Wars   you know  but it's real. It's real stuff. And also to help you  to help the community so you can do ads on that Rover  we are going to train that Rover to actually in addition to do this  to actually serve cocktails  you know  also on Mars. So that's kind of giving you an idea of the kind of  you know  fun things we are doing on Mars. I thought I'd go to  The Lord of the Rings  now and show you some of the things we have there. Now   The Lord of the Rings  has two things played through it. One  it's a very attractive planet    it just has the beauty of the rings and so on. But for scientists  also the rings have a special meaning  because we believe they represent  on a small scale  how the Solar System actually formed. Some of the scientists believe that the way the Solar System formed  that the Sun when it collapsed and actually created the Sun  a lot of the dust around it created rings and then the particles in those rings accumulated together  and they formed bigger rocks  and then that's how the planets  you know  were formed. So  the idea is  by watching Saturn we're actually watching our solar system in real time being formed on a smaller scale  so it's like a test bed for it. So  let me show you a little bit on what that Saturnian system looks like. First  I'm going to fly you over the rings. By the way  all of this is real stuff. This is not animation or anything like this. This is actually taken from the satellite that we have in orbit around Saturn  the Cassini. And you see the amount of detail that is in those rings  which are the particles. Some of them are agglomerating together to form larger particles. So that's why you have these gaps  is because a small satellite  you know  is being formed in that location. Now  you think that those rings are very large objects. Yes  they are very large in one dimension  in the other dimension they are paper thin. Very  very thin. What you are seeing here is the shadow of the ring on Saturn itself. And that's one of the satellites which was actually formed on that one. So  think about it as a paper thin  huge area of many hundreds of thousands of miles  which is rotating. And we have a wide variety of kind of satellites which will form  each one looking very different and very odd  and that keeps scientists busy for tens of years trying to explain this  and telling NASA we need more money so we can explain what these things look like  or why they formed that way. Well  there were two satellites which were particularly interesting. One of them is called Enceladus. It's a satellite which was all made of ice  and we measured it from orbit. Made of ice. But there was something bizarre about it. If you look at these stripes in here  what we call tiger stripes  when we flew over them  all of a sudden we saw an increase in the temperature  which said that those stripes are warmer than the rest of the planet. So as we flew by away from it  we looked back. And guess what  We saw geysers coming out. So this is a Yellowstone  you know  of Saturn. We are seeing geysers of ice which are coming out of that planet  which indicate that most likely there is an ocean  you know  below the surface. And somehow  through some dynamic effect  we're having these geysers which are being  you know  emitted from it. And the reason I showed the little arrow there  I think that should say    miles  we decided a few months ago to actually fly the spacecraft through the plume of that geyser so we can actually measure the material that it is made of. That was  unclear  also    you know  because we were worried about the risk of it  but it worked pretty well. We flew at the top of it  and we found that there is a fair amount of organic material which is being emitted in combination with the ice. And over the next few years  as we keep orbiting  you know  Saturn  we are planning to get closer and closer down to the surface and make more accurate measurements. Now  another satellite also attracted a lot of attention  and that's Titan. And the reason Titan is particularly interesting  it's a satellite bigger than our moon  and it has an atmosphere. And that atmosphere is very    as dense as our own atmosphere. So if you were on Titan  you would feel the same pressure that you feel in here. Except it's a lot colder  and that atmosphere is heavily made of methane. Now  methane gets people all excited  because it's organic material  so immediately people start thinking  could life have evolved in that location  when you have a lot of organic material. So people believe now that Titan is most likely what we call a pre biotic planet  because it's so cold organic material did not get to the stage of becoming biological material  and therefore life could have evolved on it. So it could be Earth  frozen three billion years ago before life actually started on it. So that's getting a lot of interest  and to show you some example of what we did in there  we actually dropped a probe  which was developed by our colleagues in Europe  we dropped a probe as we were orbiting Saturn. We dropped a probe in the atmosphere of Titan. And this is a picture of an area as we were coming down. Just looked like the coast of California for me. You see the rivers which are coming along the coast  and you see that white area which looks like Catalina Island  and that looks like an ocean. And then with an instrument we have on board  a radar instrument  we found there are lakes like the Great Lakes in here  so it looks very much like Earth. It looks like there are rivers on it  there are oceans or lakes  we know there are clouds. We think it's raining also on it. So it's very much like the cycle on Earth except because it's so cold  it could not be water  you know  because water would have frozen. What it turned out  that all that we are seeing  all this liquid   is made of  hydrocarbon and ethane and methane  similar to what you put in your car. So here we have a cycle of a planet which is like our Earth  but is all made of ethane and methane and organic material. So if you were on Mars    sorry  on Titan  you don't have to worry about four dollar gasoline. You just drive to the nearest lake  stick your hose in it  and you've got your car filled up. On the other hand  if you light a match the whole planet will blow up. So in closing  I said I want to close by a couple of pictures. And just to kind of put us in perspective  this is a picture of Saturn taken with a spacecraft from behind Saturn  looking towards the Sun. The Sun is behind Saturn  so we see what we call  forward scattering   so it highlights all the rings. And I'm going to zoom. There is a    I'm not sure you can see it very well  but on the top left  around    o'clock  there is a little teeny dot  and that's Earth. You barely can see ourselves. So what I did  I thought I'd zoom on it. So as you zoom in  you know  you can see Earth  you know  just in the middle here. So we zoomed all the way on the art center. So thank you very much. My name is Ursus Wehrli  and I would like to talk to you this morning about my project  Tidying Up Art. First of all    any questions so far  First of all  I have to say I'm not from around here. I'm from a completely different cultural area  maybe you noticed  I mean  I'm wearing a tie  first. And then secondly  I'm a little bit nervous because I'm speaking in a foreign language  and I want to apologize in advance  for any mistakes I might make. Because I'm from Switzerland  and I just don't hope you think this is Swiss German I'm speaking now here. This is just what it sounds like if we Swiss try to speak American. But don't worry    I don't have trouble with English  as such. I mean  it's not my problem  it's your language after all. I am fine. After this presentation here at TED  I can simply go back to Switzerland  and you have to go on talking like this all the time. So I've been asked by the organizers to read from my book. It's called  Tidying Up Art  and it's  as you can see  it's more or less a picture book. So the reading would be over very quickly. But since I'm here at TED  I decided to hold my talk here in a more modern way  in the spirit of TED here  and I managed to do some slides here for you. I'd like to show them around so we can just  you know    Actually  I managed to prepare for you some enlarged pictures    even better. So Tidying Up Art  I mean  I have to say  that's a relatively new term. You won't be familiar with it. I mean  it's a hobby of mine that I've been indulging in for the last few years  and it all started out with this picture of the American artist  Donald Baechler I had hanging at home. I had to look at it every day and after a while I just couldn't stand the mess anymore this guy was looking at all day long. Yeah  I kind of felt sorry for him. And it seemed to me even he felt really bad facing these unorganized red squares day after day. So I decided to give him a little support  and brought some order into neatly stacking the blocks on top of each other. Yeah. And I think he looks now less miserable. And it was great. With this experience  I started to look more closely at modern art. Then I realized how  you know  the world of modern art is particularly topsy turvy. And I can show here a very good example. It's actually a simple one  but it's a good one to start with. It's a picture by Paul Klee. And we can see here very clearly  it's a confusion of color. Yeah. The artist doesn't really seem to know where to put the different colors. The various pictures here of the various elements of the picture    the whole thing is unstructured. We don't know  maybe Mr. Klee was probably in a hurry  I mean       maybe he had to catch a plane  or something. We can see here he started out with orange  and then he already ran out of orange  and here we can see he decided to take a break for a square. And I would like to show you here my tidied up version of this picture. We can see now what was barely recognizable in the original     red and orange squares are juxtaposed with just two green squares. Yeah  that's great. So I mean  that's just tidying up for beginners. I would like to show you here a picture which is a bit more advanced. What can you say  What a mess. I mean  you see  everything seems to have been scattered aimlessly around the space. If my room back home had looked like this  my mother would have grounded me for three days. So I'd like to    I wanted to reintroduce some structure into that picture. And that's really advanced tidying up. Yeah  you're right. Sometimes people clap at this point  but that's actually more in Switzerland. We Swiss are famous for chocolate and cheese. Our trains run on time. We are only happy when things are in order. But to go on  here is a very good example to see. This is a picture by Joan Miro. And yeah  we can see the artist has drawn a few lines and shapes and dropped them any old way onto a yellow background. And yeah  it's the sort of thing you produce when you're doodling on the phone. And this is my       you can see now the whole thing takes up far less space. It's more economical and also more efficient. With this method Mr. Miro could have saved canvas for another picture. But I can see in your faces that you're still a little bit skeptical. So that you can just appreciate how serious I am about all this  I brought along the patents  the specifications for some of these works  because I've had my working methods patented at the Eidgen ssische Amt f r Geistiges Eigentum in Bern  Switzerland. I'll just quote from the specification.  Laut den Kunstpr fer Dr. Albrecht     It's not finished yet.  Laut den Kunstpr fer Dr. Albrecht G tz von Ohlenhusen wird die Verfahrensweise rechtlich gesch tzt welche die Kunst durch spezifisch aufger umte Regelm ssigkeiten des allgemeinen Formenschatzes neue Wirkungen zu erzielen m glich wird.  Ja  well I could have translated that  but you would have been none the wiser. I'm not sure myself what it means but it sounds good anyway. I just realized it's important how one introduces new ideas to people  that's why these patents are sometimes necessary. I would like to do a short test with you. Everyone is sitting in quite an orderly fashion here this morning. So I would like to ask you all to raise your right hand. Yeah. The right hand is the one we write with  apart from the left handers. And now  I'll count to three. I mean  it still looks very orderly to me. Now  I'll count to three  and on the count of three I'd like you all to shake hands with the person behind you. OK  One  two  three. You can see now  that's a good example  even behaving in an orderly  systematic way can sometimes lead to complete chaos. So we can also see that very clearly in this next painting. This is a painting by the artist  Niki de Saint Phalle. And I mean  in the original it's completely unclear to see what this tangle of colors and shapes is supposed to depict. But in the tidied up version  it's plain to see that it's a sunburnt woman playing volleyball. Yeah  it's a    this one here  that's much better. That's a picture by Keith Haring. I think it doesn't matter. So  I mean  this picture has not even got a proper title. It's called  Untitled  and I think that's appropriate. So  in the tidied up version we have a sort of Keith Haring spare parts shop. This is Keith Haring looked at statistically. One can see here quite clearly  you can see we have    pale green elements  of which one is in the form of a circle. Or here  for example  we have    pink squares with only one pink curve. I mean  that's interesting. One could extend this sort of statistical analysis to cover all Mr. Haring's various works  in order to establish in which period the artist favored pale green circles or pink squares. And the artist himself could also benefit from this sort of listing procedure by using it to estimate how many pots of paint he's likely to need in the future. One can obviously also make combinations. For example  with the Keith Haring circles and Kandinsky's dots. You can add them to all the squares of Paul Klee. In the end  one has a list with which one then can arrange. Then you categorize it  then you file it  put that file in a filing cabinet  put it in your office and you can make a living doing it. Yeah  from my own experience. So I'm    Actually  I mean  here we have some artists that are a bit more structured. It's not too bad. This is Jasper Johns. We can see here he was practicing with his ruler. But I think it could still benefit from more discipline. And I think the whole thing adds up much better if you do it like this. And here  that's one of my favorites. Tidying up Rene Magritte    this is really fun. You know  there is a    I'm always being asked what inspired me to embark on all this. It goes back to a time when I was very often staying in hotels. So once I had the opportunity to stay in a ritzy  five star hotel. And you know  there you had this little sign    I put this little sign outside the door every morning that read   Please tidy room.  I don't know if you have them over here. So actually  my room there hasn't been tidied once daily  but three times a day. So after a while I decided to have a little fun  and before leaving the room each day I'd scatter a few things around the space. Like books  clothes  toothbrush  etc. And it was great. By the time I returned everything had always been neatly returned to its place. But then one morning  I hang the same little sign onto that picture by Vincent van Gogh. And you have to say this room hadn't been tidied up since     . And when I returned it looked like this. Yeah  at least it is now possible to do some vacuuming. OK  I mean  I can see there are always people that like reacting that one or another picture hasn't been properly tidied up. So we can make a short test with you. This is a picture by Rene Magritte  and I'd like you all to inwardly    like in your head  that is    to tidy that up. So it's possible that some of you would make it like this. Yeah  I would actually prefer to do it more this way. Some people would make apple pie out of it. But it's a very good example to see that the whole work was more of a handicraft endeavor that involved the very time consuming job of cutting out the various elements and sticking them back in new arrangements. And it's not done  as many people imagine  with the computer  otherwise it would look like this. So now I've been able to tidy up pictures that I've wanted to tidy up for a long time. Here is a very good example. Take Jackson Pollock  for example. It's    oh  no  it's    that's a really hard one. But after a while  I just decided here to go all the way and put the paint back into the cans. Or you could go into three dimensional art. Here we have the fur cup by Meret Oppenheim. Here I just brought it back to its original state. But yeah  and it's great  you can even go  you know    Or we have this pointillist movement for those of you who are into art. The pointillist movement is that kind of paintings where everything is broken down into dots and pixels. And then I    this sort of thing is ideal for tidying up. So I once applied myself to the work of the inventor of that method  Georges Seurat  and I collected together all his dots. And now they're all in here. You can count them afterwards  if you like. You see  that's the wonderful thing about the tidy up art idea  it's new. So there is no existing tradition in it. There is no textbooks  I mean  not yet  anyway. I mean  it's  the future we will create.  But to round things up I would like to show you just one more. This is the village square by Pieter Bruegel. That's how it looks like when you send everyone home. Yeah  maybe you're asking yourselves where old Bruegel's people went  Of course  they're not gone. They're all here. I just piled them up. So I'm    yeah  actually I'm kind of finished at that moment. And for those who want to see more  I've got my book downstairs in the bookshop. And I'm happy to sign it for you with any name of any artist. But before leaving I would like to show you  I'm working right now on another    in a related field with my tidying up art method. I'm working in a related field. And I started to bring some order into some flags. Here    that's just my new proposal here for the Union Jack. And then maybe before I leave you ... yeah  I think  after you have seen that I have to leave anyway. Yeah  that was a hard one. I couldn't find a way to tidy that up properly  so I just decided to make it a little bit more simpler. Thank you very much. Welcome to        feet. Let me explain why we are here and why some of you have a pine cone close to you. Once upon a time  I did a book called  How Buildings Learn.  Today's event you might call  How Mountains Teach.  A little background  For    years I've been trying to figure out how to hack civilization so that we can get long term thinking to be automatic and common instead of difficult and rare    or in some cases  non existent. It would be helpful if humanity got into the habit of thinking of the now not just as next week or next quarter  but you know  next        years and the last        years    basically civilization's story so far. So we have the Long Now Foundation in San Francisco. It's an incubator for about a dozen projects  all having to do with continuity over the long term. Our core project is a rather ambitious folly    I suppose  a mythic undertaking  to build a        year clock that can really keep good time for that long a period. And the design problems of a project like that are just absolutely delicious. Go to the clock. And what we have here is something many of you saw here three years ago. It's the first working prototype of the clock. It's about nine feet high. Designed by Danny Hillis and Alexander Rose. It's presently in London  and is ticking away very deliberately at the science museum there. So the design problem for today is going to be  how do you house an eventual monumental clock like this so it can really tick  save time beautifully for     centuries  Well  this was the first solution. Alexander Rose came up with this idea of a spiraloid tower with continuous sloping ramps. And it looked like a way to go  until you start thinking about  what does deep time do to a building  Well  this is what deep time does to a building. This is the Parthenon. It's only       years old  and look what happened to it. Here's a beautiful project. They really knew it'd last forever  because they'd build it out of absolutely huge stones. And now it's a pathetic ruin and no one even knows what it was used for. That's what happens to buildings. They're vulnerable. Even the most durable and intactable buildings  like the pyramids of Giza  are in bad shape when you look up close. They've been looted inside and out. And they're built to protect things but they don't protect things. So we got to thinking  if you can't put things safely in a building  where can you safely put them  We thought  OK  underground. How about underground with a view  Underground in a place that's really solid. So the obvious answer was  we need a mountain. You don't want just any mountain. You need absolutely the right mountain if you're going to have a clock for        years. So here's an image of the long view of the search problem. And we got to thinking for various reasons it ought to be a desert mountain  so we got looking in the dry areas of the Southwest. We looked at mesas in New Mexico. We were looking at dead volcanoes in Arizona. Then Roger Kennedy  who was the director of the National Parks Service  led us to Eastern Nevada  to America's newest and oldest national park  which is called Great Basin National Park. It's right on the eastern border of Nevada. It's the highest range in the state    over        feet. And you'll notice that on the left  on the left  on the west  it's very steep  and on the right it's gentle. This place is remote. It's over     miles from any major city. It's nowhere near any Interstate or railroad. And it's    the only thing that goes by is what's called America's loneliest highway  U.S.   . Now  inside the yellow line here  on the right is    that's all national park. Inside the green line is national forest. And then over to the left is Bureau of Land Management land and some private land. Now  as it happened  that two mile long strip right in the middle  this vertical  was available because it was private land. And thanks to Jay Walker who was here and Mitch Kapor who was here  who started the process  Long Now was able to get that two mile long strip of land. And now let's look at the grand truth of what's there. We're in Pole Canyon  looking west up the western escarpment of Mount Washington  which is        feet on top. Those white cliffs are a dense Cambrian limestone. That's a       foot thick formation  and it might be a beautiful place to hide a clock. It would be a pilgrimage to get to it  it would be a serious hike to get up to where the clock is. So last June  the Long Now board  some staff and some donors and advisors  made a two week expedition to the mountain to explore it and investigate  one  if it's the right mountain  and two  if it's the right mountain  how it might actually work for us. Now Danny Hillis sort of framed the problem. He has a theory of how the overall clock experience should work. It's what he calls the seven stages of a mythic adventure. It starts with the image. The image is a picture you have in your mind of the goal at the end of the journey. In this case it might well be an image of the clock. Then there's the point of embarkation  that is  the point of transition from ordinary life to being a pilgrim on a quest. Then    this is a nice image of it  there's the labyrinth. The labyrinth is a concept  it's like a twilight zone  it's a place where it's difficult  where you get disoriented  maybe you get scared    but you have to go through it if you're going to get to some kind of deep reintegration. Then there should always be in sight the draw    a kind of a beacon that draws you on through the labyrinth to finish the process of getting there. Now Brian Eno  who's been in the thick of the Long Now process  spent two years making a C.D. called  January        and it's  Bell Studies for the Clock of the Long Now.  Based on    parts of it are based on an algorithm that Danny Hillis developed  so that a peal of    bells makes a different peal every day for        years. The Hillis algorithm.    factorial gives you that number. And in fact  pretty soon we'll hear the sound. January     . There it is. OK  back to Danny's list. Number five of the seven is the payoff. This is it. The climax. The goal. The main thing that you're trying to get to. And then Danny says a really great journey will have a secret payoff. Something you didn't expect that caps what you did expect. Then there's the return. You've got to have a gradual return to the ordinary world  so you have time to assimilate what you've learned. And then  how about a memento  Number seven. At the end of it there's something physical  a kind of reward that you take away. It might be a piece of a core drill of the mountain. Something that's just yours. How do you study a mountain for the kinds of things we're talking about  This is not a normal building project. What do you look for  What are the elements that will most affect your ideas and decisions  Start with borders. If you look on the left side of the cliffs here  that's national park. That's sacrosanct    you can't do anything with that. To the right of it is national forest. There's possibilities. The borders are important. Other elements were mines  weather  approaches and elevation. And especially trees. Look at those things up on top there. It turns out that Mount Washington is covered with bristlecone pines. They're the world's oldest living thing. People think they're just the size of shrubs  but that's not actually true. There are trees on that mountain that are       years old and still living. The wood is so solid it's like stone  and it lasts for a long time. So when you do tree ring studies of trunks that are on the mountain  some of them go back        years. The stone itself is absolutely beautiful  sculpted by millennia of very tough winters up there. We had tree ring analysts from the University of Arizona join us on the expedition. Now  if you guys have a pine cone handy  now's a good time to put it in your hand and feel it  especially on the end. That's interesting. You'll find out why it's called a bristlecone pine. A little sensory experience. Here's Danny Hillis in the midst of a bristlecone pine forest on Long Now land. I should say that the age of bristlecones was discovered  led by a theory. Edmund Schulman in the     s had been studying trees under great stress at Timberline  and came to the realization that he put in an article in Science magazine called   Longevity under Adversity in Conifers.  And then  based on that principle  he started looking around at the various trees at Timberline  and realized that the bristlecone pines    he found some in the White Mountains that were over       years old. Longevity under adversity is a pretty interesting design principle in its own right. OK  onto the mines. The first asking price for the property when we looked at it in      was one billion dollars for     acres and a couple of mines. Because the owner said   There's one billion dollars of beryllium in that mountain.  And we said   Wow  that's great. Listen  we'll counter. How about zero  And we're a non profit foundation  you can give us the property and take a hell of a tax deduction. All you have to do is prove to the government it's worth a billion dollars.  Well  a few years went by and there was some kind of back and forth  and by and by  thanks to Mitch and Jay  we were able to buy the whole property for         dollars. This is one of the mines. It doesn't have any beryllium in it. It's called the Pole Adit. And it does have tungsten  a little bit of tungsten  left over  that's the kind of mine it was. But it goes a mile and a half in a straight line  due east into the range  into very interesting territory    except that  as you'll see when we go inside in a minute  we were hoping for limestone but in there is just shale. And shale is not quite completely competent rock. Competent rock is rock that will hold itself up without any shoring. The shale would like some shoring  and so parts of it are caved in in there. That's Ben Roberts from    he's the bat specialist from the National Park. But there are many wonders back in there  like this weird fungus on some of the collapsed timbers. OK  here's another mine that's up on top of the property  and it dates back to     . That's what the property was originally built around    it was a set of mining claims. It was a very productive silver mine. In fact  it was the highest operating mine in Nevada  and it ran year round. You can imagine what it was like in the winter at        feet. You may recognize a couple of the miners there. There's Jeff Bezos on the right and Paul Saville on the left looking for galena  which is the lead silver thing. They didn't find any. They both kept their day jobs. Here's the last mine. It's called the Bonanza Adit. It's down in a canyon. And Alexander Rose on the left there worked with a bunch of people from the National Park to survey the whole mine. It's a mile deep. And they also found four species of bats in there. Now  almost all those mines  by the way  meet underneath the mountain. They don't quite  but it's something to think about. They don't quite meet. Let's go to weather. Mountains specialize in interesting weather. Way more interesting than Monterey even today. And so one Tuesday morning last June  there we were. Woke up in the morning    the mountain was covered with snow. That was a great time to go up and visit our weather station which again  thanks to Mitch Kapor  we're building up there. And it's a pretty interesting scene. This is  on the left there  the joyful lady is Pat Irwin  who's the regional head of the National Forest Service  and they gave us the temporary use permit to be there. We want a temporary use permit for the clock  eventually           year temporary use permit. The weather station's pretty interesting. Kurt Bollacker and Alexander Rose designed a radically wireless station. It runs on solar  and it sends a signal with that antenna and bounces it off of micrometeorite trails in the atmosphere to a place in Bozeman  Montana  where the data is taken down and then sent through landlines to San Francisco  where we put the data in real time up on our website. And there you see a week of weather at       feet on Mount Washington. Let's go to approaches. As it happens  there are no trails anywhere on Mount Washington  just a few old mining roads like this  so you have to bushwhack everywhere. But there's no bears  and there's no poison oak  and there's basically no people because this place has been empty for a long time. You can hike for days and not encounter anybody. Well  here's a potential approach. You need to come up the Lincoln Canyon. It's this beautiful world all of its own  surrounded by cliffs  and it's an easy hike to stroll up the canyon bottom  until you get to this barrier  and it actually presents a problem. So you can scratch Lincoln Canyon as an approach. Another possible approach is right up the western front of the mountain. You can see why we sometimes call it Long Mountain. And from where you're standing at       feet in the valley  it's an easy hike up to the mature pinyon and juniper forest through that knoll at the front at       feet. And you can carry right on up through meadows and steepening forest to the high base of the cliffs at        feet  where there's a bit of a problem. Now  Jeff Bezos advised us when he left at the end of the expedition   Make the clock inaccessible. The harder it is to get to  the more people will value it.  And check    those are     foot vertical walls there. So Alexander Rose wanted to explore this route  and he started over here on the left from his pickup truck at       feet and headed up the mountain. Now  as you gain elevation your IQ goes down    but your emotional affect goes up  which is great for having a mythic experience  whether you want to or not. In fact  Danny Hillis can estimate altitude by how much math he can't do in his head. Now  I happened to be on the radio with Alexander when he got to this point at the base of the cliffs  and he said  quote   There's a hidden notch. I think I can get up a ways.  Now  he's a rock climber  but you know  he's our executive director. I don't want him killed. I know he's going to love cliffs. I'm saying   Be careful  be careful  be careful.  Then he starts going up  and the next thing I hear is   I'm half way up. It's like climbing stairs. I'm going up    degrees. It's a secret passage. It's like something from Tolkien.  And I'm going   Careful  careful. Please be careful.  And then  of course  the next thing I hear is   I've made it to the top. You can see all of creation from up here.  And he dashed across the top of the mountains. In fact  there he is. That's Alexander Rose. First ascent of the western face to Mount Washington  and a solo ascent at that. This discovery changed everything about our sense of these cliffs and what to do with them. We realized that we had to name this thing that Alexander discovered. How about Zander's Crevice  No. So we finally decided on Alexander's Siq. Zander's Siq is named after    some of you have been to Petra  there's this wonderful slot canyon that leads into Petra called the Siq  and so this is the Siq. And it really is hidden. I can't find it in this image  and I'm not sure you can. Only when you get fresh snow can you see just along the rim there  and that brings it out. Now  Danny and I were up at this same area one day  and Danny looked over to the right and noticed something halfway up the cliffs  which is a kind of a porch or a cliff shelf with bristlecones on it  and supposed that people going up to the clock inside the mountain could come out onto that shelf and look down at the view. And the people toiling up the mountain could see them  these tiny little people up there  incredibly halfway up the cliff. How did they get there  Do I have to do that  And so that maybe becomes part of the draw and part of the labyrinth. You can get another angle on Danny's porch by going around to the south and looking north at the whole formation there. And you need to know that Danny's clock is to be kept accurate by a ray of sunshine  that perfect noon hitting it every sunny day  and the pulse of heat from that sets off a solar trigger which resets the clock to make it perfectly accurate. So even with the slowing of the rotation of the earth and so on  the clock will keep perfectly good time. So here we're looking from the south  look north. This is all Forest Service land. If you go up on top of those cliffs  that's some of the Long Now land in those trees. And if you go up there and look back  then you'll get a sense of what the view starts to be like from the top of the mountain. That's the long view. That's    miles to the horizon. And that's also timberline and those bristlecones really are shrubs. That's a different place to be. It's        feet and it's exquisite. Now  if you go over to the right from this image to looking at the edge of the cliffs  it's     foot  just about a yard to the left of Kurt Bollacker's foot  there is a     foot drop. He's ambling on over to Zander's Siq. That's what it looks like looking down it. We should probably put in a rail or something. Over on the eastern side it's gentle  as you can see. And that's not snow    that's what the white limestone looks like. You also see there a bighorn sheep. Their herd was reintroduced from Wyoming. And they're doing pretty well  but they've got a bit of trouble. This is Danny Hillis  and he's figuring out a design problem. he's trying to determine if where he is on a bit of Long Now land would appear from down in the valley to be the actual peak of the mountain. because the real peak is hidden around the corner. This is what in the infantry we used to call the military crest. And as it turned out the answer is  yes  that is from down below in the valley it does look like the peak  and that might be conjured with. We gradually realized we have three serious design domains to work on with this. One is the experience of the mountain. Another is the experience in the mountain. And the third is the experience from the mountain  which is really dominated by the view shed of the spring valley there behind Danny  and if you look off to the right  out there     miles across to the Schell Creek range. In the front  there are    ranches strung right along the base of the mountains using the water from the mountains. In fact  there are artesian wells where water springs right into the air. One of the ranches is called the Kirkeby Ranch  and I'll take you there for a minute. It's a very nice ranch. Alfalfa and cattle  run by Paul and Ronnie Brenham  and it's pretty idyllic. It's also hard work. And most of these ranches are having trouble keeping going. This is their view to the west of the Schell Creek range. And if you go out to that line of trees at the far end  you'll see what the valley used to look like. This is Rocky Mountain junipers that have been there for thousands of years. And a scheme emerged that Long Now is looking to see if it might be possible to buy up the whole valley  because those    ranches with their        acres dominate a     square mile valley with their grazing allotments and so on  and there's a possibility that you could get the whole thing for five million dollars and gradually restore it to its wild condition  and somewhere in the process turn it back over to the National Park  and it would double the size of Great Basin National Park. That would be swell. OK  let's take one more look at the mountain itself. The clock experience should be profound  but from the outside it should be invisible. Now  at the base of the high cliffs there's this natural cave. It's only about    feet deep  but what if it were deepened from inside  You excavated from somewhere  came up from inside and deepened it. And then you could have an entrance which was very rough and narrow as you first went in  that gradually becomes more refined and then actually quite exquisite. And this stone takes a perfect polish. You'd have a polished set of passages and chambers in there eventually leading to the        year clock. And it's not a mine. This would be a nuanced evocation of the basic structure of the mountain  and you would be appreciating it as much from inside as you do from outside. This is architecture not made by building  but by what you very carefully take away. So that's what the mountain taught us. Most of the amazingness of the clock we can borrow from the amazingness of the mountain. All we have to do is highlight its spectacular features and blend in with them. It's not a clock in a mountain    it's a mountain clock. Now  the Tewa Indians in the Southwest have a saying for what you need to do when you want to think long term about anything. They say   pin peya obe     welcome to the mountain. Thank you. I have  like  a thing about sleeping. I don't sleep that much  and I've come to this thing about  like  not sleeping much as being a great virtue  after years of kind of battling it as being a terrible detriment  or something. And now I really like sort of sitting up  you know. But for years I've been sitting up and I think that  like  my creativity is greatly motivated by this kind of insomnia. I lie awake. I think thoughts. I walk aimlessly. Sometimes I used to walk more at night. I walk during the day and I follow people who I think look interesting. And sometimes    actually  once it was on Page Six in the Post  that I was cruising this guy  like  sort of  whatever  but I was actually just following because he had these really great shoes on. And so I was following this guy. And I took a picture of his shoes  and we thanked each other and just went on our way. But I do that all the time. As a matter of fact  I think a lot of my design ideas come from mistakes and tricks of the eye. Because I feel like  you know  there are so many images out there  so many clothes out there. And the only ones that look interesting to me are the ones that look slightly mistaken  of course  or very  very surprising. And often  I'm driving in a taxi and I see a hole in a shirt  or something that looks very interesting or pretty or functional in some way that I'd never seen happen before. And so I'd make the car stop  and I'd get out of the car and walk  and see that in fact there wasn't a hole  but it was a trick of my eye  it was a shadow  you know. Or if there was a hole I'd think like  oh damn  there was actually someone thought of that thought already. Someone made that mistake already so I can't do it anymore. I don't know where inspiration comes from. It does not come for me from research. I don't get necessarily inspired by research. As a matter of fact  one of the most fun things I've ever  ever done in my whole life  was this Christmas season at the Guggenheim in New York. I read  Peter and the Wolf  with this beautiful band from Juilliard. And I did like  you know  the narrator  and I read it. And I saw this really smart critic who I love. This woman  Joan Acocella  who's a friend of mine  and she came backstage and she said  oh  you know  Isaac  did you know that  talking about Stalinism and talking about  you know  like the '  s in Russia. And I said  how do I know about Stalinism  I know about a wolf and a bird and  you know  he ate the bird  and then in the end you hear  you know  you hear the bird squeaking  or something  you know  So I don't really know that. I don't really    actually I do my own kind of research  you know. If I'm commissioned to do the costumes for an   th century opera  or something like that  I will do a lot of research  because it's interesting  not because it's what I'm supposed to do. I'm very  very  very inspired by movies. The color of movies and the way light makes the colors  light from behind the projection  or light from the projection  makes the colors look so impossible. And anyway  roll this little clip  I'll just show you. I sit up at night and I watch movies and I watch women in movies a lot. And I think about  you know  their roles  and about how you have to  like  watch what your daughters look at. Because I look at the way women are portrayed all the time. Whether they're kind of glorified in this way  or whether they're kind of  you know  ironically glorified  or whether they're  you know  sort of denigrated  or ironically denigrated. I go back to color all the time. Color is something that motivates me a lot. It's rarely color that I find in nature  although  you know  juxtaposed next to artificial color  natural color is so beautiful. So that's what I do. I study color a lot. But for the most part  I think  like  how can I ever make anything that is as beautiful as that image of Natalie Wood  How can I ever make anything as beautiful as Greta Garbo  I mean  that's just not possible  you know. And so that's what makes me lie awake at night  I guess  you know. I want to show you    I'm also like a big    I go to astrologers and tarot card readers often  and that's another thing that motivates me a lot. People say  oh  do that. An astrologer tells me to do something. So I do it. When I was about     an astrologer told me that I was going to meet the man of my dreams  and that his name was going to be Eric  right  So  you know  for years I would go to bars and  sort of  anyone I met whose name was Eric I was humping immediately  or something. And there were times when I was actually so desperate I would just  you know  walk into a room and just go like   Eric   And anybody who would turn around I would  sort of  make a beeline for. And I had this really interesting tarot reading a long time ago. The last card he pulled  which was representing my destiny was this guy on like a straw boater with a cane and you know  sort of spats and this  you know  a minstrel singer  right  I want to show you this clip because I do this kind of crazy thing where I do a cabaret act. So actually  check this out. Very embarrassing. The name of the show is based on this story that I have to tell you about my mother. It's sort of an excerpt from a quote of hers. I was dating this guy  right  And this has to do with being happy  I swear. I was dating this guy and it was going on for about a year  right. And we were getting serious  so we decided to invite them all to dinner  our parents. And we  you know  sort of introduced them to each other. My mother was  sort of  very sensitive to his mother  who it seemed was a little bit skeptical about the whole alternative lifestyle thing. You know  homosexuality  right  So my mother was a little offended. She turned to her and she said   Are you kidding  They have the greatest life together. They eat out  they see shows.  They eat out  they see shows. That's the name of the show  they eat out  they    that's on my tombstone when I die.  He ate out  he saw shows   right  So in editing these clips  I didn't have the audacity to edit a clip of me singing at Joe's Pub. So you'll have to  like  go check it out and come see me or something. Because it's mortifying  and yet it feels ... I don't know how to put this. I feel as little comfort as possible is a good thing  you know. And at least  you know  in my case  because if I just do one thing all the time  I don't know  I get very  very bored. I bore very easily. And you know  I don't say that I do everything well  I just say that I do a lot of things  that's all. And I kind of try not to look back  you know. Except  I guess  that's what staying up every night is about. Like  looking back and thinking  what a fool you made of yourself  you know. But I guess that's okay. Right  Because if you do many things you get to feel lousy about everything  and not just one  you know. You don't master feeling lousy about one thing. Yeah  exactly. I will show you this next thing  speaking of costumes for operas. I do work with different choreographers. I work with Twyla Tharp a lot  and I work with Mark Morris a lot  who is one of my best friends. And I designed three operas with him  and the most recent one   King Arthur.  I'd been very ingrained in the dance world since I was a teenager. I went to performing arts high school  where I was an actor. And many of my friends were ballet dancers. Again  I don't know where inspiration comes from. I don't know where it comes from. I started making puppets when I was a kid. Maybe that's where the whole inspiration thing started from  puppets  right. And then performing arts high school. There I was in high school  meeting dancers and acting. And somehow  from there  I got interested in design. I went to Parsons School of Design and then I began my career as a designer. I don't really think of myself as a designer  I don't really think of myself necessarily as a fashion designer. And frankly  I don't really know what to call myself. I think of myself as a ... I don't know what I think of myself as. It's just that. But I must say  this whole thing about being slightly bored all the time  that is what    I think that is a very important thing for a fashion designer. You always have to be slightly bored with everything. And if you're not  you have to pretend to be slightly bored with everything. But I am really a little bored with everything. I always say to my partner  Marisa Gardini  who books everything    she books everything and she makes everything happen. And she makes all the deals. And I always tell her that I find myself with a lot of time on the computer bridge program. Too much time on computer bridge  which is  you know  like that's so ... somehow  like  about ten years ago I thought that the most unboring place in the world would be like a T.V. studio  like for a day show. Some kind of day talk show. Because it's all of these things that I love all kind of in one place. And if you ever get bored you can look at another thing  and do another thing and talk about it  right  And so I had this T.V. show. And that was a very  very  very big part of my process. Actually  could you roll the clip  please  This is one of my favorite clips of Rosie. Hi there. Rosie O'Donnell  Hello  Ben. IM  Look how cute she looks with this  just a slick back. Man  Her grandmother says   Delish   IM  Ah  wow  delish. All right. So now where should I position myself  I want to stay out of the way. I don't want to be    okay. Here we go. Do you get nervous  Ashleigh  Ashleigh  Doing what  ROD  Cutting hair. A  Cutting hair  Never  never. I don't think there was ever a day where I cut hair I was nervous. IM  You look so cute already  by the way. ROD  You like it  All right. IM  Do you have a problem with looking cute  You want to look cute. ROD  Of course I want to look cute. IM  Just checking  because some people want to look  you know  aggressively ugly. ROD  No  not me  no. IM  You read about all these people who have a lot of money and they have kids and the kids always end up somehow  like  really messed up  you know what I mean  And there's got to be some way to do that  Rosie. Because just because if you're fabulously rich  and fabulously famous  does that mean you shouldn't have kids  because you know they're going to end up getting messed up  ROD  No  but it means that your priority has to be their well being first  I think. But you have to make the decision for yourself. My kids are seven  who the hell knows. They're going to be like    and in rehab. And they're going to be playing this clip   I'm such a good mother.  My God  this is the shortest I've ever had. IM  It looks good  yeah  A  I was going to ask you  has your hair ever been    ROD  No  It's all right    go crazy. IM  I feel like it needs to be a little closer down here. A  Oh no  we're just staging  ROD  We're just staging it. IM  Are you freaking out  You look so cute. ROD  No  I love it. It's the new me. IM  Oh  it's so fabulous  ROD  Flock of Rosie. Wooo  IM  So by the way. Of all the most unboring things in the world  right. I mean  like making someone who's already cute look terrible like that. That is not boring. That is nothing if it's not boring. Actually  I read this great quote the other day  which was   Style makes you feel great because it takes your mind off the fact that you're going to die.  Right  And then I realized  that was on my website  and then it said  like  you know  the quote was attributed to me and I thought  oh  I said something  you know  in an interview. I forgot that I said that. But it's really true. I want to show you this last clip because it's going to be my last goodbye. I'll tell you that I cook a lot also. I love to cook. And I often look at things as though they're food. Like I say  oh  you know  would you serve a rotten chicken  Then how could you serve  you know  a beat up old dress or something. How could you show a beat up old dress  I always relate things to kitchen ry. And so I think that's what it all boils down to. Everything boils down to that. So check this out. This is what I've been doing because I think it's the most fun thing in the world. It's  like  this website. It's got a lot of different things on it. It's a polymathematical website. We actually shoot segments like T.V. show segments. And it's kind of my favorite thing in the world. And it just began like in the beginning of February. So who knows  And again  I don't say it's good  I just think it's not boring  right  And here is the last bit. Chef  Do you  IM  Yeah  but I can never find buttermilk  ever. Chef  Oh. IM  You can't find buttermilk at Citarella  you can't find buttermilk. Chef  You can't  IM  It's always low fat buttermilk. Chef  No  but that's all it is. IM  Is that all it is  Chef  Oh  you don't know  Let me tell you something. Let me tell you something interesting. IM  You know what  Stop laughing. It's not funny. Just because I don't know that whole    that there's no such thing as whole buttermilk. Sorry  what  Chef  Well  here's the deal. Let me tell you the deal. In the old days when they used to make butter  you know how you make butter  IM  Churns  Chef  For cream  IM  Yeah  exactly. Chef  So you take heavy  high fat milk  which is cream  and you churn it until it separates into these curds and water. The liquid is actually that clear liquid. If you've ever overbeaten your whipped cream  it's actually buttermilk. And that's what it was in the early days. And that's what people used for baking and all sorts of things. Now  the buttermilk that you get is actually low fat or skim milk. IM  Excuse me  I didn't know. All right  Chef  The reason he thought that is because buttermilk is so wonderfully thick and delicious. IM  Yeah  it is  exactly. So who would think that it was low fat  Well  that's it. Thank you very much. Happy TED. It's so wonderful here. I love it. I love it. I love it. Thanks. Bye. I have a story  a story that I would like to share with you. And it's an African story. It is a story of hope  resilience and glamour. There was Hollywood. Then came Bollywood. Today we have Nollywood  the third largest film industry in the world. In      alone  almost       films were made in Nigeria. Now  try to imagine        films wrapped  distributed  every week in the streets of Lagos  Nigeria and West Africa. Some estimates put the value of this industry at     million dollars. It has created thousands  if not tens of thousands of jobs. And it's expanding. But keep in mind that this was a grassroots movement. This is something that happened without foreign investment  without government aid  and actually  it happened against all odds  in one of the most difficult moments in Nigerian economy. The industry is    years old. And so maybe you're thinking now  why  how  an Italian filmmaker based in Boston is so interested in this story  And so I think I have to tell you just a few words  a few things about my personal life  because I think there is a connection. My grandfather lived most of his life and is buried in Zambia. My father also lived most of his adult life in East Africa. And I was born in Zambia. Even though I left when I was only three years old  I really felt that Africa was this big part of my life. And it really was a place where I learned to walk. I think I uttered the first words  and my family bought their first home. So when we came back to Italy  and one of the things that I remember the most is my family having this hard time to share stories. It seemed that for our neighbors and friends  Africa was either this exotic place  this imaginary land that probably exists only in their imagination  or the place of horror  famine. And so we were always caught in this stereotype. And I remember really this desire to talk about Africa as a place where we lived and people live and go about their lives  and have dreams like we all have. So when I read in a newspaper in the business page the story of Nollywood  I really felt this is an incredible opportunity to tell a story that goes against all these preconceived notions. Here I can tell a story of Africans making movies like I do  and actually I felt this was an inspiration for me. I have the good fortune of being a filmmaker in residence at the Center of Digital Imaging Arts at Boston University. And we really look how digital technology is changing  and how young  independent filmmakers can make movies at a fraction of the cost. So when I proposed the story  I really had all the support to make this film. And not only had the support  I found two wonderful partners in crime in this adventure. Aimee Corrigan  a very talented and young photographer  and Robert Caputo  a friend and a mentor  who is a veteran of National Geographic  and told me   You know  Franco  in    years of covering Africa  I don't know if I have come across a story that is so full of hope and so fun.  So we went to Lagos in October     . And we went to Lagos to meet Bond Emeruwa  a wonderful  talented film director who is with us tonight. The plan was to give you a portrait of Nollywood  of this incredible film industry  following Bond in his quest to make an action movie that deals with the issue of corruption  called  Checkpoint.  Police corruption. And he had nine days to make it. We thought this was a good story. In the meantime  we had to cover Nollywood  and we talked to a lot of filmmakers. But I don't want to create too many expectations. I would like to show you six minutes. And these are six minutes they really prepared for the TED audience. There are several themes from the documentary  but they are re edited and made for you  OK  So I guess it's a world premier. Man  Action. Milverton Nwokedi  You cut a nice movie with just        dollars in Nigeria here. And you shoot in seven days. Peace Piberesima  We're doing films for the masses. We're not doing films for the elite and the people in their glass houses. They can afford to watch their  Robocop  and whatever. Mahmood Ali Balogun  I think filmmaking in Nigeria  for those who work in it  is a kind of subsistence filmmaking    what they do to make a living. It's not the fancy filmmaking where you say  oh  you want to put all the razzmatazz of Hollywood  and where you have big budgets. Here is that you make these films  it sells  you jump onto the location again to make another film  because if you don't make the next film  you're not going to feed. Bond Emeruwa  So while we're entertaining  we should be able to educate. I believe in the power of audiovisuals. I mean     percent of the population will watch Nollywood. I think it's the most viable vehicle right now to pass information across a dedicated cable. So if you're making a movie  no matter what your topic is  put in a message in there. Woman  You still have to report the incident. He needs proper medical attention. PP  I keep trying to explain to people  it's not about the quality at the moment    the quality is coming. I mean  there are those films that people are making for quality  but the first thing you have to remember about this society is that Africa still has people that live on one dollar a day  and these are the people that really watch these films. Sonny McDon W  Nollywood is a fantastic industry that has just been born in this part of the world. Because nobody believed that Nollywood can come out of Africa. Lancelot Imasen  But our films  they are stories that our people can relate to themselves. They are stories about our people  for our people. And consistently  they are glued to their screen whenever they see the story. Narrator  Suspense  fun and intrigue. It's the blockbuster comedy. You'll crack your ribs. Bernard Pinayon Agbaosi  We have been so deep into the foreign movies. It's all about the foreign movies. But we can do something too. We can do something  something that when the world sees it  they say  wow  this is Nigeria. Man  Just arrest yourself  sergeant. Don't embarrass yourself. Come on. Don't run away. Come back. Come back. SMW  You can now walk the street and see a role model. It s not just what you see in picture. You see the person live. You see how he talks. You see how he lives. He influences you really good  you know. It s not just what you see in the picture. It is not what you hear  you know  from the Western press. Man  See you. Bye. Action. Saint Obi  I was so fascinated  you know  with those cowboy movies. But then when I discovered the situation in my country  at that time there was so much corruption. For a young man to really make it out here  you got to think of some negative things and all that  or some kind of vices. And I didn't want that  you know. And I discovered that I could be successful in life as an actor  without doing crime  without cheating nobody  without telling no lies. Just me and God given talent. Man  Let's go. OK  it's time to kick some ass. Cover this. It's your own. Move it. Roboger Animadu  In big countries  when they do the movies  they have all these things in place. But here  we improvise these items  like the gunshots. Like they go  here  now  now  you see the gun there  but you won't see any guns shot  we use knock out. Kevin Books Ikeduba  What I'm scared of is just the explosion will come up in my face. Woman  That's why I use enough masking tape. The masking tape will hold it. Wat  wait. Just hold this for me. KBI  I'm just telling her to make sure she places it well so that it won't affect my face    the explosion  you know. But she's a professional. She knows what she s doing. I'm trying to protect my face too. This ain't going to be my last movie. You know  this is Nollywood  where the magic lives. RA  So now you're about to see how we do our own movies here  with or without any assistance from anybody. Man  Action. Cut. Franco Sacchi  So many things to say  so little time. So many themes in this story. I just can't tell you    there s one thing I want to tell you. I spent  you know  several weeks with all these actors  producers  and the problems they have to go through are unimaginable for  you know  a Westerner  a filmmaker who works in America or in Europe. But always with a smile  always with an enthusiasm  that is incredible. Werner Herzog  the German filmmaker said   I need to make movies like you need oxygen.  And I think they re breathing. The Nigerian filmmakers really  really  are doing what they like. And so it's a very  very important thing for them  and for their audiences. A woman told me   When I see a Nollywood film  I can relax  I really    I can breathe better.  There is also another very important thing that I hope will resonate with this audience. It s technology. I m very interested in it and I really think that the digital non linear editing has slashed  you know  the cost now is a fraction of what it used to be. Incredible cameras cost under       dollars. And this has unleashed tremendous energy. And guess what  We didn t have to tell to the Nigerian filmmakers. They understood it  they embraced the technology and they run with it  and they re successful. I hope that the Nollywood phenomenon will go both ways. I hope it will inspire other African nations to embrace the technology  look at the Nigerian model  make their films  create jobs  create a narrative for the population  something to identify  something positive  something that really is psychological relief and it's part of the culture. But I really think this is a phenomenon that can inspire us. I really think it goes both ways. Filmmakers  friends of mine  they look at Nollywood and they say   Wow  they are doing what we really want to do  and make a buck and live with this job.  So I really think it s a lesson that we're actually learning from them. And there's one thing  one small challenge that I have for you  and should make us reflect on the importance of storytelling. And I think this is really the theme of this session. Try to imagine a world where the only goal is food and a shelter  but no stories. No stories around the campfire. No legends  no fairytales. Nothing. No novels. Difficult  eh  It's meaningless. So this is what I really think. I think that the key to a healthy society is a thriving community of storytellers  and I think that the Nigerian filmmakers really have proved this. I would like you to hear their voices. Just a few moments. It s not an added sequence  just some voices from Nollywood. If you have an industry that puts a smile on people's face  that s Nollywood. SO  I believe very soon  we re not only going to have better movies  we'll have that original Nigerian movie. BE  It s still the same basic themes. Love  action. But we're telling it our own way  our own Nigerian way  African way. We have diverse cultures  diverse cultures  there are so many  that in the natal lifetimes  I don't see us exhausting the stories we have. FS  My job ends here  and the Nollywood filmmakers really have now to work. And I really hope that there will be many  many collaborations  where we teach each other things. And I really hope that this will happen. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Stop. I've got two questions. Franco  you described this as the world's third largest film industry. What does that translate to in terms of numbers of films  really  FS  Oh  yes. I think I mentioned briefly    it's close to       films. There is scientific data on this. CA        films a year  FS        films a year.      or    the censor board has censored       films alone. And we know that there are more. So it s safe to say that there are       films. So imagine    films per week. There are challenges. There are challenges. There is a glut of film  the quality has to be raised  they need to go to the next level  but I m optimistic. CA  And these aren t films that are primarily seen in cinemas  FS  Oh yes  of course. This is very important. Maybe  you know  for you to try to imagine this  these are films that are distributed directly in markets. They are bought in video shops. They can be rented for pennies. CA  On what format  FS  Oh  the format    thank you for the question. Yes  it's VCDs. It's a CD  it's a little bit more compressed image. They started with VHS. They actually didn't wait for  you know  the latest technology. They started in '    '  . So there are    million VCRs in Nigeria that play  you know  VHS and these VCDs. It's a CD basically. It's a compact disc. CA  So on the streets  are film casts ...   FS  You can be in a Lagos traffic jam and you can buy a movie or some bananas or some water. Yes. And I have to say  this really proves that storytelling  it's a commodity  it's a staple. There is no life without stories. CA  Franco  thank you so much. I thought I would think about changing your perspective on the world a bit  and showing you some of the designs that we have in nature. And so  I have my first slide to talk about the dawning of the universe and what I call the cosmic scene investigation  that is  looking at the relics of creation and inferring what happened at the beginning  and then following it up and trying to understand it. And so one of the questions that I asked you is  when you look around  what do you see  Well  you see this space that's created by designers and by the work of people  but what you actually see is a lot of material that was already here  being reshaped in a certain form. And so the question is  how did that material get here  How did it get into the form that it had before it got reshaped  and so forth  It's a question of what's the continuity  So one of the things I look at is  how did the universe begin and shape  What was the whole process in the creation and the evolution of the universe to getting to the point that we have these kinds of materials  So that's sort of the part  and let me move on then and show you the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. If you look at this picture  what you will see is a lot of dark with some light objects in it. And everything but    four of these light objects are stars  and you can see them there    little pluses. This is a star  this is a star  everything else is a galaxy  OK  So there's a couple of thousand galaxies you can see easily with your eye in here. And when I look out at particularly this galaxy  which looks a lot like ours  I wonder if there's an art design college conference going on  and intelligent beings there are thinking about  you know  what designs they might do  and there might be a few cosmologists trying to understand where the universe itself came from  and there might even be some in that galaxy looking at ours trying to figure out what's going on over here. But there's a lot of other galaxies  and some are nearby  and they're kind of the color of the Sun  and some are further away and they're a little bluer  and so forth. But one of the questions is    this should be  to you    how come there are so many galaxies  Because this represents a very clean fraction of the sky. This is only       galaxies. We think there's on the order    visible to the Hubble Space Telescope  if you had the time to scan it around    about     billion galaxies. Right  It's a very large number of galaxies. And that's roughly how many stars there are in our own galaxy. But when you look at some of these regions like this  you'll see more galaxies than stars  which is kind of a conundrum. So the question should come to your mind is  what kind of design  you know  what kind of creative process and what kind of design produced the world like that  And then I'm going to show you it's actually a lot more complicated. We're going to try and follow it up. We have a tool that actually helps us out in this study  and that's the fact that the universe is so incredibly big that it's a time machine  in a certain sense. We draw this set of nested spheres cut away so you see it. Put the Earth at the center of the nested spheres  just because that's where we're making observations. And the moon is only two seconds away  so if you take a picture of the moon using ordinary light  it's the moon two seconds ago  and who cares. Two seconds is like the present. The Sun is eight minutes ago. That's not such a big deal  right  unless there's solar flares coming then you want to get out the way. You'd like to have a little advance warning. But you get out to Jupiter and it's    minutes away. It's a problem. You hear about Mars  it's a problem communicating to Mars because it takes light long enough to go there. But if you look out to the nearest set of stars  to the nearest    or    stars  it's about    years. So if you take a picture of what's going on  it's    years ago. But you go and look to the center of the galaxy  it's thousands of years ago. If you look at Andromeda  which is the nearest big galaxy  and it's two million years ago. If you took a picture of the Earth two million years ago  there'd be no evidence of humans at all  because we don't think there were humans yet. I mean  it just gives you the scale. With the Hubble Space Telescope  we're looking at hundreds of millions of years to a billion years. But if we were capable to come up with an idea of how to look even further    there's some things even further  and that was what I did in a lot of my work  was to develop the techniques    we could look out back to even earlier epochs before there were stars and before there were galaxies  back to when the universe was hot and dense and very different. And so that's the sort of sequence  and so I have a more artistic impression of this. There's the galaxy in the middle  which is the Milky Way  and around that are the Hubble    you know  nearby kind of galaxies  and there's a sphere that marks the different times. And behind that are some more modern galaxies. You see the whole big picture  The beginning of time is funny    it's on the outside  right  And then there's a part of the universe we can't see because it's so dense and so hot  light can't escape. It's like you can't see to the center of the Sun  you have to use other techniques to know what's going on inside the Sun. But you can see the edge of the Sun  and the universe gets that way  and you can see that. And then you see this sort of model area around the outside  and that is the radiation coming from the Big Bang  which is actually incredibly uniform. The universe is almost a perfect sphere  but there are these very tiny variations which we show here in great exaggeration. And from them in the time sequence we're going to have to go from these tiny variations to these irregular galaxies and first stars to these more advanced galaxies  and eventually the solar system  and so forth. So it's a big design job  but we'll see about how things are going on. So the way these measurements were done  there's been a set of satellites  and this is where you get to see. So there was the COBE satellite  which was launched in       and we discovered these variations. And then in       the MAP satellite was launched    the WMAP    and it made somewhat better pictures. And later this year    this is the cool stealth version  the one that actually has some beautiful design features to it  and you should look    the Planck satellite will be launched  and it will make very high resolution maps. And that will be the sequence of understanding the very beginning of the universe. And what we saw was  we saw these variations  and then they told us the secrets  both about the structure of space time  and about the contents of the universe  and about how the universe started in its original motions. So we have this picture  which is quite a spectacular picture  and I'll come back to the beginning  where we're going to have some mysterious process that kicks the universe off at the beginning. And we go through a period of accelerating expansion  and the universe expands and cools until it gets to the point where it becomes transparent  then to the Dark Ages  and then the first stars turn on  and they evolve into galaxies  and then later they get to the more expansive galaxies. And somewhere around this period is when our solar system started forming. And it's maturing up to the present time. And there's some spectacular things. And this wastebasket part  that's to represent what the structure of space time itself is doing during this period. And so this is a pretty weird model  right  What kind of evidence do we have for that  So let me show you some of nature's patterns that are the result of this. I always think of space time as being the real substance of space  and the galaxies and the stars just like the foam on the ocean. It's a marker of where the interesting waves are and whatever went on. So here is the Sloan Digital Sky Survey showing the location of a million galaxies. So there's a dot on here for every galaxy. They go out and point a telescope at the sky  take a picture  identify what are stars and throw them away  look at the galaxies  estimate how far away they are  and plot them up. And just put radially they're going out that way. And you see these structures  this thing we call the Great Wall  but there are voids and those kinds of stuff  and they kind of fade out because the telescope isn't sensitive enough to do it. Now I'm going to show you this in  D. What happens is  you take pictures as the Earth rotates  you get a fan across the sky. There are some places you can't look because of our own galaxy  or because there are no telescopes available to do it. So the next picture shows you the three dimensional version of this rotating around. Do you see the fan like scans made across the sky  Remember  every spot on here is a galaxy  and you see the galaxies  you know  sort of in our neighborhood  and you sort of see the structure. And you see this thing we call the Great Wall  and you see the complicated structure  and you see these voids. There are places where there are no galaxies and there are places where there are thousands of galaxies clumped together  right. So there's an interesting pattern  but we don't have enough data here to actually see the pattern. We only have a million galaxies  right  So we're keeping  like  a million balls in the air but  what's going on  There's another survey which is very similar to this  called the Two degree Field of View Galaxy Redshift Survey. Now we're going to fly through it at warp a million. And every time there's a galaxy    at its location there's a galaxy    and if we know anything about the galaxy  which we do  because there's a redshift measurement and everything  you put in the type of galaxy and the color  so this is the real representation. And when you're in the middle of the galaxies it's hard to see the pattern  it's like being in the middle of life. It's hard to see the pattern in the middle of the audience  it's hard to see the pattern of this. So we're going to go out and swing around and look back at this. And you'll see  first  the structure of the survey  and then you'll start seeing the structure of the galaxies that we see out there. So again  you can see the extension of this Great Wall of galaxies showing up here. But you can see the voids  you can see the complicated structure  and you say  well  how did this happen  Suppose you're the cosmic designer. How are you going to put galaxies out there in a pattern like that  It's not just throwing them out at random. There's a more complicated process going on here. How are you going to end up doing that  And so now we're in for some serious play. That is  we have to seriously play God  not just change people's lives  but make the universe  right. So if that's your responsibility  how are you going to do that  What's the kind of technique  What's the kind of thing you're going to do  So I'm going to show you the results of a very large scale simulation of what we think the universe might be like  using  essentially  some of the play principles and some of the design principles that  you know  humans have labored so hard to pick up  but apparently nature knew how to do at the beginning. And that is  you start out with very simple ingredients and some simple rules  but you have to have enough ingredients to make it complicated. And then you put in some randomness  some fluctuations and some randomness  and realize a whole bunch of different representations. So what I'm going to do is show you the distribution of matter as a function of scales. We're going to zoom in  but this is a plot of what it is. And we had to add one more thing to make the universe come out right. It's called dark matter. That is matter that doesn't interact with light the typical way that ordinary matter does  the way the light's shining on me or on the stage. It's transparent to light  but in order for you to see it  we're going to make it white. OK  So the stuff that's in this picture that's white  that is the dark matter. It should be called invisible matter  but the dark matter we've made visible. And the stuff that is in the yellow color  that is the ordinary kind of matter that's turned into stars and galaxies. So I'll show you the next movie. So this    we're going to zoom in. Notice this pattern and pay attention to this pattern. We're going to zoom in and zoom in. And you'll see there are all these filaments and structures and voids. And when a number of filaments come together in a knot  that makes a supercluster of galaxies. This one we're zooming in on is somewhere between         and a million galaxies in that small region. So we live in the boonies. We don't live in the center of the solar system  we don't live in the center of the galaxy and our galaxy's not in the center of the cluster. So we're zooming in. This is a region which probably has more than          on the order of a million galaxies in that region. We're going to keep zooming in. OK. And so I forgot to tell you the scale. A parsec is  .   light years. So a gigaparsec is three billion light years    that's the scale. So it takes light three billion years to travel over that distance. Now we're into a distance sort of between here and here. That's the distance between us and Andromeda  right  These little specks that you're seeing in here  they're galaxies. Now we're going to zoom back out  and you can see this structure that  when we get very far out  looks very regular  but it's made up of a lot of irregular variations. So they're simple building blocks. There's a very simple fluid to begin with. It's got dark matter  it's got ordinary matter  it's got photons and it's got neutrinos  which don't play much role in the later part of the universe. And it's just a simple fluid and it  over time  develops into this complicated structure. And so you know when you first saw this picture  it didn't mean quite so much to you. Here you're looking across one percent of the volume of the visible universe and you're seeing billions of galaxies  right  and nodes  but you realize they're not even the main structure. There's a framework  which is the dark matter  the invisible matter  that's out there that's actually holding it all together. So let's fly through it  and you can see how much harder it is when you're in the middle of something to figure this out. So here's that same end result. You see a filament  you see the light is the invisible matter  and the yellow is the stars or the galaxies showing up. And we're going to fly around  and we'll fly around  and you'll see occasionally a couple of filaments intersect  and you get a large cluster of galaxies. And then we'll fly in to where the very large cluster is  and you can see what it looks like. And so from inside  it doesn't look very complicated  right  It's only when you look at it at a very large scale  and explore it and so forth  you realize it's a very intricate  complicated kind of a design  right  And it's grown up in some kind of way. So the question is  how hard would it be to assemble this  right  How big a contractor team would you need to put this universe together  right  That's the issue  right  And so here we are. You see how the filament    you see how several filaments are coming together  therefore making this supercluster of galaxies. And you have to understand  this is not how it would actually look if you    first  you can't travel this fast  everything would be distorted  but this is using simple rendering and graphic arts kind of stuff. This is how  if you took billions of years to go around  it might look to you  right  And if you could see invisible matter  too. And so the idea is  you know  how would you put together the universe in a very simple way  We're going to start and realize that the entire visible universe  everything we can see in every direction with the Hubble Space Telescope plus our other instruments  was once in a region that was smaller than an atom. It started with tiny quantum mechanical fluctuations  but expanding at a tremendous rate. And those fluctuations were stretched to astronomical sizes  and those fluctuations eventually are the things we see in the cosmic microwave background. And then we needed some way to turn those fluctuations into galaxies and clusters of galaxies and make these kinds of structures go on. So I'm going to show you a smaller simulation. This simulation was run on       processors for a month in order to make just this simple visible one. So I'm going to show you one that can be run on a desktop in two days in the next picture. So you start out with teeny fluctuations when the universe was at this point  now four times smaller  and so forth. And you start seeing these networks  this cosmic web of structure forming. And this is a simple one  because it doesn't have the ordinary matter and it just has the dark matter in it. And you see how the dark matter lumps up  and the ordinary matter just trails along behind. So there it is. At the beginning it's very uniform. The fluctuations are a part in        . There are a few peaks that are a part in         and then over billions of years  gravity just pulls in. This is light over density  pulls the material around in. That pulls in more material and pulls in more material. But the distances on the universe are so large and the time scales are so large that it takes a long time for this to form. And it keeps forming until the universe is roughly about half the size it is now  in terms of its expansion. And at that point  the universe mysteriously starts accelerating its expansion and cuts off the formation of larger scale structure. So we're just seeing as large a scale structure as we can see  and then only things that have started forming already are going to form  and then from then on it's going to go on. So we're able to do the simulation  but this is two days on a desktop. We need  you know     days on       processors to do the kind of simulation that I showed you before. So we have an idea of how to play seriously  creating the universe by starting with essentially less than an eyedrop full of material  and we create everything we can see in any direction  right  from almost nothing    that is  something extremely tiny  extremely small    and it is almost perfect  except it has these tiny fluctuations at a part in         level  which turn out to produce the interesting patterns and designs we see  that is  galaxies and stars and so forth. So we have a model  and we can calculate it  and we can use it to make designs of what we think the universe really looks like. And that design is sort of way beyond what our original imagination ever was. So this is what we started with    years ago  with the Cosmic Background Explorer    made the map on the upper right  which basically showed us that there were large scale fluctuations  and actually fluctuations on several scales. You can kind of see that. Since then we've had WMAP  which just gives us higher angular resolution. We see the same large scale structure  but we see additional small scale structure. And on the bottom right is if the satellite had flipped upside down and mapped the Earth  what kind of a map we would have got of the Earth. You can see  well  you can  kind of pick out all the major continents  but that's about it. But what we're hoping when we get to Planck  we'll have resolution about equivalent to the resolution you see of the Earth there  where you can really see the complicated pattern that exists on the Earth. And you can also tell  because of the sharp edges and the way things fit together  there are some non linear processes. Geology has these effects  which is moving the plates around and so forth. You can see that just from the map alone. We want to get to the point in our maps of the early universe we can see whether there are any non linear effects that are starting to move  to modify  and are giving us a hint about how space time itself was actually created at the beginning moments. So that's where we are today  and that's what I wanted to give you  a flavor of. Give you a different view about what the design and what everything else looks like. Thank you. What technology can we really apply to reducing global poverty  And what I found was quite surprising. We started looking at things like death rates in the   th century  and how they'd been improved  and very simple things turned out. You'd think maybe antibiotics made more difference than clean water  but it's actually the opposite. And so very simple things    off the shelf technologies that we could easily find on the then early Web    would clearly make a huge difference to that problem. But I also  in looking at more powerful technologies and nanotechnology and genetic engineering and other new emerging kind of digital technologies  became very concerned about the potential for abuse. If you think about it  in history  a long  long time ago we dealt with the problem of an individual abusing another individual. We came up with something    the Ten Commandments  Thou shalt not kill. That's a  kind of a one on one thing. We organized into cities. We had many people. And to keep the many from tyrannizing the one  we came up with concepts like individual liberty. And then  to have to deal with large groups  say  at the nation state level  and we had to have mutual non aggression  or through a series of conflicts  we eventually came to a rough international bargain to largely keep the peace. But now we have a new situation  really what people call an asymmetric situation  where technology is so powerful that it extends beyond a nation state. It's not the nation states that have potential access to mass destruction  but individuals. And this is a consequence of the fact that these new technologies tend to be digital. We saw genome sequences. You can download the gene sequences of pathogens off the Internet if you want to  and clearly someone recently    I saw in a science magazine    they said  well  the      flu is too dangerous to FedEx around. If people want to use it in their labs for working on research  just reconstruct it yourself  because  you know  it might break in FedEx. So that this is possible to do this is not deniable. So individuals in small groups super empowered by access to these kinds of self replicating technologies  whether it be biological or other  are clearly a danger in our world. And the danger is that they can cause roughly what's a pandemic. And we really don't have experience with pandemics  and we're also not very good as a society at acting to things we don't have direct and sort of gut level experience with. So it's not in our nature to pre act. And in this case  piling on more technology doesn't solve the problem  because it only super empowers people more. So the solution has to be  as people like Russell and Einstein and others imagine in a conversation that existed in a much stronger form  I think  early in the   th century  that the solution had to be not just the head but the heart. You know  public policy and moral progress. The bargain that gives us civilization is a bargain to not use power. We get our individual rights by society protecting us from others not doing everything they can do but largely doing only what is legal. And so to limit the danger of these new things  we have to limit  ultimately  the ability of individuals to have access  essentially  to pandemic power. We also have to have sensible defense  because no limitation is going to prevent a crazy person from doing something. And you know  and the troubling thing is that it's much easier to do something bad than to defend against all possible bad things  so the offensive uses really have an asymmetric advantage. So these are the kind of thoughts I was thinking in      and       and my friends told me I was getting really depressed  and they were really worried about me. And then I signed a book contract to write more gloomy thoughts about this and moved into a hotel room in New York with one room full of books on the Plague  and you know  nuclear bombs exploding in New York where I would be within the circle  and so on. And then I was there on September   th  and I stood in the streets with everyone. And it was quite an experience to be there. I got up the next morning and walked out of the city  and all the sanitation trucks were parked on Houston Street and ready to go down and start taking the rubble away. And I walked down the middle  up to the train station  and everything below   th Street was closed. It was quite a compelling experience  but not really  I suppose  a surprise to someone who'd had his room full of the books. It was always a surprise that it happened then and there  but it wasn't a surprise that it happened at all. And everyone then started writing about this. Thousands of people started writing about this. And I eventually abandoned the book  and then Chris called me to talk at the conference. I really don't talk about this anymore because  you know  there's enough frustrating and depressing things going on. But I agreed to come and say a few things about this. And I would say that we can't give up the rule of law to fight an asymmetric threat  which is what we seem to be doing because of the present  the people that are in power  because that's to give up the thing that makes civilization. And we can't fight the threat in the kind of stupid way we're doing  because a million dollar act causes a billion dollars of damage  causes a trillion dollar response which is largely ineffective and arguably  probably almost certainly  has made the problem worse. So we can't fight the thing with a million to one cost  one to a million cost benefit ratio. So after giving up on the book    and I had the great honor to be able to join Kleiner Perkins about a year ago  and to work through venture capital on the innovative side  and to try to find some innovations that could address what I saw as some of these big problems. Things where  you know  a factor of    difference can make a factor of       difference in the outcome. I've been amazed in the last year at the incredible quality and excitement of the innovations that have come across my desk. It's overwhelming at times. I'm very thankful for Google and Wikipedia so I can understand at least a little of what people are talking about who come through the doors. But I wanted to share with you three areas that I'm particularly excited about and that relate to the problems that I was talking about in the Wired article. The first is this whole area of education  and it really relates to what Nicholas was talking about with a      computer. And that is to say that there's a lot of legs left in Moore's Law. The most advanced transistors today are at    nanometers  and we've seen  and I've had the pleasure to invest in  companies that give me great confidence that we'll extend Moore's Law all the way down to roughly the    nanometer scale. Another factor of  say  six in dimensional reduction  which should give us about another factor of     in raw improvement in what the chips can do. And so  to put that in practical terms  if something costs about       dollars today  say  the best personal computer you can buy  that might be its cost  I think we can have that in      for    dollars. Okay  Now  just imagine what that      computer will be in      as a tool for education. I think the challenge for us is    I'm very certain that that will happen  the challenge is  will we develop the kind of educational tools and things with the net to let us take advantage of that device  I'd argue today that we have incredibly powerful computers  but we don't have very good software for them. And it's only in retrospect  after the better software comes along  and you take it and you run it on a ten year old machine  you say  God  the machine was that fast  I remember when they took the Apple Mac interface and they put it back on the Apple II. The Apple II was perfectly capable of running that kind of interface  we just didn't know how to do it at the time. So given that we know and should believe    because Moore's Law's been  like  a constant  I mean  it's just been very predictable progress over the last    years or whatever. We can know what the computers are going to be like in     . It's great that we have initiatives to say  let's go create the education and educate people in the world  because that's a great force for peace. And we can give everyone in the world a      computer or a     computer in the next    years. The second area that I'm focusing on is the environmental problem  because that's clearly going to put a lot of pressure on this world. We'll hear a lot more about that from Al Gore very shortly. The thing that we see as the kind of Moore's Law trend that's driving improvement in our ability to address the environmental problem is new materials. We have a challenge  because the urban population is growing in this century from two billion to six billion in a very short amount of time. People are moving to the cities. They all need clean water  they need energy  they need transportation  and we want them to develop in a green way. We're reasonably efficient in the industrial sectors. We've made improvements in energy and resource efficiency  but the consumer sector  especially in America  is very inefficient. But these new materials bring such incredible innovations that there's a strong basis for hope that these things will be so profitable that they can be brought to the market. And I want to give you a specific example of a new material that was discovered    years ago. If we take carbon nanotubes  you know  Iijima discovered them in       they just have incredible properties. And these are the kinds of things we're going to discover as we start to engineer at the nano scale. Their strength  they're almost the strongest material  tensile strength material known. They're very  very stiff. They stretch very  very little. In two dimensions  if you make  like  a fabric out of them  they're    times stronger than Kevlar. And if you make a three dimensional structure  like a buckyball  they have all sorts of incredible properties. If you shoot a particle at them and knock a hole in them  they repair themselves  they go zip and they repair the hole in femtoseconds  which is not    is really quick. If you shine a light on them  they produce electricity. In fact  if you flash them with a camera they catch on fire. If you put electricity on them  they emit light. If you run current through them  you can run       times more current through one of these than through a piece of metal. You can make both p  and n type semiconductors  which means you can make transistors out of them. They conduct heat along their length but not across    well  there is no width  but not in the other direction if you stack them up  that's a property of carbon fiber also. If you put particles in them  and they go shooting out the tip    they're like miniature linear accelerators or electron guns. The inside of the nanotubes is so small    the smallest ones are  .  nanometers    that it's basically a quantum world. It's a strange place inside a nanotube. And so we begin to see  and we've seen business plans already  where the kind of things Lisa Randall's talking about are in there. I had one business plan where I was trying to learn more about Witten's cosmic dimension strings to try to understand what the phenomenon was going on in this proposed nanomaterial. So inside of a nanotube  we're really at the limit here. So what we see is with these and other new materials that we can do things with different properties    lighter  stronger    and apply these new materials to the environmental problems. New materials that can make water  new materials that can make fuel cells work better  new materials that catalyze chemical reactions  that cut pollution and so on. Ethanol    new ways of making ethanol. New ways of making electric transportation. The whole green dream    because it can be profitable. And we've dedicated    we've just raised a new fund  we dedicated     million dollars to these kinds of investments. We believe that Genentech  the Compaq  the Lotus  the Sun  the Netscape  the Amazon  the Google in these fields are yet to be found  because this materials revolution will drive these things forward. The third area that we're working on  and we just announced last week    we were all in New York. We raised     million dollars in a specialty fund to work on a pandemic in biodefense. And to give you an idea of the last fund that Kleiner raised was a      million fund  so this for us is a very substantial fund. And what we did  over the last few months    well  a few months ago  Ray Kurzweil and I wrote an op ed in the New York Times about how publishing the      genome was very dangerous. And John Doerr and Brook and others got concerned   unclear   and we started looking around at what the world was doing about being prepared for a pandemic. And we saw a lot of gaps. And so we asked ourselves  you know  can we find innovative things that will go fill these gaps  And Brooks told me in a break here  he said he's found so much stuff he can't sleep  because there's so many great technologies out there  we're essentially buried. And we need them  you know. We have one antiviral that people are talking about stockpiling that still works  roughly. That's Tamiflu. But Tamiflu    the virus is resistant. It is resistant to Tamiflu. We've discovered with AIDS we need cocktails to work well so that the viral resistance    we need several anti virals. We need better surveillance. We need networks that can find out what's going on. We need rapid diagnostics so that we can tell if somebody has a strain of flu which we have only identified very recently. We've got to be able to make the rapid diagnostics quickly. We need new anti virals and cocktails. We need new kinds of vaccines. Vaccines that are broad spectrum. Vaccines that we can manufacture quickly. Cocktails  more polyvalent vaccines. You normally get a trivalent vaccine against three possible strains. We need    we don't know where this thing is going. We believe that if we could fill these    gaps  we have a chance to help really reduce the risk of a pandemic. And the difference between a normal flu season and a pandemic is about a factor of       in deaths and certainly enormous economic impact. So we're very excited because we think we can fund     or speed up    projects and see them come to market in the next couple years that will address this. So if we can address  use technology  help address education  help address the environment  help address the pandemic  does that solve the larger problem that I was talking about in the Wired article  And I'm afraid the answer is really no  because you can't solve a problem with the management of technology with more technology. If we let an unlimited amount of power loose  then we will    a very small number of people will be able to abuse it. We can't fight at a million to one disadvantage. So what we need to do is  we need better policy. And for example  some things we could do that would be policy solutions which are not really in the political air right now but perhaps with the change of administration would be    use markets. Markets are a very strong force. For example  rather than trying to regulate away problems  which probably won't work  if we could price into the cost of doing business  the cost of catastrophe  so that people who are doing things that had a higher cost of catastrophe would have to take insurance against that risk. So if you wanted to put a drug on the market you could put it on. But it wouldn't have to be approved by regulators  you'd have to convince an actuary that it would be safe. And if you apply the notion of insurance more broadly  you can use a more powerful force  a market force  to provide feedback. How could you keep the law  I think the law would be a really good thing to keep. Well  you have to hold people accountable. The law requires accountability. Today scientists  technologists  businessmen  engineers don't have any personal responsibility for the consequences of their actions. So if you tie that    you have to tie that back with the law. And finally  I think we have to do something that's not really    it's almost unacceptable to say this    which  we have to begin to design the future. We can't pick the future  but we can steer the future. Our investment in trying to prevent pandemic flu is affecting the distribution of possible outcomes. We may not be able to stop it  but the likelihood that it will get past us is lower if we focus on that problem. So we can design the future if we choose what kind of things we want to have happen and not have happen  and steer us to a lower risk place. Vice President Gore will talk about how we could steer the climate trajectory into a lower probability of catastrophic risk. But above all  what we have to do is we have to help the good guys  the people on the defensive side  have an advantage over the people who want to abuse things. And what we have to do to do that is we have to limit access to certain information. And growing up as we have  and holding very high the value of free speech  this is a hard thing for us to accept    for all of us to accept. It's especially hard for the scientists to accept who still remember  you know  Galileo essentially locked up  and who are still fighting this battle against the church. But that's the price of having a civilization. The price of retaining the rule of law is to limit the access to the great and kind of unbridled power. Thank you. I went to Spain a few months ago and I had the best foie gras of my life. The best culinary experience of my life. Because what I saw  I'm convinced  is the future of cooking. Ridiculous  right  Foie gras and the future of cooking. There's not a food today that's more maligned than foie gras  right  I mean  it's crucified. It was outlawed in Chicago for a while. It's pending here in California  and just recently in New York. It's like if you're a chef and you put it on your menu  you risk being attacked. Really  it happened here in San Francisco to a famous chef. I'm not saying that there's not a rationale for being opposed to foie gras. The reasons usually just boil down to the gavage  which is the force feeding. Basically you take a goose or a duck and you force feed a ton of grain down its throat. More grain in a couple of weeks than it would ever get in a lifetime. Its liver expands by eight times. Suffice to say it's like    it's not the prettiest picture of sustainable farming. The problem for us chefs is that it's so freakin' delicious. I mean  I love the stuff. It is fatty  it's sweet  it's silky  it's unctuous. It makes everything else you put it with taste incredible. Can we produce a menu that's delicious without foie gras  Yes  sure. You can also bike the Tour de France without steroids  right  Not a lot of people are doing it. And for good reason. So several months ago  a friend of mine sent me this link to this guy  Eduardo Sousa. Eduardo is doing what he calls natural foie gras. Natural foie gras. What's natural about foie gras  To take advantage of when the temperature drops in the fall  geese and ducks gorge on food to prepare for the harsh realities of winter. And the rest of the year they're free to roam around Eduardo's land and eat what they want. So no gavage  no force feeding  no factory like conditions  no cruelty. And it's shockingly not a new idea. His great granddad started    Pater a de Sousa    in     . And they've been doing it quietly ever since. That is until last year  when Eduardo won the Coup de Coeur  the coveted French gastronomic prize. It's like the Olympics of food products. He placed first for his foie gras. Big  big problem. As he said to me  that really pissed the French off. He said it sort of gleefully. It was all over the papers. I read about it. It was in Le Monde.  Spanish chef accused ...      and the French accused him.  Spanish chef accused of cheating.  They accused him of paying off the judges. They implicated actually  the Spanish government  amazingly. Huh  amazing. A huge scandal for a few weeks. Couldn't find a shred of evidence. Now  look at the guy. He doesn't look like a guy who's paying off French judges for his foie gras. So that died down  and very soon afterward  new controversy. He shouldn't win because it's not foie gras. It's not foie gras because it's not gavage. There's no force feeding. So by definition  he's lying and should be disqualified. As funny as it sounds  articulating it now and reading about it    actually  if we had talked about it before this controversy  I would have said   That's kind of true.  You know  foie gras by definition  force feeding  it's gavage  and that's what you get when you want foie gras. That is  until I went to Eduardo's farm in Extremadura     miles north of Seville  right on the Portugal border. I saw first hand a system that is incredibly complex and then at the same time  like everything beautiful in nature  is utterly simple. And he said to me  really from the first moment  my life's work is to give the geese what they want. He repeated that about    times in the two days I was with him. I'm just here to give the geese what they want. Actually  when I showed up he was lying down with the geese with his cell phone taking pictures of them like his children in the grass. Amazing. He's really just in love with    he's at one with    he's the goose whisperer. And when I was speaking to him  you know  I thought  like I'm speaking to you now  right  but sort of in the middle of my questions  my excited questions  because the more I got to know him and his system  the more exciting this whole idea became. He kept going like this to me. And I thought  OK  excited Jew from New York  right  I'm talking a little too aggressively  whatever  so you know  I slowed down. And finally  by the end of the day I was like  Ed uar do  you know like this  But he was still going like this. I figured it out. I was speaking too loudly. So I hushed my voice. I kind of like asked these questions and chatted with him through a translator in kind of a half whisper. And he stopped doing this. And amazingly  the geese who were on the other side of the paddock when I was around     Get the hell away from this kid      when I lowered my voice  they all came right up to us. Right up to us  like right up to here. Right along the fence line. And fence line was amazing in itself. The fence    like this conception of fence that we have it's totally backward with him. The electricity on this fiberglass fence is only on the outside. He rewired it. He invented it. I've never seen it. Have you  You fence in animals. You electrify the inside. He doesn't. He electrifies only the outside. Why  Because he said to me that he felt like the geese    and he proved this actually  not just a conceit  he proved this    the geese felt manipulated when they were imprisoned in their little paddocks. Even though they were imprisoned in this Garden of Eden with figs and everything else. He felt like they felt manipulated. So he got rid of the electricity  he got rid of current on the inside and kept it on the outside  so it would protect them against coyotes and other predators. Now  what happened  They ate  and he showed me on a chart  how they ate about    percent more feed to feed their livers. The landscape is incredible. I mean  his farm is incredible. It really is the Garden of Eden. There's figs and everything else there for the taking. And the irony of ironies is because Extremadura  the area    what does Extremadura mean  Extra hard land  right  Extra difficult. Extra hard. But over four generations  he and his family have literally transformed this extra hard land into a tasting menu. Upgrades the life for these geese. And they are allowed to take whatever they want. Another irony  the double irony is that on the figs and the olives  Eduardo can make more money selling those than he can on the foie gras. He doesn't care. He lets them take what they want and he says   Usually  it's about    percent. They're very fair.  The other    percent  he takes and he sells and he makes money on them. Part of the income for his farm. A big part of his income for his farm. But he never controls it. They get what they want  they leave the rest for me and I sell it. His biggest obstacle  really  was the marketplace  which demands these days bright yellow foie gras. That's how I've been trained. You want to look and see what good foie gras is  it's got to be bright yellow. It's the indication that it's the best foie gras. Well  because he doesn't force feed  because he doesn't gavage tons of corn  his livers were pretty grey. Or they were. But he found this wild plant called the Lupin bush. The Lupin bush  it's all around Extremadura. He let it go to seed  he took the seeds  he planted it on his    acres  all around. And the geese love the Lupin bush. Not for the bush  but for the seeds. And when they eat the seeds  their foie gras turns yellow. Radioactive yellow. Bright yellow. Of the highest quality foie gras yellow I've ever seen. So I'm listening to all this  you know  and I'm like  is this guy for real  Is he making some of this up  Is he like  you know    because he seemed to have an answer for everything  and it was always nature. It was never him. And I was like  you know  I always get a little  like  weirded out by people who deflect everything away from themselves. Because  really  they want you to look at themselves  right  But he deflected everything away from his ingenuity into working with his landscape. So it's like  here I am  I'm on the fence about this guy  but increasingly  eating up his every word. And we're sitting there  and I hear  clapping  from a distance  so I look over. And he grabs my arm and the translator's  and ducks us under a bush and says   Watch this.   Shush   he says again for the    th time to me.  Shush  watch this.  And this squadron of geese come over.  Clapping  And they're getting louder  louder  louder  like really loud  right over us. And like airport traffic control  as they start to go past us they're called back    and they're called back and back and back. And then they circle around. And his geese are calling up now to the wild geese.  Clapping  And the wild geese are calling down.  Clapping  And it's getting louder and louder and they circle and circle and they land. And I'm just saying   No way.  No way. And I look at Eduardo  who's near tears looking at this  and I say   You're telling me that your geese are calling to the wild geese to say come for a visit   And he says   No  no  no. They've come to stay.  They've come to stay  It's like the DNA of a goose is to fly south in the winter  right  I said that. I said  Isn't that what they're put on this Earth for  To fly south in the winter and north when it gets warm   He said   No  no  no. Their DNA is to find the conditions that are conducive to life. To happiness. They find it here. They don't need anything more.  They stop. They mate with his domesticated geese  and his flock continues. Think about that for a minute. It's brilliant  right  Imagine    I don't know  imagine a hog farm in  like  North Carolina  and a wild pig comes upon a factory farm and decides to stay. So how did it taste  I finally got to taste it before I left. He took me to his neighborhood restaurant and he served me some of his foie gras  confit de foie gras. It was incredible. And the problem with saying that  of course  is that you know  at this point it risks hyperbole really easily. And I'd like to make a metaphor  but I don't have one really. I was drinking this guy's Kool Aid so much  he could have served me goose feathers and I would have been like  this guy's a genius  you know  I'm really in love with him at this point. But it truly was the best foie gras of my life. So much so that I don't think I had ever really had foie gras until that moment. I'd had something that was called foie gras. But this was transformative. Really transformative. And I say to you  I might not stick to this  but I don't think I'll ever serve foie gras on my menu again because of that taste experience with Eduardo. It was sweet  it was unctuous. It had all the qualities of foie gras  but its fat had a lot of integrity and a lot of honesty. And you could taste herbs  you could taste spices. And I kept    I said  you know  I swear to God I tasted star anise. I was sure of it. And I'm not like some super taster  you know  But I can taste things. There's     percent star anise in there. And he says   No.  And I ended up like going down the spices  and finally  it was like  OK  salt and pepper  thinking he's salted and peppered his liver. But no. He takes the liver when he harvests the foie gras  he sticks them in this jar and he confits it. No salt  no pepper  no oil  no spices. What  We went back out for the final tour of the farm  and he showed me the wild pepper plants and the plants that he made sure existed on his farm for salinity. He doesn't need salt and pepper. And he doesn't need spices  because he's got this potpourri of herbs and flavors that his geese love to gorge on. I turned to him at the end of the meal  and it's a question I asked several times  and he hadn't  kind of  answered me directly  but I said   Now look  you're in Spain  some of the greatest chefs in the world are    Ferran Adria  the preeminent chef of the world today  not that far from you. How come you don't give him this  How come no one's really heard of you   And it may be because of the wine  or it may be because of my excitement  he answered me directly and he said   Because chefs don't deserve my foie gras.  And he was right. He was right. Chefs take foie gras and they make it their own. They create a dish where all the vectors point at us. With Eduardo it's about the expression of nature. And as he said  I think fittingly  it's a gift from God  with God saying  you've done good work. Simple. I flew home  I'm on the flight with my little black book and I took  you know  pages and pages of notes about it. I really was moved. And in the corner of one of these    one of my notes  is this note that says  when asked  what do you think of conventional foie gras  What do you think of foie gras that   .      percent of the world eats  He said   I think it's an insult to history.  And I wrote  insult to history. I'm on the plane and I'm just tearing my hair out. It's like  why didn't I follow up on that  What the hell does that mean  Insult to history. So I did some research when I got back  and here's what I found. The history of foie gras. Jews invented foie gras. True story. True story. By accident. They were looking for an alternative to schmaltz. Gotten sick of the chicken fat. They were looking for an alternative. And they saw in the fall that there was this natural  beautiful  sweet  delicious fat from geese. And they slaughtered them  used the fat throughout the winter for cooking. The Pharaoh got wind of this    This is true  right off the Internet. The Pharaoh got     Laughter  I swear to God. The Pharaoh got wind of this and wanted to taste it. He tasted it and fell in love with it. He started demanding it. And he didn't want it just in the fall  he wanted it all year round. And he demanded that the Jews supply enough for everyone. And the Jews  fearing for their life  had to come up with an ingenious idea  or at least try and satisfy the Pharaoh's wishes  of course. And they invented  what  Gavage. They invented gavage in a great moment of fear for their lives  and they provided the Pharaoh with gavage liver  and the good stuff they kept for themselves. Supposedly  anyway. I believe that one. That's the history of foie gras. And if you think about it  it's the history of industrial agriculture. It's the history of what we eat today. Most of what we eat today. Mega farms  feed lots  chemical amendments  long distance travel  food processing. All of it  our food system. That's also an insult to history. It's an insult to the basic laws of nature and of biology. Whether we're talking about beef cattle or we're talking about chickens  or we're talking about broccoli or Brussels sprouts  or in the case of this morning's New York Times  catfish    which wholesale are going out of business. Whatever it is  it's a mindset that is reminiscent of General Motors. It's rooted in extraction. Take more  sell more  waste more. And for the future it won't serve us. Jonas Salk has a great quote. He said   If all the insects disappeared  life on Earth as we know it would disappear within    years. If human beings disappeared  life on Earth as we know it would flourish.  And he's right. We need now to adopt a new conception of agriculture. Really new. One in which we stop treating the planet as if it were some kind of business in liquidation. And stop degrading resources under the guise of cheap food. We can start by looking to farmers like Eduardo. Farmers that rely on nature for solutions  for answers  rather than imposing solutions on nature. Listening as Janine Benyus  one of my favorite writers and thinkers about this topic says   Listening to nature's operating instructions.  That's what Eduardo does  and does so brilliantly. And what he showed me and what he can show all of us  I think  is that the great thing for chefs  the great blessing for chefs  and for people that care about food and cooking  is that the most ecological choice for food is also the most ethical choice for food. Whether we're talking about Brussels sprouts or foie gras. And it's also almost always  and I haven't found an example otherwise  but almost always  the most delicious choice. That's serendipitous. Thank you. Great creativity. In times of need  we need great creativity. Discuss. Great creativity is astonishingly  absurdly  rationally  irrationally powerful. Great creativity can spread tolerance  champion freedom  make education seem like a bright idea. Great creativity can turn a spotlight on deprivation  or show that deprivation ain't necessarily so. Great creativity can make politicians electable  or parties unelectable. It can make war seem like tragedy or farce. Creativity is the meme maker that puts slogans on our t shirts and phrases on our lips. It's the pathfinder that shows us a simple road through an impenetrable moral maze. Science is clever  but great creativity is something less knowable  more magical. And now we need that magic. This is a time of need. Our climate is changing quickly  too quickly. And great creativity is needed to do what it does so well  to provoke us to think differently with dramatic creative statements. To tempt us to act differently with delightful creative scraps. Here is one such scrap from an initiative I'm involved in using creativity to inspire people to be greener. Narrator  And so he walked  and as he walked he saw things. Strange and wonderful things he would not otherwise have seen. A deer with an itchy leg. A flying motorcycle. A father and daughter separated from a bicycle by a mysterious wall. And then he stopped. Walking in front of him was her. The woman who as a child had skipped with him through fields and broken his heart. Sure  she had aged a little. In fact  she had aged a lot. But he felt all his old passion for her return.  Ford   he called softly. For that was her name.  Don't say another word  Gusty   she said  for that was his name.  I know a tent next to a caravan  exactly     yards from here. Let's go there and make love. In the tent.  Ford undressed. She spread one leg  and then the other. Gusty entered her boldly and made love to her rhythmically while she filmed him  because she was a keen amateur pornographer. The earth moved for both of them. And they lived together happily ever after. And all because he decided to walk that day. Andy Hobsbawm  We've got the science  we've had the debate. The moral imperative is on the table. Great creativity is needed to take it all  make it simple and sharp. To make it connect. To make it make people want to act. So this is a call  a plea  to the incredibly talented TED community. Let's get creative against climate change. And let's do it soon. Thank you. Unless we do something to prevent it  over the next    years we re facing an epidemic of neurologic diseases on a global scale. A cheery thought. On this map  every country that s colored blue has more than    percent of its population over the age of   . This is the world we live in. And this is the world your children will live in. For        years  the distribution of ages in the human population has looked like a pyramid  with the oldest on top. It s already flattening out. By       it s going to be a column and will start to invert. This is why it s happening. The average lifespan s more than doubled since       and it s increasing currently at the rate of about five hours every day. And this is why that s not entirely a good thing  because over the age of     your risk of getting Alzheimer s or Parkinson s disease will increase exponentially. By       there ll be about    million people in the United States over the age of     and unless we do something about it  half of them will have Alzheimer s disease and three million more will have Parkinson s disease. Right now  those and other neurologic diseases    for which we have no cure or prevention    cost about a third of a trillion dollars a year. It will be well over a trillion dollars by     . Alzheimer s disease starts when a protein that should be folded up properly misfolds into a kind of demented origami. So one approach we re taking is to try to design drugs that function like molecular Scotch tape  to hold the protein into its proper shape. That would keep it from forming the tangles that seem to kill large sections of the brain when they do. Interestingly enough  other neurologic diseases which affect very different parts of the brain also show tangles of misfolded protein  which suggests that the approach might be a general one  and might be used to cure many neurologic diseases  not just Alzheimer s disease. There s also a fascinating connection to cancer here  because people with neurologic diseases have a very low incidence of most cancers. And this is a connection that most people aren t pursuing right now  but which we re fascinated by. Most of the important and all of the creative work in this area is being funded by private philanthropies. And there s tremendous scope for additional private help here  because the government has dropped the ball on much of this  I m afraid. In the meantime  while we re waiting for all these things to happen  here s what you can do for yourself. If you want to lower your risk of Parkinson s disease  caffeine is protective to some extent  nobody knows why. Head injuries are bad for you. They lead to Parkinson s disease. And the Avian Flu is also not a good idea. As far as protecting yourself against Alzheimer s disease  well  it turns out that fish oil has the effect of reducing your risk for Alzheimer s disease. You should also keep your blood pressure down  because chronic high blood pressure is the biggest single risk factor for Alzheimer s disease. It s also the biggest risk factor for glaucoma  which is just Alzheimer s disease of the eye. And of course  when it comes to cognitive effects   use it or lose it  applies  so you want to stay mentally stimulated. But hey  you re listening to me. So you ve got that covered. And one final thing. Wish people like me luck  okay  Because the clock is ticking for all of us. Thank you. The north coast of California has rainforests    temperate rainforests    where it can rain more than     inches a year. This is the realm of the Coast Redwood tree. Its species name is Sequoia sempervirens. Sequoia sempervirens is the tallest living organism on Earth. The range of the species goes up to as much as     feet tall. That's    stories tall. These are trees that would stand out in midtown Manhattan. Nobody knows how old the oldest living Coast Redwoods are because nobody has ever drilled into any of them to count their annual growth rings  and  in any case  the centers of the oldest individuals appear to be hollow. But it's believed that the oldest living Redwoods are perhaps       years old    roughly the age of the Parthenon    although it's also suspected that there may be individual trees that are older than that. You can see the range of the Coast Redwoods. It's here  in red. The largest individuals of this species  the dreadnoughts of their kind  live just on the north coast of California  where the rain is really intense. In recent historic times  about    percent of the Coast Redwood forest was cut down  especially in a series of bursts of intense liquidation logging  clear cutting that took place in the     s through the early     s. Even so  about four percent of the primeval Redwood rainforest remains intact  wild and now protected    entirely protected    in a chain of small parks strung out like pearls along the north coast of California  including Redwood National Park. But curiously  Redwood rainforests  the fragments that we have left  to this day remain under explored. Redwood rainforest is incredibly difficult to move through  and even today  individual trees are being discovered that have never been seen before  including  in the summer of       Hyperion  the world's tallest tree. I'm going to do a little Gedanken experiment. I'm going to ask you to imagine what a Redwood really is as a living organism. And  Chris  if I could have you up here  I have a tape measure. It's a kind loaner from TED. And Chris  if you could take the end of that tape measure  We're going to show you what the diameter at breast height of a big Redwood is. Unfortunately  this tape isn't long enough    it's only a    foot tape. Chris  could you extend your arm out that way  There we go. OK. And maybe about here  about    feet  is the diameter of a big Redwood. Now  let your imagination go upward into space. Think about this tree  rising upward into Redwood space      feet     stories  an individual living organism articulating its forms upward into space over long periods of time. The Redwood species seems to exist in another kind of time  not human time  but what we might call Redwood time. Redwood time moves at a more stately pace than human time. To us  when we look at a Redwood tree  it seems to be motionless and still  and yet Redwoods are constantly in motion  moving upward into space  articulating themselves and filling Redwood space over Redwood time  over thousands of years. Plant this small seed  wait       years  and you get this  the Lost Monarch. It dwells in the Grove of Titans on the north coast  and was discovered in     . And yet  when you look at the base of a Redwood tree  you're not seeing the organism. You're like a mouse looking at the foot of an elephant  and most of the organism is overhead  unseen. I became very interested  and I wrote about a couple. Steve Sillett and Marie Antoine are the principal explorers of the Redwood forest canopy. They're world class athletes  and they also are world class forest ecology scientists. Steve Sillett  when he was a    year old college student at Reed College  had heard that the Redwood forest canopy is considered to be a so called Redwood desert. That is to say  at that time it was believed that there was nothing up there except the branches of Redwood trees. And with a friend of his  he took it upon himself to free climb a Redwood without ropes or any equipment to see what was up there. He climbed up a small tree next to this giant Redwood  and then he leaped through space and grabbed a branch with his hands  and ended up hanging  like catching a bar of a trapeze. And then  from there  he climbed directly up the bark until he got to the top of the tree. His friend  a guy named Marwood Harris  was following behind. Neither one of them had noticed that there was a Yellow Jacket wasp's nest the size of a bowling ball hanging from the branch that Steve had jumped into. And when Marwood made the jump  he was covered with wasps stinging him in the face and eyes. He nearly let go. He would have fallen to his death  being    feet above the ground. But they made it to the top  and what they found was not a Redwood desert  but a lost world    a kind of three dimensional labyrinth in the air  filled with unknown life. Now  I had been working on other topics  the emergence of infectious diseases  which come out of the natural ecosystems of the Earth  make a trans species jump  and get into humans. After three books on this  it got to be a bit much  in a way. My wife and I adore our children. And I began climbing trees with my kids as just something to do with them  using the so called arborist climbing technique  with ropes. You use ropes to get yourself up into the crown of a tree. Children are incredibly adept at climbing trees. That's my son  Oliver. They don't seem to suffer from the same fear of heights that humans do. If ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny  then children are somewhat closer to our roots as primates in the arboreal forest. Humans appear to be the only primates that I know of that are afraid of heights. All other primates  when they're scared  they run up a tree  where they feel safe. We camped overnight in the trees  in tree boats. This is my daughter Laura  then     looking out of a tree boat. She's  by the way  tied in with a rope so she can't fall. Looking out of a tree boat in the morning and hearing birdsong coming in three dimensions around us. We had been visited in the night by flying squirrels  who don't seem to recognize humans for what they are because they've never seen them in the canopy before. And we practiced advanced techniques like sky walking  where you can move from tree to tree through space  rather like Spiderman. It became a writing project. When Steve Sillett gets up into a big Redwood  he fires an arrow  which trails a fishing line  which gets over a branch in the tree  and then you ascend up a rope which has been dragged into the tree by the line. You ascend    stories. There are two people climbing this tree  Gaya  which is thought to be one of the oldest Redwoods. There they are. They are only one seventh of the way up that tree. You do feel a sense of exposure. There is a small person right down there on the ground. You feel like you're climbing a wall of wood. But then you enter the Redwood canopy  and it's like coming through a layer of clouds. And all of a sudden  you lose sight of the ground  and you also lose sight of the sky  and you're in a three dimensional labyrinth in the air filled with hanging gardens of ferns growing out of soil  which is populated with all kinds of small organisms. There are epiphytes  plants that grow on trees. These are huckleberry bushes. Many species of mosses  and then all sorts of lichens just plastering the tree. When you get near the top of the tree  you feel like you can't fall    in fact  it's difficult to move. You're worming your way through branches which are crowded with living things that don't occur near the ground. It's like scuba diving into a coral reef  except you're going upward instead of downward. And then the trees tend to flare out into platform like areas at the top. Maria's sitting on one of them. These limbs could be five to six hundred years old. Redwoods grow very slowly in their tops. They also have a feature  thickets of huckleberry bushes that grow out of the tops of Redwood trees that are technically known as huckleberry afros  and you can sit there and snack on the berries while you're resting. Redwoods have an enormous surface area that extends upward into space because they have a propensity to do something called reiteration. A Redwood is a fractal. And as they put out limbs  the limbs burst into small trees  copies of the Redwood. Now  here we see a reiteration in Chronos  one of the older Redwoods. This reiteration is a huge flying buttress that comes out the tree itself. This buttress is less than halfway up the tree. And then it bursts into a forest of Redwoods. This particular extra trunk is a meter across at the base and extends upward for     feet. It's as big as any of the biggest trees east of the Mississippi River  and yet it's only a minor feature on Chronos. This three dimensional map of the crown structure of a Redwood named Iluvatar  made by Steve Sillett  Marie Antoine and their colleagues  gives you an idea. What you're seeing here is a hierarchical schematic development of the trunks of this tree as it has elaborated itself over time into six layers of fractal  of trunks springing from trunks springing from trunks. I asked Steve to put a human being in this to give a sense of scale. There's the person  right there. The person is waving to us. I've wanted to ask Craig Venter if it would be possible to insert a synthetic chromosome into a human so that we could reiterate ourselves if we wanted to. And if we were able to reiterate  then the fingers of our hand would be people who looked like us  and they would have people on their hands and so on. And if we had Redwood like biology  we would have six layers of people on our hands  as it were. And it would be a lovely thing to be able to wave to someone and have all our reiterations wave at the same time. To reiterate the point  let's go closer into Iluvatar. We're looking at that yellow box. And this hallucinatory drawing shows you    everything you see in this drawing is Iluvatar. These are millennial structures    portions of the tree that are believed to be more than       years old. There are four humans in this shot    one  two  three  four. And there's also something that I want to show you. This is a flying buttress. Redwoods grow back into themselves as they expand into space  and this flying buttress is a limb shot out of that small trunk  going back into the main trunk and fusing with it. Flying buttresses  just as in a cathedral  help strengthen the crown of the tree and help the tree exist longer through time. The scientists are doing all kinds of experiments in these trees. They've wired them like patients in an ICU. They're finding out that Redwoods can move moisture out of the air and down into their trunks  possibly all the way into their root systems. They also have the ability to put roots anywhere in the tree itself. If a portion of a Redwood is rotting  the Redwood will send roots into its own form and draw nutrients out of itself as it falls apart. If we had Redwood like biology  if we got a touch of gangrene in our arm then we could just  you know  extract the nutrients extract the nutrients and the moisture out of it until it fell off. Canopy soil can occur up to a meter deep  hundreds of feet above the ground  and there are organisms in this soil that have  as yet  no names. This is an unnamed species of copepod. A copepod is a crustacean. These copepods are a major constituent of the oceans  and they are a major part of the diet of grazing baleen whales. What they're doing in the Redwood forest canopy soil hundreds of feet above the ocean  or how they got there  is completely unknown. There are some interesting theories that  if I had time  I would tell you about. But as you go and you look closer at a tree  what you see is  you see increasing complexity. We're looking at the very top of Gaya  which is thought to be the oldest Redwood. Gaya may be       to       years old  no one really knows  but its top has broken off and it's been rotting back now. This little Japanese garden like creation probably took     years to form in its complexity that we see right now. As you look at a tree  it takes a magnifying glass to see a giant tree. I have to show you something unfortunately very sad at the conclusion of this talk. The Eastern Hemlock tree has often been described as the Redwood of the East. And we're moving in a full circle now. In the     s  a small organism appeared in Richmond  Virginia  called the Hemlock woolly adelgid. It made a trans species jump out of some other organism in Asia  where it was living on Hemlock trees in Asia. When it moved into its new host  the Eastern Hemlock tree  it escaped its predators  and the new tree had no resistance to it. The Eastern Hemlock forest is being considered in some ways the last fragments of primeval rainforest east of the Mississippi River. I hadn't even known that there were rainforests in the east  but in Great Smoky Mountains National Park it can rain up to     inches of rain a year. And in the last two to three summers  these invasive organisms  this kind of Ebola of the trees  as it were  has swept through the primeval Hemlock forest of the east  and has absolutely wiped it out. I climbed there this past summer. This is Great Smoky Mountains National Park  and the Hemlocks are dead as far as the eye can see. And what we're seeing is not just the potential death of the Eastern Hemlock species    that is to say  its extinction from nature due to this invading parasite    but we're also seeing the death of an incredibly complex ecosystem for which these trees are merely the substrate for the aerial labyrinth of the sky that exists in their crowns. It's absolutely heartbreaking to see. One of the things that is just    I almost can't conceive it    is the idea that the national news media hasn't picked this up at all  and this is the devastation of one of the most important ecosystems in North America. What can the Redwoods tell us about ourselves  Well  I think they can tell us something about human time. The flickering  transitory quality of human time and the brevity of human life    the necessity to love. But we're different from trees  and they can also teach us something about ourselves in the differences that we have. We are human  and we have the capacity to love  we have the capacity to wonder  and we have a sort of boundless curiosity  a restless inquisitiveness that so suits us as primates  I think. And at least for me  personally  the trees have taught me an entirely new way of loving my children. Exploring with them the forest canopy has been one of the most lovely things of my existence on Earth. And I think that one of the happiest things is the sense that with my children I've been able to introduce them into the very small circle of humans who are lucky enough  or possibly stupid enough  to still climb trees. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  I think at a previous TED  I think it was Nathan Myhrvold who told me that it was thought that because these trees are like        years and older  on many of them there are ecosystems where there are species that are not found anywhere on the Earth except on that one tree. Is that correct  Richard Preston  Yes  that is correct. I mentioned Hyperion  the world's tallest tree. And I was a member of a climbing team that made the first climb of it  in     . And while we were climbing Hyperion  Marie Antoine spotted an unknown species of golden brown ant about halfway up the trunk. Ants are not known to occur in Redwood trees  curiously enough  and we wondered whether this ant  this species of ant  was only endemic to that one tree  or possibly to that grove. And in subsequent climbs they could never find that ant again  and so no specimens have ever been collected. We don't know what it is    we just know it's there. CA  So  you have to wonder when  you know  if some other species than us was recording the stories that mattered on Earth  you know  our stories are about Iraq and war and politics and celebrity gossip. You've just told us a different story of this tragic arms race that's happening  and maybe whole ecosystems gone forever. It's an amazing sense of wonder you've given me  and a sense of just how fragile this whole thing is. RP  It is fragile  and you know  I think about emerging human diseases    parasites that move into the human species. But that's just a very small facet of a much greater problem of invasions of species worldwide  all through the ecosystems  and you know  the Earth itself    CA  Partly caused by us  inadvertently. RP  Caused by humans. Caused by the movement of humans. You can think of the Earth's biosphere as a palace  and the continents are rooms in the palace  and the islands are small rooms. But lately  the doors of the palace have been flung open  and the walls are coming down. CA  Richard Preston  thank you very much  I think. RP  Thank you. You know  we're going to do things a little differently. I'm not going to show you a presentation. I'm going to talk to you. And at the same time  we're going to look at just images from a photo stream that is pretty close to live of things that    snapshots from Second Life. So hopefully this will be fascinating. You can    I can compete for your attention with the strange pictures that you see on screen that come from there. I thought I'd talk a little bit about some just big ideas about this  and then get John back out here so we can talk interactively a little bit more and think and ask questions. You know  I guess the first question is  why build a virtual world at all  And I think the answer to that is always going to be at least driven to a certain extent by the people initially crazy enough to start the project  you know. So I can give you a little bit of first background just on me and what moved me as a    really going back as far as a teenager and then an adult  to actually try and build this kind of thing. I was a very creative kid who read a lot  and got into electronics first  and then later  programming computers  when I was really young. I was just always trying to make things. I was just obsessed with taking things apart and building things  and just anything I could do with my hands or with wood or electronics or metal or anything else. And so  for example    and it's a great Second Life thing    I had a bedroom. And every kid  you know  as a teenager  has got his bedroom he retreats to    but I wanted my door  I thought it would be cool if my door went up rather than opened  like on Star Trek. I thought it would be neat to do that. And so I got up in the ceiling and I cut through the ceiling joists  much to my parents' delight  and put the door  you know  being pulled up through the ceiling. I built    I put a garage door opener up in the attic that would pull this door up. You can imagine the amount of time that it took me to do this to the house and the displeasure of my parents. The thing that was always striking to me was that we as people could have so many really amazing ideas about things we'd like to do  but are so often unable  in the real world  to actually do those things    to actually cobble together the materials and go through the actual execution phase of building something that you imagine from a design perspective. And so for me  I know that when the Internet came around and I was doing computer programming and just  you know  just generally trying to run my own little company and figure out what to do with the Internet and with computers  I was just immediately struck by how the ultimate thing that you would really want to do with the Internet and with computers would be to use the Internet and connected computers to simulate a world to sort of recreate the laws of physics and the rules of how things went together    the sort of    the idea of atoms and how to make things  and do that inside a computer so that we could all get in there and make stuff. And so for me that was the thing that was so enticing. I just wanted this place where you could build things. And so I think you see that in the genesis of what has happened with Second Life  and I think it's important. I also think that more generally  the use of the Internet and technology as a kind of a space between us for creativity and design is a general trend. It is a    sort of a great human progress. Technology is just generally being used to allow us to create in as shared and social a way as possible. And I think that Second Life and virtual worlds more generally represent the best we can do to achieve that right now. You know  another way to look at that  and related to the content and  you know  thinking about space  is to connect sort of virtual worlds to space. I thought that might be a fun thing to talk about for a second. If you think about going into space  it's a fascinating thing. So many movies  so many kids  we all sort of dream about exploring space. Now  why is that  Stop for a moment and ask  why that conceit  Why do we as people want to do that  I think there's a couple of things. It's what we see in the movies    you know  it's this dream that we all share. One is that if you went into space you'd be able to begin again. In some sense  you would become someone else in that journey  because there wouldn't be    you'd leave society and life as you know it  behind. And so inevitably  you would transform yourself    irreversibly  in all likelihood    as you began this exploration. And then the second thing is that there's this tangible sense that if you travel far enough  you can find out there    oh  yeah    you have no idea what you're going to find once you get there  into space. It's going to be different than here. And in fact  it's going to be so different than what we see here on earth that anything is going to be possible. So that's kind of the idea    we as humans crave the idea of creating a new identity and going into a place where anything is possible. And I think that if you really sit and think about it  virtual worlds  and where we're going with more and more computing technology  represent essentially the likely  really tactically possible version of space exploration. We are moved by the idea of virtual worlds because  like space  they allow us to reinvent ourselves and they contain anything and everything  and probably anything could happen there. You know  to give you a size idea about scale  you know  comparing space to Second Life  most people don't realize  kind of    and then this is just like the Internet in the early '  s. In fact  Second Life virtual worlds are a lot like the Internet in the early '  s today  everybody's very excited  there's a lot of hype and excitement about one idea or the next from moment to moment  and then there's despair and everybody thinks the whole thing's not going to work. Everything that's happening with Second Life and more broadly with virtual worlds  all happened in the early '  s. We always play a game at the office where you can take any article and find the same article where you just replace the words  Second Life  with  Web   and  virtual reality  with  Internet.  You can find exactly the same articles written about everything that people are observing. To give you an idea of scale  Second Life is about        CPUs at this point. It's about        computers connected together in three facilities in the United States right now  that are simulating this virtual space. And the virtual space itself    there's about         people a day that are wandering around in there  so the kind of  active population is something like a smallish city. The space itself is about    times the size of San Francisco  and it's about as densely built out. So it gives you an idea of scale. Now  it's expanding very rapidly    about five percent a month or so right now  in terms of new servers being added. And so of course  radically unlike the real world  and like the Internet  the whole thing is expanding very  very quickly  and historically exponentially. So that sort of space exploration thing is matched up here by the amount of content that's in there  and I think that amount is critical. It was critical with the virtual world that it be this space of truly infinite possibility. We're very sensitive to that as humans. You know  you know when you see it. You know when you can do anything in a space and you know when you can't. Second Life today is this        machines  and it's about     million or so user created objects where  you know  an object would be something like this  possibly interactive. Tens of millions of them are thinking all the time  they have code attached to them. So it's a really large world already  in terms of the amount of stuff that's there and that's very important. If anybody plays  like  World of Warcraft  World of Warcraft comes on  like  four DVDs. Second Life  by comparison  has about     terabytes of user created data  making it about        times larger. So again  like the Internet compared to AOL  and the sort of chat rooms and content on AOL at the time  what's happening here is something very different  because the sheer scale of what people can do when they're enabled to do anything they want is pretty amazing. The last big thought is that it is almost certainly true that whatever this is going to evolve into is going to be bigger in total usage than the Web itself. And let me justify that with two statements. Generically  what we use the Web for is to organize  exchange  create and consume information. It's kind of like Irene talking about Google being data driven. I'd say I kind of think about the world as being information. Everything that we interact with  all the experiences that we have  is kind of us flowing through a sea of information and interacting with it in different ways. The Web puts information in the form of text and images. The topology  the geography of the Web is text to text links for the most part. That's one way of organizing information  but there are two things about the way you access information in a virtual world that I think are the important ways that they're very different and much better than what we've been able to do to date with the Web. The first is that  as I said  the    well  the first difference for virtual worlds is that information is presented to you in the virtual world using the most powerful iconic symbols that you can possibly use with human beings. So for example  C H A I R is the English word for that  but a picture of this is a universal symbol. Everybody knows what it means. There's no need to translate it. It's also more memorable if I show you that picture  and I show you C H A I R on a piece of paper. You can do tests that show that you'll remember that I was talking about a chair a couple of days later a lot better. So when you organize information using the symbols of our memory  using the most common symbols that we've been immersed in all our lives  you maximally both excite  stimulate  are able to remember  transfer and manipulate data. And so virtual worlds are the best way for us to essentially organize and experience information. And I think that's something that people have talked about for    years    you know  that  D  that lifelike environments are really important in some magical way to us. But the second thing    and I think this one is less obvious    is that the experience of creating  consuming  exploring that information is in the virtual world implicitly and inherently social. You are always there with other people. And we as humans are social creatures and must  or are aided by  or enjoy more  the consumption of information in the presence of others. It's essential to us. You can't escape it. When you're on Amazon.com and you're looking for digital cameras or whatever  you're on there right now  when you're on the site  with like       other people  but you can't talk to them. You can't just turn to the people that are browsing digital cameras on the same page as you  and ask them   Hey  have you seen one of these before  Because I'm thinking about buying it.  That experience of like  shopping together  just as a simple example  is an example of how as social creatures we want to experience information in that way. So that second point  that we inherently experience information together or want to experience it together  is critical to essentially  kind of  this trend of where we're going to use technology to connect us. And so I think  again  that it's likely that in the next decade or so these virtual worlds are going to be the most common way as human beings that we kind of use the electronics of the Internet  if you will  to be together  to consume information. You know  mapping in India    that's such a great example. Maybe the solution there involves talking to other people in real time. Asking for advice  rather than any possible way that you could just statically organize a map. So I think that's another big point. I think that wherever this is all going  whether it's Second Life or its descendants  or something broader that happens all around the world at a lot of different points    this is what we're going to see the Internet used for  and total traffic and total unique users is going to invert  so that the Web and its bibliographic set of text and graphical information is going to become a tool or a part of that consumption pattern  but the pattern itself is going to happen mostly in this type of an environment. Big idea  but I think highly defensible. So let me stop there and bring John back  and maybe we can just have a longer conversation. Thank you. John. That's great. John Hockenberry  Why is the creation  the impulse to create Second Life  not a utopian impulse  Like for example  in the   th century  any number of works of literature that imagined alternative worlds were explicitly utopian. Philip Rosedale  I think that's great. That's such a deep question. Yeah. Is a virtual world likely to be a utopia  would be one way I'd say it. The answer is no  and I think the reason why is because the Web itself as a good example is profoundly bottoms up. That idea of infinite possibility  that magic of anything can happen  only happens in an environment where you really know that there's a fundamental freedom at the level of the individual actor  at the level of the Lego blocks  if you will  that make up the virtual world. You have to have that level of freedom  and so I'm often asked that  you know  is there a  kind of  utopian or  is there a utopian tendency to Second Life and things like it  that you would create a world that has a grand scheme to it  Those top down schemes are alienating to just about everybody  even if you mean well when you build them. And what's more  human society  when it's controlled  when you set out a grand scheme of rules  a new way of people interacting  or a new way of laying out a city  or whatever  that stuff historically has never scaled much beyond  you know    I always laughingly say    the Mall of America  you know  which is like  the largest piece of centrally designed architecture that  you know  has been built. JH  The Kremlin was pretty big. PR  The Kremlin  yeah. That's true. The whole complex. JH  Give me a story of a tool you created at the beginning in Second Life that you were pretty sure people would want to use in the creation of their avatars or in communicating that people actually in practice said  no  I'm not interested in that at all  and name something that you didn't come up with that almost immediately people began to demand. PR  I'm sure I can think of multiple examples of both of those. One of my favorites. I had this feature that I built into Second Life    I was really passionate about it. It was an ability to kind of walk up close to somebody and have a more private conversation  but it wasn't instant messaging because you had to sort of befriend somebody. It was just this idea that you could kind of have a private chat. I just remember it was one of those examples of data driven design. I thought it was such a good idea from my perspective  and it was just absolutely never used  and we ultimately    I think we've now turned it off  if I remember. We finally gave up  took it out of the code. But more generally  you know  one other example I think about this  which is great relative to the utopian idea. Second Life originally had    simulators. It now has       . So when it only had     it was only about as big as this college campus. And we had    we zoned it  you know  we put a nightclub  we put a disco where you could dance  and then we had a place where you could fight with guns if you wanted to  and we had another place that was like a boardwalk  kind of a Coney Island. And we laid out the zoning  but of course  people could build all around it however they wanted to. And what was so amazing right from the start was that the idea that we had put out in the zoning concept  basically  was instantly and thoroughly ignored  and like  two months into the whole thing     which is really a small amount of time  even in Second Life time    I remember the users  the people who were then using Second Life  the residents came to me and said  we want to buy the disco    because I had built it    we want to buy that land and raze it and put houses on it. And I sold it to them    I mean  we transferred ownership and they had a big party and blew up the entire building. And I remember that that was just so telling  you know  that you didn't know exactly what was going to happen. When you think about stuff that people have built that's popular    JH  CBGB's has to close eventually  you know. That's the rule. PR  Exactly. And it    but it closed on day one  basically  in Internet time. You know  an example of something    pregnancy. You can have a baby in Second Life. This is done entirely using  kind of  the tools that are built into Second Life  so the innate concept of becoming pregnant and having a baby  of course    Second Life is  at the platform level  at the level of the company    at Linden Lab    Second Life has no game properties to it whatsoever. There is no attempt to structure the experience  to make it utopian in that sense that we put into it. So of course  we never would have put a mechanism for having babies or  you know  taking two avatars and merging them  or something. But people built the ability to have babies and care for babies as a purchasable experience that you can have in Second Life and so    I mean  that's a pretty fascinating example of  you know  what goes on in the overall economy. And of course  the existence of an economy is another idea. I didn't talk about it  but it's a critical feature. When people are given the opportunity to create in the world  there's really two things they want. One is fair ownership of the things they create. And then the second one is    if they feel like it  and they're not going to do it in every case  but in many they are    they want to actually be able to sell that creation as a way of providing for their own livelihood. True on the Web    also true in Second Life. And so the existence of an economy is critical. JH  Questions for Philip Rosedale  Right here. JH  The observation is  Philip has been accused of looking like a character  an avatar  in Second Life. Respond  and then we'll get the rest of your question. PR  But I don't look like my avatar. How many people here know what my avatar looks like  That's probably not very many. JH  Are you ripping off somebody else's avatar with that  sort of    PR  No  no. I didn't. One of the other guys at work had a fantastic avatar    a female avatar    that I used to be once in a while. But my avatar is a guy wearing chaps. Spiky hair    spikier than this. Kind of orange hair. Handlebar mustache. Kind of a Village People sort of a character. So  very cool. JH  And your question  JH  The question is  there appears to be a lack of cultural fine tuning in Second Life. It doesn't seem to have its own culture  and the sort of differences that exist in the real world aren't translated into the Second Life map. PR  Well  first of all  we're very early  so this has only been going on for a few years. And so part of what we see is the same evolution of human behavior that you see in emerging societies. So a fair criticism    is what it is    of Second Life today is that it's more like the Wild West than it is like Rome  from a cultural standpoint. That said  the evolution of  and the nuanced interaction that creates culture  is happening at    times the speed of the real world  and in an environment where  if you walk into a bar in Second Life     percent of the people there are not in the United States  and in fact are speaking their  you know  various and different languages. In fact  one of the ways to make money in Second Life is to make really cool translators that you drag onto your body and they basically  kind of  pop up on your screen and allow you to use Google or Babel Fish or one of the other online text translators to on the fly translate spoken    I'm sorry    typed text between individuals. And so  the multicultural nature and the sort of cultural melting pot that's happening inside Second Life is quite    I think  quite remarkable relative to what in real human terms in the real world we've ever been able to achieve. So  I think that culture will fine tune  it will emerge  but we still have some years to wait while that happens  as you would naturally expect. JH  Other questions  Right here. JH  What's your demographic  PR  So  the question is  what's the demographic. So  the average age of a person in Second Life is     however  the use of Second Life increases dramatically as your physical age increases. So as you go from age    to age       and there are many people in their sixties using Second Life    this is also not a sharp curve    it's very  very distributed    usage goes up in terms of  like  hours per week by    percent as you go from age    to age    in real life  so there's not    many people make the mistake of believing that Second Life is some kind of an online game. Actually it's generally unappealing    I'm just speaking broadly and critically    it's not very appealing to people that play online video games  because the graphics are not yet equivalent to    I mean  these are very nice pictures  but in general the graphics are not quite equivalent to the fine tuned graphics that you see in a Grand Theft Auto  . So average age    . I mentioned    percent of the users are not in the United States. The distribution amongst countries is extremely broad. There's users from  you know  virtually every country in the world now in Second Life. The dominant ones are    if you take the UK and Europe  together they make up about    percent of the usage base in Second Life. In terms of psychographic    oh  men and women  men and women are almost equally matched in Second Life  so about    percent of the people online right now on Second Life are women. Women use Second Life  though  about    to    percent more  on an hours basis  than men do  meaning that more men sign up than women  and more women stay and use it than men. So that's another demographic fact. In terms of psychographic  you know  the people in Second Life are remarkably dissimilar relative to what you might think  when you go in and talk to them and meet them  and I would  you know  challenge you to just do this and find out. But it's not a bunch of programmers. It's not easy to describe as a demographic. If I had to just sort of paint a broad picture  I'd say  remember the people who were really getting into eBay in the first few years of eBay  Maybe a little bit like that  in other words  people who are early adopters. They tend to be creative. They tend to be entrepreneurial. A lot of them    about        people so far    are cash flow positive  they're making money from what    I mean  real world money    from what they're doing in Second Life  so it's a very build    still a creative  building things  build your own business type of an orientation. So  that's it. JH  You describe yourself  Philip  as someone who was really creative when you were young and  you know  liked to make things. I mean  it's not often that you hear somebody describe themselves as really creative. I suspect that's possibly a euphemism for C student who spent a lot of time in his room  Is it possible  PR  I was a    there were times I was a C student. You know  it's funny. When I got to college    I studied physics in college    and I got really    it was funny  because I was definitely a more antisocial kid. I read all the time. I was shy. I don't seem like it now  but I was very shy. Moved around a bunch    had that experience too. So I did  kind of  I think  live in my own world  and obviously that helps  you know  engage your real interest in something. JH  So you're on your fifth life at this point  PR  If you count  yeah  cities. So    but I did    and I didn't do    I think I didn't do as well in school as I could have. I think you're right. I wasn't  like  an obsessed    you know  get A's kind of guy. I was going to say  I had a great social experience when I went to college that I hadn't had before  a more fraternal experience  where I met six or seven other guys who I studied physics with  and I was very competitive with them  so then I started to get A's. But you're right  I wasn't an A student. JH  Last question. Right here. JH  You want to paraphrase that  PR  Yeah  so let me restate that. So  you're saying that in the pamphlet there's a statement that we may come to prefer our digital selves to our real ones    our more malleable or manageable digital identities to our real identities    and that in fact  much of human life and human experience may move into the digital realm. And then that's kind of a horrifying thought  of course. That's a frightening change  frightening disruption. I guess  and you're asking  what do I think about that  How do I    JH  What's your response to the people who would say  that's horrifying  what would be your response   PR  Well  I'd say a couple of things. One is  it's disturbing like the Internet or electricity was. That is to say  it's a big change  but it isn't avoidable. So  no amount of backpedaling or intentional behavior or political behavior is going to keep these technology changes from connecting us together  because the basic motive that people have    to be creative and entrepreneurial    is going to drive energy into these virtual worlds in the same way that it has with the Web. So this change  I believe  is a huge disruptive change. Obviously  I'm the optimist and a big believer in what's going on here  but I think that as    even a sober  you know  the most sober  disconnected thinker about this  looking at it from the side  has to conclude  based on the data  that with those kinds of economic forces at play  there is definitely going to be a sea change  and that change is going to be intensely disruptive relative to our concept of our very lives and being  and our identities  as well. I don't think we can get away from those changes. I think generally  we were talking about this    I think that generally being present in a virtual world and being challenged by it  being    surviving there  having a good life there  so to speak  is a challenge because of the multiculturality of it  because of the languages  because of the entrepreneurial richness of it  the sort of flea market nature  if you will  of the virtual world today. It puts challenges on us to rise to. We must be better than ourselves  in many ways. We must learn things and  you know  be more tolerant  and be smarter and learn faster and be more creative  perhaps  than we are typically in our real lives. And I think that if that is true of virtual worlds  then these changes  though scary    and  I say  inevitable    are ultimately for the better  and therefore something that we should ride out. But I would say that    and many other authors and speakers about this  other than me  have said  you know  fasten your seat belts because the change is coming. There are going to be big changes. JH  Philip Rosedale  thank you very much. People love their automobiles. They allow us to go where we want to when we want to. They're a form of entertainment  they're a form of art  a pride of ownership. Songs are written about cars. Prince wrote a great song   Little Red Corvette.  He didn't write  Little Red Laptop Computer  or  Little Red Dirt Devil.  He wrote about a car. And one of my favorites has always been   Make love to your man in a Chevy van   because that was my vehicle when I was in college. The fact is  when we do our market research around the world  we see that there's nearly a universal aspiration on the part of people to own an automobile. And     million people in the world today own a car. And you say  boy  that's a lot. But you know what  That's just    percent of the population. We really have to ask the question  Can the world sustain that number of automobiles  And if you look at projections over the next    to    to    years  it looks like the world car park could grow to on the order of  .  billion vehicles. Now  if you parked those end to end and wrapped them around the Earth  that would stretch around the Earth     times. Now  we've made great progress with automobile technology over the last     years. Cars are dramatically cleaner  dramatically safer  more efficient and radically more affordable than they were     years ago. But the fact remains  the fundamental DNA of the automobile has stayed pretty much the same. If we are going to reinvent the automobile today  rather than     years ago  knowing what we know about the issues associated with our product and about the technologies that exist today  what would we do  We wanted something that was really affordable. The fuel cell looked great  one tenth as many moving parts and a fuel cell propulsion system as an internal combustion engine    and it emits just water. And we wanted to take advantage of Moore's Law with electronic controls and software  and we absolutely wanted our car to be connected. So we embarked upon the reinvention around an electrochemical engine  the fuel cell  hydrogen as the energy carrier. First was Autonomy. Autonomy really set the vision for where we wanted to head. We embodied all of the key components of a fuel cell propulsion system. We then had Autonomy drivable with Hy Wire  and we showed Hy Wire here at this conference last year. Hy Wire is the world's first drivable fuel cell  and we have followed up that now with Sequel. And Sequel truly is a real car. So if we would run the video    But the real key question I'm sure that's on your mind  where's the hydrogen going to come from  And secondly  when are these kinds of cars going to be available  So let me talk about hydrogen first. The beauty of hydrogen is it can come from so many different sources  it can come from fossil fuels  it can come from any way that you can create electricity  including renewables. And it can come from biofuels. And that's quite exciting. The vision here is to have each local community play to its natural strength in creating the hydrogen. A lot of hydrogen's produced today in the world. It's produced to get sulfur out of gasoline    which I find is somewhat ironic. It's produced in the fertilizer industry  it's produced in the chemical manufacturing industry. That hydrogen's being made because there's a good business reason for its use. But it tells us that we know how to create it  we know how to create it cost effectively  we know how to handle it safely. We did an analysis where you would have a station in each city with each of the     largest cities in the United States  and located the stations so you'd be no more than two miles from a station at any time. We put one every    miles on the freeway  and it turns out that translates into about        stations. And at a million dollars each  that would be about    billion dollars. Now that's a lot of money. But if you built the Alaskan pipeline today  that's half of what the Alaskan pipeline would cost. But the real exciting vision that we see truly is home refueling  much like recharging your laptop or recharging your cellphone. So we're pretty excited about the future of hydrogen. We think it's a question of not whether  but a question of when. What we've targeted for ourselves    and we're making great progress for this goal    is to have a propulsion system based on hydrogen and fuel cells  designed and validated  that can go head to head with the internal combustion engine    we're talking about obsoleting the internal combustion engine    and do it in terms of its affordability  add skill volumes  its performance and its durability. So that's what we're driving to for     . We haven't seen anything yet in our development work that says that isn't possible. We actually think the future's going to be event driven. So since we can't predict the future  we want to spend a lot of our time trying to create that future. I'm very  very intrigued by the fact that our cars and trucks sit idle    percent of the time  they're parked  they're parked all around us. They're usually parked within     feet of the people that own them. Now  if you take the power generating capability of an automobile and you compare that to the electric grid in the United States  it turns out that four percent of the automobiles  the power in four percent of the automobiles  equals that of the electric grid of the US. that's a huge power generating capability  a mobile power generating capability. And hydrogen and fuel cells give us that opportunity to actually use our cars and trucks when they're parked to generate electricity for the grid. And we talked about swarm networks earlier. And talking about the ultimate swarm  about having all of the processors and all of the cars when they're sitting idle being part of a global grid for computing capability. We find that premise quite exciting. The automobile becomes  then  an appliance  not in a commodity sense  but an appliance  mobile power  mobile platform for information and computing and communication  as well as a form of transportation. And the key to all of this is to make it affordable  to make it exciting  to get it on a pathway where there's a way to make money doing it. And again  this is a pretty big march to take here. And a lot of people say  how do you sleep at night when you're rustling with a problem of that magnitude  And I tell them I sleep like a baby  I wake up crying every two hours. Actually the theme of this conference  I think  has hit on really one of the major keys to pull that off    and that's relationships and working together. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Larry  Larry  wait  wait  wait  wait  Larry  wait  wait one sec. Just    I've got so many questions I could ask you. I just want to ask one. You know  I could be wrong about this  but my sense is that in the public mind  today  that GM is not viewed as serious about some of these environmental ideas as some of your Japanese competitors  maybe even as Ford. Are you serious about it  and not just  you know  when the consumers want it  when the regulators force us to do it we will go there  Are you guys going to really try and show leadership on this  Larry Burns  Yeah  we're absolutely serious. We're into this over a billion dollars already  so I would hope people would think we're serious when we're spending that kind of money. And secondly  it's a fundamental business proposition. I'll be honest with you  we're into it because of business growth opportunities. We can't grow our business unless we solve these problems. The growth of the auto industry will be capped by sustainability issues if we don't solve the problems. And there's a simple principle of strategy that says  Do unto yourself before others do unto you. If we can see this possible future  others can too. And we want to be the first one to create it  Chris. In       Buckminster Fuller presented the particularly audacious proposal for the Geoscope. It was a     foot diameter geodesic sphere to be suspended over the East River in New York City  in full view of the United Nations. It was a big idea  for sure  and it was one that he felt could truly inform and deeply affect the decision making of this body through animations of global data  trends and other information regarding the globe  on this sphere. And today     years later  we clearly have no less need for this kind of clarity and perspective  but what we do have is improved technology. Today we don't need one million light bulbs to create a spherical display. We can use LEDs. LEDs are smaller  they're cheaper  they're longer lasting  they're more efficient. Most importantly for this  they're faster. And this speed  combined with today's high performance micro controllers  allows us to actually simulate  in this piece  over        LEDs    using just   . And the way this happens is through the phenomenon of persistence of vision. But as this ring rotates at about       rpm    that's    times per second. The equator's speed is actually about    miles per hour. There are four on board micro controllers that  each time this ring rotates it  as it passes the rear of the display  it picks up a position signal. And from that  the on board micro controllers can extrapolate the position of the ring at all points around the revolution and display arbitrary bitmap images and animations. But this is really just the beginning. In addition to higher resolution versions of this display  my father and I are working on a new patent pending design for a fully volumetric display using the same phenomenon. It achieves this by rotating LEDs about two axes. So as you can see here  this is a  eleven inch diameter circuit board. These blocks represent LEDs. And so you could see that as this disc rotates about this axis  it will create a disc of light that we can control. That's nothing new  that's a propeller clock  that's the rims that you can buy for your car. But what is new is that  when we rotate this disc about this axis  this disc of light actually becomes a sphere of light. And so we can control that with micro controllers and create a fully volumetric  three dimensional display with just     LEDs. Now this piece is currently in process    due out in May    but what we've done is we've put together a small demo  just to show the geometric translation of points into a sphere. I've got a little video to show you  but keep in mind that this is with no electronic control  and this is also with only four LEDs. This is actually only about  .  percent of what the final display will be in May. So  take a look. And here you can see it's rotating about the vertical axis only  creating circles. And then  as the other axis kicks in  those actually blur into a volume. And the shutter speed of the camera actually makes it slightly less effective in this case. But this piece is due out in May. It'll be on display at the Interactive Telecommunications Spring Show in Greenwich Village in New York City    that's open to the public  definitely invite you all to come and attend    it's a fantastic show. There are hundreds of student innovators with fantastic projects. This piece  actually  will be on display down in the Sierra Simulcast Lounge in the breaks between now and the end of the show. So I'd love to talk to you all  and invite you to come down and take a closer look. It's an honor to be here. Thanks very much. This is Aunt Zip from Sodom  North Carolina. She was     years old when I took this picture. She was always saying things that made me stop and think  like   Time may be a great healer  but it ain't no beauty specialist.  She said   Be good to your friends. Why  without them  you'd be a total stranger.  This is one of her songs. Let's see if we can get into the flow here and all do this one together. And I'm going to have Michael Manring play bass with me. Give him a big old hand. One  two  three  four. Well  my true love's a black eyed daisy  if I don't see her  I go crazy. My true love lives up the river  a few more jumps and I'll be with her. Hey  hey  black eyed Susie  Hey  hey  black eyed Susie  Hey  hey black eyed Susie  hey. Now you've got to picture Aunt Zip at     years old in Sodom  North Carolina. I'd go up and learn these old songs from her. She couldn't sing much  couldn't play anymore. And I'd pull her out on the front porch. Down below  there was her grandson plowing the tobacco field with a mule. A double outhouse over here on the side. And we'd sing this old song. She didn't have a whole lot of energy  so I'd sing   Hey  hey   and she'd just answer back with   Black eyed Susie.  Oh  hey  hey  black eyed Susie  Hey  hey  black eyed Susie  Hey  hey  black eyed Susie  hey. Well  she and I went blackberry picking. She got mad  I took a licking. Ducks on the millpond  geese in the ocean  Devil in the pretty girl when she takes a notion. Hey  hey  black eyed Susie  Hey  hey  black eyed Susie  Hey  hey black eyed Susie  hey. Let's have the banjo. Well  we'll get married next Thanksgiving. I'll lay around  she'll make a living. She'll cook blackjacks  I'll cook gravy  we'll have chicken someday  maybe. Hey  hey  hey  hey. Hey  hey  black eyed Susie  hey  One more time now. Oh  hey  hey  black eyed Susie  Hey  hey  black eyed Susie  Hey  hey  black eyed Susie  hey. Thank you  Michael. This is Ralph Stanley. When I was going to college at University of California at Santa Barbara in the College of Creative Studies  taking majors in biology and art  he came to the campus. This was in       I guess it was. And he played his bluegrass style of music  but near the end of the concert  he played the old timing style of banjo picking that came from Africa  along with the banjo. It's called claw hammer style  that he had learned from his mother and grandmother. I fell in love with that. I went up to him and said  how can I learn that  He said  well  you can go back to Clinch Mountain  where I'm from  or Asheville or Mount Airy  North Carolina    some place that has a lot of music. Because there's a lot of old people still living that play that old style. So I went back that very summer. I just fell in love with the culture and the people. And you know  I came back to school  I finished my degrees and told my parents I wanted to be a banjo player. You can imagine how excited they were. So I thought I would just like to show you some of the pictures I've taken of some of my mentors. Just a few of them  but maybe you'll get just a little hint of some of these folks. And play a little banjo. Let's do a little medley. Those last few pictures were of Ray Hicks  who just passed away last year. He was one of the great American folk tale tellers. The Old Jack tales that he had learned    he talked like this  you could hardly understand him. But it was really wonderful. And he lived in that house that his great grandfather had built. No running water  no electricity. A wonderful  wonderful guy. And you can look at more pictures. I've actually got a website that's got a bunch of photos that I've done of some of the other folks I didn't get a chance to show you. This instrument came up in those pictures. It's called the mouth bow. It is definitely the first stringed instrument ever in the world  and still played in the Southern mountains. Now  the old timers didn't take a fancy guitar string and make anything like this. They would just take a stick and a catgut and string it up. It was hard on the cats  but it made a great little instrument. It sounds something like this. Well  have you heard the many stories told by young and old with joy about the many deeds of daring that were done by the Johnson boys  You take Kate  I'll take Sal  we'll both have a Johnson gal. You take Kate  I'll take Sal  we'll both have a Johnson gal. Now  they were scouts in the rebels' army  they were known both far and wide. When the Yankees saw them coming  they'd lay down their guns and hide. You take Kate  I'll take Sal  we'll both have a Johnson gal. You take Kate  I'll take Sal  we'll both have a Johnson gal. Ain't that a sound  Well  it was       I guess it was. We were driving in the car outside of Gatesville  Texas  where I grew up in the early part of my life. Outside of Gatesville we were coming back from the grocery store. My mom was driving  my brother and I were in the back seat. We were really mad at my mom. We looked out the window. We were surrounded by thousands of acres of cotton fields. You see  we'd just been to the grocery store  and my mom refused to buy us the jar of Ovaltine that had the coupon for the Captain Midnight decoder ring in it. And  buddy  that made us mad. Well  my mom didn't put up with much either  and she was driving  and she said   You boys  You think you can have anything you want. You don't know how hard it is to earn money. Your dad works so hard. You think money grows on trees. You've never worked a day in your lives. You boys make me so mad. You're going to get a job this summer.  She pulled the car over  she said   Get out of the car.  My brother and I stepped out of the car. We were standing on the edge of thousands of acres of cotton. There were about a hundred black folks out there picking. My mom grabbed us by the shoulders. She marched us out in the field. She went up to the foreman  she said   I've got these two little boys never worked a day in their lives.  Of course  we were just eight and   . She said   Would you put them to work   Well  that must have seemed like a funny idea to that foreman  put these two middle class little white boys out in a cotton field in August in Texas    it's hot. So he gave us each a cotton sack  about    feet long  about that big around  and we started picking. Now  cotton is soft but the outside of the plant is just full of stickers. And if you don't know what you're doing  your hands are bleeding in no time. And my brother and I started to pick it  and our hands were startin' to bleed  and then     Mom   And Mom was just sitting by the car like this. She wasn't going to give up. Well  the foreman could see he was in over his head  I guess. He kind of just snuck up behind us and he sang out in a low voice. He just sang   Well  there's a long white robe in heaven  I know. Don't want it to leave me behind. Well  there's a long white robe in heaven  I know. Don't want it to leave me behind.  And from all around as people started singing and answering back  he sang   Good news  good news  Chariot's coming. Good news  Chariot's coming. Good news  Chariot's coming. And I don't want it to leave me behind.  Now  my brother and I had never heard anything like that in our whole lives. It was so beautiful. We sat there all day picking cotton  without complaining  without crying  while they sang things like   Oh  Mary  don't you weep  don't you moan  and  Wade in the water   and  I done done    This little light of mine.  Finally  by the end of the day  we'd each picked about a quarter of a bag of cotton. But the foreman was kind enough to give us each a check for a dollar  but my mother would never let us cash it. I'm     still have the check. Now  my mother hoped that we learned from that the value of hard work. But if you have children  you know it doesn't often work that way. No  we learned something else. The first thing I learned that day was that I never ever wanted to work that hard again. And pretty much never did. But I also learned that some people in this world do have to work that hard every day  and that was an eye opener. And I also learned that a great song can make hard work go a little easier. And it also can bring the group together in a way that nothing else can. Now  I was just a little eight year old boy that day when my mama put me out of the car in that hot Texas cotton field. I wasn't even aware of music    not even aware of it. But that day in the cotton field out there picking  when those people started singing  I realized I was in the very heart of real music  and that's where I've wanted to be ever since. Try this old song with me. I sing  Well  there's a long white robe in heaven  I know. You sing  Don't want it to leave me behind. Well  there's a long white robe in heaven  I know. Don't want it to leave me behind. Good news  good news  Chariot's coming. Good news  Chariot's coming. Good news  Chariot's coming. And I don't want it to leave me    It's been a while since you guys have been picking your last bale of cotton  isn't it  Let's try it one more time. There's a starry crown in heaven  I know. Don't want it to leave me behind. There's a starry crown in heaven  I know. Don't want it to leave me behind. Good news  Chariot's coming. Good news  Chariot's coming. Good news  Chariot's coming. And I don't want it to leave me behind. It was a few years ago  but I sort of remembered this story  and I told it at a concert. My mom was in the audience. After the    she was glad to have a story about herself  of course  but after the concert she came up and she said   David  I've got to tell you something. I set that whole thing up. I set it up with the foreman. I set it up with the owner of the land. I just wanted you boys to learn the value of hard work. I didn't know it was going to make you fall in love with music though.  Let's try. Good news  Chariot's coming. Good news  Chariot's coming. Good news  Chariot's coming. And I don't want it to leave me behind. Well  this is the steel guitar. It's an American made instrument. It was originally made by the Dopyera Brothers  who later on made the Dobro  which is a wood bodied instrument with a metal cone for    where the sound comes from. It's usually played flat on your lap. It was made to play Hawaiian music back in the     s  before they had electric guitars  trying to make a loud guitar. And then African American folks figured out you could take a broken bottle neck  just like that    a nice Merlot works very well. That wine we had yesterday would have been perfect. Break it off  put it on your finger  and slide into the notes. This instrument pretty much saved my life. Fifteen years ago     years ago  I guess  this year  my wife and I lost our daughter  Sarah Jane  in a car accident  and it was the most    it almost took me out    it almost took me out of this world. And I think I learned a lot about what happiness was by going through such unbelievable grief  just standing on the edge of that abyss and just wanting to jump in. I had to make lists of reasons to stay alive. I had to sit down and make lists  because I was ready to go  I was ready to check out of this world. And you know  at the top of the list  of course  were Jenny  and my son  Zeb  my parents    I didn't want to hurt them. But then  when I thought about it beyond that  it was very simple things. I didn't care about    I had a radio show  I have a radio show on public radio   Riverwalk   I didn't care about that. I didn't care about awards or money or anything. Nothing. Nothing. On the list it would be stuff like  seeing the daffodils bloom in the spring  the smell of new mown hay  catching a wave and bodysurfing  the touch of a baby's hand  the sound of Doc Watson playing the guitar  listening to old records of Muddy Waters and Uncle Dave Macon. And for me  the sound of a steel guitar  because one of my parents' neighbors just gave me one of these things. And I would sit around with it  and I didn't know how to play it  but I would just play stuff as sad as I could play. And it was the only instrument that  of all the ones that I play  that would really make that connection. This is a song that came out of that. Well  I hear you're having trouble. Lord  I hate to hear that news. If you want to talk about it  you know  I will listen to you through. Words no longer say it  let me tell you what I always do. I just break off another bottleneck and play these steel guitar blues. People say   Oh  snap out of it   Oh yeah  that's easier said than done. While you can hardly move  they're running around having all kinds of fun. Sometimes I think it's better just to sink way down in your funky mood 'til you can rise up humming these steel guitar blues. Now  you can try to keep it all inside with drink and drugs and cigarettes  but you know that's not going to get you where you want to get. But I got some medicine here that just might shake things loose. Call me in the morning after a dose of these steel guitar blues. Open up now. Oh  I think I've got time to tell you about this. My dad was an inventor. We moved to California when Sputnik went up  in     . And he was working on gyroscopes  he has a number of patents for that kind of thing. And we moved across the street from Michael and John Whitney. They were about my age. John went on  and Michael did too  to become some of the inventors of computer animation. Michael's dad was working on something called the computer. This was       I was a little    year old kid  I didn't know what that was. But he took me down to see one  you know  what they were making. It was like a library  just full of vacuum tubes as far as you could see  just floors and floors of these things  and one of the engineers said  some day you're going to be able to put this thing in your pocket. I thought  damn  those are going to be some big pants  So that Christmas    maybe I've got time for this    that Christmas I got the Mister Wizard Fun o Rama chemistry set. Well  I wanted to be an inventor just like my dad  so did Michael. His great granddad had been Eli Whitney  the inventor of the cotton gin. So we looked in that    this was a commercial chemistry set. It had three chemicals we were really surprised to see  sulfur  potassium nitrate and charcoal. Man  we were only     but we knew that made gunpowder. We made up a little batch and we put it on the driveway and we threw a match and phew  it flared up. Ah  it was great. Well  obviously the next thing to do was build a cannon. So we went over into Michael's garage    his dad had all kinds of stuff  and we put a pipe in the vice there  and screwed a cap on the end of the pipe  drilled a hole in the back of the pipe  took some of our firecrackers  pulled out the fuses  tied them together  put them in the back there  and    down in that hole    and then stuffed some of our gunpowder down that pipe and put three ball bearings on the top  in the garage. We weren't stupid  we put up a sheet of plywood about five feet in front of it. We stood back  we lit that thing  and they flew out of there    they went through that plywood like it was paper. Through the garage. Two of them landed in the side door of his new Citroen. We tore everything down and buried it in his backyard. That was Pacific Palisades  it probably is still there  back there. Well  my brother heard that we had made gunpowder. He and his buddies  they were older  and they were pretty mean. They said they were going to beat us up if we didn't make some gunpowder for them. We said  well  what are you going to do with it  They said  we're going to melt it down and make rocket fuel. Sure. We'll make you a big batch. So we made them a big batch  and it was in my    now  we'd just moved here. We'd just moved to California. Mom had redone the kitchen  Mom was gone that day. We had a pie tin. It became Chris Berquist's job to do the melting down. Michael and I were standing way at the side of the kitchen. He said   Yeah  hey  it's melting. Yeah  the sulfur's melting. No problem. Yeah  you know.  It just flared up  and he turned around  and he looked like this. No hair  no eyelashes  no nothing. There were big welts all over my mom's kitchen cabinet  the air was the just full of black smoke. She came home  she took that chemistry set away  and we never saw it again. But we thought of it often  because every time she'd cook tuna surprise it made    tasted faintly of gunpowder. So I like to invent things too  and I think I'll close out my set with something I invented a good while back. When drum machines were new  I got to thinking  why couldn't you take the oldest form of music  the hambone rhythms  and combine it with the newest technology  I call this Thunderwear. At that time  drum triggers were new. And so I put them all together and sewed    of them in this suit. I showed you some of the hambone rhythms yesterday  I'm going to be doing some of the same ones. I have a trigger here  trigger here  here  here. Right there. It's going to really hurt if I don't take that off. Okay. Now  the drum triggers go out my tail here  into the drum machine  and they can make various sounds  like drums. So let me put them all together. And also  I can change the sounds by stepping on this pedal right here  and    let me just close out here by doing you a little hambone solo or something like this. Thank you  folks. So I understand that this meeting was planned  and the slogan was From Was to Still. And I am illustrating Still. Which  of course  I am not agreeing with because  although I am     I am not still working. And anybody who asks me   Are you still doing this or that   I don't answer because I'm not doing things still  I'm doing it like I always did. I still have    or did I use the word still  I didn't mean that. I have my file which is called To Do. I have my plans. I have my clients. I am doing my work like I always did. So this takes care of my age. I want to show you my work so you know what I am doing and why I am here. This was about     . All of these things were made during the last    years. But  of course  I'm working since     doing more or less what you see here. This is Castleton China. This was an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art. This is now for sale at the Metropolitan Museum. This is still at the Metropolitan Museum now for sale. This is a portrait of my daughter and myself. These were just some of the things I've made. I made hundreds of them for the last    years. I call myself a maker of things. I don't call myself an industrial designer because I'm other things. Industrial designers want to make novel things. Novelty is a concept of commerce  not an aesthetic concept. The industrial design magazine  I believe  is called  Innovation.  Innovation is not part of the aim of my work. Well  makers of things  they make things more beautiful  more elegant  more comfortable than just the craftsmen do. I have so much to say. I have to think what I am going to say. Well  to describe our profession otherwise  we are actually concerned with the playful search for beauty. That means the playful search for beauty was called the first activity of Man. Sarah Smith  who was a mathematics professor at MIT  wrote   The playful search for beauty was Man's first activity    that all useful qualities and all material qualities were developed from the playful search for beauty.  These are tiles. The word   playful  is a necessary aspect of our work because  actually  one of our problems is that we have to make  produce  lovely things throughout all of life  and this for me is now    years. So how can you  without drying up  make things with the same pleasure  as a gift to others  for so long  The playful is therefore an important part of our quality as designer. Let me tell you some about my life. As I said  I started to do these things    years ago. My first exhibition in the United States was at the Sesquicentennial exhibition in         that the Hungarian government sent one of my hand drawn pieces as part of the exhibit. My work actually took me through many countries  and showed me a great part of the world. This is not that they took me    the work didn't take me    I made the things particularly because I wanted to use them to see the world. I was incredibly curious to see the world  and I made all these things  which then finally did take me to see many countries and many cultures. I started as an apprentice to a Hungarian craftsman  and this taught me what the guild system was in Middle Ages. The guild system  that means when I was an apprentice  I had to apprentice myself in order to become a pottery master. In my shop where I studied  or learned  there was a traditional hierarchy of master  journeyman and learned worker  and apprentice  and I worked as the apprentice. The work as an apprentice was very primitive. That means I had to actually learn every aspect of making pottery by hand. We mashed the clay with our feet when it came from the hillside. After that  it had to be kneaded. It had to then go in  kind of  a mangle. And then finally it was prepared for the throwing. And there I really worked as an apprentice. My master took me to set ovens because this was part of oven making  oven setting  in the time. And finally  I had received a document that I had accomplished my apprenticeship successfully  that I had behaved morally  and this document was given to me by the Guild of Roof Coverers  Rail Diggers  Oven Setters  Chimney Sweeps and Potters. I also got at the time a workbook which explained my rights and my working conditions  and I still have that workbook. First I set up a shop in my own garden  and made pottery which I sold on the marketplace in Budapest. And there I was sitting  and my then boyfriend    I didn't mean it was a boyfriend like it is meant today    but my boyfriend and I sat at the market and sold the pots. My mother thought that this was not very proper  so she sat with us to add propriety to this activity. However  after a while there was a new factory being built in Budapest  a pottery factory  a large one. And I visited it with several ladies  and asked all sorts of questions of the director. Then the director asked me  why do you ask all these questions  I said  I also have a pottery. So he asked me  could he please visit me  and then finally he did  and explained to me that what I did now in my shop was an anachronism  that the industrial revolution had broken out  and that I rather should join the factory. There he made an art department for me where I worked for several months. However  everybody in the factory spent his time at the art department. The director there said there were several women casting and producing my designs now in molds  and this was sold also to America. I remember that it was quite successful. However  the director  the chemist  model maker    everybody    concerned himself much more with the art department    that means  with my work    than making toilets  so finally they got a letter from the center  from the bank who owned the factory  saying  make toilet setting behind the art department  and that was my end. So this gave me the possibility because now I was a journeyman  and journeymen also take their satchel and go to see the world. So as a journeyman  I put an ad into the paper that I had studied  that I was a down to earth potter's journeyman and I was looking for a job as a journeyman. And I got several answers  and I accepted the one which was farthest from home and practically  I thought  halfway to America. And that was in Hamburg. Then I first took this job in Hamburg  at an art pottery where everything was done on the wheel  and so I worked in a shop where there were several potters. And the first day  I was coming to take my place at the turntable    there were three or four turntables    and one of them  behind where I was sitting  was a hunchback  a deaf mute hunchback  who smelled very bad. So I doused him in cologne every day  which he thought was very nice  and therefore he brought bread and butter every day  which I had to eat out of courtesy. The first day I came to work in this shop there was on my wheel a surprise for me. My colleagues had thoughtfully put on the wheel where I was supposed to work a very nicely modeled natural man's organs. After I brushed them off with a hand motion  they were very    I finally was now accepted  and worked there for some six months. This was my first job. If I go on like this  you will be here till midnight. So I will try speed it up a little Moderator  Eva  we have about five minutes. Eva Zeisel  Are you sure  Moderator  Yes  I am sure. EZ  Well  if you are sure  I have to tell you that within five minutes I will talk very fast. And actually  my work took me to many countries because I used my work to fill my curiosity. And among other things  other countries I worked  was in the Soviet Union  where I worked from '   to '      actually  to '  . I was finally there  although I had nothing to do    I was a foreign expert. I became art director of the china and glass industry  and eventually under Stalin's purges    at the beginning of Stalin's purges  I didn't know that hundreds of thousands of innocent people were arrested. So I was arrested quite early in Stalin's purges  and spent    months in a Russian prison. The accusation was that I had successfully prepared an Attentat on Stalin's life. This was a very dangerous accusation. And if this is the end of my five minutes  I want to tell you that I actually did survive  which was a surprise. But since I survived and I'm here  and since this is the end of the five minutes  I will    Moderator  Tell me when your last trip to Russia was. Weren't you there recently  EZ  Oh  this summer  in fact  the Lomonosov factory was bought by an American company  invited me. They found out that I had worked in '   at this factory  and they came to my studio in Rockland County  and brought the    of their artists to visit me here. And they invited myself to come to the Russian factory last summer  in July  to make some dishes  design some dishes. And since I don't like to travel alone  they also invited my daughter  son in law and granddaughter  so we had a lovely trip to see Russia today  which is not a very pleasant and happy view. Here I am now  if this is the end  Thank you. What I'd like you to do is  just really quickly  is just  sort of  nod to the person on your right  and then nod to the person on your left. Now  chances are that over the last winter  if you had been a beehive  either you or one of the two people you just nodded at would have died. Now  that's an awful lot of bees. And this is the second year in a row we have lost over    percent of the colonies  or we estimate we've lost    percent of the colonies over the winter. Now  that's a lot  a lot of bees  and that's really important. And most of those losses are because of things we know. We know that there are these varroa mites that have introduced and caused a lot of losses  and we also have this new phenomenon  which I talked about last year  Colony Collapse Disorder. And here we see a picture on top of a hill in Central Valley last December. And below  you can see all these out yards  or temporary yards  where the colonies are brought in until February  and then they're shipped out to the almonds. And one documentary writer  who was here and looked at this two months after I was here  described this not as beehives but as a graveyard  with these empty white boxes with no bees left in them. Now  I'm going to sum up a year's worth of work in two sentences to say that we have been trying to figure out what the cause of this is. And what we know is that it's as if the bees have caught a flu. And this flu has wiped through the population of bees. In some cases  and in fact in most cases in one year  this flu was caused by a new virus to us  or newly identified by us  called Israeli Acute Paralysis virus. It was called that because a guy in Israel first found it  and he now regrets profoundly calling it that disease  because  of course  there's the implication. But we think this virus is pretty ubiquitous. It's also pretty clear that the bees sometimes catch other viruses or other flus  and so the question we're still struggling with  and the question that keeps us up at night  is why have the bees suddenly become so susceptible to this flu  and why are they so susceptible to these other diseases  And we don't have the answer to that yet  and we spend a lot of time trying to figure that out. We think perhaps it's a combination of factors. We know from the work of a very large and dynamic working team that  you know  we're finding a lot of different pesticides in the hive  and surprisingly  sometimes the healthiest hives have the most pesticides. And so we discover all these very strange things that we can't begin to understand. And so this opens up the whole idea of looking at colony health. Now of course  if you lose a lot of colonies  beekeepers can replace them very quickly. And that's why we've been able to recover from a lot of loss. If we lost one in every three cows in the winter  you know  the National Guard would be out. But what beekeepers can do is  if they have one surviving colony  they can split that colony in two. And then the one half that doesn't have a queen  they can buy a queen. It comes in the mail  it can come from Australia or Hawaii or Florida  and you can introduce that queen. And in fact  America was the first country that ever did mail delivery queens and in fact  it's part of the postal code that you have to deliver queens by mail in order to make sure that we have enough bees in this country. If you don't just want a queen  you can buy  actually  a three pound package of bees  which comes in the mail  and of course  the Postal Office is always very concerned when they get  you know  your three pound packages of bees. And you can install this in your hive and replace that dead out. So it means that beekeepers are very good at replacing dead outs  and so they've been able to cover those losses. So even though we've lost    percent of the colonies every year  the same number of colonies have existed in the country  at about  .  million colonies. Now  those losses are tragic on many fronts  and one of those fronts is for the beekeeper. And it's really important to talk about beekeepers first  because beekeepers are among the most fascinating people you'll ever meet. If this was a group of beekeepers  you would have everyone from the card carrying NRA member who's  you know  live free or die  to the  you know  the self expressed quirky San Francisco backyard pig farmer. And you get all of these people in the same room  and they're all engaged and they're getting along  and they're all there because of the passion for bees. Now  there's another part of that community which are the commercial beekeepers  the ones who make their livelihood from beekeeping alone. And these tend to be some of the most independent  tenacious  intuitive  you know  inventive people you will ever meet. They're just fascinating. And they're like that all over the world. I had the privilege of working in Haiti just for two weeks earlier this year. And Haiti  if you've ever been there  is just a tragedy. I mean  there may be     explanations for why Haiti is the impoverished nation it is  but there is no excuse to see that sort of squalor. But you meet this beekeeper  and I met this beekeeper here  and he is one of the most knowledgeable beekeepers I've ever met. No formal education  but very knowledgeable. We needed beeswax for a project we were working on  he was so capable  he was able to render the nicest block of beeswax I have ever seen from cow dung  tin cans and his veil  which he used as a screening  right in this meadow. And so that ingenuity is inspiring. We also have Dave Hackenberg  who is the poster child of CCD. He's the one who first identified this condition and raised the alarm bells. And he has a history of these trucks  and he's moved these bees up and down the coast. And a lot of people talk about trucks and moving bees  and that being bad  but we've done that for thousands of years. The ancient Egyptians used to move bees up and down the Nile on rafts  so this idea of a movable bee force is not new at all. And one of our real worries with Colony Collapse Disorder is the fact that it costs so much money to replace those dead out colonies. And you can do that one year in a row  you may be able to do it two years in a row. But if you're losing    percent to    percent of your colonies  you can't survive three years in a row. And we're really worried about losing this segment of our industry. And that's important for many fronts  and one of them is because of that culture that's in agriculture. And these migratory beekeepers are the last nomads of America. You know  they pick up their hives  they move their families once or twice in a year. And if you look at Florida  in Dade City  Florida  that's where all the Pennsylvania beekeepers go. And then    miles down the road is Groveland  and that's where all the Wisconsin beekeepers go. And if you're ever in Central Valley in February  you go to this caf  at    o'clock in the morning  Kathy and Kate's. And that's where all the beekeepers come after a night of moving bees into the almond groves. They all have their breakfast and complain about everyone right there. And it's a great experience  and I really encourage you to drop in at that diner during that time  because that's quite essential American experience. And we see these families  these nomadic families  you know  father to son  father to son  and these guys are hurting. And they're not people who like to ask for help  although they are the most helpful people ever. If there's one guy who loses all his bees because of a truck overhaul  everyone pitches in and gives    hives to help him replace those lost colonies. And so  it's a very dynamic  and I think  historic and exciting community to be involved with. Of course  the real importance for bees is not the honey. And although I highly encourage you  all use honey. I mean  it's the most ethical sweetener  and you know  it's a dynamic and fun sweetener. But we estimate that about one in three bites of food we eat is directly or indirectly pollinated by honeybees. Now  I want to just illustrate that in the fact that if we look at the breakfast I had yesterday morning    a little cranberry juice  some fruits  some granola  I should have had whole wheat bread  I realized  but you know  jam on my Wonderbread  and some coffee    and had we taken out all those ingredients     except for the almonds I wasn't going to pick out from the granola    if we had taken out all those ingredients the bees had indirectly or directly pollinated  we wouldn't have much on our plate. So if we did not have bees  it's not like we would starve  but clearly our diet would be diminished. It's said that for bees  the flower is the fountain of life  and for flowers bees are the messengers of love. And that's a really great expression  because really  bees are the sex workers for flowers. They are  you know    they get paid for their services. They get paid by pollen and nectar  to move that male sperm  the pollen  from flower to flower. And there are flowers that are self infertile. That means they can't    the pollen in their bloom can't fertilize themselves. So in an apple orchard  for instance  you'll have rows of    apples of one variety  and then you have another apple tree that's a different type of pollen. And bees are very faithful. When they're out pollinating or gathering pollen from one flower  they stay to that crop exclusively  in order to help generate. And of course  they're made to carry this pollen. They build up a static electric charge and the pollen jumps on them and helps spread that pollen from bloom to bloom. However  honeybees are a minority. Honeybees are not native to America  they were introduced with the colonialists. And there are actually more species of bees than there are mammals and birds combined. In Pennsylvania alone  we have been surveying bees for     years  and very intensely in the last three years. We have identified over     species of bees in Pennsylvania. Thirty two species have not been identified or found in the state since     . Now  that could be because we haven't been sampling right  but it does  I think  suggest that something's wrong with the pollinator force. And these bees are fascinating. We have bumblebees on the top. And bumblebees are what we call eusocial  they're not truly social  because only the queen is  over winter. We also have the sweat bees  and these are little gems flying around. They're like tiny little flies and they fly around. And then you have another type of bee  which we call kleptoparasites  which is a very fancy way of saying  bad minded  murdering    what's the word I'm looking for  Murdering    Audience  Bee  Dennis vanEngelsdorp  Bee. Okay  thanks. What these bees do is  they sit there. These solitary bees  they drill a hole in the ground or drill a hole in a branch  and they collect pollen and make it into a ball  and they lay an egg on it. Well  these bees hang out at that hole  and they wait for that mother to fly away  they go in  eat the egg  and lay their own egg there. So they don't do any work. And so  in fact  if you know you have these kleptoparasitic bees  you know that your environment is healthy  because they're top of the food chain bees. And in fact  there is now a red list of pollinators that we're worried have disappeared  and on top of that list are a lot of these kleptoparasites  but also these bumblebees. And in fact  if you guys live on the West Coast  go to these websites here  and they're really looking for people to look for some of these bumblebees  because we think some have gone extinct. Or some  the population has declined. And so it's not just honeybees that are in trouble  but we don't understand these native pollinators or all those other parts of our community. And of course  bees are not the only important factor here. There are other animals that pollinate  like bats  and bats are in trouble too. And I'm glad I'm a bee man and not a bat man  because there's no money to research the bat problems. And bats are dying at an extraordinary rate. White nose syndrome has wiped out populations of bats. If there's a cave in New York that had        bats in it  and there are       left. That's like San Francisco becoming the population of half of this county in three years. And so that's incredible. And there's no money to do that. But I'm glad to say that I think we know the cause of all these conditions  and that cause is NDD  Nature Deficit Disorder. And that is that I think that what we have in our society is  we forgot our connection with nature. And I think if we reconnect to nature  we'll be able to have the resources and that interest to solve these problems. And I think that there is an easy cure for NDD. And that is  make meadows and not lawns. And I think we have lost our connection  and this is a wonderful way of reconnecting to our environment. I've had the privilege of living by a meadow for the last little while  and it is terribly engaging. And if we look at the history of lawns  it's actually rather tragic. It used to be  two  three hundred years ago  that a lawn was a symbol of prestige  and so it was only the very rich that could keep these green actually  deserts  they're totally sterile. Americans spent  in            percent of all pesticide use was done on lawns. Five percent of our greenhouse gases are produced by mowing our lawns. And so it's incredible the amount of resources we've spent keeping our lawns  which are these useless biosystems. And so we need to rethink this idea. In fact  you know  the White House used to have sheep in front in order to help fund the war effort in World War I  which probably is not a bad idea  it wouldn't be a bad idea. I want to say this not because I'm opposed completely to mowing lawns. I think that there is perhaps some advantage to keeping lawns at a limited scale  and I think we're encouraged to do that. But I also want to reinforce some of the ideas we've heard here  because having a meadow or living by a meadow is transformational. That it is amazing that connection we can have with what's there. These milkweed plants have grown up in my meadow over the last four years. Add to watch the different plants  or insects  that come to these flowers  to watch that    and we've heard about  you know  this relationship you can have with wine  this companion you can have as it matures and as it has these different fragrances. And this is a companion  and this is a relationship that never dries up. You never run out of that companion as you drink this wine  too. And I encourage you to look at that. Now  not all of us have meadows  or lawns that we can convert  and so you can always  of course  grow a meadow in a pot. Bees apparently  can be the gateway to  you know  other things. So I'm not saying that you should plant a meadow of pot  but a pot in a meadow. But you can also have this great community of city or building top beekeepers  these beekeepers that live    This is in Paris where these beekeepers live. And everyone should open a beehive  because it is the most amazing  incredible thing. And if we want to cure ourselves of NDD  or Nature Deficit Disorder  I think this is a great way of doing it. Get a beehive and grow a meadow  and watch that life come back into your life. And so with that  I think that what we can do  if we do this  we can make sure that our future    our more perfect future    includes beekeepers and it includes bees and it includes those meadows. And that journey    that journey of transformation that occurs as you grow your meadow and as you keep your bees or you watch those native bees there    is an extremely exciting one. And I hope that you experience it and I hope you tell me about it one day. So thank you very much for being here.  Thank you very much. These rocks have been hitting our earth for about three billion years  and are responsible for much of what s gone on on our planet. This is an example of a real meteorite  and you can see all the melting of the iron from the speed and the heat when a meteorite hits the earth  and just how much of it survives and melts. From a meteorite from space  we re over here with an original Sputnik. This is one of the seven surviving Sputniks that was not launched into space. This is not a copy. The space age began    years ago in October  and that s exactly what Sputnik looked like. And it wouldn t be fun to talk about the space age without seeing a flag that was carried to the moon and back  on Apollo   . The astronauts each got to carry about ten silk flags in their personal kits. They would bring them back and mount them. So this has actually been carried to the moon and back. So that s for fun. The dawn of books is  of course  important. And it wouldn t be interesting to talk about the dawn of books without having a copy of a Guttenberg Bible. You can see how portable and handy it was to have your own Guttenberg in     . But what s interesting about the Guttenberg Bible  and the dawn of this technology  is not the book. You see  the book was not driven by reading. In       nobody could read. So why did the printing press succeed  This is an original page of a Guttenberg Bible. So you re looking here at one of the first printed books using movable type in the history of man      years ago. We are living at the age here at the end of the book  where electronic paper will undoubtedly replace it. But why is this so interesting  Here s the quick story. It turns out that in the     s  the Catholic Church needed money  and so they actually hand wrote these things called indulgences  which were forgiveness s on pieces of paper. They traveled all around Europe and sold by the hundreds or by the thousands. They got you out of purgatory faster. And when the printing press was invented what they found was they could print indulgences  which was the equivalent of printing money. And so all of Western Europe started buying printing presses in         to print out thousands  and then hundreds of thousands  and then ultimately millions of single  small pieces of paper that got you out of middle hell and into heaven. That is why the printing press succeeded  and that is why Martin Luther nailed his    theses to the door  because he was complaining that the Catholic Church had gone amok in printing out indulgences and selling them in every town and village and city in all of Western Europe. So the printing press  ladies and gentlemen  was driven entirely by the printing of forgivenesses and had nothing to do with reading. More tomorrow. I also have pictures coming of the library for those of you that have asked for pictures. We re going to have some tomorrow. Instead of showing an object from the stage I m going to do something special for the first time. We are going to show  actually  what the library looks like  OK  So  I am married to the most wonderful woman in the world. You re going to find out why in a minute  because when I went to see Eileen  this is what I said I wanted to build. This is the Library of Human Imagination. The room itself is three stories tall. In the glass panels are       years of human imagination that are computer controlled. The room is a theatre. It changes colors. And all throughout the library are different objects  different spaces. It s designed like an Escher print. Here is some of the lower level of the library  where the exhibits constantly change. You can walk through. You can touch. You can see exactly how many of these types of items would fit in a room. There s my very own Saturn V. Everybody should have one  OK   Laughter  So you can see here in the lower level of the library the books and the objects. In the glass panels all along is sort of the history of imagination. There is a glass bridge that you walk across that s suspended in space. So it s a leap of imagination. How do we create  Part of the question that I have answered is  is we create by surrounding ourselves with stimuli  with human achievement  with history  with the things that drive us and make us human    the passionate discovery  the bones of dinosaurs long gone  the maps of space that we ve experienced  and ultimately the hallways that stimulate our mind and our imagination. So hopefully tomorrow I ll show one or two more objects from the stage  but for today I just wanted to say thank you for all the people that came and talked to us about it. And Eileen and I are thrilled to open our home and share it with the TED community. TED is all about patterns in the clouds. It s all about connections. It s all about seeing things that everybody else has seen before but thinking about them in ways that nobody has thought of them before. And that s really what discovery and imagination is all about. For example  we can look at a DNA molecule model here. None of us really have ever seen one  but we know it exists because we ve been taught to understand this molecule. But we can also look at an Enigma machine from the Nazis in World War II that was a coding and decoding machine. Now  you might say  what does this have to do with this  Well  this is the code for life  and this is a code for death. These two molecules code and decode. And yet  looking at them  you would see a machine and a molecule. But once you ve seen them in a new way  you realize that both of these things really are connected. And they re connected primarily because of this here. You see  this is a human brain model  OK  And it s rare  because we never really get to see a brain. We get to see a skull. But there it is. All of imagination    everything that we think  we feel  we sense    comes through the human brain. And once we create new patterns in this brain  once we shape the brain in a new way  it never returns to its original shape. And I ll give you a quick example. We think about the Internet  we think about information that goes across the Internet. And we never think about the hidden connection. But I brought along here a lump of coal    right here  one lump of coal. And what does a lump of coal have to do with the Internet  You see  it takes the energy in one lump of coal to move one megabyte of information across the net. So every time you download a file  each megabyte is a lump of coal. What that means is  a     megabyte file looks like this  ladies and gentlemen. OK  So the next time you download a gigabyte  or two gigabytes  it s not for free  OK  The connection is the energy it takes to run the web   and to make everything we think possible  possible. Thanks  Chris. We all make decisions every day  we want to know what the right thing is to do    in domains from the financial to the gastronomic to the professional to the romantic. And surely  if somebody could really tell us how to do exactly the right thing at all possible times  that would be a tremendous gift. It turns out that  in fact  the world was given this gift in      by a Dutch polymath named Daniel Bernoulli. And what I want to talk to you about today is what that gift is  and I also want to explain to you why it is that it hasn't made a damn bit of difference. Now  this is Bernoulli's gift. This is a direct quote. And if it looks like Greek to you  it's because  well  it's Greek. But the simple English translation    much less precise  but it captures the gist of what Bernoulli had to say    was this  The expected value of any of our actions    that is  the goodness that we can count on getting    is the product of two simple things  the odds that this action will allow us to gain something  and the value of that gain to us. In a sense  what Bernoulli was saying is  if we can estimate and multiply these two things  we will always know precisely how we should behave. Now  this simple equation  even for those of you who don't like equations  is something that you're quite used to. Here's an example  if I were to tell you  let's play a little coin toss game  and I'm going to flip a coin  and if it comes up heads  I'm going to pay you    dollars  but you have to pay four dollars for the privilege of playing with me  most of you would say  sure  I'll take that bet. Because you know that the odds of you winning are one half  the gain if you do is    dollars  that multiplies to five  and that's more than I'm charging you to play. So  the answer is  yes. This is what statisticians technically call a damn fine bet. Now  the idea is simple when we're applying it to coin tosses  but in fact  it's not very simple in everyday life. People are horrible at estimating both of these things  and that's what I want to talk to you about today. There are two kinds of errors people make when trying to decide what the right thing is to do  and those are errors in estimating the odds that they're going to succeed  and errors in estimating the value of their own success. Now  let me talk about the first one first. Calculating odds would seem to be something rather easy  there are six sides to a die  two sides to a coin     cards in a deck. You all know what the likelihood is of pulling the ace of spades or of flipping a heads. But as it turns out  this is not a very easy idea to apply in everyday life. That's why Americans spend more    I should say  lose more    gambling than on all other forms of entertainment combined. The reason is  this isn't how people do odds. The way people figure odds requires that we first talk a bit about pigs. Now  the question I'm going to put to you is whether you think there are more dogs or pigs on leashes observed in any particular day in Oxford. And of course  you all know that the answer is dogs. And the way that you know that the answer is dogs is you quickly reviewed in memory the times you've seen dogs and pigs on leashes. It was very easy to remember seeing dogs  not so easy to remember pigs. And each one of you assumed that if dogs on leashes came more quickly to your mind  then dogs on leashes are more probable. That's not a bad rule of thumb  except when it is. So  for example  here's a word puzzle. Are there more four letter English words with R in the third place or R in the first place  Well  you check memory very briefly  make a quick scan  and it's awfully easy to say to yourself  Ring  Rang  Rung  and very hard to say to yourself  Pare  Park  they come more slowly. But in fact  there are many more words in the English language with R in the third than the first place. The reason words with R in the third place come slowly to your mind isn't because they're improbable  unlikely or infrequent. It's because the mind recalls words by their first letter. You kind of shout out the sound  S    and the word comes. It's like the dictionary  it's hard to look things up by the third letter. So  this is an example of how this idea that the quickness with which things come to mind can give you a sense of their probability    how this idea could lead you astray. It's not just puzzles  though. For example  when Americans are asked to estimate the odds that they will die in a variety of interesting ways    these are estimates of number of deaths per year per     million U.S. citizens. And these are just ordinary people like yourselves who are asked to guess how many people die from tornado  fireworks  asthma  drowning  etc. Compare these to the actual numbers. Now  you see a very interesting pattern here  which is first of all  two things are vastly over estimated  namely tornadoes and fireworks. Two things are vastly underestimated  dying by drowning and dying by asthma. Why  When was the last time that you picked up a newspaper and the headline was   Boy dies of Asthma   It's not interesting because it's so common. It's very easy for all of us to bring to mind instances of news stories or newsreels where we've seen tornadoes devastating cities  or some poor schmuck who's blown his hands off with a firework on the Fourth of July. Drownings and asthma deaths don't get much coverage. They don't come quickly to mind  and as a result  we vastly underestimate them. Indeed  this is kind of like the Sesame Street game of  Which thing doesn't belong   And you're right to say it's the swimming pool that doesn't belong  because the swimming pool is the only thing on this slide that's actually very dangerous. The way that more of you are likely to die than the combination of all three of the others that you see on the slide. The lottery is an excellent example  of course    an excellent test case of people's ability to compute probabilities. And economists    forgive me  for those of you who play the lottery    but economists  at least among themselves  refer to the lottery as a stupidity tax  because the odds of getting any payoff by investing your money in a lottery ticket are approximately equivalent to flushing the money directly down the toilet    which  by the way  doesn't require that you actually go to the store and buy anything. Why in the world would anybody ever play the lottery  Well  there are many answers  but one answer surely is  we see a lot of winners. Right  When this couple wins the lottery  or Ed McMahon shows up at your door with this giant check    how the hell do you cash things that size  I don't know. We see this on TV  we read about it in the paper. When was the last time that you saw extensive interviews with everybody who lost  Indeed  if we required that television stations run a    second interview with each loser every time they interview a winner  the     million losers in the last lottery would require nine and a half years of your undivided attention just to watch them say   Me  I lost.   Me  I lost.  Now  if you watch nine and a half years of television    no sleep  no potty breaks    and you saw loss after loss after loss  and then at the end there's    seconds of   and I won   the likelihood that you would play the lottery is very small. Look  I can prove this to you  here's a little lottery. There's    tickets in this lottery. Nine of them have been sold to these individuals. It costs you a dollar to buy the ticket and  if you win  you get    bucks. Is this a good bet  Well  Bernoulli tells us it is. The expected value of this lottery is two dollars  this is a lottery in which you should invest your money. And most people say   OK  I'll play.  Now  a slightly different version of this lottery  imagine that the nine tickets are all owned by one fat guy named Leroy. Leroy has nine tickets  there's one left. Do you want it  Most people won't play this lottery. Now  you can see the odds of winning haven't changed  but it's now fantastically easy to imagine who's going to win. It's easy to see Leroy getting the check  right  You can't say to yourself   I'm as likely to win as anybody   because you're not as likely to win as Leroy. The fact that all those tickets are owned by one guy changes your decision to play  even though it does nothing whatsoever to the odds. Now  estimating odds  as difficult as it may seem  is a piece of cake compared to trying to estimate value  trying to say what something is worth  how much we'll enjoy it  how much pleasure it will give us. I want to talk now about errors in value. How much is this Big Mac worth  Is it worth    dollars  Most of you have the intuition that it's not    you wouldn't pay that for it. But in fact  to decide whether a Big Mac is worth    dollars requires that you ask one  and only one question  which is  What else can I do with    dollars  If you've ever gotten on one of those long haul flights to Australia and realized that they're not going to serve you any food  but somebody in the row in front of you has just opened the McDonald's bag  and the smell of golden arches is wafting over the seat  you think  I can't do anything else with this    dollars for    hours. I can't even set it on fire    they took my cigarette lighter  Suddenly     dollars for a Big Mac might be a good deal. On the other hand  if you're visiting an underdeveloped country  and    dollars buys you a gourmet meal  it's exorbitant for a Big Mac. Why were you all sure that the answer to the question was no  before I'd even told you anything about the context  Because most of you compared the price of this Big Mac to the price you're used to paying. Rather than asking   What else can I do with my money   comparing this investment to other possible investments  you compared to the past. And this is a systematic error people make. What you knew is  you paid three dollars in the past     is outrageous. This is an error  and I can prove it to you by showing the kinds of irrationalities to which it leads. For example  this is  of course  one of the most delicious tricks in marketing  is to say something used to be higher  and suddenly it seems like a very good deal. When people are asked about these two different jobs  a job where you make   K  then   K  then   K  a job where you're getting a salary cut each year  and one in which you're getting a salary increase  people like the second job better than the first  despite the fact they're all told they make much less money. Why  Because they had the sense that declining wages are worse than rising wages  even when the total amount of wages is higher in the declining period. Here's another nice example. Here's a        Hawaiian vacation package  it's now on sale for      . Assuming you wanted to go to Hawaii  would you buy this package  Most people say they would. Here's a slightly different story         Hawaiian vacation package is now on sale for     dollars  so you decide to mull it over for a week. By the time you get to the ticket agency  the best fares are gone    the package now costs      . Would you buy it  Most people say  no. Why  Because it used to cost      and there's no way I'm paying       for something that was     last week. This tendency to compare to the past is causing people to pass up the better deal. In other words  a good deal that used to be a great deal is not nearly as good as an awful deal that was once a horrible deal. Here's another example of how comparing to the past can befuddle our decisions. Imagine that you're going to the theater. You're on your way to the theater. In your wallet you have a ticket  for which you paid    dollars. You also have a    dollar bill. When you arrive at the theater  you discover that somewhere along the way you've lost the ticket. Would you spend your remaining money on replacing it  Most people answer  no. Now  let's just change one thing in this scenario. You're on your way to the theater  and in your wallet you have two    dollar bills. When you arrive you discover you've lost one of them. Would you spend your remaining    dollars on a ticket  Well  of course  I went to the theater to see the play. What does the loss of    dollars along the way have to do  Now  just in case you're not getting it  here's a schematic of what happened  OK  Along the way  you lost something. In both cases  it was a piece of paper. In one case  it had a U.S. president on it  in the other case it didn't. What the hell difference should it make  The difference is that when you lost the ticket you say to yourself  I'm not paying twice for the same thing. You compare the cost of the play now       dollars    to the cost that it used to have       dollars    and you say it's a bad deal. Comparing with the past causes many of the problems that behavioral economists and psychologists identify in people's attempts to assign value. But even when we compare with the possible  instead of the past  we still make certain kinds of mistakes. And I'm going to show you one or two of them. One of the things we know about comparison  that when we compare one thing to the other  it changes its value. So in       this fellow  George Bush  for those of us who were kind of on the liberal side of the political spectrum  didn't seem like such a great guy. Suddenly  we're almost longing for him to return. The comparison changes how we evaluate him. Now  retailers knew this long before anybody else did  of course  and they use this wisdom to help you    spare you the undue burden of money. And so a retailer  if you were to go into a wine shop and you had to buy a bottle of wine  and you see them here for eight     and    dollars  what would you do  Most people don't want the most expensive  they don't want the least expensive. So  they will opt for the item in the middle. If you're a smart retailer  then  you will put a very expensive item that nobody will ever buy on the shelf  because suddenly the     wine doesn't look as expensive in comparison. So I'm telling you something you already knew  namely  that comparison changes the value of things. Here's why that's a problem  the problem is that when you get that     bottle of wine home  it won't matter what it used to be sitting on the shelf next to. The comparisons we make when we are appraising value  where we're trying to estimate how much we'll like things  are not the same comparisons we'll be making when we consume them. This problem of shifting comparisons can bedevil our attempts to make rational decisions. Let me just give you an example. I have to show you something from my own lab  so let me sneak this in. These are subjects coming to an experiment to be asked the simplest of all questions  How much will you enjoy eating potato chips one minute from now  They're sitting in a room with potato chips in front of them. For some of the subjects  sitting in the far corner of a room is a box of Godiva chocolates  and for others is a can of Spam. In fact  these items that are sitting in the room change how much the subjects think they're going to enjoy the potato chips. Namely  those who are looking at Spam think potato chips are going to be quite tasty  those who are looking at Godiva chocolate think they won't be nearly so tasty. Of course  what happens when they eat the potato chips  Well  look  you didn't need a psychologist to tell you that when you have a mouthful of greasy  salty  crispy  delicious snacks  what's sitting in the corner of the room makes not a damn bit of difference to your gustatory experience. Nonetheless  their predictions are perverted by a comparison that then does not carry through and change their experience. You've all experienced this yourself  even if you've never come into our lab to eat potato chips. So here's a question  You want to buy a car stereo. The dealer near your house sells this particular stereo for     dollars  but if you drive across town  you can get it for     bucks. So would you drive to get    percent off  saving     dollars  Most people say they would. They can't imagine buying it for twice the price when  with one trip across town  they can get it for half off. Now  let's imagine instead you wanted to buy a car that had a stereo  and the dealer near your house had it for       . But if you drove across town  you could get it for       . Would you drive to get it  At this point   .    savings    the     dollars. Most people say  no  I'm going to schlep across town to save     bucks on the purchase of a car  This kind of thinking drives economists crazy  and it should. Because this     dollars that you save    hello     doesn't know where it came from. It doesn't know what you saved it on. When you go to buy groceries with it  it doesn't go  I'm the money saved on the car stereo  or  I'm the dumb money saved on the car. It's money. And if a drive across town is worth     bucks  it's worth     bucks no matter what you're saving it on. People don't think that way. That's why they don't know whether their mutual fund manager is taking  .  percent or  .   percent of their investment  but they clip coupons to save one dollar off of toothpaste. Now  you can see  this is the problem of shifting comparisons  because what you're doing is  you're comparing the     bucks to the purchase that you're making  but when you go to spend that money you won't be making that comparison. You've all had this experience. If you're an American  for example  you've probably traveled in France. And at some point you may have met a couple from your own hometown  and you thought   Oh  my God  these people are so warm. They're so nice to me. I mean  compared to all these people who hate me when I try to speak their language and hate me more when I don't  these people are just wonderful.  And so you tour France with them  and then you get home and you invite them over for dinner  and what do you find  Compared to your regular friends  they are boring and dull  right  Because in this new context  the comparison is very  very different. In fact  you find yourself disliking them enough almost to qualify for French citizenship. Now  you have exactly the same problem when you shop for a stereo. You go to the stereo store  you see two sets of speakers    these big  boxy  monoliths  and these little  sleek speakers  and you play them  and you go  you know  I do hear a difference  the big ones sound a little better. And so you buy them  and you bring them home  and you entirely violate the d cor of your house. And the problem  of course  is that this comparison you made in the store is a comparison you'll never make again. What are the odds that years later you'll turn on the stereo and go   Sounds so much better than those little ones   which you can't even remember hearing. The problem of shifting comparisons is even more difficult when these choices are arrayed over time. People have a lot of trouble making decisions about things that will happen at different points in time. And what psychologists and behavioral economists have discovered is that by and large people use two simple rules. So let me give you one very easy problem  a second very easy problem and then a third  hard  problem. Here's the first easy problem  You can have    dollars now or    dollars now. Which would you prefer  This is what we call a one item IQ test  OK  All of us  I hope  prefer more money  and the reason is  we believe more is better than less. Here's the second problem  You can have    dollars today or    dollars in a month. Which would you prefer  Again  an easy decision  because we all know that now is better than later. What's hard in our decision making is when these two rules conflict. For example  when you're offered    dollars now or    dollars in a month. This typifies a lot of situations in life in which you will gain by waiting  but you have to be patient. What do we know  What do people do in these kinds of situations  Well  by and large people are enormously impatient. That is  they require interest rates in the hundred or thousands of percents in order to delay gratification and wait until next month for the extra    dollars. Maybe that isn't so remarkable  but what is remarkable is how easy it is to make this impatience go away by simply changing when the delivery of these monetary units will happen. Imagine that you can have    dollars in a year    that's    months    or    dollars in    months. What do we find now  People are gladly willing to wait  as long as they're waiting     they might as well wait   . What makes this dynamic inconsistency happen  Comparison. Troubling comparison. Let me show you. This is just a graph showing the results that I just suggested you would show if I gave you time to respond  which is  people find that the subjective value of    is higher than the subjective value of    when they'll be delivered in now or one month  respectively    a    day delay    but they show the reverse pattern when you push the entire decision off into the future a year. Now  why in the world do you get this pattern of results  These guys can tell us. What you see here are two lads  one of them larger than the other  the fireman and the fiddler. They are going to recede towards the vanishing point in the horizon  and I want you to notice two things. At no point will the fireman look taller than the fiddler. No point. However  the difference between them seems to be getting smaller. First it's an inch in your view  then it's a quarter inch  then a half inch  and then finally they go off the edge of the earth. Here are the results of what I just showed you. This is the subjective height    the height you saw of these guys at various points. And I want you to see that two things are true. One  the farther away they are  the smaller they look  and two  the fireman is always bigger than the fiddler. But watch what happens when we make some of them disappear. Right. At a very close distance  the fiddler looks taller than the fireman  but at a far distance their normal  their true  relations are preserved. As Plato said  what space is to size  time is to value. These are the results of the hard problem I gave you     now or    in a month  And these are subjective values  and what you can see is  our two rules are preserved. People always think more is better than less     is always better than     and they always think now is better than later  the bars on this side are higher than the bars on this side. Watch what happens when we drop some out. Suddenly we have the dynamic inconsistency that puzzled us. We have the tendency for people to go for    dollars now over waiting a month  but not if that decision is far in the future. Notice something interesting that this implies    namely  that when people get to the future  they will change their minds. That is  as that month    approaches  you will say  what was I thinking  waiting an extra month for    dollars  I'll take the    dollars now. Well  the question with which I'd like to end is this  If we're so damn stupid  how did we get to the moon  Because I could go on for about two hours with evidence of people's inability to estimate odds and inability to estimate value. The answer to this question  I think  is an answer you've already heard in some of the talks  and I dare say you will hear again  namely  that our brains were evolved for a very different world than the one in which we are living. They were evolved for a world in which people lived in very small groups  rarely met anybody who was terribly different from themselves  had rather short lives in which there were few choices and the highest priority was to eat and mate today. Bernoulli's gift  Bernoulli's little formula  allows us  it tells us how we should think in a world for which nature never designed us. That explains why we are so bad at using it  but it also explains why it is so terribly important that we become good  fast. We are the only species on this planet that has ever held its own fate in its hands. We have no significant predators  we're the masters of our physical environment  the things that normally cause species to become extinct are no longer any threat to us. The only thing    the only thing    that can destroy us and doom us are our own decisions. If we're not here in        years  it's going to be because we could not take advantage of the gift given to us by a young Dutch fellow in       because we underestimated the odds of our future pains and overestimated the value of our present pleasures. Thank you. Chris Anderson  That was remarkable. We have time for some questions for Dan Gilbert. One and two. Bill Lyell  Would you say that this mechanism is in part how terrorism actually works to frighten us  and is there some way that we could counteract that  Dan Gilbert  I actually was consulting recently with the Department of Homeland Security  which generally believes that American security dollars should go to making borders safer. I tried to point out to them that terrorism was a name based on people's psychological reaction to a set of events  and that if they were concerned about terrorism they might ask what causes terror and how can we stop people from being terrified  rather than    not rather than  but in addition to stopping the atrocities that we're all concerned about. Surely the kinds of play that at least American media give to    and forgive me  but in raw numbers these are very tiny accidents. We already know  for example  in the United States  more people have died as a result of not taking airplanes    because they were scared    and driving on highways  than were killed in     . OK  If I told you that there was a plague that was going to kill        Americans next year  you might be alarmed if you didn't find out it was the flu. These are small scale accidents  and we should be wondering whether they should get the kind of play  the kind of coverage  that they do. Surely that causes people to overestimate the likelihood that they'll be hurt in these various ways  and gives power to the very people who want to frighten us. CA  Dan  I'd like to hear more on this. So  you're saying that our response to terror is  I mean  it's a form of mental bug  Talk more about it. DG  It's out sized. I mean  look. If Australia disappears tomorrow  terror is probably the right response. That's an awful large lot of very nice people. On the other hand  when a bus blows up and    people are killed  more people than that were killed by not using their seatbelts in the same country. Is terror the right response  CA  What causes the bug  Is it the drama of the event    that it's so spectacular  Is it the fact that it's an intentional attack by  quote  outsiders  What is it  DG  Yes. It's a number of things  and you hit on several of them. First  it's a human agent trying to kill us    it's not a tree falling on us by accident. Second  these are enemies who may want to strike and hurt us again. People are being killed for no reason instead of good reason    as if there's good reason  but sometimes people think there are. So there are a number of things that together make this seem like a fantastic event  but let's not play down the fact that newspapers sell when people see something in it they want to read. So there's a large role here played by the media  who want these things to be as spectacular as they possibly can. CA  I mean  what would it take to persuade our culture to downplay it  DG  Well  go to Israel. You know  go to Israel. And a mall blows up  and then everybody's unhappy about it  and an hour and a half later    at least when I was there  and I was     feet from the mall when it blew up    I went back to my hotel and the wedding that was planned was still going on. And as the Israeli mother said  she said   We never let them win by stopping weddings.  I mean  this is a society that has learned    and there are others too    that has learned to live with a certain amount of terrorism and not be quite as upset by it  shall I say  as those of us who have not had many terror attacks. CA  But is there a rational fear that actually  the reason we're frightened about this is because we think that the Big One is to come  DG  Yes  of course. So  if we knew that this was the worst attack there would ever be  there might be more and more buses of    people    we would probably not be nearly so frightened. I don't want to say    please  I'm going to get quoted somewhere as saying   Terrorism is fine and we shouldn't be so distressed.  That's not my point at all. What I'm saying is that  surely  rationally  our distress about things that happen  about threats  should be roughly proportional to the size of those threats and threats to come. I think in the case of terrorism  it isn't. And many of the things we've heard about from our speakers today    how many people do you know got up and said  Poverty  I can't believe what poverty is doing to us. People get up in the morning  they don't care about poverty. It's not making headlines  it's not making news  it's not flashy. There are no guns going off. I mean  if you had to solve one of these problems  Chris  which would you solve  Terrorism or poverty  That's a tough one. CA  There's no question. Poverty  by an order of magnitude  a huge order of magnitude  unless someone can show that there's  you know  terrorists with a nuke are really likely to come. The latest I've read  seen  thought is that it's incredibly hard for them to do that. If that turns out to be wrong  we all look silly  but with poverty it's a bit    DG  Even if that were true  still more people die from poverty. CA  We've evolved to get all excited about these dramatic attacks. Is that because in the past  in the ancient past  we just didn't understand things like disease and systems that cause poverty and so forth  and so it made no sense for us as a species to put any energy into worrying about those things  People died  so be it. But if you got attacked  that was something you could do something about. And so we evolved these responses. Is that what happened  DG  Well  you know  the people who are most skeptical about leaping to evolutionary explanations for everything are the evolutionary psychologists themselves. My guess is that there's nothing quite that specific in our evolutionary past. But rather  if you're looking for an evolutionary explanation  you might say that most organisms are neo phobic    that is  they're a little scared of stuff that's new and different. And there's a good reason to be  because old stuff didn't eat you. Right  Any animal you see that you've seen before is less likely to be a predator than one that you've never seen before. So  you know  when a school bus is blown up and we've never seen this before  our general tendency is to orient towards that which is new and novel is activated. I don't think it's quite as specific a mechanism as the one you alluded to  but maybe a more fundamental one underlying it. Jay Walker  You know  economists love to talk about the stupidity of people who buy lottery tickets. But I suspect you're making the exact same error you're accusing those people of  which is the error of value. I know  because I've interviewed about       lottery buyers over the years. It turns out that the value of buying a lottery ticket is not winning. That's what you think it is. All right  The average lottery buyer buys about     tickets a year  so the buyer knows full well that he or she is going to lose  and yet she buys     tickets a year. Why is that  It's not because she is stupid or he is stupid. It's because the anticipation of possibly winning releases serotonin in the brain  and actually provides a good feeling until the drawing indicates you've lost. Or  to put it another way  for the dollar investment  you can have a much better feeling than flushing the money down the toilet  which you cannot have a good feeling from. Now  economists tend to       economists tend to view the world through their own lenses  which is  this is just a bunch of stupid people. And as a result  many people look at economists as stupid people. And so fundamentally  the reason we got to the moon is  we didn't listen to the economists. Thank you very much. DG  Well  no  it's a great point. It remains to be seen whether the joy of anticipation is exactly equaled by the amount of disappointment after the lottery. Because remember  people who didn't buy tickets don't feel awful the next day either  even though they don't feel great during the drawing. I would disagree that people know they're not going to win. I think they think it's unlikely  but it could happen  which is why they prefer that to the flushing. But certainly I see your point  that there can be some utility to buying a lottery ticket other than winning. Now  I think there's many good reasons not to listen to economists. That isn't one of them  for me  but there's many others. CA  Last question. Aubrey de Grey  My name's Aubrey de Grey  from Cambridge. I work on the thing that kills more people than anything else kills    I work on aging    and I'm interested in doing something about it  as we'll all hear tomorrow. I very much resonate with what you're saying  because it seems to me that the problem with getting people interested in doing anything about aging is that by the time aging is about to kill you it looks like cancer or heart disease or whatever. Do you have any advice  DG  For you or for them  AdG  In persuading them. DG  Ah  for you in persuading them. Well  it's notoriously difficult to get people to be farsighted. But one thing that psychologists have tried that seems to work is to get people to imagine the future more vividly. One of the problems with making decisions about the far future and the near future is that we imagine the near future much more vividly than the far future. To the extent that you can equalize the amount of detail that people put into the mental representations of near and far future  people begin to make decisions about the two in the same way. So  would you like to have an extra         dollars when you're    is a question that's very different than  imagine who you'll be when you're     will you be living  what will you look like  how much hair will you have  who will you be living with. Once we have all the details of that imaginary scenario  suddenly we feel like it might be important to save so that that guy has a little retirement money. But these are tricks around the margins. I think in general you're battling a very fundamental human tendency  which is to say   I'm here today  and so now is more important than later.  CA  Dan  thank you. Members of the audience  that was a fantastic session. Thank you. I'm just going to play a brief video clip. Video  On the fifth of December       a bottle of      Lafitte was sold for         pounds    nine times the previous world record. The buyer was Kip Forbes  son of one of the most flamboyant millionaires of the   th century. The original owner of the bottle turned out to be one of the most enthusiastic wine buffs of the   th century. Ch teau Lafitte is one of the greatest wines in the world  the prince of any wine cellar. Benjamin Wallace  Now  that's about all the videotape that remains of an event that set off the longest running mystery in the modern wine world. And the mystery existed because of a gentleman named Hardy Rodenstock. In       he announced to his friends in the wine world that he had made this incredible discovery. Some workmen in Paris had broken through a brick wall  and happened upon this hidden cache of wines    apparently the property of Thomas Jefferson.           . He wouldn't reveal the exact number of bottles  he would not reveal exactly where the building was and he would not reveal exactly who owned the building. The mystery persisted for about    years. It finally began to get resolved in      because of this guy. Bill Koch is a Florida billionaire who owns four of the Jefferson bottles  and he became suspicious. And he ended up spending over a million dollars and hiring ex FBI and ex Scotland Yard agents to try to get to the bottom of this. There's now ample evidence that Hardy Rodenstock is a con man  and that the Jefferson bottles were fakes. But for those    years  an unbelievable number of really eminent and accomplished figures in the wine world were sort of drawn into the orbit of these bottles. I think they wanted to believe that the most expensive bottle of wine in the world must be the best bottle of wine in the world  must be the rarest bottle of wine in the world. I became increasingly  kind of voyeuristically interested in the question of you know  why do people spend these crazy amounts of money  not only on wine but on lots of things  and are they living a better life than me  So  I decided to embark on a quest. With the generous backing of a magazine I write for sometimes  I decided to sample the very best  or most expensive  or most coveted item in about a dozen categories  which was a very grueling quest   as you can imagine. This was the first one. A lot of the Kobe beef that you see in the U.S. is not the real thing. It may come from Wagyu cattle  but it's not from the original  Appalachian Hyogo Prefecture in Japan. There are very few places in the U.S. where you can try real Kobe  and one of them is Wolfgang Puck's restaurant  Cut  in Los Angeles. I went there  and I ordered the eight ounce rib eye for     dollars. And it arrived  and it was tiny. And I was outraged. It was like      dollars for this  And then I took a bite  and I wished that it was tinier  because Kobe beef is so rich. It's like foie gras    it's not even like steak. I almost couldn't finish it. I was really happy when I was done. Now  the photographer who took the pictures for this project for some reason posed his dog in a lot of them  so that's why you're going to see this recurring character. Which  I guess  you know  communicates to you that I did not think that one was really worth the price. White truffles. One of the most expensive luxury foods by weight in the world. To try this  I went to a Mario Batali restaurant in Manhattan    Del Posto. The waiter  you know  came out with the white truffle knob and his shaver  and he shaved it onto my pasta and he said  you know   Would Signore like the truffles   And the charm of white truffles is in their aroma. It's not in their taste  really. It's not in their texture. It's in the smell. These white pearlescent flakes hit the noodles  this haunting  wonderful  nutty  mushroomy smell wafted up.    seconds passed and it was gone. And then I was left with these little ugly flakes on my pasta that  you know  their purpose had been served  and so I'm afraid to say that this was also a disappointment to me. There were several    several of these items were disappointments. Yeah. The magazine wouldn't pay for me to go there. They did give me a tour  though. And this hotel suite is       square feet. It has     degree views. It has four balconies. It was designed by the architect I.M. Pei. It comes with its own Rolls Royce and driver. It comes with its own wine cellar that you can draw freely from. When I took the tour  it actually included some Opus One  I was glad to see.        dollars for a night in a hotel. This is soap that's made from silver nanoparticles  which have antibacterial properties. I washed my face with this this morning in preparation for this. And it  you know  tickled a little bit and it smelled good  but I have to say that nobody here has complimented me on the cleanliness of my face today. But then again  nobody has complimented me on the jeans I'm wearing. These ones GQ did spring for    I own these    but I will tell you  not only did I not get a compliment from any of you  I have not gotten a compliment from anybody in the months that I have owned and worn these. I don't think that whether or not you're getting a compliment should be the test of something's value  but I think in the case of a fashion item  an article of clothing  that's a reasonable benchmark. That said  a lot of work goes into these. They are made from handpicked organic Zimbabwean cotton that has been shuttle loomed and then hand dipped in natural indigo    times. But no compliments. Thank you. Armando Manni is a former filmmaker who makes this olive oil from an olive that grows on a single slope in Tuscany. And he goes to great lengths to protect the olive oil from oxygen and light. He uses tiny bottles  the glass is tinted  he tops the olive oil off with an inert gas. And he actually    once he releases a batch of it  he regularly conducts molecular analyses and posts the results online  so you can go online and look at your batch number and see how the phenolics are developing  and  you know  gauge its freshness. I did a blind taste test of this with    people and five other olive oils. It tasted fine. It tasted interesting. It was very green  it was very peppery. But in the blind taste test  it came in last. The olive oil that came in first was actually a bottle of Whole Foods     olive oil which had been oxidizing next to my stove for six months. A recurring theme is that a lot of these things are from Japan    you'll start to notice. I don't play golf  so I couldn't actually road test these  but I did interview a guy who owns them. Even the people who market these clubs    I mean  they'll say these have four axis shafts which minimize loss of club speed and thereby drive the ball farther    but they'll say  look  you know  you're not getting        dollars worth of performance from these clubs. You're paying for the bling  that they're encrusted with gold and platinum. The guy who I interviewed who owns them did say that he's gotten a lot of pleasure out of them  so ... Oh  yeah  you know this one  This is a coffee made from a very unusual process. The luwak is an Asian Palm Civet. It's a cat that lives in trees  and at night it comes down and it prowls the coffee plantations. And apparently it's a very picky eater and it  you know  hones in on only the ripest coffee cherries. And then an enzyme in its digestive tract leeches into the beans  and people with the unenviable job of collecting these cats' leavings then go through the forest collecting the  you know  results and processing it into coffee    although you actually can buy it in the unprocessed form. That's right. Unrelatedly    Japan is doing crazy things with toilets. There is now a toilet that has an MP  player in it. There's one with a fragrance dispenser. There's one that actually analyzes the contents of the bowl and transmits the results via email to your doctor. It's almost like a home medical center    and that is the direction that Japanese toilet technology is heading in. This one does not have those bells and whistles  but for pure functionality it's pretty much the best    the Neorest    . And to try this    I couldn't get a loaner  but I did go into the Manhattan showroom of the manufacturer  Toto  and they have a bathroom off of the showroom that you can use  which I used. It's fully automated    you walk towards it  and the seat lifts. The seat is preheated. There's a water jet that cleans you. There's an air jet that dries you. You get up  it flushes by itself. The lid closes  it self cleans. Not only is it a technological leap forward  but I really do believe it's a bit of a cultural leap forward. I mean  a no hands  no toilet paper toilet. And I want to get one of these. This was another one I could not get a loaner of. Tom Cruise supposedly owns this bed. There's a little plaque on the end that  you know  each buyer gets their name engraved on it. To try this one  the maker of it let me and my wife spend the night in the Manhattan showroom. Lights glaring in off the street  and we had to hire a security guard and all these things. But anyway  we had a great night's sleep. And you spend a third of your life in bed. I don't think it's that bad of a deal. This was a fun one. This is the fastest street legal car in the world and the most expensive production car. I got to drive this with a chaperone from the company  a professional race car driver  and we drove around the canyons outside of Los Angeles and down on the Pacific Coast Highway. And  you know  when we pulled up to a stoplight the people in the adjacent cars kind of gave us respectful nods. And it was really amazing. It was such a smooth ride. Most of the cars that I drive  if I get up to    they start to rattle. I switched lanes on the highway and the driver  this chaperone  said   You know  you were just going     miles an hour.  And I had no idea that I was one of those obnoxious people you occasionally see weaving in and out of traffic  because it was just that smooth. And if I was a billionaire  I would get one. This is a completely gratuitous video I'm just going to show of one of the pitfalls of advanced technology. This is Tom Cruise arriving at the  Mission  Impossible III  premiere. When he tries to open the door  you could call it  Mission  Impossible IV.  There was one object that I could not get my hands on  and that was the      Cheval Blanc. The '   Cheval Blanc is probably the most mythologized wine of the   th century. And Cheval Blanc is kind of an unusual wine for Bordeaux in having a significant percentage of the Cabernet Franc grape. And      was a legendary vintage  especially in the right bank of Bordeaux. And just together  that vintage and that chateau took on this aura that eventually kind of gave it this cultish following. But it's    years old. There's not much of it left. What there is of it left you don't know if it's real    it's considered to be the most faked wine in the world. Not that many people are looking to pop open their one remaining bottle for a journalist. So  I'd about given up trying to get my hands on one of these. I'd put out feelers to retailers  to auctioneers  and it was coming up empty. And then I got an email from a guy named Bipin Desai. Bipin Desai is a U.C. Riverside theoretical physicist who also happens to be the preeminent organizer of rare wine tastings  and he said   I've got a tasting coming up where we're going to serve the '   Cheval Blanc.  And it was going to be a double vertical    it was going to be    vintages of Cheval Blanc  and    vintages of Yquem. And it was an invitation you do not refuse. I went. It was three days  four meals. And at lunch on Saturday  we opened the '  . And you know  it had this fragrant softness  and it smelled a little bit of linseed oil. And then I tasted it  and it  you know  had this kind of unctuous  porty richness  which is characteristic of that wine    that it sort of resembles port in a lot of ways. There were people at my table who thought it was  you know  fantastic. There were some people who were a little less impressed. And I wasn't that impressed. And I don't    call my palate a philistine palate    so it doesn't necessarily mean something that I wasn't impressed  but I was not the only one there who had that reaction. And it wasn't just to that wine. Any one of the wines served at this tasting  if I'd been served it at a dinner party  it would have been  you know  the wine experience of my lifetime  and incredibly memorable. But drinking    great wines over three days  they all just blurred together  and it became almost a grueling experience. And I just wanted to finish by mentioning a very interesting study which came out earlier this year from some researchers at Stanford and Caltech. And they gave subjects the same wine  labeled with different price tags. A lot of people  you know  said that they liked the more expensive wine more    it was the same wine  but they thought it was a different one that was more expensive. But what was unexpected was that these researchers did MRI brain imaging while the people were drinking the wine  and not only did they say they enjoyed the more expensively labeled wine more    their brain actually registered as experiencing more pleasure from the same wine when it was labeled with a higher price tag. Thank you. The career that I started early on in my life was looking for exotic life forms in exotic places  and at that time I was working in the Antarctic and the Arctic  and high deserts and low deserts. Until about a dozen years ago  when I was really captured by caves  and I really re focused most of my research in that direction. So I have a really cool day job   I get to do some really amazing stuff. I work in some of the most extreme cave environments on the planet. Many of them are trying to kill us from the minute we go into them  but nevertheless  they're absolutely gripping  and contain unbelievable biological wonders that are very  very different from those that we have on the planet. Apart from the intrinsic value of the biology and mineralogy and geo microbiology that we do there  we're also using these as templates for figuring out how to go look for life on other planets. Particularly Mars  but also Europa  the small  icy moon around Jupiter. And perhaps  someday  far beyond our solar system itself. I'm very passionately interested in the human future  on the Moon and Mars particularly  and elsewhere in the solar system. I think it's time that we transitioned to a solar system going civilization and species. And  as an outgrowth of all of this then  I wonder about whether we can  and whether we even should  think about transporting Earth type life to other planets. Notably Mars  as a first example. Something I never talk about in scientific meetings is how I actually got to this state and why I do the work that I do. Why don't I have a normal job  a sensible job  And then of course  I blame the Soviet Union. Because in the mid     s  when I was a tiny child  they had the audacity to launch a very primitive little satellite called Sputnik  which sent the Western world into a hysterical tailspin. And a tremendous amount of money went into the funding of science and mathematics skills for kids. And I'm a product of that generation  like so many other of my peers. It really caught hold of us  and caught fire  and it would be lovely if we could reproduce that again now. Of course  refusing to grow up       even though I impersonate a grown up in daily life  but I do a fairly good job of that    but really retaining that childlike quality of not caring what other people think about what you're interested in  is really critical. The next element is the fact that I have applied a value judgment and my value judgment is that the presence of life is better than no life. And so  life is more valuable than no life. And so I think that that holds together a great deal of the work that people in this audience approach. I'm very interested in Mars  of course  and that was a product of my being a young undergraduate when the Viking Landers landed on Mars. And that took what had been a tiny little astronomical object in the sky  that you would see as a dot  and turned it completely into a landscape  as that very first primitive picture came rastering across the screen. And when it became a landscape  it also became a destination  and altered  really  the course of my life. In my graduate years I worked with my colleague and mentor and friend  Steve Schneider  at the National Center for Atmospheric Research  working on global change issues. We've written a number of things on the role of Gaia hypothesis    whether or not you could consider Earth as a single entity in any meaningful scientific sense  and then  as an outgrowth of that  I worked on the environmental consequences of nuclear war. So  wonderful things and grim things. But what it taught me was to look at Earth as a planet with external eyes  not just as our home. And that is a wonderful stepping away in perspective  to try to then think about the way our planet behaves  as a planet  and with the life that's on it. And all of this seems to me to be a salient point in history. We're getting ready to begin to go through the process of leaving our planet of origin and out into the wider solar system and beyond. So  back to Mars. How hard is it going to be to find life on Mars  Well  sometimes it's really very hard for us to find each other  even on this planet. So  finding life on another planet is a non trivial occupation and we spend a lot of time trying to think about that. Whether or not you think it's likely to be successful sort of depends on what you think about the chances of life in the universe. I think  myself  that life is a natural outgrowth of the increasing complexification of matter over time. So  you start with the Big Bang and you get hydrogen  and then you get helium  and then you get more complicated stuff  and you get planets forming    and life is a common  planetary based phenomenon  in my view. Certainly  in the last    years  we've seen increasing numbers of planets outside of our solar system being confirmed  and just last month  a couple of weeks ago  a planet in the size class of Earth has actually been found. And so this is very exciting news. So  my first bold prediction is that  is that in the universe  life is going to be everywhere. It's going to be everywhere we look    where there are planetary systems that can possibly support it. And those planetary systems are going to be very common. So  what about life on Mars  Well  if somebody had asked me about a dozen years ago what I thought the chances of life on Mars would be  I would've probably said  a couple of percent. And even that was considered outrageous at the time. I was once sneeringly introduced by a former NASA official  as the only person on the planet who still thought there was life on Mars. Of course  that official is now dead  and I'm not  so there's a certain amount of glory in outliving your adversaries. But things have changed greatly over the last dozen years. And the reason that they have changed is because we now have new information. The amazing Pathfinder mission that went in '    and the MER Rover missions that are on Mars as we speak now and the European Space Agency's Mars Express  has taught us a number of amazing things. There is sub surface ice on that planet. And so where there is water  there is a very high chance of our kind of life. There's clearly sedimentary rocks all over the place   one of the landers is sitting in the middle of an ancient seabed  and there are these amazing structures called blueberries  which are these little  rocky concretions that we are busy making biologically in my lab right now. So  with all of these things put together  I think that the chances of life are much greater than I would've ever thought. I think that the chance of life having arisen on Mars  sometime in its past  is maybe one in four to maybe even half and half. So this is a very bold statement. I think it's there  and I think we need to go look for it  and I think it's underground. So the game's afoot  and this is the game that we play in astro biology. How do you try to get a handle on extraterrestrial life  How do you plan to look for it  How do you know it when you find it  Because if it's big and obvious  we would've already found it    it would've already bitten us on the foot  and it hasn't. So  we know that it's probably quite cryptic. Very critically  how do we protect it  if we find it  and not contaminate it  And also  even perhaps more critically  because this is the only home planet we have  how do we protect us from it  while we study it  So why might it be hard to find  Well  it's probably microscopic  and it's never easy to study microscopic things  although the amazing tools that we now have to do that allow us to study things in much greater depth  at much smaller scales than ever before. But it's probably hiding  because if you are out sequestering resources from your environment  that makes you yummy  and other things might want to eat you  or consume you. And so  there's a game of predator prey that's going to be  essentially  universal  really  in any kind of biological system. It also may be very  very different in its fundamental properties   its chemistry  or its size. We say small  but what does that mean  Is it virus sized  Is it smaller than that  Is it bigger than the biggest bacterium  We don't know. And speed of activity  which is something that we face in our work with sub surface organisms  because they grow very  very slowly. If I were to take a swab off your teeth and plate it on a Petri plate  within about four or five hours  I would have to see growth. But the organisms that we work with  from the sub surface of Earth  very often it's months    and in many cases  years    before we see any growth whatsoever. So they are  intrinsically  a slower life form. But the real issue is that we are guided by our limited experience  and until we can think out of the box of our cranium and what we know  then we can't recognize what to look for  or how to plan for it. So  perspective is everything and  because of the history that I've just briefly talked to you about  I have learned to think about Earth as an extraterrestrial planet. And this has been invaluable in our approach to try to study these things. This is my favorite game on airplanes  where you're in an airplane and you look out the window  you see the horizon. I always turn my head on the side  and that simple change makes me go from seeing this planet as home  to seeing it as a planet. It's a very simple trick  and I never fail to do it when I'm sitting in a window seat. Well  this is what we apply to our work. This shows one of the most extreme caves that we work in. This is Cueva de Villa Luz in Tabasco  in Mexico  and this cave is saturated with sulfuric acid. There is tremendous amounts of hydrogen sulfide coming into this cave from volcanic sources and from the breakdown of evaporite    minerals below the carbonates in which this cave is formed    and it is a completely hostile environment for us. We have to go in with protective suits and breathing gear  and    parts per million of H S will kill you. This is regularly several hundred parts per million. So  it's a very hazardous environment  with CO as well  and many other gases. These extreme physical and chemical parameters make the biology that grows in these places very special. Because contrary to what you might think  this is not devoid of life. This is one of the richest caves that we have found on the planet  anywhere. It's bursting with life. The extremes on Earth are interesting in their own right  but one of the reasons that we're interested in them is because they represent  really  the average conditions that we may expect on other planets. So  this is part of the ability that we have  to try to stretch our imagination  in terms of what we may find in the future. There's so much life in this cave  and I can't even begin to scratch the surface of it with you. But one of the most famous objects out of this are what we call Snottites  for obvious reasons. This stuff looks like what comes out of your two year old's nose when he has a cold. And this is produced by bacteria who are actually making more sulfuric acid  and living at pHs right around zero. And so  this stuff is like battery acid. And yet  everything in this cave has adapted to it. In fact  there's so much energy available for biology in this cave  that there's actually a huge number of cavefish. And the local Zoque Indians harvest this twice a year  as part of their Easter week celebration and Holy Week celebration. This is very unusual for caves. In some of the other amazing caves that we work in    this is in Lechuguilla cave in New Mexico near Carlsbad  and this is one of the most famous caves in the world. It's     miles of mapped passage  it's pristine  it has no natural opening and it's a gigantic biological  geo microbiological laboratory. In this cave  great areas are covered by this reddish material that you see here  and also these enormous crystals of selenite that you can see dangling down. This stuff is produced biologically. This is the breakdown product of the bedrock  that organisms are busy munching their way through. They take iron and manganese minerals within the bedrock and they oxidize them. And every time they do that  they get a tiny little packet of energy. And that tiny little packet of energy is what they use  then  to run their life processes. Interestingly enough  they also do this with uranium and chromium  and various other toxic metals. And so  the obvious avenue for bio remediation comes from organisms like this. These organisms we now bring into the lab  and you can see some of them growing on Petri plates  and get them to reproduce the precise biominerals that we find on the walls of these caves. So  these are signals that they leave in the rock record. Well  even in basalt surfaces in lava tube caves  which are a by product of volcanic activity  we find these walls totally covered  in many cases  by these beautiful  glistening silver walls  or shiny pink or shiny red or shiny gold. And these are mineral deposits that are also made by bacteria. And you can see in these central images here  scanning electron micrographs of some of these guys    these are gardens of these bacteria. One of the interesting things about these particular guys is that they're in the actinomycete and streptomycete groups of the bacteria  which is where we get most of our antibiotics. The sub surface of Earth contains a vast biodiversity. And these organisms  because they're very separate from the surface  make a vast array of novel compounds. And so  the potential for exploiting this for pharmaceutical and industrial chemical uses is completely untapped  but probably exceeds most of the rest of the biodiversity of the planet. So  lava tube caves   I've just told you about organisms that live here on this planet. We know that on Mars and the Moon there are tons of these structures. We can see them. On the left you can see a lava tube forming at a recent eruption    Mount Etna in Sicily    and this is the way these tubes form. And when they hollow out  then they become habitats for organisms. These are all over the planet Mars  and we're busy cataloguing them now. And so  there's very interesting cave real estate on Mars  at least of that type. In order to access these sub surface environments that we're interested in  we're very interested in developing the tools to do this. You know  it's not easy to get into these caves. It requires crawling  climbing  rope work  technical rope work and many other complex human motions in order to access these. We face the problem of  how can we do this robotically  Why would we want to do it robotically  Well  we're going to be sending robotic missions to Mars long in advance of human missions. And then  secondly  getting back to that earlier point that I made about the preciousness of any life that we may find on Mars  we don't want to contaminate it. And one of the best ways to study something without contaminating it is to have an intermediary. And in this case  we're imagining intermediary robotic devices that can actually do some of that front end work for us  to protect any potential life that we find. I'm not going to go through all of these projects now  but we're involved in about half a dozen robotic development projects  in collaboration with a number of different groups. I want to talk specifically about the array that you see on the top. These are hopping microbot swarms. I'm working on this with the Field and Space Robotics Laboratory and my friend Steve Dubowsky at MIT  and we have come up with the idea of having little  jumping bean like robots that are propelled by artificial muscle  which is one of the Dubowsky Lab's specialties    are the EPAMs  or artificial muscles. And these allow them to hop. They behave with a swarm behavior  where they relate to each other  modeled after insect swarm behavior  and they could be made very numerous. And so  one can send a thousand of them  as you can see in this upper left hand picture  a thousand of them could fit into the payload bay that was used for one of the current MER Rovers. And these little guys    you could lose many of them. If you send a thousand of them  you could probably get rid of    percent of them and still have a mission. And so  that allows you the flexibility to go into very challenging terrain and actually make your way where you want to go. Now  to wrap this up  I want to talk for two seconds about caves and the human expansion beyond Earth as a natural outgrowth of the work that we do in caves. It occurred to us a number of years ago that caves have many properties that people have used and other organisms have used as habitat in the past. And perhaps it's time we started to explore those  in the context of future Mars and the Moon exploration. So  we have just finished a NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts Phase II study  looking at the irreducible set of technologies that you would need in order to actually allow people to inhabit lava tubes on the Moon or Mars. It turns out to be a fairly simple and small list  and we have gone in the relatively primitive technology direction. So  we're talking about things like inflatable liners that can conform to the complex topological shape on the inside of a cave  foamed in place airlocks to deal with this complex topology  various ways of getting breathing gases made from the intrinsic materials of these bodies. And the future is there for us to use these lava tube caves on Mars. And right now we're in caves  and we're doing science and recreation  but I think in the future we'll be using them for habitat and science on these other bodies. Now  my view of what the current status of potential life on Mars is that it's probably been on the planet  maybe one in two chances. The question as to whether there is life on Mars that is related to life on Earth has now been very muddied  because we now know  from Mars meteorites that have made it to Earth  that there's material that can be exchanged between those two planets. One of the burning questions  of course  is if we go there and find life in the sub surface  as I fully expect that we will  is that a second genesis of life  Did life start here and was it transported there  Did it start there and get transported here  This will be a fascinating puzzle as we go into the next half century  and where I expect that we will have more and more Mars missions to answer these questions. Thank you. I was trying to think  how is sync connected to happiness  and it occurred to me that for some reason we take pleasure in synchronizing. We like to dance together  we like singing together. And so  if you'll put up with this  I would like to enlist your help with a first experiment today. The experiment is    and I notice  by the way  that when you applauded  that you did it in a typical North American way  that is  you were raucous and incoherent. You were not organized. It didn't even occur to you to clap in unison. Do you think you could do it  I would like to see if this audience would    no  you haven't practiced  as far as I know    can you get it together to clap in sync  Whoa  Now  that's what we call emergent behavior. So I didn't expect that  but    I mean  I expected you could synchronize. It didn't occur to me you'd increase your frequency. It's interesting. So what do we make of that  First of all  we know that you're all brilliant. This is a room full of intelligent people  highly sensitive. Some trained musicians out there. Is that what enabled you to synchronize  So to put the question a little more seriously  let's ask ourselves what are the minimum requirements for what you just did  for spontaneous synchronization. Do you need  for instance  to be as smart as you are  Do you even need a brain at all just to synchronize  Do you need to be alive  I mean  that's a spooky thought  right  Inanimate objects that might spontaneously synchronize themselves. It's real. In fact  I'll try to explain today that sync is maybe one of  if not one of the most  perhaps the most pervasive drive in all of nature. It extends from the subatomic scale to the farthest reaches of the cosmos. It's a deep tendency toward order in nature that opposes what we've all been taught about entropy. I mean  I'm not saying the law of entropy is wrong    it's not. But there is a countervailing force in the universe    the tendency towards spontaneous order. And so that's our theme. Now  to get into that  let me begin with what might have occurred to you immediately when you hear that we're talking about synchrony in nature  which is the glorious example of birds that flock together  or fish swimming in organized schools. So these are not particularly intelligent creatures  and yet  as we'll see  they exhibit beautiful ballets. This is from a BBC show called  Predators   and what we're looking at here are examples of synchrony that have to do with defense. When you're small and vulnerable  like these starlings  or like the fish  it helps to swarm to avoid predators  to confuse predators. Let me be quiet for a second because this is so gorgeous. For a long time  biologists were puzzled by this behavior  wondering how it could be possible. We're so used to choreography giving rise to synchrony. These creatures are not choreographed. They're choreographing themselves. And only today is science starting to figure out how it works. I'll show you a computer model made by Iain Couzin  a researcher at Oxford  that shows how swarms work. There are just three simple rules. First  all the individuals are only aware of their nearest neighbors. Second  all the individuals have a tendency to line up. And third  they're all attracted to each other  but they try to keep a small distance apart. And when you build those three rules in  automatically you start to see swarms that look very much like fish schools or bird flocks. Now  fish like to stay close together  about a body length apart. Birds try to stay about three or four body lengths apart. But except for that difference  the rules are the same for both. Now  all this changes when a predator enters the scene. There's a fourth rule  when a predator's coming  get out of the way. Here on the model you see the predator attacking. The prey move out in random directions  and then the rule of attraction brings them back together again  so there's this constant splitting and reforming. And you see that in nature. Keep in mind that  although it looks as if each individual is acting to cooperate  what's really going on is a kind of selfish Darwinian behavior. Each is scattering away at random to try to save its scales or feathers. That is  out of the desire to save itself  each creature is following these rules  and that leads to something that's safe for all of them. Even though it looks like they're thinking as a group  they're not. You might wonder what exactly is the advantage to being in a swarm  so you can think of several. As I say  if you're in a swarm  your odds of being the unlucky one are reduced as compared to a small group. There are many eyes to spot danger. And you'll see in the example with the starlings  with the birds  when this peregrine hawk is about to attack them  that actually waves of panic can propagate  sending messages over great distances. You'll see    let's see  it's coming up possibly at the very end    maybe not. Information can be sent over half a kilometer away in a very short time through this mechanism. Yes  it's happening here. See if you can see those waves propagating through the swarm. It's beautiful. The birds are  we sort of understand  we think  from that computer model  what's going on. As I say  it's just those three simple rules  plus the one about watch out for predators. There doesn't seem to be anything mystical about this. We don't  however  really understand at a mathematical level. I'm a mathematician. We would like to be able to understand better. I mean  I showed you a computer model  but a computer is not understanding. A computer is  in a way  just another experiment. We would really like to have a deeper insight into how this works and to understand  you know  exactly where this organization comes from. How do the rules give rise to the patterns  There is one case that we have begun to understand better  and it's the case of fireflies. If you see fireflies in North America  like so many North American sorts of things  they tend to be independent operators. They ignore each other. They each do their own thing  flashing on and off  paying no attention to their neighbors. But in Southeast Asia    places like Thailand or Malaysia or Borneo    there's a beautiful cooperative behavior that occurs among male fireflies. You can see it every night along the river banks. The trees  mangrove trees  are filled with fireflies communicating with light. Specifically  it's male fireflies who are all flashing in perfect time together  in perfect synchrony  to reinforce a message to the females. And the message  as you can imagine  is  Come hither. Mate with me.  In a second I'm going to show you a slow motion of a single firefly so that you can get a sense. This is a single frame. Then on  and then off    a   th of a second  there. And then watch this whole river bank  and watch how precise the synchrony is. On  more on and then off. The combined light from these beetles    these are actually tiny beetles    is so bright that fishermen out at sea can use them as navigating beacons to find their way back to their home rivers. It's stunning. For a long time it was not believed when the first Western travelers  like Sir Francis Drake  went to Thailand and came back with tales of this unbelievable spectacle. No one believed them. We don't see anything like this in Europe or in the West. And for a long time  even after it was documented  it was thought to be some kind of optical illusion. Scientific papers were published saying it was twitching eyelids that explained it  or  you know  a human being's tendency to see patterns where there are none. But I hope you've convinced yourself now  with this nighttime video  that they really were very well synchronized. Okay  well  the issue then is  do we need to be alive to see this kind of spontaneous order  and I've already hinted that the answer is no. Well  you don't have to be a whole creature. You can even be just a single cell. Like  take  for instance  your pacemaker cells in your heart right now. They're keeping you alive. Every beat of your heart depends on this crucial region  the sinoatrial node  which has about        independent cells that would each beep  have an electrical rhythm    a voltage up and down    to send a signal to the ventricles to pump. Now  your pacemaker is not a single cell. It's this democracy of        cells that all have to fire in unison for the pacemaker to work correctly. I don't want to give you the idea that synchrony is always a good idea. If you have epilepsy  there is an instance of billions of brain cells  or at least millions  discharging in pathological concert. So this tendency towards order is not always a good thing. You don't have to be alive. You don't have to be even a single cell. If you look  for instance  at how lasers work  that would be a case of atomic synchrony. In a laser  what makes laser light so different from the light above my head here is that this light is incoherent    many different colors and different frequencies  sort of like the way you clapped initially    but if you were a laser  it would be rhythmic applause. It would be all atoms pulsating in unison  emitting light of one color  one frequency. Now comes the very risky part of my talk  which is to demonstrate that inanimate things can synchronize. Hold your breath for me. What I have here are two empty water bottles. This is not Keith Barry doing a magic trick. This is a klutz just playing with some water bottles. I have some metronomes here. Can you hear that  All right  so  I've got a metronome  and it's the world's smallest metronome  the    well  I shouldn't advertise. Anyway  so this is the world's smallest metronome. I've set it on the fastest setting  and I'm going to now take another one set to the same setting. We can try this first. If I just put them on the table together  there's no reason for them to synchronize  and they probably won't. Maybe you'd better listen to them. I'll stand here. What I'm hoping is that they might just drift apart because their frequencies aren't perfectly the same. Right  They did. They were in sync for a while  but then they drifted apart. And the reason is that they're not able to communicate. Now  you might think that's a bizarre idea. How can metronomes communicate  Well  they can communicate through mechanical forces. So I'm going to give them a chance to do that. I also want to wind this one up a bit. How can they communicate  I'm going to put them on a movable platform  which is the  Guide to Graduate Study at Cornell.  Okay  So here it is. Let's see if we can get this to work. My wife pointed out to me that it will work better if I put both on at the same time because otherwise the whole thing will tip over. All right. So there we go. Let's see. OK  I'm not trying to cheat    let me start them out of sync. No  hard to even do that. All right. So before any one goes out of sync  I'll just put those right there. Now  that might seem a bit whimsical  but this pervasiveness of this tendency towards spontaneous order sometimes has unexpected consequences. And a clear case of that  was something that happened in London in the year     . The Millennium Bridge was supposed to be the pride of London    a beautiful new footbridge erected across the Thames  first river crossing in over     years in London. There was a big competition for the design of this bridge  and the winning proposal was submitted by an unusual team    in the TED spirit  actually    of an architect    perhaps the greatest architect in the United Kingdom  Lord Norman Foster    working with an artist  a sculptor  Sir Anthony Caro  and an engineering firm  Ove Arup. And together they submitted a design based on Lord Foster's vision  which was    he remembered as a kid reading Flash Gordon comic books  and he said that when Flash Gordon would come to an abyss  he would shoot what today would be a kind of a light saber. He would shoot his light saber across the abyss  making a blade of light  and then scamper across on this blade of light. He said   That's the vision I want to give to London. I want a blade of light across the Thames.  So they built the blade of light  and it's a very thin ribbon of steel  the world's    probably the flattest and thinnest suspension bridge there is  with cables that are out on the side. You're used to suspension bridges with big droopy cables on the top. These cables were on the side of the bridge  like if you took a rubber band and stretched it taut across the Thames    that's what's holding up this bridge. Now  everyone was very excited to try it out. On opening day  thousands of Londoners came out  and something happened. And within two days the bridge was closed to the public. So I want to first show you some interviews with people who were on the bridge on opening day  who will describe what happened. Man  It really started moving sideways and slightly up and down  rather like being on the boat. Woman  Yeah  it felt unstable  and it was very windy  and I remember it had lots of flags up and down the sides  so you could definitely    there was something going on sideways  it felt  maybe. Interviewer  Not up and down  Boy  No. Interviewer  And not forwards and backwards  Boy  No. Interviewer  Just sideways. About how much was it moving  do you think  Boy  It was about    Interviewer  I mean  that much  or this much  Boy  About the second one. Interviewer  This much  Boy  Yeah. Man  It was at least six  six to eight inches  I would have thought. Interviewer  Right  so  at least this much  Man  Oh  yes. Woman  I remember wanting to get off. Interviewer  Oh  did you  Woman  Yeah. It felt odd. Interviewer  So it was enough to be scary  Woman  Yeah  but I thought that was just me. Interviewer  Ah  Now  tell me why you had to do this  Boy  We had to do this because  to keep in balance because if you didn't keep your balance  then you would just fall over about  like  to the left or right  about    degrees. Interviewer  So just show me how you walk normally. Right. And then show me what it was like when the bridge started to go. Right. So you had to deliberately push your feet out sideways and    oh  and short steps  Man  That's right. And it seemed obvious to me that it was probably the number of people on it. Interviewer  Were they deliberately walking in step  or anything like that  Man  No  they just had to conform to the movement of the bridge. Steven Strogatz  All right  so that already gives you a hint of what happened. Think of the bridge as being like this platform. Think of the people as being like metronomes. Now  you might not be used to thinking of yourself as a metronome  but after all  we do walk like    I mean  we oscillate back and forth as we walk. And especially if we start to walk like those people did  right  They all showed this strange sort of skating gait that they adopted once the bridge started to move. And so let me show you now the footage of the bridge. But also  after you see the bridge on opening day  you'll see an interesting clip of work done by a bridge engineer at Cambridge named Allan McRobie  who figured out what happened on the bridge  and who built a bridge simulator to explain exactly what the problem was. It was a kind of unintended positive feedback loop between the way the people walked and the way the bridge began to move  that engineers knew nothing about. Actually  I think the first person you'll see is the young engineer who was put in charge of this project. Okay. Interviewer  Right. So it was quite small    Engineer  Yes. Interviewer     but real  Engineer  Absolutely. Interviewer  You thought   Oh  bother.  Engineer  I felt I was disappointed about it. We'd spent a lot of time designing this bridge  and we'd analyzed it  we'd checked it to codes    to heavier loads than the codes    and here it was doing something that we didn't know about. Interviewer  You didn't expect. Engineer  Exactly. Narrator  The most dramatic and shocking footage shows whole sections of the crowd    hundreds of people    apparently rocking from side to side in unison  not only with each other  but with the bridge. This synchronized movement seemed to be driving the bridge. But how could the crowd become synchronized  Was there something special about the Millennium Bridge that caused this effect  This was to be the focus of the investigation. Interviewer  Well  at last the simulated bridge is finished  and I can make it wobble. Now  Allan  this is all your fault  isn't it  Allan McRobie  Yes. Interviewer  You designed this  yes  this simulated bridge  and this  you reckon  mimics the action of the real bridge  AM  It captures a lot of the physics  yes. Interviewer  Right. So if we get on it  we should be able to wobble it  yes  Allan McRobie is a bridge engineer from Cambridge who wrote to me  suggesting that a bridge simulator ought to wobble in the same way as the real bridge    provided we hung it on pendulums of exactly the right length. AM  This one's only a couple of tons  so it's fairly easy to get going. Just by walking. Interviewer  Well  it's certainly going now. AM  It doesn't have to be a real dangle. Just walk. It starts to go. Interviewer  It's actually quite difficult to walk. You have to be careful where you put your feet down  don't you  because if you get it wrong  it just throws you off your feet. AM  It certainly affects the way you walk  yes. You can't walk normally on it. Interviewer  No. If you try and put one foot in front of another  it's moving your feet away from under you. AM  Yes. Interviewer  So you've got to put your feet out sideways. So already  the simulator is making me walk in exactly the same way as our witnesses walked on the real bridge. AM  ... ice skating gait. There isn't all this sort of snake way of walking. Interviewer  For a more convincing experiment  I wanted my own opening day crowd  the sound check team. Their instructions  just walk normally. It's really intriguing because none of these people is trying to drive it. They're all having some difficulty walking. And the only way you can walk comfortably is by getting in step. But then  of course  everyone is driving the bridge. You can't help it. You're actually forced by the movement of the bridge to get into step  and therefore to drive it to move further. SS  All right  well  with that from the Ministry of Silly Walks  maybe I'd better end. I see I've gone over. But I hope that you'll go outside and see the world in a new way  to see all the amazing synchrony around us. Thank you. It's amazing  when you meet a head of state and you say   What is your most precious natural resource      they will not say children at first. And then when you say children  they will pretty quickly agree with you. the Minister of Defense of Colombia  head of the army and the head of the police  and we're dropping off     laptops today to children who have no television  no telephone and have been in a community cut off from the rest of the world for the past    years. The importance of delivering laptops to this region is connecting kids who have otherwise been unconnected because of the FARC  the guerrillas that started off    years ago as a political movement and then became a drug movement. There are one billion children in the world  and    percent of them don't have electricity at home or at school. And in some countries    let me pick Afghanistan       percent of the little girls don't go to school. And I don't mean that they drop out of school in the third or fourth grade    they don't go. So in the three years since I talked at TED and showed a prototype  it's gone from an idea to a real laptop. We have half a million laptops today in the hands of children. We have about a quarter of a million in transit to those and other children  and then there are another quarter of a million more that are being ordered at this moment. So  in rough numbers  there are a million laptops. That's smaller than I predicted    I predicted three to    million    but is still a very large number. In Colombia  we have about       laptops. It's the Minister of Defense with whom we're working  not the Minister of Education  because it is seen as a strategic defense issue in the sense of liberating these zones that had been completely closed off  in which the people who had been causing  if you will     years' worth of bombings and kidnappings and assassinations lived. And suddenly  the kids have connected laptops. They've leapfrogged. The change is absolutely monumental  because it's not just opening it up  but it's opening it up to the rest of the world. So yes  they're building roads  yes  they're putting in telephone  yes  there will be television. But the kids six to    years old are surfing the Internet in Spanish and in local languages  so the children grow up with access to information  with a window into the rest of the world. Before  they were closed off. Interestingly enough  in other countries  it will be the Minister of Finance who sees it as an engine of economic growth. And that engine is going to see the results in    years. It's not going to happen  you know  in one year  but it's an important  deeply economic and cultural change that happens through children. Thirty one countries in total are involved  and in the case of Uruguay  half the children already have them  and by the middle of       every single child in Uruguay will have a laptop    a little green laptop. Now what are some of the results  Some of the results that go across every single country include teachers saying they have never loved teaching so much  and reading comprehension measured by third parties    not by us    skyrockets. Probably the most important thing we see is children teaching parents. They own the laptops. They take them home. And so when I met with three children from the schools  who had traveled all day to come to Bogota  one of the three children brought her mother. And the reason she brought her mother is that this six year old child had been teaching her mother how to read and write. Her mother had not gone to primary school. And this is such an inversion  and such a wonderful example of children being the agents of change. So now  in closing  people say  now why laptops  Laptops are a luxury  it's like giving them iPods. No. The reason you want laptops is that the word is education  not laptop. This is an education project  not a laptop project. They need to learn learning. And then  just think    they can have  let's say      books. In a village  you have     laptops  each with a different set of     books  and so that village suddenly has        books. You and I didn't have        books when we went to primary school. Sometimes school is under a tree  or in many cases  the teacher has only a fifth grade education  so you need a collaborative model of learning  not just building more schools and training more teachers  which you have to do anyway. So we're once again doing  Give One  Get One.  Last year  we ran a  Give One  Get One  program  and it generated over         laptops that we were then able to give free. And by being a zero dollar laptop  we can go to countries that can't afford it at all. And that's what we did. We went to Haiti  we went to Rwanda  Afghanistan  Ethiopia  Mongolia. Places that are not markets  seeding it with the principles of saturation  connectivity  low ages  etc. And then we can actually roll out large numbers. So think of it this way  think of it as inoculating children against ignorance. And think of the laptop as a vaccine. You don't vaccinate a few children. You vaccinate all the children in an area. There are more Chinese restaurants in this country than McDonald's  Burger King  Kentucky Fried Chicken and Wendy's  combined            actually. Chinese restaurants have played an important role in American history  as a matter of fact. The Cuban missile crisis was resolved in a Chinese restaurant called Yenching Palace in Washington  D.C.  which unfortunately is closed now  and about to be turned into Walgreen's. And the house that John Wilkes Booth planned the assassination of Abraham Lincoln is actually also now a Chinese restaurant called Wok 'n Roll  on H Street in Washington. And it's not completely gratuitous  because wok and roll    Chinese food and Japanese foods  so it kind of works out. And Americans love their Chinese food so much they've actually brought it into space. NASA  for example  serves thermal stabilized sweet and sour pork on its shuttle menu for its astronauts. So  let me present the question to you  If our benchmark for Americanness is apple pie  you should ask yourself  how often do you eat apple pie  versus how often do you eat Chinese food. Right  And if you think about it  a lot of the foods that you think of or we think of or Americans think of as Chinese food are barely recognizable to Chinese  for example  beef with broccoli  egg rolls  General Tso's Chicken  fortune cookies  chop suey  the take out boxes. For example  I took a whole bunch of fortune cookies back to China  gave them to Chinese to see how they would react. What is this  Should I try it  Try it  What is it called  Fortune cookie. There's a piece of paper inside  What is this  You've won a prize  What is this  It's a fortune  Tasty  So  where are they from  The short answer is  actually  they're from Japan. And in Kyoto  outside  there are still small family run bakeries that make fortune cookies  as they did over     years ago     years before fortune cookies were introduced in the United States. If you see them side by side  there's yellow and brown. Theirs are actually flavored with miso and sesame paste  so they're not as sweet as our version. So  how did they get to the United States  Well  the short answer is  the Japanese immigrants came over  and a bunch of the bakers introduced them    including at least one in Los Angeles  and one here in San Francisco called Benkyo do  which is on the corner of Sutter and Buchanan. They back then  actually  made fortune cookies using very much the similar kind of irons that we saw back in Kyoto. So  the interesting question is  how do you go from fortune cookies being something that is Japanese to being something that is Chinese  Well  the short answer is  we locked up all the Japanese during World War II  including those that made fortune cookies  so that's the time when the Chinese moved in  kind of saw a market opportunity and took over. So  fortune cookies  invented by the Japanese  popularized by the Chinese  but ultimately consumed by Americans. They are more American than anything else. Another one of my favorite dishes  General Tso's Chicken    which  by the way  in the US Naval Academy is called Admiral Tso's Chicken. I love this dish. The original name in my book was actually called The Long March of General Tso  and he has marched very far indeed  because he is sweet  he is fried  and he is chicken    all things that Americans love. He has marched so far  actually  that the chef who originally invented the dish doesn't recognize it  he's kind of horrified. He's in Taiwan right now. He's retired  deaf and plays a lot of Mahjong. So  he    after this I showed him  he got up  and he's like   Mominqimiao   which means   This is all nonsense   and goes back to play his Mahjong game during the afternoon. So  another dish. One of my favorites. Beef with broccoli. Broccoli is not a Chinese vegetable  in fact  it is originally an Italian vegetable. It was introduced into the United States in the     s  but became popularized in the     s and the     s. In fact  the Chinese had their own version of broccoli  which is called Chinese broccoli  but right now  what    they've now discovered American broccoli  and are importing it as a  sort of  exotic delicacy. I guarantee you  General Tso never saw a stalk of broccoli in his life    and indeed  that actually was a picture of General Tso. I went to his home town. This is a billboard that says   Welcome to the birthplace of General Tso.  And I went looking for chicken. Finally found a cow    and did find chicken. Believe it or not  these guys were actually crossing the road. And       I actually found a whole bunch of General Tso's relatives who are still in the little town. This guy is now five generations removed from the General  this guy is about seven. Showed them all the pictures of General Tso Chicken that I showed you  and they're like  we don't know this dish. And then they're like  is this Chinese food  Because it doesn't look like Chinese food to them. But they weren't kind of surprised I traveled around the world to visit them  because in their eyes he is  after all  a famous Qing dynasty military hero. He played an important role in the Taiping rebellion  which was a war started by a guy who thought he was the son of God and the baby brother of Jesus Christ. And caused the war that killed    million people    still the deadliest civil war in the world to this day. So  you know  I realized when I was there  General Tso is kind of a lot like Colonel Sanders in America  in that he's known for chicken and not war. But in China  this guy's actually known for war and not chicken. But the granddaddy of all the Chinese American dishes we probably ought to talk about is chop suey  which was introduced around the turn of the   th century. And according to New York Times  in       there was an outbreak of Chinese restaurants all over town  and  the city has gone 'chop suey' mad.  So it took about    years before the Americans realized that  whoa  chop suey is actually not known in China. And as this article points out   The average native of any city in China knows nothing of chop suey.  You know  back then it was a way to show that you were sophisticated and cosmopolitan  if you were a guy and you wanted to impress a girl  you could take her out on a chop suey date. I like to say chop suey's the biggest culinary joke that one culture has ever played on another  because chop suey  if you translate into Chinese  means tsap sui  which  if you translate back  means  odds and ends.  So  these people are going around China asking for chop suey  which is sort of like a Japanese guy coming here and saying  I understand you have a very popular dish in your country called  leftovers   and it is particularly       right  And not only that  this dish is particularly popular after that holiday you call Thanksgiving. So  why    why and where    did chop suey come from  Let's go back to mid     s when the Chinese first came to America. Now back then  the Americans were not clamoring to eat Chinese food. In fact  they saw this people who landed at their shores as alien. These people weren't eating dogs    they were eating cats    and they weren't eating cats    they were eating rats. In fact  The New York Times  my esteemed employer  in      ran an article that asked   Do Chinese eat rats   And not the most PC question to be asked today  but if you kind of look at the popular imagery of the time  not so outlandish. This is actually a real advertisement for rat poison from the late     s  and if you see  under the word  Clears     very small    it says   They must go   which refers not only to the rats  but to the Chinese in their midst  because the way that the food was perceived was that these people who ate foods different from us must be different from us. And another way that you saw  sort of  this sort of  this antipathy towards the Chinese is through documents like this. This is actually in the Library of Congress  it is a pamphlet published by Samuel Gompers  hero of our American labor movement  and it's called   Some Reason for Chinese Exclusion  Meat versus Rice  American Manhood against Asiatic Coolieism  Which shall survive  And it basically made the argument that Chinese men who ate rice would necessarily bring down the standard of living for American men who ate meat. And as a matter of fact  then  this is one of the reasons why we must exclude them from this country So  with sentiments like these  the Chinese Exclusion Act was sort of passed between      and       the only time in American history when a group was specifically excluded for its national origin or ethnicity. So  in a way  because the Chinese were attacked  chop suey was created as a defense mechanism. Now  who came up with the idea of chop suey  There's a lot of different mysteries  a lot of different legends  but of the ones that I've found that I thought was most interesting is this article from     . A Chinese guy named Lem Sen shows up in Chinatown  New York City  and says  I want you guys all to stop making chop suey  because I am the original creator and sole proprietor of the dish known as chop suey. And the way that he tells it  there was a guy  there was a famous Chinese diplomat that showed up  and he was told to make a dish that looked very popular and could  quote   pass  as Chinese. And as he said    we would never print this today    but basically  the American man has become very rich. Lem Sen  who's this guy  I would have made this money  too  but I've spent all this time looking for the American man who stole my recipe. Now I've come and found him  and I want my recipe back and I want everyone to stop making chop suey  or pay me for the right to do the same. So it was an early exercise of intellectual property rights. So the thing is  this kind of idea of Chinese American food doesn't exist only in America. In fact  if you think about it  Chinese food is the most pervasive food on the planet  served on all seven continents  even Antarctica  because Monday night is Chinese food night at McMurdo Station  which is the main scientific station in Antarctica. So  you see different varieties of Chinese food. For example  there is French Chinese food  where they serve salt and pepper frog legs. There is Italian Chinese food  where they don't have fortune cookies  so they serve fried gelato. My downstairs neighbor  Alessandra  was completely shocked when I told her   Dude  fried gelato is not Chinese.  She's like   It's not  But they serve it in all the Chinese restaurants in Italy.  And even the Brits have their own version. This is a dish called crispy shredded beef  which has a lot of crisp  a lot of shred  and not a lot of beef. There is West Indian Chinese food  there's Jamaican Chinese food  there is Middle Eastern Chinese food  there's Mauritian Chinese food. This is a dish called Magic Bowl that I discovered. There's Indian Chinese food  Korean Chinese food  Japanese Chinese food  where they take the bao  the little buns  and they make them into pizza versions  and they take    and they    like  totally randomly they'll take Chinese noodle dishes  and they'll just Ramen ize them. This is  like  this is something that in the Chinese version has no soup. So  there's Peruvian Chinese food  which should not be mixed with Mexican Chinese food  where they basically take things and make it look like fajitas. And then    one thing  they have things like risotto chop suey. My personal favorite of all the restaurants I've encountered around the world was this one in Brazil  called  Kung Food.  So  let's take a step back  and kind of  understand what is to be appreciated in America. McDonald's has  sort of  garnered a lot of attention  a lot of respect  for basically standardizing the menu  d cor and dining experience in post World War II America. But you know what  They actually did so through a centralized headquarters out of Illinois  right  Chinese restaurants have done largely the same thing  I would argue  with the menu and the d cor    even the restaurant name    but without a centralized headquarters. So  this actually became very clear to me with the March          Powerball drawing  where  you know  they expected  based on the number of ticket sales they had  to have three or four second place winners    those are the people who match five or six Powerball numbers. Instead  they had      and they were completely shocked. They looked all across the country  and discovered it couldn't necessarily be fraud  because it happened  you know  in different states  across different computer systems. So whatever it was  it caused people to sort of behave in a mass synchronized way. So  like  OK  maybe it had to do with the patterns on the little pieces of paper    you know  like  it was a diamond  or  you know  diagonal. It wasn't that. It wasn't that  so they're like  OK  let's look at television  so they looked at an episode of  Lost.  Now  I don't have a TV  which makes me a freak  but very productive  and       and this episode of  Lost   I understand  where the overweight guy has a lucky number which was not a lucky number  which was how long they'd been on the island  but they looked  and the numbers did not match. So they looked at  The Young and The Restless   and it wasn't that  either. So  it wasn't until the first guy shows up the next day  and they ask him   Where did you get your number from   He's like   Oh  I got it from a fortune cookie.  This actually is a slip that one of the winners had  because the Tennessee lottery security officials were like  oh  no    like  this can't be true. But it was true  and basically  of those     people  and     of them or so had gotten their number from the fortune cookie. Yeah. So  I went and started looking. I went across the country  looking for these restaurants where these people had gotten their fortune cookies from. You know  there are a bunch of them  including Lee's China in Omaha    which is actually run by Koreans  but that's another point    and a bunch of them named China Buffet. So  what's interesting is that their stories were similar  but they were different. It was lunch  it was take out  it was sit down  it was buffet  it was three weeks ago  it was three months ago. But at some point  all these people had a very similar experience that converged at a fortune cookie and at a Chinese restaurant  and all these Chinese restaurants were serving fortune cookies  which  of course we know aren't even Chinese to begin with. So it's kind of part of the phenomenon I called spontaneous self organization  right  where  like in ant colonies  where little decisions made by    on the micro level actually have a big impact on the macro level. So  a good sort of contrast is Chicken McNuggets. McDonald's actually spent    years coming out with a chicken like product. They did chicken pot pie  they did fried chicken  and then they finally introduced Chicken McNuggets. And the great innovation of Chicken McNuggets was not nuggetfying them  because that's kind of an easy concept  but the trick behind Chicken McNuggets was  they were able to remove the chicken from the bone in a cost effective manner  which is why it took so long for other people to copy them. It took    years  and then within a couple of months  it was such a hit they just introduced it and rolled it across the entire system of McDonald's in the country. In contrast  we have General Tso's Chicken  which actually started in New York City in the early     s  as I was also starting in the university in New York City in the early     s  so ... And this logo  So me  General Tso's Chicken and this logo are all karmacally related. But that dish also took about    years to spread across America from a random restaurant in New York City. Someone's like  oh  God    it's sweet  it's fried  it's chicken  Americans will love this. So  what I like to say  you know  this being sort of Bay Area  Silicon Valley    is that we think of McDonald's as sort of the Microsoft of the dining experiences. We can think of Chinese restaurants perhaps as Linux  sort of an open source thing  right  where ideas from one person can be copied and propagated across the entire system  that there can be specialized versions of Chinese food  you know  depending on the region. For example  you know  in New Orleans we have Cajun Chinese food  where they serve Sichuan alligator and sweet and sour crawfish  right  And in Philadelphia  you have Philadelphia cheesesteak roll  which looks like an egg roll on the outside  but a cheesesteak on the inside. I was really surprised to discover that  not only in Philadelphia  but also in Atlanta  because what had happened was that a Chinese family had moved from Atlanta to    sorry  from Philadelphia to Atlanta  and brought that with them. So  the thing is  our historical lore  because of the way we like narratives  are full of vast characters such as  you know  Howard Schultz of Starbucks and Ray Kroc with McDonald's and Asa Chandler with Coca Cola. But  you know  it's very easy to overlook the smaller characters    oops    for example  like Lem Sen  who introduced chop suey  Chef Peng  who introduced General Tso Chicken  and all the Japanese bakers who introduced fortune cookies. So  the point of my presentation is to make you think twice  that those whose names are forgotten in history can often have had as much  if not more  impact on what we eat today. So. Thank you very much. I'll just start talking about the   th century. I hope nobody finds that offensive. I    you know  when I    after I had invented PCR  I kind of needed a change. And I moved down to La Jolla and learned how to surf. And I started living down there on the beach for a long time. And when surfers are out waiting for waves  you probably wonder  if you've never been out there  what are they doing  You know  sometimes there's a         minute break out there when you're waiting for a wave to come in. They usually talk about the   th century. You know  they get a real bad rap in the world. People think they're sort of lowbrows. One day  somebody suggested I read this book. It was called    it was called  The Air Pump   or something like  The Leviathan and The Air Pump.  It was a real weird book about the   th century. And I realized  the roots of the way I sort of thought was just the only natural way to think about things. That    you know  I was born thinking about things that way  and I had always been like a little scientist guy. And when I went to find out something  I used scientific methods. I wasn't real surprised  you know  when they first told me how    how you were supposed to do science  because I'd already been doing it for fun and whatever. But it didn't    it never occurred to me that it had to be invented and that it had been invented only     years ago. You know  it was    like it happened in England  and Germany  and Italy sort of all at the same time. And the story of that  I thought  was really fascinating. So I'm going to talk a little bit about that  and what exactly is it that scientists are supposed to do. And it's  it's a kind of    You know  Charles I got beheaded somewhere early in the   th century. And the English set up Cromwell and a whole bunch of Republicans or whatever  and not the kind of Republicans we had. They changed the government  and it didn't work. And Charles II  the son  was finally put back on the throne of England. He was really nervous  because his dad had been  you know  beheaded for being the King of England And he was nervous about the fact that conversations that got going in  like  bars and stuff would turn to    this is kind of    it's hard to believe  but people in the   th century in England were starting to talk about  you know  philosophy and stuff in bars. They didn't have TV screens  and they didn't have any football games to watch. And they would get really pissy  and all of a sudden people would spill out into the street and fight about issues like whether or not it was okay if Robert Boyle made a device called the vacuum pump. Now  Boyle was a friend of Charles II. He was a Christian guy during the weekends  but during the week he was a scientist. Which was    back then it was sort of  you know  well  you know    if you made this thing    he made this little device  like kind of like a bicycle pump in reverse that could suck all the air out of    you know what a bell jar is  One of these things  you pick it up  put it down  and it's got a seal  and you can see inside of it  so you can see what's going on inside this thing. But what he was trying to do was to pump all the air out of there  and see what would happen inside there. I mean  the first    I think one of the first experiments he did was he put a bird in there. And people in the   th century  they didn't really understand the same way we do about you know  this stuff is a bunch of different kinds of molecules  and we breathe it in for a purpose and all that. I mean  fish don't know much about water  and people didn't know much about air. But both started exploring it. One thing  he put a bird in there  and he pumped all the air out  and the bird died. So he said  hmm... He said    he called what he'd done as making    they didn't call it a vacuum pump at the time. Now you call it a vacuum pump  he called it a vacuum. Right  And immediately  he got into trouble with the local clergy who said  you can't make a vacuum. Ah  uh    Aristotle said that nature abhors one. I think it was a poor translation  probably  but people relied on authorities like that. And you know  Boyle says  well  shit. I make them all the time. I mean  whatever that is that kills the bird    and I'm calling it a vacuum. And the religious people said that if God wanted you to make    I mean  God is everywhere  that was one of their rules  is God is everywhere. And a vacuum    there's nothing in a vacuum  so you've    God couldn't be in there. So therefore the church said that you can't make a vacuum  you know. And Boyle said  bullshit. I mean  you want to call it Godless  you know  you call it Godless. But that's not my job. I'm not into that. I do that on the weekend. And like    what I'm trying to do is figure out what happens when you suck everything out of a compartment. And he did all these cute little experiments. Like he did one with    he had a little wheel  like a fan  that was sort of loosely attached  so it could spin by itself. He had another fan opposed to it that he had like a    I mean  the way I would have done this would be  like  a rubber band  and  you know  around a tinker toy kind of fan. I know exactly how he did it  I've seen the drawings. It's two fans  one which he could turn from outside after he got the vacuum established  and he discovered that if he pulled all the air out of it  the one fan would no longer turn the other one  right  Something was missing  you know. I mean  these are    it's kind of weird to think that someone had to do an experiment to show that  but that was what was going on at the time. And like  there was big arguments about it in the    you know  the gin houses and in the coffee shops and stuff. And Charles started not liking that. Charles II was kind of saying  you know  you should keep that    let's make a place where you can do this stuff where people don't get so    you know  we don't want the    we don't want to get the people mad at me again. And so    because when they started talking about religion and science and stuff like that  that's when it had sort of gotten his father in trouble. And so  Charles said  I'm going to put up the money give you guys a building  come here and you can meet in the building  but just don't talk about religion in there. And that was fine with Boyle. He said  OK  we're going to start having these meetings. And anybody who wants to do science is    this is about the time that Isaac Newton was starting to whip out a lot of really interesting things. And there was all kind of people that would come to the Royal Society  they called it. You had to be dressed up pretty well. It wasn't like a TED conference. That was the only criteria  was that you be    you looked like a gentleman  and they'd let anybody could come. You didn't have to be a member then. And so  they would come in and you would do    Anybody that was going to show an experiment  which was kind of a new word at the time  demonstrate some principle  they had to do it on stage  where everybody could see it. So they were    the really important part of this was  you were not supposed to talk about final causes  for instance. And God was out of the picture. The actual nature of reality was not at issue. You're not supposed to talk about the absolute nature of anything. You were not supposed to talk about anything that you couldn't demonstrate. So if somebody could see it  you could say  here's how the machine works  here's what we do  and then here's what happens. And seeing what happens  it was OK to generalize  and say  I'm sure that this will happen anytime we make one of these things. And so you can start making up some rules. You say  anytime you have a vacuum state  you will discover that one wheel will not turn another one  if the only connection between them is whatever was there before the vacuum. That kind of thing. Candles can't burn in a vacuum  therefore  probably sparklers wouldn't either. It's not clear  actually sparklers will  but they didn't know that. They didn't have sparklers. But  they       you can make up rules  but they have to relate only to the things that you've been able to demonstrate. And most the demonstrations had to do with visuals. Like if you do an experiment on stage  and nobody can see it  they can just hear it  they would probably think you were freaky. I mean  reality is what you can see. That wasn't an explicit rule in the meeting  but I'm sure that was part of it  you know. If people hear voices  and they can't see and associate it with somebody  that person's probably not there. But the general idea that you could only    you could only really talk about things in that place that had some kind of experimental basis. It didn't matter what Thomas Hobbes  who was a local philosopher  said about it  you know  because you weren't going to be talking final causes. What's happening here  in the middle of the   th century  was that what became my field    science  experimental science    was pulling itself away  and it was in a physical way  because we're going to do it in this room over here  but it was also what    it was an amazing thing that happened. Science had been all interlocked with theology  and philosophy  and    and    and mathematics  which is really not science. But experimental science had been tied up with all those things. And the mathematics part and the experimental science part was pulling away from philosophy. And    things    we never looked back. It's been so cool since then. I mean  it just    it just    untangled a thing that was really impeding technology from being developed. And  I mean  everybody in this room    now  this is     short years ago. Remember  that's a short time. It was          probably  years ago that most of us  the ancestors of most of us in this room came up out of Africa and turned to the left. You know  the ones that turned to the right  there are some of those in the Japanese translation. But that happened very    a long time ago compared to     short years ago. But in that     years  the place has just undergone a lot of changes. In fact  everybody in this room probably  especially if you picked up your bag    some of you  I know  didn't pick up your bags    but if you picked up your bag  everybody in this room has got in their pocket  or back in their room  something that     years ago  kings would have gone to war to have. I mean  if you can think how important    If you have a GPS system and there are no satellites  it's not going to be much use. But  like    but  you know  if somebody had a GPS system in the   th century some king would have gotten together an army and gone to get it  you know. If that person    Audience  For the teddy bear  The teddy bear  Kary Mullis  They might have done it for the teddy bear  yeah. But    all of us own stuff. I mean  individuals own things that kings would have definitely gone to war to get. And this is just     years. Not a whole lot of people doing this stuff. You know  the important people    you can almost read about their lives  about all the really important people that made advances  you know. And  I mean    this kind of stuff  you know  all this stuff came from that separation of this little sort of thing that we do    now I  when I was a boy was born sort of with this idea that if you want to know something    you know  maybe it's because my old man was gone a lot  and my mother didn't really know much science  but I thought if you want to know something about stuff  you do it    you make an experiment  you know. You get    you get  like    I just had a natural feeling for science and setting up experiments. I thought that was the way everybody had always thought. I thought that anybody with any brains will do it that way. It isn't true. I mean  there's a lot of people    You know  I was one of those scientists that was    got into trouble the other night at dinner because of the post modernism thing. And I didn't mean  you know    where is that lady  Audience  Here. KM  I mean  I didn't really think of that as an argument so much as just a lively discussion. I didn't take it personally  but    I just    I had    I naively had thought  until this surfing experience started me into the   th century  I'd thought that's just the way people thought  and everybody did  and they recognized reality by what they could see or touch or feel or hear. At any rate  when I was a boy  I  like  for instance  I had this    I got this little book from Fort Sill  Oklahoma    This is about the time that George Dyson's dad was starting to blow nuclear    thinking about blowing up nuclear rockets and stuff. I was thinking about making my own little rockets. And I knew that frogs    little frogs    had aspirations of space travel  just like people. And I    I was looking for a    a propulsion system that would like  make a rocket  like  maybe about four feet high go up a couple of miles. And  I mean  that was my sort of goal. I wanted it to go out of sight and then I wanted this little parachute to come back with the frog in it. And    I    I    I got this book from Fort Sill  Oklahoma  where there's a missile base. They send it out for amateur rocketeers  and it said in there do not ever heat a mixture of potassium perchlorate and sugar. You know  that's what you call a lead. You sort of    now you say  well  let's see if I can get hold of some potassium chlorate and sugar  perchlorate and sugar  and heat it  it would be interesting to see what it is they don't want me to do  and what it is going to    and how is it going to work. And we didn't have    like  my mother presided over the back yard from an upstairs window  where she would be ironing or something like that. And she was usually just sort of keeping an eye on  and if there was any puffs of smoke out there  she'd lean out and admonish us all not to blow our eyes out. That was her    You know  that was kind of the worst thing that could happen to us. That's why I thought  as long as I don't blow my eyes out... I may not care about the fact that it's prohibited from heating this solution. I'm going to do it carefully  but I'll do it. It's like anything else that's prohibited  you do it behind the garage. So  I went to the drug store and I tried to buy some potassium perchlorate and it wasn't unreasonable then for a kid to walk into a drug store and buy chemicals. Nowadays  it's no ma'am  check your shoes. And like    But then it wasn't    they didn't have any  but the guy had    I said  what kind of salts of potassium do you have  You know. And he had potassium nitrate. And I said  that might do the same thing  whatever it is. I'm sure it's got to do with rockets or it wouldn't be in that manual. And so I    I did some experiments. You know  I started off with little tiny amounts of potassium nitrate and sugar  which was readily available  and I mixed it in different proportions  and I tried to light it on fire. Just to see what would happen  if you mixed it together. And it    they burned. It burned kind of slow  but it made a nice smell  compared to other rocket fuels I had tried  that all had sulfur in them. And  it smelt like burnt candy. And then I tried the melting business  and I melted it. And then it melted into a little sort of syrupy liquid  brown. And then it cooled down to a brick hard substance  that when you lit that  it went off like a bat. I mean  the little bowl of that stuff that had cooled down    you'd light it  and it would just start dancing around the yard. And I said  there is a way to get a frog up to where he wants to go. So I started developing    you know  George's dad had a lot of help. I just had my brother. But I    it took me about    it took me about  I'd say  six months to finally figure out all the little things. There's a lot of little things involved in making a rocket that it will actually work  even after you have the fuel. But you do it  by    what I just   you know  you do experiments  and you write down things sometimes  you make observations  you know. And then you slowly build up a theory of how this stuff works. And it was    I was following all the rules. I didn't know what the rules were  I'm a natural born scientist  I guess  or some kind of a throwback to the   th century  whatever. But at any rate  we finally did have a device that would reproduceably put a frog out of sight and get him back alive. And we had not    I mean  we weren't frightened by it. We should have been  because it made a lot of smoke and it made a lot of noise  and it was powerful  you know. And once in a while  they would blow up. But I wasn't worried  by the way  about  you know  the explosion causing the destruction of the planet. I hadn't heard about the    ways that we should be afraid of the    By the way  I could have thought  I'd better not do this because they say not to  you know. And I'd better get permission from the government. If I'd have waited around for that  I would have never    the frog would have died  you know. At any rate  I bring it up because it's a good story  and he said  tell personal things  you know  and that's a personal    I was going to tell you about the first night that I met my wife  but that would be too personal  wouldn't it. So  so I've got something else that's not personal. But that... process is what I think of as science  see  where you start with some idea  and then instead of  like  looking up  every authority that you've ever heard of I    sometimes you do that  if you're going to write a paper later  you want to figure out who else has worked on it. But in the actual process  you get an idea    like  when I got the idea one night that I could amplify DNA with two oligonucleotides  and I could make lots of copies of some little piece of DNA  you know  the thinking for that was about    minutes while I was driving my car  and then instead of going    I went back and I did talk to people about it  but if I'd listened to what I heard from all my friends who were molecular biologists    I would have abandoned it. You know  if I had gone back looking for an authority figure who could tell me if it would work or not  he would have said  no  it probably won't. Because the results of it were so spectacular that if it worked it was going to change everybody's goddamn way of doing molecular biology. Nobody wants a chemist to come in and poke around in their stuff like that and change things. But if you go to authority  and you always don't    you don't always get the right answer  see. But I knew  you'd go into the lab and you'd try to make it work yourself. And then you're the authority  and you can say  I know it works  because right there in that tube is where it happened  and here  on this gel  there's a little band there that I know that's DNA  and that's the DNA I wanted to amplify  so there  So it does work. You know  that's how you do science. And then you say  well  what can make it work better  And then you figure out better and better ways to do it. But you always work from  from like  facts that you have made available to you by doing experiments  things that you could do on a stage. And no tricky shit behind the thing. I mean  it's all    you've got to be very honest with what you're doing if it really is going to work. I mean  you can't make up results  and then do another experiment based on that one. So you have to be honest. And I'm basically honest. I have a fairly bad memory  and dishonesty would always get me in trouble  if I  like    so I've just sort of been naturally honest and naturally inquisitive  and that sort of leads to that kind of science. Now  let's see... I've got another five minutes  right  OK. All scientists aren't like that. You know    and there is a lot    There is a lot    a lot has been going on since Isaac Newton and all that stuff happened. One of the things that happened right around World War II in that same time period before  and as sure as hell afterwards  government got    realized that scientists aren't strange dudes that  you know  hide in ivory towers and do ridiculous things with test tube. Scientists  you know  made World War II as we know it quite possible. They made faster things. They made bigger guns to shoot them down with. You know  they made drugs to give the pilots if they were broken up in the process. They made all kinds of    and then finally one giant bomb to end the whole thing  right  And everybody stepped back a little and said  you know  we ought to invest in this shit  because whoever has got the most of these people working in the places is going to have a dominant position  at least in the military  and probably in all kind of economic ways. And they got involved in it  and the scientific and industrial establishment was born  and out of that came a lot of scientists who were in there for the money  you know  because it was suddenly available. And they weren't the curious little boys that liked to put frogs up in the air. They were the same people that later went in to medical school  you know  because there was money in it  you know. I mean  later  then they all got into business    I mean  there are waves of    going into your high school  person saying  you want to be rich  you know  be a scientist. You know  not anymore. You want to be rich  you be a businessman. But a lot of people got in it for the money and the power and the travel. That's back when travel was easy. And those people don't think    they don't    they don't always tell you the truth  you know. There is nothing in their contract  in fact  that makes it to their advantage always  to tell you the truth. And the people I'm talking about are people that like    they say that they're a member of the committee called  say  the Inter Governmental Panel on Climate Change. And they    and they have these big meetings where they try to figure out how we're going to    how we're going to continually prove that the planet is getting warmer  when that's actually contrary to most people's sensations. I mean  if you actually measure the temperature over a period    I mean  the temperature has been measured now pretty carefully for about        years    longer than that it's been measured  but in really nice  precise ways  and records have been kept for    or    years  and in fact  the temperature hadn't really gone up. It's like  the average temperature has gone up a tiny little bit  because the nighttime temperatures at the weather stations have come up just a little bit. But there's a good explanation for that. And it's that the weather stations are all built outside of town  where the airport was  and now the town's moved out there  there's concrete all around and they call it the skyline effect. And most responsible people that measure temperatures realize you have to shield your measuring device from that. And even then  you know  because the buildings get warm in the daytime  and they keep it a little warmer at night. So the temperature has been  sort of  inching up. It should have been. But not a lot. Not like  you know    the first guy    the first guy that got the idea that we're going to fry ourselves here  actually  he didn't think of it that way. His name was Sven Arrhenius. He was Swedish  and he said  if you double the CO  level in the atmosphere  which he thought might    this is in         the temperature ought to go up about  .  degrees  he calculated. He was thinking of the earth as  kind of like  you know  like a completely insulated thing with no stuff in it  really  just energy coming down  energy leaving. And so he came up with this theory  and he said  this will be cool  because it'll be a longer growing season in Sweden  you know  and the surfers liked it  the surfers thought  that's a cool idea  because it's pretty cold in the ocean sometimes  and    but a lot of other people later on started thinking it would be bad  you know. But nobody actually demonstrated it  right  I mean  the temperature as measured    and you can find this on our wonderful Internet  you just go and look for all NASAs records  and all the Weather Bureau's records  and you'll look at it yourself  and you'll see  the temperature has just    the nighttime temperature measured on the surface of the planet has gone up a tiny little bit. So if you just average that and the daytime temperature  it looks like it went up about .  degrees in this century. But in fact  it was just coming up    it was the nighttime  the daytime temperatures didn't go up. So    and Arrhenius' theory    and all the global warmers think    they would say  yeah  it should go up in the daytime  too  if it's the greenhouse effect. Now  people like things that have  like  names like that  that they can envision it  right  I mean    but people don't like things like this  so    most    I mean  you don't get all excited about things like the actual evidence  you know  which would be evidence for strengthening of the tropical circulation in the     s. It's a paper that came out in February  and most of you probably hadn't heard about it.  Evidence for Large Decadal Variability in the Tropical Mean Radiative Energy Budget.  Excuse me. Those papers were published by NASA  and some scientists at Columbia  and Viliki and a whole bunch of people  Princeton. And those two papers came out in Science Magazine  February the first  and these    the conclusion in both of these papers  and in also the Science editor's  like  descriptions of these papers  for  you know  for the quickie  is that our theories about global warming are completely wrong. I mean  what these guys were doing  and this is what    the NASA people have been saying this for a long time. They say  if you measure the temperature of the atmosphere  it isn't going up    it's not going up at all. We've doing it very carefully now for    years  from satellites  and it isn't going up. And in this paper  they show something much more striking  and that was that they did what they call a radiation    and I'm not going to go into the details of it  actually it's quite complicated  but it isn't as complicated as they might make you think it is by the words they use in those papers. If you really get down to it  they say  the sun puts out a certain amount of energy    we know how much that is    it falls on the earth  the earth gives back a certain amount. When it gets warm it generates    it makes redder energy    I mean  like infra red  like something that's warm gives off infra red. The whole business of the global warming    trash  really  is that    if the    if there's too much CO  in the atmosphere  the heat that's trying to escape won't be able to get out. But the heat coming from the sun  which is mostly down in the    it's like     nanometers  which is where it's centered    that goes right through CO . So you still get heated  but you don't dissipate any. Well  these guys measured all of those things. I mean  you can talk about that stuff  and you can write these large reports  and you can get government money to do it  but these    they actually measured it  and it turns out that in the last    years    that's why they say  decadal  there    that the energy    that the level of what they call  imbalance  has been way the hell over what was expected. Like  the amount of imbalance    meaning  heat's coming in and it's not going out that you would get from having double the CO   which we're not anywhere near that  by the way. But if we did  in      or something  have double the CO  as we had in       they say it would be increase the energy budget by about    in other words  one watt per square centimeter more would be coming in than going out. So the planet should get warmer. Well  they found out in this study    these two studies by two different teams    that five and a half watts per square meter had been coming in from             and the place didn't get warmer. So the theory's kaput    it's nothing. These papers should have been called   The End to the Global Warming Fiasco   you know. They're concerned  and you can tell they have very guarded conclusions in these papers  because they're talking about big laboratories that are funded by lots of money and by scared people. You know  if they said  you know what  There isn't a problem with global warming any longer  so we can    you know  they're funding. And if you start a grant request with something like that  and say  global warming obviously hadn't happened... if they    if they    if they actually    if they actually said that  I'm getting out. I'll stand up too  and    They have to say that. They had to be very cautious. But what I'm saying is  you can be delighted  because the editor of Science  who is no dummy  and both of these fairly professional    really professional teams  have really come to the same conclusion and in the bottom lines in their papers they have to say  what this means is  that what we've been thinking  was the global circulation model that we predict that the earth is going to get overheated that it's all wrong. It's wrong by a large factor. It's not by a small one. They just    they just misinterpreted the fact that the earth    there's obviously some mechanisms going on that nobody knew about  because the heat's coming in and it isn't getting warmer. So the planet is a pretty amazing thing  you know  it's big and horrible    and big and wonderful  and it does all kinds of things we don't know anything about. So I mean  the reason I put those things all together  OK  here's the way you're supposed to do science    some science is done for other reasons  and just curiosity. And there's a lot of things like global warming  and ozone hole and you know  a whole bunch of scientific public issues  that if you're interested in them  then you have to get down the details  and read the papers called   Large Decadal Variability in the...  You have to figure out what all those words mean. And if you just listen to the guys who are hyping those issues  and making a lot of money out of it  you'll be misinformed  and you'll be worrying about the wrong things. Remember the    things that are going to get you. The    one of them    And the asteroids is the one I really agree with there. I mean  you've got to watch out for asteroids. OK  thank you for having me here. I'm kind of tired of talking about simplicity  actually  so I thought I'd make my life more complex  as a serious play. So  I'm going to  like  go through some slides from way back when  and walk through them to give you a sense of how I end up here. So  basically it all began with this whole idea of a computer. Who has a computer  Yeah. O.K.  so  everyone has a computer. Even a mobile phone  it's a computer. And    anyone remember this workbook   Instant Activities for Your Apple     free poster in each book  This was how computing began. Don't forget  a computer came out  it had no software. You'd buy that thing  you'd bring it home  you'd plug it in  and it would do absolutely nothing at all. So  you had to program it  and there were great programming  like  tutorials  like this. I mean  this was great. It's  like  you know  Herbie the Apple II. It's such a great way to    I mean  they should make Java books like this  and we've have no problem learning a program. But this was a great  grand time of the computer  when it was just a raw  raw  what is it  kind of an era. And  you see  this era coincided with my own childhood. I grew up in a tofu factory in Seattle. Who of you grew up in a family business  suffered the torture  Yes  yes. The torture was good. Wasn't it good torture  It was just life changing  you know. And so  in my life  you know  I was in the tofu  it was a family business. And my mother was a kind of a designer  also. She'd make this kind of  like  wall of tofu cooking  and it would confuse the customers  because they all thought it was a restaurant. A bad sort of branding thing  or whatever. But  anyway  that's where I grew up  in this little tofu factory in Seattle  and it was kind of like this  a small room where I kind of grew up. I'm big there in that picture. That's my dad. My dad was kind of like MacGyver  really  he would invent  like  ways to make things heavy. Like back here  there's like  concrete block technology here  and he would need the concrete blocks to press the tofu  because tofu is actually kind of a liquidy type of thing  and so you have to have heavy stuff to push out the liquid and make it hard. Tofu comes out in these big batches  and my father would sort of cut them by hand. I can't tell you    family business story  you'd understand this    my father was the most sincere man possible. He walked into a Safeway once on a rainy day  slipped  broke his arm  rushed out  he didn't want to inconvenience Safeway. So  instead  you know  my father's  like  arm's broken for two weeks in the store  and that week    now  those two weeks were when my older brother and I had to do everything. And that was torture  real torture. Because  you see  we'd seen my father taking the big block of tofu and cutting it  like  knife in  zap  zap  zap. We thought  wow. So  the first time I did that  I went  like  whoa  Like this. Bad blocks. But anyways  the tofu to me was kind of my origin  basically. And because working in a store was so hard  I liked going to school  it was like heaven. And I was really good at school. So  when I got to MIT  you know  as most of you who are creatives  your parents all told you not to be creative  right  So  same way  you know  I was good at art and good at math  and my father says  he's    John's good at math. I went to MIT  did my math  but I had this wonderful opportunity  because computers had just become visual. The Apple    Macintosh just came out  I had a Mac in hand when I went to MIT. And it was a time when a guy who  kind of  could cross the two sides    it was a good time. And so  I remember that my first major piece of software was on a direct copy of then Aldus PageMaker. I made a desktop publishing system way back when  and that was  kind of  my first step into figuring out how to    oh  these two sides are kind of fun to mix. And the problem when you're younger    for all you students out there    is  your head gets kind of big really easy. And when I was making icons  I was  like  the icon master  and I was  like  yeah  I'm really good at this  you know. And then luckily  you know  I had the fortune of going to something called a library  and in the library I came upon this very book. I found this book. It's called   Thoughts on Design   by a man named Paul Rand. It's a little slim volume  I'm not sure if you've seen this. It's a very nice little book. It's about this guy  Paul Rand  who was one of the greatest graphic designers  and also a great writer as well. And when I saw this man's work  I realized how bad I was at design  or whatever I called it back then  and I suddenly had a kind of career goal  kind of in hot pursuit. So I kind of switched. I went to MIT  finished. I got my masters  and then went to art school after that. And just began to design stuff  like chopstick wrappers  napkins  menus    whatever I could get a handle on  sort of wheel and deal  move up in the design world  whatever. And isn't it that strange moment when you publish your design  Remember that moment    publishing your designs  Remember that moment  It felt so good  didn't it  So  I was published  you know  so  wow  my design's in a book  you know  After that  things kind of got strange  and I got thinking about the computer  because the computer to me always  kind of  bothered me. I didn't quite get it. And Paul Rand was a kind of crusty designer  you know  a crusty designer  like a good    kind of like a good French bread  You know  he wrote in one of his books   A Yale student once said  'I came here to learn how to design  not how to use a computer.' Design schools take heed.  This is in the '  s  in the great clash of computer non computer people. A very difficult time  actually. And this to me was an important message from Rand. And so I began to sort of mess with the computer at the time. This is the first sort of play thing I did  my own serious play. I built a working version of an Adobe Illustrator ish thing. It looks like Illustrator  it can  like  draw. It was very hard to make this  actually. It took a month to make this part. And then I thought  what if I added this feature  where I can say  this point  you can fly like a bird. You're free  kind of thing. So I could  sort of  change the kind of stability with a little control there on the dial  and I can sort of watch it flip around. And this is in     . And when my professors saw this  they were very upset at me. They were saying  Why's it moving  They were saying  Make it stop now. Now  I was saying  Well  that's the whole point  it's moving. And he says  Well  when's it going to stop  And I said  Never. And he said  Even worse. Stop it now. I started studying this whole idea  of like  what is this computer  It's a strange medium. It's not like print. It's not like video. It lasts forever. It's a very strange medium. So  I went off with this  and began to look for things even more. And so in Japan  I began to experiment with people. This is actually bad  human experiments. I would do these things where I'd have students become pens  there's blue pen  red pen  green pen  black pen. And someone sits down and draws a picture. They're laughing because he said  draw from the middle right to the middle  and he kind of messed up. See  humans don't know how to take orders  the computer's so good at it. This guy figured out how to get the computer to draw with two pens at once  you know  you  pen  do this  and you  pen  do this. And so began to have multiple pens on the page    again  hard to do with our hands. And then someone discovered this  a ha moment  where you could use coordinate systems. We thought  ah  this is when it's going to happen. In the end  he drew a house. It was the most boring thing. It became computerish  we began to think computerish    the X  Y system    and so that was kind of a revelation. And after this I wanted to build a computer out of people  called a human powered computer. So  this happened in     . Sound down  please. It's a computer where the people are the parts. I have behind this wall a disk drive  a CPU  a graphics card  a memory system. They're picking up a giant floppy disk made of cardboard. It's put inside the computer. And that little program's on that cardboard disk. So  she wears the disk  and reads the data off the sectors of the disk  and the computer starts up  it sort of boots up  really. And it's a sort of a working computer. And when I built this computer  I had a moment of    what is it called     the epiphany where I realized that the computer's just so fast. This computer appears to be fast   she's working pretty hard  and people are running around  and we think  wow  this is happening at a fast rate. And this computer's programmed to do only one thing  which is  if you move your mouse  the mouse changes on the screen. On the computer  when you move your mouse  that arrow moves around. On this computer  if you move the mouse  it takes half an hour for the mouse cursor to change. To give you a sense of the speed  the scale  the computer is just so amazingly fast  O.K.  And so  after this I began to do experiments for different companies. This is something I did for Sony in     . It was three Sony  H  devices that responded to sound. So  if you talk into the mike  you'll hear some music in your headphones  if you talk in the phone  then video would happen. So  I began to experiment with industry in different ways with this kind of mixture of skills. I did this ad. I don't believe in this kind of alcohol  but I do drink sometimes. And Chanel. So  getting to do different projects. And also  one thing I realized is that I like to make things. We like to make things. It's fun to make things. And so I never developed the ability to have a staff. I have no staff  it's all kind of made by hand    these sort of broken hands. And these hands were influenced by this man  Mr. Inami Naomi. This guy was my kind of like mentor. He was the first digital media producer in Tokyo. He's the guy that kind of discovered me  and kind of got me going in digital media. He was such an inspirational guy. I remember  like  we'd be in his studio  like  at   a.m.  and then he'd show up from some client meeting. He'd come in and say  you know  If I am here  everything is okay. And you'd feel so much better  you know. And I'll never forget how  like  but    I'll never forget how  like  he had a sudden situation with his    he had an aneurysm. He went into a coma. And so  for three years he was out  and he could only blink  and so I realized at this moment  I thought  wow    how fragile is this thing we're wearing  this body and mind we're wearing  and so I thought  How do you go for it more  How do you take that time you have left and go after it  So  Naomi was pivotal in that. And so  I began to think more carefully about the computer. This was a moment where I was thinking about  so  you have a computer program  it responds to motion    X and Y    and I realized that each computer program has all these images inside the program. So  if you can see here  you know  that program you're seeing in the corner  if you spread it out  it's all these things all at once. It's real simultaneity. It's nothing we're used to working with. We're so used to working in one vector. This is all at the same time. The computer lives in so many dimensions. And also  at the same time I was frustrated  because I would go to all these art and design schools everywhere  and there were these  like   the computer lab   you know  and this is  like  in the late     s  and this is in Basel  a great graphic design school. And here's this  like  dirty  kind of  shoddy  kind of  dark computer room. And I began to wonder  Is this the goal  Is this what we want  you know  And also  I began to be fascinated by machines    you know  like copy machines    and so this is actually in Basel. I noticed how we spent so much time on making it interactive    this is  like  a touch screen    and I noticed how you can only touch five places  and so   why are we wasting so much interactivity everywhere   became a question. And also  the sound  I discovered I can make my ThinkPad pretend it's a telephone. You get it  No  O.K. And also  I discovered in Logan airport  this was  like  calling out to me. Do you hear that  It's like cows. This is at   a.m. at Logan. So  I was wondering  like  what is this thing in front of me  this computer thing  It didn't make any sense. So  I began to make things again. This is another series of objects made of old computers from my basement. I made    I took my old Macintoshes and made different objects out of them from Tokyo. I began to be very disinterested in computers themselves  so I began to make paintings out of PalmPilots. I made this series of works. They're paintings I made and put a PalmPilot in the middle as a kind of display that's sort of thinking  I'm abstract art. What am I  I'm abstract. And so it keeps thinking out loud of its own abstraction. I began to be fascinated by plastic  so I spent four months making eight plastic blocks perfectly optically transparent  as a kind of release of stress. Because of that  I became interested in blue tape  so in San Francisco  at C.C.  I had a whole exhibition on blue tape. I made a whole installation out of blue tape    blue painters' tape. And at this point my wife kind of got worried about me  so I stopped doing blue tape and began to think  Well  what else is there in life  And so computers  as you know  these big computers  there are now tiny computers. They're littler computers  so the one chip computers  I began to program one chip computers and make objects out of P.C. boards  LEDs. I began to make LED sculptures that would live inside little boxes out of MDF. This is a series of light boxes I made for a show in Italy. Very simple boxes  you just press one button and some LED interaction occurs. This is a series of lamps I made. This is a Bento box lamp  it's sort of a plastic rice lamp  it's very friendly. I did a show in London last year made out of iPods    I used iPods as a material. So I took    iPod Nanos and made a kind of a Nano fish  basically. Recently  this is for Reebok. I've done shoes for Reebok as well  as a kind of a hobby for apparel. So anyways  there are all these things you can do  but the thing I love the most is to experience  taste the world. The world is just so tasty. We think we'll go to a museum  that's where all the tastes are. No  they're all out there. So  this is  like  in front of the Eiffel Tower  really  actually  around the Louvre area. This I found  where nature had made a picture for me. This is a perfect    degree angle by nature. In this strange moment where  like  these things kind of appeared. We all are creative people. We have this gene defect in our mind. We can't help but stop  right  This feeling's a wonderful thing. It's the forever always on museum. This is from the Cape last year. I discovered that I had to find the equation of art and design  which we know as circle triangle square. It's everywhere on the beach  I discovered. I began to collect every instance of circle triangle square. I put these all back  by the way. And I also discovered how . some rocks are twins separated at birth. This is also out there  you know. I'm  like  how did this happen  kind of thing  I brought you guys together again. So  three years ago I discovered  the letters M I T occurring in simplicity and complexity. My alma mater  MIT  and I had this moment    a kind of M. Night Shayamalan moment    where I thought  Whoa  I have to do this. And I went after it with passion. However  recently this RISD opportunity kind of arose    going to RISD    and I couldn't reconcile this real easy  because the letters had told me  MIT forever. But I discovered in the French word raison d' tre. I was  like  aha  wait a second. And there RISD appeared. And so I realized it was O.K. to go. So  I'm going to RISD  actually. Who's a RISD alum out there  RISD alums  Yeah  RISD. There we go  RISD. Woo  RISD. I'm sorry  I'm sorry  Art Center    Art Center is good  too. RISD is kind of my new kind of passion  and I'll tell you a little bit about that. So  RISD is    I was outside RISD  and some student wrote this on some block  and I thought  Wow  RISD wants to know what itself is. And I have no idea what RISD should be  actually  or what it wants to be  but one thing I have to tell you is that although I'm a technologist  I don't like technology very much. It's a  kind of  the qi thing  or whatever. People say  Are you going to bring RISD into the future  And I say  well  I'm going to bring the future back to RISD. There's my perspective. Because in reality  the problem isn't how to make the world more technological. It's about how to make it more humane again. And if anything  I think RISD has a strange DNA. It's a strange exuberance about materials  about the world  a fascination that I think the world needs quite very much right now. So  thank you everyone. Sixty five million years ago  a very important and catastrophic event changed the course of life on land. And although we know that the land animals I'm going to talk about are just the scum of the Earth on the land    the little bits of land floating around    but they are important to us because they're sort of in our scale of experience from millimeters to meters. And these animals disappeared  and a separate life  mammals  radiated out to take their place. And so  we know this in extraordinary detail. And so this is a core from near Bermuda. We know that the tsunamis  the earthquakes  and the things that we've experienced in the entire record of humankind history can't really quite get around the kind of disaster that this represented for the Earth. So even before that impact was known  even before scientists in general came to an agreement over the theory of evolution  scientists and natural historians of all kinds of stripes actually had divided Earth's life's history into these two episodes  Mesozoic  the middle life  and the Cenozoic  the recent life. And as it turns out  it actually corresponds really nicely with geologic history. So we have a Mesozoic period  an age of fragmentation  and a Cenozoic period  an age of reconnection    South America to North America  India to Asia. And so my work  really  is trying to understand the character of that Mesozoic radiation compared to the Cenozoic radiation to see what mysteries we can understand from dinosaurs and from other animals about what life on drifting continents really can tell us about evolution. The work immediately begs the question   Why didn't they go into the waters   I mean  certainly mammals did. This is one example. You can go outside    see many other examples. Within five     million years of the bolide impact we had a whole variety of animals going into the water. Why didn't they do that  Why didn't they hang around in trees at good size  and why didn't they burrow  Why didn't they do all these things  and if they didn't do all these things  what kinds of animals were in those spaces  And if there were no animals in those spaces  what does that tell us about  you know  how evolution works on land  Really interesting questions. I think a lot of it has to do with body size. In fact  I think that most of it has to do with body size    the size you are when you inherit a vacant ecospace from whatever natural disaster. Looking at dinosaur evolution and studying it  digging it up for many years  I end up looking at the mammal radiation  and it seems as though everything is quick time  just like technology  advancing by an order of magnitude. Dinosaur evolution proceeded at a stately pace  an order of magnitude slower on any way you want to measure it. You want to measure it by diversity  You want to measure it by the time it took to reach maximum body size  Yes  they do have larger body size  but many of them are smaller  but we're interested in the time it took them to achieve that. Fifty million years to achieve this maximum body size. And that is    times longer than it took the mammals to achieve maximum body size and invade all those habitats. So there's lessons to learn  and there's lessons to learn from the exception  the exception that we know very well today from the discoveries we've made  and many other scholars have made around the world. This slide was shown before. This is the famous Jurassic bird Archaeopteryx. We now know this transition is the one time that dinosaurs actually went below that body size    we're going to see where they began in a minute    and it is the one time that they rapidly invaded all the habitats I just told you that dinosaurs weren't in. They became marine. We now know them today from the ice caps. There's burrowing birds. They inhabit the trees at all body sizes  and  of course  they inhabit the land. So we were the first to actually name a bird from the famous series that later exploded onto the pages of Science and Nature. We called this bird Sinornis. It's a little bit more advanced than Archaeopteryx  and if you go to different layers  you find things that are less advanced than Archaeopteryx  and every grade in between  so that if you find something today  we're usually splitting hairs    or  more appropriately  feathers    as to decide whether it's actually a non avian or an avian. It is the greatest transition that we have  actually  on land from one habitat to another  bar none  to understand how a bony  fairly heavy  kilogram or a couple of kilogram animal could make such a transition. It is really our greatest    one of our greatest    evolutionary sequences. Now  my work began at the beginning. I thought if I'm going to understand dinosaur evolution  I'd have to go back to those beds where they had picked up fragments  go back to a time and a place where the earliest dinosaurs existed. I'd like to call for this little video clip to give you some idea of  sort of  what we face. Normally  we get asked a lot of questions   Well  how do you find fossils in areas that look like this   If we could roll that first video clip. This is sort of a nice helicopter ride through those early beds  and they're located in Northeastern Argentina. And we're coming over a cliff  and at the top of that cliff  dinosaurs had basically taken over. At the bottom of the cliff  we find that they're rare as hens' teeth. That's where dinosaur origins is to be found  at the bottom of the cliff. You go into an area like this  you get a geologic map  you get a topographic map  and the best  most inspired team you can bring to the area. And the rest is up to you. You've got to find fossils. You've got to dig a hole that's usually quite a bit bigger than that to get it out  you've got to climb those cliffs and find  really  everything that existed    not just the dinosaurs  but the entire story. If you're lucky  and you dig a place like that  you actually find the ash bed to dig it  and we did.     million years old  we found what really is the most primitive dinosaur  that's the Ur dinosaur. A three and a half foot thing  beautiful skull  predator  meat eater  a two legged animal. So  all the other dinosaurs that you know  or your kids know  at least  on four legs. This is sort of a look at the skull  and it's an absolutely fantastic thing about five or six inches long. It looks rather bird like because it is. It's bird like and hollow. A predator. Maybe    pounds  or    kilograms. That's where dinosaurs began. That's where the radiation began. That is    times larger than the mammal radiation  which was a four legged radiation. We are extremely dinosaur like  and unusual in our two legged approach to life. Now  if you want to understand what happened then when the continents broke apart  and dinosaurs found    landlubbers  as they are    found themselves adrift. There's some missing puzzle pieces. Most of those missing puzzle pieces are southern continents  because it was those continents that are least explored. If you want to add to this picture and try and sketch it globally  you really have to force yourself to go down to the four corners of the Earth    Africa  India  Antarctica  Australia    and start putting together some of these pieces. I've been to some of those continents  but Africa was  in the words of Steven Pinker  was a blank slate  largely. But one with an immense chalkboard in the middle  with lots of little areas of dinosaur rock if you could survive an expedition. There's no roads into the Sahara. It's an enormous place. To be able to excavate the    tons of dinosaurs that we have in the Sahara and take them out  you really have to put together an expedition team that can handle the conditions. Some of them are political. Many of them are physical. Some of them    the most important    are mental. And you really have to be able to withstand conditions    you have to drive into the desert  you will see landscapes in many cases    you can see from what we've discovered    that nobody else has ever seen. And the kinds of teams they bring in  Well  they're composed of people who understand science as adventure with a purpose. They're usually students who've never seen a desert. Some of them are more experienced. Your job as a leader    this is definitely a team sport    your job as a leader is to try to inspire them to do more work than they've ever done in their life under conditions that they can't imagine. So      degrees is normal. The ground surface at        typical. So  you can't leave your normal metal tools out because you'll get a first degree burn if you grab them sometimes. So  you are finding yourself also in an amazing cultural milieu. You're really rubbing shoulders with the world's last great nomadic people. These are the Tuareg nomads  and they're living their lives much as they have for centuries. Your job is to excavate things like this in the foreground  and make them enter the pages of history. To do that  you've got to actually transport them thousands of miles out of the desert. We're talking about Ethiopia  but let's talk about Niger    or Niger  in our English language    north of Nigeria    that's where this photograph was taken. Basically you're talking about a country that  when we started working there  did not have container traffic. You transported the bones out yourself to the coast of Africa  onto a boat  if you wanted to get them out of the middle of the Sahara. That's a       mile journey. So enormous excavations and a lot of work  and out of essentially a partial herd of dinosaurs that you saw buried there       tons of material    we erect Jobaria  a sauropod dinosaur like we haven't seen on some other continents. It really is a little bit out of place temporally. It looks nothing like what we would find if we dug in contemporary beds in North America. Here's the animal that was causing it trouble. And  you know  on and on    a whole menagerie. When you pick up something like this    and some of you have had the chance to touch it    this is a piece of history. You're touching something that's     million years old. This is a thumb claw. There it was  moments after it was discovered. It is an incredible view of life  and it really began when we began to understand the depth of time. It's only been with us for less than a century  and in that time  that fourth dimension  when radioactive dating came about  less than a century ago  and we could actually tell how old some of these things were  is probably the most profound transformation  because it changes the way we look at ourselves and the world dramatically. When you pick up a piece of history like that  I think it can transform kids that are possibly interested in science. That's the animal that thumb claw came from  Suchomimus. Here's some others. This is something we found in Morocco  an immense animal. We prototyped by CAT scanning the brain out of this animal. It turns out to have a forebrain one fifteenth the size of a human. This was the cover of Science  because they thought that humans were more intelligent than these animals  but we can see by some in our administration that despite the enormous advantage in brain volume some of the attitudes remain the same. Anyway  smaller raptors. All the stuff from Jurassic Park that you know of    all those small animals    they all come from northern continents. This is the first skeleton from a southern continent  and guess what  You start preparing it. It has no big claw on its hind foot. It doesn't look like a Velociraptor. It's really a wholly separate radiation. So what we're trying to piece together here is a story. It involves flying reptiles like this Pterosaur that we reconstructed from Africa. Crocodiles  of course  and that's a nasty one we haven't named yet. And huge things    I mean  this is a lower jaw just laying there in the desert of this enormous crocodile. The crocodile is technically called Sarcosuchus. That's an adult Orinoco crocodile in its jaws. We had to try and reconstruct this. We had to actually look at recent crocodiles to understand how crocodiles scale. Could I have the second little video clip  Now  this field is just    and  of course  science in general    is just    adventure. We had to find and measure the largest crocodiles living today. Narrator  ... as long as their boat. Man  Look at that set of choppers  Yeah  he's a big one. Narrator  If they can just land it  this croc will provide useful data  helping Paul in his quest to understand Sarcosuchus. Man  OK  hand me some more here. Man    OK. Narrator  It falls to Paul to cover its eyes. Man  Watch out  Watch out  No  no  no  no. You're going to have to get on the back legs. Man  I got the back legs. Man    You have the back legs  No  you have the front legs  my friend. I've got it. I've got the back legs. Somebody get the front legs. Paul Sereno  Let's get this tape measure on him. Put it right there. Wow. Sixty five. Wow. That's a big skull. Narrator  Big  but less than half the size of supercroc's skull. Man  Enormous. PS  You've got a ...    foot croc. Man  I knew it was big. PS  Don't get off. You don't get off  but don't worry about me. Narrator  Paul has his data  so they decide to release the animal back into the river. PS  Don't get off  Don't get off  Don't get off  Narrator  Paul has never seen a fossil do that. PS  Okay  when I say three  we move. One  two  three  Whoa  So    there were    Well  you know  the    the fossil record is truly amazing because it really forces you to look at living animals in a new way. We proved with those measurements that crocodiles scaled isometrically. It depended on the shape of their skull  though  so we had to actually get those measurements to be sure that we had reconstructed and could prove to the scientific world that supercroc in fact is a    foot crocodile  probably a male. Anyway  you find other things  too. I'm going to lead an expedition to the Sahara to dig up Africa's largest neolithic site. We found this last year. Two hundred skeletons  tools  jewelry. This is a ceremonial disk. An amazing record of the colonization of the Sahara       years ago is been sitting out there waiting for us to go back. So  really exciting. And then work later is going to take us to Tibet. Now  we normally think of Tibet as a highland. It's really an island continent. It was a precursor to India  a messenger from Gondwana    a lost paradise of dinosaurs isolated for millions of years. No one's found them. We know where they are  and we're going to go and get them next year. They're only between    and        feet  but if you go in the warm part of the year  it's O.K. Now  I tried to suture together a dinosaur evolutionary history so that we can try to understand some basic patterns of evolution. I've talked about a few of them. We really need to take that further. We need to delve into this mass of anatomy that we've been compiling to understand where the changes are occurring and what this means. We can't predict  necessarily  what will happen in evolution  but we can learn some of the rules of the game  and that's really what we're trying to do. With regard to the biogeographic question  the Earth is dividing. These are all landlubbing animals. There's a couple of choices. You get divided  and a continent's division corresponds to a fork in the evolutionary tree  or you're crafty  and you manage to escape from one to the other and erase that division  or you're living peacefully on each side  and on one side you just go extinct  and you survive on the other side and create a difference. And the fourth thing is that you actually did one or the other of those three things  but the paleontologist never found you. And you take those four instances and you realize you have a complex problem. And so  in addition to digging  I think we have some answers from the dinosaur record. I think these dinosaurs migrated    we call it dispersal    around the globe  with the slightest land bridge. They did it within two or three degrees of the pole  to maintain similarity between continents. But when they were divided  indeed they were divided  and we do see the continents carving differences among dinosaurs. But there's one thing that's even more important  and I think that's extinction. We have downgraded this factor. It carves up the history of life  and gives us the differences that we see in the dinosaur world towards the end  right before the bolide impact. The best way to test this is to actually create a model. So if we move back  this is a two dimensional typical tree of life. I want to give you three dimensions. So you see the tree of life  but now I've added the dimension of area. So the tree of life is normally divergence over time. Now we have divergence over time  but we've created the third dimension of area. This is a computer program which has three knobs. We can control those things that we're worried about  extinction  sampling  dispersal    going from one area to another. And ultimately we can control the branching to mimic what we think the continents were like  and run it a thousand times  so we can estimate the parameters  to answer the question whether we are on the mark or not  at least to know the barriers of the problems. So that's a little bit about the science. Today I'm going to spend the rest of my few minutes up here talking about the other stuff that I do in Chicago  which is related to the fact that I never    and actually  in talking to a lot of TEDsters  there's a number of you out there    I don't know that I'd get an answer honestly  if I asked you to raise your hand  but there are a number of you out there that started your scientific  technical  entertainment career as failures  by society's standards  as failures by schools. I was one of those. I was failed by my school    my school failed me. Who's pointing fingers  Several teachers nearly killed me. I found myself in art. I was a total failure in school  not really headed to graduate high school. And I went on    that's my first painting on canvas. I read a dictionary. I got into college. I became an artist. O.K.  and started drawing. It became abstract. I worked up a portfolio  and I was headed to New York. Sometimes I would see bones when there was a body there. Something was going on in the background. I headed to New York to a studio. I took a side trip to the American Museum  and I never recovered. But really it's the same discipline    they're kindred disciplines. I mean  is there anything that is not visualizing what can't be seen  in terms of discovering this dinosaur bone from a small piece of it that's out there  or seeing the distortion that we try to see as evolutionary distortion in one animal to another  This is a very extraordinarily visual. I give you a human face because you're experts at that. It takes us years to understand how to do that with dinosaurs. They're really kindred disciplines. But what we're trying to create in Chicago is a way to get  collect together  those students who are least represented in our science and technology spheres. We all know  and there's been several allusions to it  that we are failing in our ability to produce enough scientists  engineers and technicians. We've known that for a long time. We've gone through the Sputnik phase  and now  as you see the increase in the pace of what we're doing  it becomes even more prominent.  Where are all these people going to come from  And a more general question for our society is  what's going to happen to all the rest that are left behind  What about all the kids like me that were in school    kids like some of you out there    that were in school and didn't get a chance and will never get a chance to participate in science and technology  Those are the questions I ask. And we talk about Ethiopia  and it's very important. Niger is equally important  and I'm trying desperately to do something in Niger. They have an AIDS problem. I asked    the U.S. State Department asked the government recently  What do you want to do  And they gave them two problems. Dinosaurs was one of them. Give us a museum of dinosaurs  and we will attract tourists  which is our number two industry. And I hope to God the United States government  me  or TED  or somebody helps us do that  because that would be an incredible thing for their country. But when we look back at our own country  we're looking back at our cities  the cities where most of you come from    certainly the city I come from    there's legions of kids out there like these. And the question is    and we started to address this question for centuries    as to how we get these kids involved in science. We've started in Chicago an organization    a non profit organization    called Project Exploration. These are two kids from Project Exploration. We met them in their early stages in high school. They were    failing to poor students  and they are now    one at the University of Chicago  another in Illinois. We've got students at Harvard. We're six years old. And we created a track record. Because when you go out there as a scholar  and you try to find out longitudinal studies  track records like that  there essentially are very few  if none. So  we've created an incredible track record of     percent graduation     percent going to college  many first generation     percent of those choosing science as a career. It's an impressive track record  and so we look back and we say  well  we didn't really exactly work this out theoretically from the start  but when we look back  there are theoretical movements in science education. It's gone through science as an inquiry  which was a big advance  and Dewey back at Chicago    you learn by doing. To    you learn by envisioning yourself as a scientist  and then you learn to envision yourself as a scientist. The next step is to learn the capability to make yourself a scientist. You have to have those steps. If you have    It's easy to get kids interested in science. It's hard to get them to envision themselves as a scientist  which involves standing up in front of people like we're doing here at this symposium and presenting something as a knowledgeable person  and then seeing yourself in the role as a scientist and giving yourself the tools to pursue that. And so  that's what we're going to do. We're planning a permanent home in Chicago. We have lots of ideas  but I guarantee you this one thing    and I've talked to some people here at TED    it's not going to look like anything you've seen before. It's going to be part school  part museum hall  part conservatory  part zoo  and part of an answer to the problem of how you interest kids in science. Thank you very much. Many of you could ask the question  you know  why is a flying car  or maybe more accurately  a roadable aircraft  possible at this time  A number of years ago  Mr. Ford predicted that flying cars of some form would be available. Now     years later  I'm here to tell you why it's possible. When I was about five years old  not very much    about a year after Mr. Ford made his predictions  I was living in a rural part of Canada  on the side of a mountain in a very isolated area. Getting to school  for a kid that was actually pretty short for his age  through the Canadian winter  was not a pleasant experience. It was a trying and scary thing for a young kid to be going through. At the end of my first year in school  in the summer of that year  I discovered a couple hummingbirds that were caught in a shed near my home. They'd worn themselves out  beating themselves against the window  and  well  they were easy to capture. I took them outside and as I let them go  that split second  even though they were very tired  that second I let them go they hovered for a second  then zipped off into the distance. I thought  what a great way to get to school. For a kid at that age  this was like infinite speed  disappearing  and I was very inspired by that. And so the next    over the next six decades  believe it or not  I've built a number of aircraft  with the goal of creating something that could do for you  or me  what the hummingbird does  and give you that flexibility. I've called this vehicle  generically  a volantor  after the Latin word  volant   meaning  to fly in a light  nimble manner. Volantor like helicopter  perhaps. The FAA  the controlling body above all  calls it a  powered lift aircraft.  And they've actually issued a pilot's license    a powerlift pilot's license    for this type of aircraft. It's closer than you think. It's kind of remarkable when you consider that there are no operational powered lift aircraft. So for once  perhaps  the government is ahead of itself. The press calls my particular volantor a  Skycar.  This is a little bit earlier version of it  that's why it's given the X designation  but it's a four passenger aircraft that could take off vertically  like a helicopter    therefore it doesn't need an airfield. On the ground  it's powered electrically. It's actually classified as a motorcycle because of the three wheels  which is a great asset because it allows you  theoretically  to use this on the highways in most states  and actually in all cities. So that's an asset because if you've got to deal with the crash protection issues of the automobile  forget it    you're never going to fly it. One could say that a helicopter does pretty much what the hummingbird does  and gets around in much the same way  and it's true  but a helicopter is a very complex device. It's expensive    so expensive that very few people could own or use it. It's often been described because of its fragile nature and its complexity  as a series of parts    a large number of parts    flying in formation. Another difference  and I have to describe this  because it's very personal  another great difference between the helicopter and the volantor    in my case the Skycar volantor    is the experience that I've had in flying both of those. In a helicopter you feel    and it's still a remarkable sensation    you feel like you're being hauled up from above by a vibrating crane. When you get in the Skycar    and I can tell you  there's only one other person that's flown it  but he had the same sensation    you really feel like you're being lifted up by a magic carpet  without any vibration whatsoever. The sensation is unbelievable. And it's been a great motivator. I only get to fly this vehicle occasionally  and only when I can persuade my stockholders to let me do so  but it's still one of those wonderful experiences that reward you for all that time. What we really need is something to replace the automobile for those    plus mile trips. Very few people realize that    mile plus trips make up    percent of the miles traveled in America. If we can get rid of that  then the highways will now be useful to you  as contrasted by what's happening in many parts of the world today. On this next slide  is an interesting history of what we really have seen in infrastructure  because whether I give you a perfect Skycar  the perfect vehicle for use  it's going to have very little value to you unless you've got a system to use it in. I'm sure any of you have asked the question  yeah  are there great things up there    what am I going to do  get up there  It's bad enough on a highway  what's it going to be like to be in the air  This world that you're going to be talking about tomorrow is going to be completely integrated. You're not going to be a pilot  you're going to be a passenger. And it's the infrastructure that really determines whether this process goes forward. I can tell you  technically we can build Skycars    my God  we went to the moon  The technology there was much more difficult than what I'm dealing with here. But we have to have these priority changes  we have to have infrastructure to go with this. Historically you see that we got around     years ago by canals  and as that system disappeared  were replaced by railroads. As that disappeared we came in with highways. But if you look at that top corner    the highway system    you see where we are today. Highways are no longer being built  and that's a fact. You won't see any additional highways in the next    years. However  the next    years  if like the last    years  we're going to see    percent more traffic. And where is that going to lead you to  So the issue then  I've often asked  is when is it going to happen  When are we going to be able to have these vehicles  And of course  if you ask me  I'm going to give you a really optimistic view. After all  I've been spending    years here believing it's going to happen tomorrow. So  I'm not going to quote myself on this. I'd prefer to quote someone else  who testified with me before Congress  and in his position as head of NASA put forward this particular vision of the future of this type of aircraft. Now I would argue  actually  if you look at the fact that on the highways today  you're only averaging about    miles per hour    on average  according to the DOT    the Skycar travels at over     miles an hour  up to        feet. And so  in effect  you could see perhaps a tenfold increase in the ability to get around as far as speed is concerned. Unbeknownst to many of you  the highway in the sky that I'm talking about here has been under construction for    years. It makes use of the GPS    you're familiar with GPS in your automobile  but you may not be familiar with the fact that there's a GPS U.S.  there's a Russian GPS  and there's a new GPS system going to Europe  called Galileo. With those three systems  you have what is always necessary    a level of redundancy that says  if one system fails  you'll still have a way to make sure that you're being controlled. Because if you're in this world  where computers are controlling what you're doing  it's going to be very critical that something can't fail on you. How would a trip in a Skycar work  Well  you can't right now take off from your home because it's too noisy. I mean to be able to take off from your home  you'd have to be extremely quiet. But it's still fairly quiet. You'd motor  electrically  to a vertiport  which may be a few blocks  maybe even a few miles away. This is clearly  as I said earlier  a roadable aircraft  and you're not going to spend that much time on the road. After all  if you can fly like that  why are you going to drive around on a highway  Go to a local vertiport  plug in your destination  delivered almost like a passenger. You can play computer games  you can sleep  you can read on the way. This is the world    there won't be you as a pilot. And I know the pilots in the audience aren't going to like that    and I've had a lot of bad feedback from people who want to be up there  flying around and experiencing that. And of course  I suppose like recreational parks you can still do that. But the vehicle itself is going to be a very  very controlled environment. Or it's going to have no use to you as a person who might use such a system. We flew the first vehicle for the international press in       when I really got it started. I was a professor at the U.C. Davis System  and I got a lot of excitement around this  and I was able to fund the initiation of the program back in that time. And then through the various years we invented various vehicles. Actually the critical point was in       when we demonstrated the stability of this vehicle    how completely stable it was in all circumstances  which is of course very critical. Still not a practical vehicle during all of this  but moving in the right direction  we believe. Finally  in the early part of    or actually the middle of       we flew the        M     which was the four passenger vehicle. In this case here  we're flying it remotely  as we always did at the beginning. And we had very small power plants in it at this time. We are now installing larger powerplants  which will make it possible for me to get back on board. A vertical takeoff aircraft is not the safest vehicle during the test flight program. There's an old adage that applied for the years between     s and     s  when every aeronautical company was working on vertical takeoff aircraft. A vertical takeoff aircraft needs an artificial stabilization system    that's essential. At least for the hover  and the low speed flight. If that single stability system  that brain that flies that aircraft  fails  or if the engine fails  that vehicle crashes. There is no option to that. And the adage that I'm referring to  that applied at that time  was that nothing comes down faster than a VTOL aircraft upside down. That's a macabre comment because we lost a lot of pilots. In fact  the aircraft companies gave up on vertical takeoff aircraft more or less for a number of years. And there's really only one operational aircraft in the world today that's a vertical takeoff aircraft    as distinct from a helicopter    and that's the Hawker Harrier jump jet. A vertical takeoff aircraft  like the hummingbird  has a very high metabolism  which means it requires a lot of energy. Getting that energy is very  very difficult. It all comes down to that power plant    how to get a large amount of power in a small package. Fortunately  Dr. Felix Wankel invented the rotary engine. A very unique engine    it's round  it's small  it's vibration free. It fits exactly where we need to fit it  right in the center of the hubs of the ducts in the system    very critical. In fact that engine    for those who are into the automobile    know that it recently is applied to the RX     the Mazda. And that sportscar won Sports Car of the Year. Wonderful engine. In that application  it generates one horsepower per pound  which is twice as good as your car engine today  but only half of what we need. My company has spent    years and many millions of dollars taking that rotary engine  which was invented in the late '  s  and getting it to the point that we get over two horsepower per pound  reliably  and critical. We actually get     horsepower into one cubic foot. We have eight engines in this vehicle. We have four computers. We have two parachutes. Redundancy is the critical issue here. If you want to stay alive you've got to have backups. And we have actually flown this vehicle and lost an engine  and continued to hover. The computers back up each other. There's a voting system    if one computer is not agreeing with the other three  it's kicked out of the system. And then you have three    you still have the triple redundancy. If one of those fails  you still have a second chance. If you stick around  then good luck. There won't be a third chance. The parachutes are there    hopefully  more for psychological than real reasons  but they will be an ultimate backup if it comes to that. I'd like to show you an animation in this next one  which is one element of the Skycar's use  but it's one that demonstrates how it could be used. You could think of it personally in your own terms  of how you might use it. Video  Skycar dispatched  launch rescue vehicle for San Francisco. Paul Moller  I believe that personal transportation in something like the Skycar  probably in another volantor form as well  will be a significant part of our lives  as Dr. Goldin says  within the next    years. And it's going to change the demographics in a very significant way. If you can live    miles from San Francisco and get there in    minutes  you're going to sell your         dollar apartment  buy an upscale home on the side of a mountain  buy a Skycar  which I think would be priced at that time perhaps in the area of         dollars  put money in the bank ... that's a very significant incentive for getting out of San Francisco. But you better be the first one out of town as the real estate values go to hell. Developing the Skycar has been a real challenge. Obviously I'm dependent on a lot of other people believing in what I'm doing    both financially and in technical help. And that has    you run into situations where you have this great acceptance of what you're doing  and a lot of rejection of the same kind of thing. I characterized this emerging technology in an aphorism  as it's described  which really talks about what I've experienced  and I'm sure what other people may have experienced in emerging technologies. There's an interesting poll that came out recently under NAS    I think it's MSNBC    in which they asked the question   Are you in the market for a volantor   Twenty three percent said   Yes  as soon as possible.  Forty seven percent    yes  as soon as they could    price could come down. Twenty three percent said   As soon as it's proven safe.  Only seven percent said that they wouldn't consider buying a Skycar. I'm encouraged by that. At least it makes me feel like  to some extent  it is becoming self evident. That we need an alternative to the automobile  at least for those    mile trips and more  so that the highways become usable in today's world. Thank you. What I thought I would talk about today is the transition from one mode of thinking about nature to another that's tracked by architecture. What's interesting about architects is  we always have tried to justify beauty by looking to nature  and arguably  beautiful architecture has always been looking at a model of nature. So  for roughly     years  the hot debate in architecture was whether the number five or the number seven was a better proportion to think about architecture  because the nose was one fifth of your head  or because your head was one seventh of your body. And the reason that that was the model of beauty and of nature was because the decimal point had not been invented yet    it wasn't the   th century    and everybody had to dimension a building in terms of fractions  so a room would be dimensioned as one fourth of a facade  the structural dais of that might be dimensioned as    units  and you would get down to the small elements by fractional subdivision  finer and finer and finer. In the   th century  the decimal point was invented  architects stopped using fractions  and they had a new model of nature. So  what's going on today is that there's a model of natural form which is calculus based and which is using digital tools  and that has a lot of implications to the way we think about beauty and form  and it has a lot of implications in the way we think about nature. The best example of this would probably be the Gothic  and the Gothic was invented after the invention of calculus  although the Gothic architects weren't really using calculus to define their forms. But what was important is  the Gothic moment in architecture was the first time that force and motion was thought of in terms of form. So  examples like Christopher Wren's King's Cross  you can see that the structural forces of the vaulting get articulated as lines  so you're really actually seeing the expression of structural force and form. Much later  Robert Maillart's bridges  which optimize structural form with a calculus curvature almost like a parabola. The Hanging Chain models of Antonio Gaudi  the Catalan architect. The end of the   th century  beginning of the   th century  and how that Hanging Chain model translates into archways and vaulting. So  in all of these examples  structure is the determining force. Frei Otto was starting to use foam bubble diagrams and foam bubble models to generate his Mannheim Concert Hall. Interestingly  in the last    years Norman Foster used a similar heat thermal transfer model to generate the roof of the National Gallery  with the structural engineer Chris Williams. In all these examples  there's one ideal form  because these are thought in terms of structure. And as an architect  I've always found these kinds of systems very limiting  because I'm not interested in ideal forms and I'm not interested in optimizing to some perfect moment. So  what I thought I would bring up is another component that needs to be thought of  whenever you think about nature  and that's basically the invention of generic form in genetic evolution. My hero is actually not Darwin  it's a guy named William Bateson  father of Greg Bateson  who was here for a long time in Monterey. And he was what you'd call a teratologist  he looked at all of the monstrosities and mutations to find rules and laws  rather than looking at the norms. So  instead of trying to find the ideal type or the ideal average  he'd always look for the exception. So  in this example  which is an example of what's called Bateson's Rule  he has two kinds of mutations of a human thumb. When I first saw this image     years ago  I actually found it very strange and beautiful at the same time. Beautiful  because it has symmetry. So  what he found is that in all cases of thumb mutations  instead of having a thumb  you would either get another opposable thumb  or you would get four fingers. So  the mutations reverted to symmetry. And Bateson invented the concept of symmetry breaking  which is that wherever you lose information in a system  you revert back to symmetry. So  symmetry wasn't the sign of order and organization    which is what I was always understanding  and as is an architect    symmetry was the absence of information. So  whenever you lost information  you'd move to symmetry  whenever you added information to a system  you would break symmetry. So  this whole idea of natural form shifted at that moment from looking for ideal shapes to looking for a combination of information and generic form. You know  literally after seeing that image  and finding out what Bateson was working with  we started to use these rules for symmetry breaking and branching to start to think about architectural form. To just talk for a minute about the digital mediums that we're using now and how they integrate calculus  the fact that they're calculus based means that we don't have to think about dimension in terms of ideal units or discreet elements. So  in architecture we deal with big assemblies of components  so there might be up to  say         pieces of material in this room you're sitting in right now that all need to get organized. Now  typically you'd think that they would all be the same  like  the chairs you're sitting in would all be the same dimension. You know  I haven't verified this  but it's the norm that every chair would be a slightly different dimension  because you'd want to space them all out for everybody's sight lines. The elements that make up the ceiling grid and the lighting  they're all losing their modular quality  and moving more and more to these infinitesimal dimensions. That's because we're all using calculus tools for manufacturing and for design. Calculus is also a mathematics of curves. So  even a straight line  defined with calculus  is a curve. It's just a curve without inflection. So  a new vocabulary of form is now pervading all design fields  whether it's automobiles  architecture  products  etc.  it's really being affected by this digital medium of curvature. The intricacies of scale that come out of that    you know  in the example of the nose to the face  there's a fractional part to whole idea. With calculus  the whole idea of subdivision is more complex  because the whole and the parts are one continuous series. It's too early in the morning for a lecture on calculus  so I brought some images to just describe how that works. This is a Korean church that we did in Queens. And in this example  you can see that the components of this stair are repetitive  but they're repetitive without being modular. Each one of the elements in this structure is a unique distance and dimension  and all of the connections are unique angles. Now  the only way we could design that  or possibly construct it  is by using a calculus based definition of the form. It also is much more dynamic  so that you can see that the same form opens and closes in a very dynamic way as you move across it  because it has this quality of vector in motion built into it. So the same space that appears to be a kind of closed volume  when seen from the other side becomes a kind of open vista. And you also get a sense of visual movement in the space  because every one of the elements is changing in a pattern  so that pattern leads your eye towards the altar. I think that's one of the main changes  also  in architecture  that we're starting to look now not for some ideal form  like a Latin cross for a church  but actually all the traits of a church  so  light that comes from behind from an invisible source  directionality that focuses you towards an altar. It turns out it's not rocket science to design a sacred space. You just need to incorporate a certain number of traits in a very kind of genetic way. So  these are the different perspectives of that interior  which has a very complex set of orientations all in a simple form. In terms of construction and manufacturing  this is a kilometer long housing block that was built in the '  s in Amsterdam. And here we've broken the     apartments up into small neighborhoods  and differentiated those neighborhoods. I won't go into too much description of any of these projects  but what you can see is that the escalators and elevators that circulate people along the face of the building are all held up by     structural trusses. Because we're using escalators to move people  all of these trusses are picking up diagonal loads. So  every one of them is a little bit different shaped as you move down the length of the building. So  working with Bentley and MicroStation  we've written a custom piece of software that networks all of the components together into these chunks of information  so that if we change any element along the length of the building  not only does that change distribute through each one of the trusses  but each one of the trusses then distributes that information down the length of the entire facade of the building. So it's a single calculation for every single component of the building that we're adding onto. So  it's tens of millions of calculations just to design one connection between a piece of structural steel and another piece of structural steel. But what it gives us is a harmonic and synthesized relationship of all these components  one to another. This idea has  kind of  brought me into doing some product design  and it's because design firms that have connections to architects  like  I'm working with Vitra  which is a furniture company  and Alessi  which is a houseware company. They saw this actually solving a problem  this ability to differentiate components but keep them synthetic. So  not to pick on BMW  or to celebrate them  but take BMW as an example. They have to  in       have a distinct identity for all their models of cars. So  the     series  or whatever their newest car is  the     series that's coming out  has to look like the     series  at the other end of their product line  so they need a distinct  coherent identity  which is BMW. At the same time  there's a person paying        dollars for a     series car  and a person paying        dollars for a     series  and that person paying more than double doesn't want their car to look too much like the bottom of the market car. So they have to also discriminate between these products. So  as manufacturing starts to allow more design options  this problem gets exacerbated  of the whole and the parts. Now  as an architect  part to whole relationships is all I think about  but in terms of product design it's becoming more and more of an issue for companies. So  the first kind of test product we did was with Alessi  which was for a coffee and tea set. It's an incredibly expensive coffee and tea set  we knew that at the beginning. So  I actually went to some people I knew down south in San Diego  and we used an exploded titanium forming method that's used in the aerospace industry. Basically what we can do  is just cut a graphite mold  put it in an oven  heat it to       degrees  gently inflate titanium that's soft  and then explode it at the last minute into this form. But what's great about it is  the forms are only a few hundred dollars. The titanium's several thousand dollars  but the forms are very cheap. So  we designed a system here of eight curves that could be swapped  very similar to that housing project I showed you  and we could recombine those together  so that we always had ergonomic shapes that always had the same volume and could always be produced in the same way. That way  each one of these tools we could pay for with a few hundred dollars  and get incredible variation in the components. And this is one of those examples of the sets. So  for me  what was important is that this coffee set    which is just a coffee pot  a teapot  and those are the pots sitting on a tray    that they would have a coherence    so  they would be Greg Lynn Alessi coffee pots    but that everyone who bought one would have a one of a kind object that was unique in some way. To go back to architecture  what's organic about architecture as a field  unlike product design  is this whole issue of holism and of monumentality is really our realm. Like  we have to design things which are coherent as a single object  but also break down into small rooms and have an identity of both the big scale and the small scale. Architects tend to work with signature  so that an architect needs a signature and that signature has to work across the scale of houses up to  say  skyscrapers  and that problem of signatures is a thing we're very good at maintaining and working with  and intricacy  which is the relationship of  say  the shape of a building  its structure  its windows  its color  its pattern. These are real architectural problems. So  my kind of hero for this in the natural world are these tropical frogs. I got interested in them because they're the most extreme example of a surface where the texture and the    let's call it the decoration    I know the frog doesn't think of it as decoration  but that's how it works    are all intricately connected to one another. So a change in the form indicates a change in the color pattern. So  the pattern and the form aren't the same thing  but they really work together and are fused in some way. So  when doing a center for the national parks in Costa Rica  we tried to use that idea of a gradient color and a change in texture as the structure moves across the surface of the building. We also used a continuity of change from a main exhibition hall to a natural history museum  so it's all one continuous change in the massing  but within that massing are very different kinds of spaces and forms. In a housing project in Valencia  Spain  we're doing  the different towers of housing fused together in shared curves so you get a single mass  like a kind of monolith  but it breaks down into individual elements. And you can see that that change in massing also gives all    of the apartments a unique shape and size  but always within a  kind of  controlled limit  an envelope of change. I work with a group of other architects. We have a company called United Architects. We were one of the finalists for the World Trade Center site design. And I think this just shows how we were approaching the problem of incredibly large scale construction. We wanted to make a kind of Gothic cathedral around the footprints of the World Trade Center site. And to do that  we tried to connect up the five towers into a single system. And we looked at  from the     s on  there were numerous examples of other architects trying to do the same thing. We really approached it at the level of the typology of the building  where we could build these five separate towers  but they would all join at the   th floor and make a kind of single monolithic mass. With United Architects  also  we made a proposal for the European Central Bank headquarters that used the same system  but this time in a much more monolithic mass  like a sphere. But again  you can see this  kind of  organic fusion of multiple building elements to make a thing which is whole  but breaks down into smaller parts  but in an incredibly organic way. Finally  I'd like to just show you some of the effects of using digital fabrication. About six years ago  I bought one of these CNC mills  to just replace  kind of  young people cutting their fingers off all the time building models. And I also bought a laser cutter and started to fabricate within my own shop  kind of  large scale building elements and models  where we could go directly to the tooling. What I found out is that the tooling  if you intervened in the software  actually produced decorative effects. So  for these interiors  like this shop in Stockholm  Sweden  or this installation wall in the Netherlands at the Netherlands Architecture Institute  we could use the texture that the tool would leave to produce a lot of the spatial effects  and we could integrate the texture of the wall with the form of the wall with the material. So  in vacuum formed plastic  in fiberglass  and then even at the level of structural steel  which you think of as being linear and modular. The steel industry is so far ahead of the design industry that if you take advantage of it you can even start to think of beams and columns all rolled together into a single system which is highly efficient  but also produces decorative effects and formal effects that are very beautiful and organic. Thanks very much. I was listed on the online biography that said I was a design missionary. That's a bit lofty  I'm really more of something like a street walker. I spend a lot of time in urban areas looking for design  and studying design in the public sector. I take about       photographs a year  and I thought that I would edit from these  and try to come up with some images that might be appropriate and interesting to you. And I used three criteria  the first was  I thought I'd talk about real design within reach  design that's free  not design not quite within reach  as we're fondly known by our competition and competitors  but stuff that you can find on the streets  stuff that was free  stuff that was available to all people  and stuff that probably contains some other important messages. I'll use these sidewalks in Rio as an example. A very common public design done in the '  s. It's got a nice kind of flowing  organic form  very consistent with the Brazilian culture    I think good design adds to culture. Wholly inconsistent with San Francisco or New York. But I think these are my sort of information highways  I live in much more of an analog world  where pedestrian traffic and interaction and diversity exchange  and where I think the simple things under our feet have a great amount of meaning to us. How did I get started in this business  I was a ceramic designer for about    years  and just loved utilitarian form    simple things that we use every day  little compositions of color and surface on form. This led me to starting a company called Design Within Reach  a company dealing with simple forms  making good designers available to us  and also selling the personalities and character of the designers as well  and it seems to have worked. A couple of years into the process  I spent a lot of time in Europe traveling around  looking for design. And I had a bit of a wake up call in Amsterdam  I was there going into the design stores  and mixing with our crowd of designers  and I recognized that a whole lot of stuff pretty much looked the same  and the effect of globalization has had that in our community also. We know a lot about what's going on with design around the world  and it's getting increasingly more difficult to find design that reflects a unique culture. I was walking around on the streets of Amsterdam and I recognized  you know  the big story from Amsterdam isn't what's in the design stores  it's what's out on the streets  and maybe it's self explanatory  but a city that hasn't been taken over by modernism  that's preserved its kind of architecture and character  and where the bicycle plays an important part of the way in which people get around and where pedestrian rights are protected. And I write a newsletter that goes out every week  and I wrote an article about this  and it got such enormous response that I realized that design  that common design  that's in the public area means a lot to people  and establishes kind of a groundwork and a dialog. I then kind of thought about the other cities in Europe where I spend a lot of time looking for design  like Basel  where Vitra is located  or in northern Italy    all cities where there are a whole lot of bicycles  and where pedestrian areas    and I came to the conclusion that perhaps there was something about these important design centers that dealt with bicycles and foot traffic  and I'm sure the skeptic eye would say  no  the correlation there is that there are universities and schools where people can't afford cars  but it did seem that in many of these areas pedestrian traffic was protected. You wouldn't look at this and call this a designer bike  a designer bike is made of titanium or molybdenum. But I began looking at design in a place like Amsterdam and recognized  you know  the first job of design is to serve a social purpose. And so I look at this bike as not being a designer bike  but being a very good example of design. And since that time in Amsterdam  I spent an increasing amount of time in the cities  looking at design for common evidence of design that really isn't under so much of a designer's signature. I was in Buenos Aires very recently  and I went to see this bridge by Santiago Calatrava. He's a Spanish architect and designer. And the tourist brochures pointed me in the direction of this bridge    I love bridges  metaphorically and symbolically and structurally    and it was a bit of a disappointment  because of the sludge from the river was encrusted on it  it really wasn't in use. And I recognized that oftentimes design  when you're set up to see design  it can be a bit of a letdown. But there were lots of other things going on in this area  it was a kind of construction zone  a lot of buildings were going up. And  approaching a building from a distance  you don't see too much  you get a little closer  and you arrive at a nice little composition that might remind you of a Mondrian or a Diebenkorn or something. But to me it was an example of industrial materials with a little bit of colors and animation and a nice little still life    kind of unintended piece of design. And going a little closer  you get a different perspective. I find these little vignettes  these little accidental pieces of design  to be refreshing. They give me  I don't know  a sense of correctness in the world and some visual delight in the knowledge that the building will probably never look as good as this simple industrial scaffolding that is there to serve. Down the road  there was another building  a nice visual structure  horizontal  vertical elements  little decorative lines going across  these magenta squiggles  the workmen being reduced to decorative elements  just a nice  kind of  breakup of the urban place. And  you know  that no longer exists. You've captured it for a moment  and finding this little still life's like listening to little songs or something  it gives me an enormous amount of pleasure. Antoine Predock designed a wonderful ball stadium in San Diego called Petco Park. A terrific use of local materials  but inside you could find some interior compositions. Some people go to baseball stadiums to look at games  I go and see design relationships. Just a wonderful kind of breakup of architecture  and the way that the trees form vertical elements. Red is a color in the landscape that is often on stop signs. It takes your attention  it has a great amount of emotion  it stares back at you the way that a figure might. Just a piece of barrier tape construction stuff in Italy. Construction site in New York  red having this kind of emotional power that's almost an equivalent with the way in which    cuteness of puppies and such. Side street in Italy. Red drew me into this little composition  optimistic to me in the sense that maybe the public service's mailbox  door service  plumbing. It looks as if these different public services work together to create some nice little compositions. In Italy  you know  almost everything  kind of  looks good. Simple menus put on a board  achieving  kind of  the sort of balance. But I'm convinced that it's because you're walking around the streets and seeing things. Red can be comical  it can draw your attention to the poor little personality of the little fire hydrant suffering from bad civic planning in Havana. Color can animate simple blocks  simple materials  walking in New York  I'll stop. I don't always know why I take photographs of things. A nice visual composition of symmetry. Curves against sharp things. It's a comment on the way in which we deal with public seating in the city of New York. I've come across some other just  kind of  curious relationships of bollards on the street that have different interpretations  but    these things amuse me. Sometimes a trash can    this is just in the street in San Francisco    a trash can that's been left there for    months creates a nice    degree angle against these other relationships  and turns a common parking spot into a nice little piece of sculpture. So  there's this sort of silent hand of design at work that I see in places that I go. Havana is a wonderful area. It's quite free of commercial clutter  you don't see our logos and brands and names  and therefore you're alert to things physically. And this is a great protection of a pedestrian zone  and the repurposing of some colonial cannons to do that. And Cuba needs to be far more resourceful  because of the blockades and things  but a really wonderful playground. I've often wondered why Italy is really a leader in modern design. In our area  in furnishings  they're sort of way at the top. The Dutch are good also  but the Italians are good. And I came across this little street in Venice  where the communist headquarters were sharing a wall with this Catholic shrine. And I realized that  you know  Italy is a place where they can accept these different ideologies and deal with diversity and not have the problem  or they can choose to ignore them  but these    you don't have warring factions  and I think that maybe the tolerance of the absurdity which has made Italy so innovative and so tolerant. The past and the present work quite well together in Italy also  and I think that it's recognizable there  and has an important effect on culture  because their public spaces are protected  their sidewalks are protected  and you're actually able to confront these things physically  and I think this helps people get over their fear of modernism and other such things. A change might be a typical street corner in San Francisco. And I use this    this is  sort of  what I consider to be urban spam. I notice this stuff because I walk a lot  but here  private industry is really kind of making a mess of the public sector. And as I look at it  I sort of say  you know  the publications that report on problems in the urban area also contribute to it  and it's just my call to say to all of us  public policy won't change this at all  private industry has to work to take things like this seriously. The extreme might be in Italy where  again  there's kind of some type of control over what's happening in the environment is very evident  even in the way that they sell and distribute periodicals. I walk to work every day or ride my scooter  and I come down and park in this little spot. And I came down one day  and all the bikes were red. Now  this is not going to impress you guys who Photoshop  and can do stuff  but this was an actual moment when I got off my bike  and I looked and I thought  it's as if all of my biker brethren had kind of gotten together and conspired to make a little statement. And it reminded me that    to keep in the present  to look out for these kinds of things. It gave me possibilities for wonder    if maybe it's a yellow day in San Francisco  and we could all agree  and create some installations. But it also reminded me of the power of pattern and repetition to make an effect in our mind. And I don't know if there's a stronger kind of effect than pattern and the way it unites kind of disparate elements. I was at the art show in Miami in December  and spent a couple of hours looking at fine art  and amazed at the prices of art and how expensive it is  but having a great time looking at it. And I came outside  and the valets for this car service had created  you know  quite a nice little collage of these car keys  and my closest equivalent were a group of prayer tags that I had seen in Tokyo. And I thought that if pattern can unite these disparate elements  it can do just about anything. I don't have very many shots of people  because they kind of  get in the way of studying pure form. I was in a small restaurant in Spain  having lunch    one of those nice days where you had the place kind of to yourself  and you have a glass of wine  and enjoying the local area and the culture and the food and the quiet  and feeling very lucky  and a bus load of tourists arrived  emptied out  filled up the restaurant. In a very short period of time  completely changed the atmosphere and character with loud voices and large bodies and such  and we had to get up and leave  it was just that uncomfortable. And at that moment  the sun came out  and through this perforated screen  a pattern was cast over these bodies and they kind of faded into the rear  and we left the restaurant kind of feeling O.K. about stuff. And I do think pattern has the capability of eradicating some of the most evil forces of society  such as bad form in restaurants  but quite seriously  it was a statement to me that one thing that you do  sort of  see is the aggressive nature of the industrial world has produced    kind of  large masses of things  and when you    in monoculture  and I think the preservation of diversity in culture is something that's important to us. The last shots that I have deal with    coming back to this theme of sidewalks  and I wanted to say something here about    I'm  kind of  optimistic  you know. Post Second World War  the influence of the automobile has really been devastating in a lot of our cities. A lot of urban areas have been converted into parking lots in a sort of indiscriminate use. A lot of the planning departments became subordinated to the transportation department. It's as easy to rag on cars as it is on Wal Mart  I'm not going to do that. But they're real examples in urbanization and the change that's occurred in the last number of years  and the heightened sensitivity to the importance of our urban environments as cultural centers. I think that they are  that the statements that we make in this public sector are our contributions to a larger whole. Cities are the place where we're most likely to encounter diversity and to mix with other people. We go there for stimulation in art and all those other things. But I think people have recognized the sanctity of our urban areas. A place like Chicago has really reached kind of a level of international stature. The U.S. is actually becoming a bit of a leader in kind of enlightened urban planning and renewal  and I want to single out a place like Chicago  where I look at some guy like Mayor Daley as a bit of a design hero for being able to work through the political processes and all that to improve an area. You would expect a city like this to have upgraded flower boxes on Michigan Avenue where wealthy people shop  but if you actually go along the street you find the flower boxes change from street to street  there's actual diversity in the plants. And the idea that a city group can maintain different types of foliage is really quite exceptional. There are common elements of this that you'll see throughout Chicago  and then there are your big D design statements  the Pritzker Pavilion done by Frank Gehry. My measure of this as being an important bit of design is not so much the way that it looks  but the fact that it performs a very important social function. There are a lot of free concerts  for example  that go on in this area  it has a phenomenal acoustic system. But the commitment that the city has made to the public area is significant  and almost an international model. I work on the mayor's council in San Francisco  on the International Design Council for Mayors  and Chicago is looked at as the pinnacle  and I really would like to salute Mayor Daley and the folks there. I thought that I should include at least one shot of technology for you guys. This is also in Millennium Park in Chicago  where the Spanish artist designer Plensa has created  kind of  a digital readout in this park that reflects back the characters and personalities of the people in this area. And it's a welcoming area  I think  inclusive of diversity  reflective of diversity  and I think this marriage of both technology and art in the public sector is an area where the U.S. can really take a leadership role  and Chicago is one example. Thank you very much. Of the five senses  vision is the one that I appreciate the most  and it's the one that I can least take for granted. I think this is partially due to my father  who was blind. It was a fact that he didn't make much of a fuss about  usually. One time in Nova Scotia  when we went to see a total eclipse of the sun    yeah  same one as in the Carly Simon song  which may or may not refer to James Taylor  Warren Beatty or Mick Jagger  we're not really sure. They handed out these dark plastic viewers that allowed us to look directly at the sun without damaging our eyes. But Dad got really scared  he didn't want us doing that. He wanted us instead to use these cheap cardboard viewers so that there was no chance at all that our eyes would be damaged. I thought this was a little strange at the time. What I didn't know at the time was that my father had actually been born with perfect eyesight. When he and his sister Martha were just very little  their mom took them out to see a total eclipse    or actually  a solar eclipse    and not long after that  both of them started losing their eyesight. Decades later  it turned out that the source of their blindness was most likely some sort of bacterial infection. As near as we can tell  it had nothing whatsoever to do with that solar eclipse  but by then my grandmother had already gone to her grave thinking it was her fault. So  Dad graduated Harvard in       married my mom  and bought a house in Lexington  Massachusetts  where the first shots were fired against the British in       although we didn't actually hit any of them until Concord. He got a job working for Raytheon  designing guidance systems  which was part of the Route     high tech axis in those days    so the equivalent of Silicone Valley in the '  s. Dad wasn't a real militaristic kind of guy  he just really felt bad that he wasn't able to fight in World War II on account of his handicap  although they did let him get through the several hour long army physical exam before they got to the very last test  which was for vision. So  Dad started racking up all of these patents and gaining a reputation as a blind genius  rocket scientist  inventor. But to us he was just Dad  and our home life was pretty normal. As a kid  I watched a lot of television and had lots of nerdy hobbies like mineralogy and microbiology and the space program and a little bit of politics. I played a lot of chess. But at the age of     a friend of mine got me interested in comic books  and I decided that was what I wanted to do for a living. So  here's my dad  he's a scientist  he's an engineer and he's a military contractor. So  he has four kids  right  One grows up to become a computer scientist  one grows up to join the Navy  one grows up to become an engineer  and then there's me  the comic book artist. Which  incidentally  makes me the opposite of Dean Kamen  because I'm a comic book artist  son of an inventor  and he's an inventor  son of a comic book artist. Right  it's true. The funny thing is  Dad had a lot of faith in me. He had faith in my abilities as a cartoonist  even though he had no direct evidence that I was any good whatsoever  everything he saw was just a blur. Now  this gives a real meaning to the term  blind faith   which doesn't have the same negative connotation for me that it does for other people. Now  faith in things which cannot be seen  which cannot be proved  is not the sort of faith that I've ever really related to all that much. I tend to like science  where what we see and can ascertain are the foundation of what we know. But there's a middle ground  too. A middle ground tread by people like poor old Charles Babbage  and his steam driven computers that were never built. Nobody really understood what it was that he had in mind  except for Ada Lovelace  and he went to his grave trying to pursue that dream. Vannevar Bush with his Memex    this idea of all of human knowledge at your fingertips    he had this vision. And I think a lot of people in his day probably thought he was a bit of a kook. And  yeah  we can look back in retrospect and say  yeah  ha ha  you know    it's all microfilm. But that's    that's not the point. He understood the shape of the future. So did J.C.R. Licklider and his notions for computer human interaction. Same thing  he understood the shape of the future  even though it was something that would only be implemented by people much later. Or Paul Baran  and his vision for packet switching. Hardly anybody listened to him in his day. Or even the people who actually pulled it off  the people at Bolt  Beranek and Newman in Boston  who just would sketch out these structures of what would eventually become a worldwide network  and sketching things on the back of napkins and on note papers and arguing over dinner at Howard Johnson's    on Route     in Lexington  Massachusetts  just two miles from where I was studying the Queen's Gambit Deferred and listening to Gladys Knight   the Pips singing  Midnight Train to Georgia   while       in my dad's big easy chair  you know  So  three types of vision  right  Vision based on what one cannot see  the vision of that unseen and unknowable. The vision of that which has already been proven or can be ascertained. And this third kind of vision  of something which can be  which may be  based on knowledge  but is as yet unproven. Now  we've seen a lot of examples of people who are pursuing that sort of vision in science  but I think it's also true in the arts  it's true in politics  it's even true in personal endeavors. What it comes down to  really  is four basic principles  learn from everyone  follow no one  watch for patterns  and work like hell. I think these are the four principles that go into this. And it's that third one  especially  where visions of the future begin to manifest themselves. What's interesting is that this particular way of looking at the world  is  I think  only one of four different ways that manifest themselves in different fields of endeavor. In comics  I know that it results in sort of a formalist attitude towards trying to understand how it works. Then there's another  more classical  attitude which embraces beauty and craft. Another one which believes in the pure transparency of content. And then another which emphasizes the authenticity of human experience    and honesty  and rawness. These are four very different ways of looking at the world. I even gave them names. The classicist  the animist  and formalist and iconoclast. Interestingly  it seemed to correspond more or less to Jung's four subdivisions of human thought. And they reflect a dichotomy of art and delight on left and the right  tradition and revolution on the top and the bottom. And if you go on the diagonal  you get content and form    and then beauty and truth. And it probably applies just as much to music and to movies and to fine art  which has nothing whatsoever to do with vision at all  or for that matter  nothing to do with our conference theme of  Inspired by Nature     except to the extent of the fable of the frog who gives the ride to the scorpion on his back to get across the river because the scorpion promises not to sting him  but then the scorpion does sting him anyway and they both die  but not before the frog asks him why and the scorpion says   Because it's my nature     in that sense  yes. So    so this was my nature. The thing was  I saw that the route that I took to discovering this focus in my work and who I was  I saw it as just this road to discovery. Actually  it was just me embracing my nature  which means that I didn't actually fall that far from the tree after all. So what does a  scientific mind  do in the arts  Well  I started making comics  but I also started trying to understand them  almost immediately. And one of the most important things about comics  I discovered  was that comics are a visual medium  but they try to embrace all of the senses within it. So  the different elements of comics  like pictures and words  and the different symbols and everything in between that comics presents are all funneled through the single conduit of vision. So you have things like resemblance  where something which resembles the physical world can be abstracted in a couple of different directions  abstracted from resemblance  but still retaining the complete meaning  or abstracted away from both resemblance and meaning towards the picture plan. Put all these three together  and you have a nice little map of the entire boundary of visual iconography which comics can embrace. And if you move to the right you also get language  because that's abstracting even further from resemblance  but still maintaining meaning. Vision is called upon to represent sound and to understand the common properties of those two and their common heritage  as well. Also  to try to represent the texture of sound to capture its essential character through visuals. And there's also a balance between the visible and the invisible in comics. Comics is a kind of call and response in which the artist gives you something to see within the panels  and then gives you something to imagine between the panels. Also  another sense which comics' vision represents  and that's time. Sequence is a very important aspect of comics. Comics presents a kind of temporal map. And this temporal map was something that energizes modern comics  but I was wondering if perhaps it also energizes other sorts of forms  and I found some in history. And you can see this same principle operating in these ancient versions of the same idea. What's happening is  the art form is colliding with the given technology  whether it's paint on stone  like the Tomb of the Scribe in ancient Egypt  or a bas relief sculpture rising up a stone column  or a     foot long embroidery  or painted deerskin and tree bark running across    accordion folded pages. What's interesting is  once you hit print    and this is from       by the way    all of the artifacts of modern comics start to present themselves  rectilinear panel arrangements  simple line drawings without tone and a left to right reading sequence. And within     years  you already start to see word balloons and captions  and it's really just a hop  skip and a jump from here to here. So I wrote a book about this in '    but as I was finishing the book  I had to do a little bit of typesetting  and I was tired of going to my local copy shop to do it  so I bought a computer. And it was just a little thing    it wasn't good for much except text entry    but my father had told me about Moore's Law  about Moore's Law back in the '  s  and I knew what was coming. And so  I kept my eyes peeled to see if the sort of changes that happened when we went from pre print comics to print comics would happen when we went beyond  to post print comics. So  one of the first things that were proposed was that we could mix the visuals of comics with the sound  motion and interactivity of the CD ROMs that were being made in those days. This was even before the Web. And one of the first things they did was  they tried to take the comics page as is and transplant it to monitors  which was a classic McLuhanesque mistake of appropriating the shape of the previous technology as the content of the new technology. And so  what they would do is  they'd have these comic pages that resemble print comics pages  and they would introduce all this sound and motion. The problem was  that if you go with this idea    this basic idea that space equals time in comics    what happens is that when you introduce sound and motion  which are temporal phenomena that can only be represented through time  then they break with that continuity of presentation. Interactivity was another thing. There were hypertext comics. But the thing about hypertext is that everything in hypertext is either here  not here or connected to here  it's profoundly non spatial. The distance from Abraham Lincoln to a Lincoln penny  the Penny Marshall to the Marshall Plan to  Plan    to nine lives  it's all the same. And    but in comics  in comics  every aspect of the work  every element of the work has a spatial relationship to every other element at all times. So the question was  was there any way to preserve that spatial relationship while still taking advantage of all of the things that digital had to offer us  And I found my personal answer for this in those ancient comics that I was showing you. Each of them has a single unbroken reading line  whether it's going zigzag across the walls or spiraling up a column or just straight left to right  or even going in a backwards zigzag across those    accordion folded pages. The same thing is happening  and that is that the basic idea that as you move through space you move through time is being carried out without any compromise  but there were compromises when print hit. Adjacent spaces were no longer adjacent moments  so the basic idea of comics was being broken again and again and again and again. And I thought  O.K.  well  if that's true  is there any way  when we go beyond today's print  to somehow bring that back  Now  the monitor is just as limited as the page  technically  right  It's a different shape  but other than that it's the same basic limitation. But that's only if you look at the monitor as a page  but not if you look at the monitor as a window. And that's what I proposed  that perhaps we could create these comics on an infinite canvas  along the X axis and the Y axis and staircases. We could do circular narratives that were literally circular. We could do a turn in a story that was literally a turn. Parallel narratives could be literally parallel. X  Y and also Z. So I had all these notions. This was back in the late '  s  and other people in my business thought I was pretty crazy  but a lot of people then went on and actually did it. I'm going to show you a couple now. This was an early collage comic by a fellow named Jason Lex. And notice what's going on here. What I'm searching for is a durable mutation    that's what all of us are searching for. As media head into this new era  we are looking for mutations that are durable  that have some sort of staying power. Now  we're taking this basic idea of presenting comics in a visual medium  and then we're carrying it through all the way from beginning to end. That's that entire comic you just saw is up on the screen right now. But even though we're only experiencing it one piece at a time  that's just where the technology is right now. As the technology evolves  as you get full immersive displays and whatnot  this sort of thing will only grow. It will adapt. It will adapt to its environment  it's a durable mutation. Here's another one I'll show you. This is by Drew Weing  this is called   Pup Contemplates the Heat Death of the Universe.  See what's going on here as we draw these stories on an infinite canvas is you're creating a more pure expression of what this medium is all about. We'll go by this a little quickly    you get the idea. I just want to get to the last panel. There we go. Just one more. Talk about your infinite canvas. It's by a guy named Daniel Merlin Goodbrey in Britain. Why is this important  I think this is important because media  all media  provide us a window back into our world. Now  it could be that motion pictures    and eventually  virtual reality  or something equivalent to it    some sort of immersive display  is going to provide us with our most efficient escape from the world that we're in. That's why most people turn to storytelling  is to escape. But media provides us with a window back into the world that we live in. And when media evolve so that the identity of the media becomes increasingly unique. Because what you're looking at is  you're looking at comics cubed  you're looking at comics that are more comics like than they've ever been before. When that happens  you provide people with multiple ways of re entering the world through different windows  and when you do that  it allows them to triangulate the world that they live in and see its shape. And that's why I think this is important. One of many reasons  but I've got to go now. Thank you for having me. This is a wheat bread  a whole wheat bread  and it's made with a new technique that I've been playing around with  and developing and writing about which  for lack of a better name  we call the epoxy method. And I call it an epoxy method because    it's not very appetizing. I understand that    but    but if you think about epoxy  what's epoxy  It's two resins that are  sort of  in and of themselves    neither of which can make glue  but when you put the two together  something happens. A bond takes place  and you get this very strong  powerful adhesive. Well  in this technique  what I've tried to do is kind of gather all of the knowledge that the bread baking world  the artisan bread baking community  has been trying to accumulate over the last    years or so    since we've been engaged in a bread renaissance in America    and put it together to come up with a method that would help to take whole grain breads. And let's face it  everyone's trying to move towards whole grains. We finally  after    years of knowing that wholegrain was a healthier option  we're finally getting to the point where we actually are tipping over and attempting to actually eat them. The challenge  though  for a wholegrain baker is  you know  how do you make it taste good  Because whole grain    it's easy with white flour to make a good tasting bread. White flour is sweet. It's mainly starch  and starch  when you break it down    what is starch  It's    thank you    sugar  yes. So a baker  and a good baker  knows how to pull or draw forth the inherent sugar trapped in the starch. With whole grain bread  you have other obstacles. You've got bran  which is probably the healthiest part of the bread for us  or the fiber for us because it is just loaded with fiber  for the bran is fiber. It's got germ. Those are the good things  but those aren't the tastiest parts of the wheat. So whole grain breads historically have had sort of this onus of being health food breads  and people don't like to eat  quote  health food. They like to eat healthy and healthily  but when we think of something as a health food  we think of it as something we eat out of obligation  not out of passion and love for the flavor. And ultimately  the challenge of the baker  the challenge of every culinary student  of every chef  is to deliver flavor. Flavor is king. Flavor rules. I call it the flavor rule. Flavor rules. And    and you can get somebody to eat something that's good for them once  but they won't eat it again if they don't like it  right  So  this is the challenge for this bread. We're going to try this at lunch  and I'll explain a bit more about it  but it's made not only with two types of pre doughs    this attempt  again  at bringing out flavor is to make a piece of dough the day before that is not leavened. It's just dough that is wet. It's hydrated dough we call  the soaker     that helps to start enzyme activity. And enzymes are the secret  kind of  ingredient in dough that brings out flavor. It starts to release the sugars trapped in the starch. That's what enzymes are doing. And so  if we can release some of those  they become accessible to us in our palate. They become accessible to the yeast as food. They become accessible to the oven for caramelization to give us a beautiful crust. The other pre dough that we make is fermented    our pre ferment. And it's made    it can be a sourdough starter  or what we call a  biga  or any other kind of pre fermented dough with a little yeast in it  and that starts to develop flavor also. And on day two  we put those two pieces together. That's the epoxy. And we're hoping that  sort of  the enzyme piece of dough becomes the fuel pack for the leavened piece of dough  and when we put them together and add the final ingredients  we can create a bread that does evoke the full potential of flavor trapped in the grain. That's the challenge. Okay  so  now  what we    in the journey of wheat  let's go back and look at these    stages. I'm going to go through them very quickly and then revisit them. Okay  we're going to start with the first stage. And this is what every student has to begin with. Everyone who works in the culinary world knows that the first stage of cooking is  mise en place   which is just a French way of saying   get organized.  Everything in its place. First stage. So in baking we call it scaling    weighing out the ingredients. Stage two is mixing. We take the ingredients and we mix them. We have to develop the gluten. There's no gluten in flour. There's only the potential for gluten. Here's another kind of prefiguring of epoxy because we've got glutenin and gliadin  neither of which are strong enough to make a good bread. But when they get hydrated and they bond to each other  they create a stronger molecule  a stronger protein we call gluten. And so we  in the mixing process  have to develop the gluten  we have to activate the leaven or the yeast  and we have to essentially distribute all the ingredients evenly. Then we get into fermentation  the third stage  which is really where the flavor develops. The yeast comes alive and starts eating the sugars  creating carbon dioxide and alcohol    essentially it's burping and sweating  which is what bread is. It's yeast burps and sweat. And somehow  this is transformed    the yeast burps and sweats are later transformed    and this is really getting to the heart of what makes bread so special is that it is a transformational food  and we're going to explore that in a minute. But then  quickly through the next few stages. We  after it's fermented and it's developed  started to develop flavor and character  we divide it into smaller units. And then we take those units and we shape them. We give them a little pre shape  usually a round or a little torpedo shape  sometimes. That's called  rounding.  And there's a short rest period. It can be for a few seconds. It can be for    or    minutes. We call that resting or benching. Then we go into final shaping   panning     which means putting the shaped loaf on a pan. This takes a second  but it's a distinctive stage. It can be in a basket. It can be in a loaf pan  but we pan it. And then  stage nine. The fermentation which started at stage three is continuing through all these other stages. Again  developing more flavor. The final fermentation takes place in stage nine. We call it  proofing.  Proofing means to prove that the dough is alive. And at stage nine we get the dough to the final shape  and it goes into the oven    stage   . Three transformations take place in the oven. The sugars in the dough caramelize in the crust. They give us that beautiful brown crust. Only the crust can caramelize. It's the only place that gets hot enough. Inside  the proteins    this gluten    coagulates. When it gets to about     degrees  the proteins all line up  and they create structure  the gluten structure    what ultimately we will call the crumb of the bread. And the starches  when they reach about     degrees  gelatinize. And gelatinization is yet another oven transformation. Coagulation  caramelization and gelatinization    when the starch is thick and they absorb all the moisture that's around them  they    they kind of swell  and then they burst. And they burst  and they spill their guts into the bread. So basically now we're eating yeast sweats    sweat  burps and starch guts. Again  transformed in stage    in the oven because what went into the oven as dough comes out in stage    as bread. And stage     we call it cooling    because we never really eat the bread right away. There's a little carry over baking. The proteins have to set up  strengthen and firm up. And then we have stage     which the textbooks call  packaging   but my students call  eating.  And so  we're going to be on our own journey today from wheat to eat  and in a few minutes we will try this  and see if we have succeeded in fulfilling this baker's mission of pulling out flavor. But I want to go back now and revisit these steps  and talk about it from the standpoint of transformation  because I really believe that all things can be understood    and this is not my own idea. This goes back to the Scholastics and to the Ancients    that all things can be understood on four levels  the literal  the metaphoric or poetic level  the political or ethical level. And ultimately  the mystical or sometimes called the  anagogical  level. It's hard to get to those levels unless you go through the literal. In fact  Dante says you can't understand the three deeper levels unless you first understand the literal level  so that's why we're talking literally about bread. But let's kind of look at these stages again from the standpoint of connections to possibly a deeper level    all in my quest for answering the question   What is it about bread that's so special   And fulfilling this mission of evoking the full potential of flavor. Because what happens is  bread begins as wheat or any other grain. But what's wheat  Wheat is a grass that grows in the field. And  like all grasses  at a certain point it puts out seeds. And we harvest those seeds  and those are the wheat kernels. Now  in order to harvest it    I mean  what's harvesting  It's just a euphemism for killing  right  I mean  that's what's harvest    we say we harvest the pig  you know  Yes  we slaughter  you know. Yes  that's life. We harvest the wheat  and in harvesting it  we kill it. Now  wheat is alive  and as we harvest it  it gives up its seeds. Now  at least with seeds we have the potential for future life. We can plant those in the ground. And we save some of those for the next generation. But most of those seeds get crushed and turned into flour. And at that point  the wheat has suffered the ultimate indignity. It's not only been killed  but it's been denied any potential for creating future life. So we turn it into flour. So as I said  I think bread is a transformational food. The first transformation    and  by the way  the definition of transformation for me is a radical change from one thing into something else. O.K.  Radical  not subtle. Not like hot water made cold  or cold water turned hot  but water boiled off and becoming steam. That's a transformation  two different things. Well  in this case  the first transformation is alive to dead. I'd call that radical. So  we've got now this flour. And what do we do  We add some water. In stage one  we weigh it. In stage two  we add water and salt to it  mix it together  and we create something that we call  clay.  It's like clay. And we infuse that clay with an ingredient that we call  leaven.  In this case  it's yeast  but yeast is leaven. What does leaven mean  Leaven comes from the root word that means enliven    to vivify  to bring to life. By the way  what's the Hebrew word for clay  Adam. You see  the baker  in this moment  has become  in a sense  sort of  the God of his dough  you know  and his dough  well  while it's not an intelligent life form  is now alive. And we know it's alive because in stage three  it grows. Growth is the proof of life. And while it's growing  all these literal transformations are taking place. Enzymes are breaking forth sugars. Yeast is eating sugar and turning it into carbon dioxide and alcohol. Bacteria is in there  eating the same sugars  turning them into acids. In other words  personality and character's being developed in this dough under the watchful gaze of the baker. And the baker's choices all along the way determine the outcome of the product. A subtle change in temperature    a subtle change in time    it's all about a balancing act between time  temperature and ingredients. That's the art of baking. So all these things are determined by the baker  and the bread goes through some stages  and characters develop. And then we divide it  and this one big piece of dough is divided into smaller units  and each of those units are given shape by the baker. And as they're shaped  they're raised again  all along proving that they're alive  and developing character. And at stage     we take it to the oven. It's still dough. Nobody eats bread dough    a few people do  I think  but not too many. I've met some dough eaters  but    it's not the staff of life  right  Bread is the staff of life. But dough is what we're working with  and we take that dough to the oven  and it goes into the oven. As soon as the interior temperature of that dough crosses the threshold of     degrees  it passes what we call the  thermal death point.  Students love that TDP. They think it's the name of a video game. But it's the thermal death point    all life ceases there. The yeast  whose mission it has been up till now to raise the dough  to enliven it  to vivify it  in order to complete its mission  which is also to turn this dough into bread  has to give up its life. So you see the symbolism at work  It's starting to come forth a little bit  you know. It's starting to make sense to me    what goes in is dough  what comes out is bread    or it goes in alive  comes out dead. Third transformation. First transformation  alive to dead. Second transformation  dead brought back to life. Third transformation  alive to dead    but dough to bread. Or another analogy would be  a caterpillar has been turned into a butterfly. And it's what comes out of the oven that is what we call the staff of life. This is the product that everyone in the world eats  that is so difficult to give up. It's so deeply embedded in our psyches that bread is used as a symbol for life. It's used as a symbol for transformation. And so  as we get to stage    and we partake of that  again completing the life cycle  you know  we have a chance to essentially ingest that    it nurtures us  and we continue to carry on and have opportunities to ponder things like this. So this is what I've learned from bread. This is what bread has taught me in my journey. And what we're going to attempt to do with this bread here  again  is to use  in addition to everything we talked about  this bread we're going to call  spent grain bread  because  as you know  bread making is very similar to beer making. Beer is basically liquid bread  or bread is solid beer. And    they    they're invented around the same time. I think beer came first. And the Egyptian who was tending the beer fell asleep in the hot  Egyptian sun  and it turned into bread. But we've got this bread  and what I did here is to try to  again  evoke even more flavor from this grain  was we've added into it the spent grain from beer making. And if you make this bread  you can use any kind of spent grain from any type of beer. I like dark spent grain. Today we're using a light spent grain that's actually from  like  some kind of a lager of some sort    a light lager or an ale    that is wheat and barley that's been toasted. In other words  the beer maker knows also how to evoke flavor from the grains by using sprouting and malting and roasting. We're going to take some of that  and put it into the bread. So now we not only have a high fiber bread  but now fiber on top of fiber. And so this is  again  hopefully not only a healthy bread  but a bread that you will enjoy. So  if I  kind of  break this bread  maybe we can share this now a little bit here. We'll start a little piece here  and I'm going to take a little piece here    I think I'd better taste it myself before you have it at lunch. I'll leave you with what I call the baker's blessing. May your crust be crisp  and your bread always rise. Thank you. I'm going to talk about a very fundamental change that is going on in the very fabric of the modern economy. And to talk about that  I'm going to go back to the beginning  because in the beginning were commodities. Commodities are things that you grow in the ground  raise on the ground or pull out of the ground  basically  animal  mineral  vegetable. And then you extract them out of the ground  and sell them on the open marketplace. Commodities were the basis of the agrarian economy that lasted for millennia. But then along came the industrial revolution  and then goods became the predominant economic offering  where we used commodities as a raw material to be able to make or manufacture goods. So  we moved from an agrarian economy to an industrial economy. Well  what then happened over the last    or    years  is that goods have become commoditized. Commoditized  where they're treated like a commodity  where people don't care who makes them. They just care about three things and three things only  price  price and price. Now  there's an antidote to commoditization  and that is customization. My first book was called  Mass Customization     it came up a couple of times yesterday    and how I discovered this progression of economic value was realizing that customizing a good automatically turned it into a service  because it was done just for a particular person  because it wasn't inventoried  it was delivered on demand to that individual person. So  we moved from an industrial economy to a service based economy. But over the past    or    years  what's happened is that services are being commoditized as well. Long distance telephone service sold on price  price  price  fast food restaurants with all their value pricing  and even the Internet is commoditizing not just goods  but services as well. What that means is that it's time to move to a new level of economic value. Time to go beyond the goods and the services  and use  in that same heuristic  what happens when you customize a service  What happens when you design a service that is so appropriate for a particular person    that's exactly what they need at this moment in time  Then you can't help but make them go  wow   you can't help but turn it into a memorable event    you can't help but turn it into an experience. So we're shifting to an experience economy  where experiences are becoming the predominant economic offering. Now most places that I talk to  when I talk about experience  I talk about Disney    the world's premier experience stager. I talk about theme restaurants  and experiential retail  and boutique hotels  and Las Vegas    the experience capital of the world. But here  when you think about experiences  think about Thomas Dolby and his group  playing music. Think about meaningful places. Think about drinking wine  about a journey to the Clock of the Long Now. Those are all experiences. Think about TED itself. The experience capital in the world of conferences. All of these are experiences. Now  over the last several years I spent a lot of time in Europe  and particularly in the Netherlands  and whenever I talk about the experience economy there  I'm always greeted at the end with one particular question  almost invariably. And the question isn't really so much a question as an accusation. And the Dutch  when they usually put it  it always starts with the same two words. You know the words I mean  You Americans. They say  you Americans. You like your fantasy environments  your fake  your Disneyland experiences. They say  we Dutch  we like real  natural  authentic experiences. So much has that happened that I've developed a fairly praticed response  which is  I point out that first of all  you have to understand that there is no such thing as an inauthentic experience. Why  Because the experience happens inside of us. It's our reaction to the events that are staged in front of us. So  as long as we are in any sense authentic human beings  then every experience we have is authentic. Now  there may be more or less natural or artificial stimuli for the experience  but even that is a matter of degree  not kind. And there's no such thing as a     percent natural experience. Even if you go for a walk in the proverbial woods  there is a company that manufactured the car that delivered you to the edge of the woods  there's a company that manufactured the shoes that you have to protect yourself from the ground of the woods. There's a company that provides a cell phone service you have in case you get lost in the woods. Right  All of those are man made  artificiality brought into the woods by you  and by the very nature of being there. And then I always finish off by talking about    the thing that amazes me the most about this question  particularly coming from the Dutch  is that the Netherlands is every bit as manufactured as Disneyland. And the Dutch  they always go ... and they realize  I'm right  There isn't a square meter of ground in the entire country that hasn't been reclaimed from the sea  or otherwise moved  modified and manicured to look as if it had always been there. It's the only place you ever go for a walk in the woods and all the trees are lined up in rows. But nonetheless  not just the Dutch  but everyone has this desire for the authentic. And authenticity is therefore becoming the new consumer sensibility    the buying criteria by which consumers are choosing who are they going to buy from  and what they're going to buy. Becoming the basis of the economy. In fact  you can look at how each of these economies developed  that each one has their own business imperative  matched with a consumer sensibility. We're the agrarian economy  and we're supplying commodities. It's about supply and availability. Getting the commodities to market. With the industrial economy  it is about controlling costs    getting the costs down as low as possible so we can offer them to the masses. With the service economy  it is about improving quality. That has    the whole quality movement has risen with the service economy over the past    or    years. And now  with the experience economy  it's about rendering authenticity. Rendering authenticity    and the keyword is  rendering.  Right  Rendering  because you have to get your consumers    as business people    to percieve your offerings as authentic. Because there is a basic paradox  no one can have an inauthentic experience  but no business can supply one. Because all businesses are man made objects  all business is involved with money  all business is a matter of using machinery  and all those things make something inauthentic. So  how do you render authenticity  is the question. Are you rendering authenticity  When you think about that  let me go back to what Lionel Trilling  in his seminal book on authenticity   Sincerity and Authenticity     came out in         points to as the seminal point at which authenticity entered the lexicon  if you will. And that is  to no surprise  in Shakespeare  and in his play  Hamlet. And there is one part in this play  Hamlet  where the most fake of all the characters in Hamlet  Polonius  says something profoundly real. At the end of a laundry list of advice he's giving to his son  Laertes  he says this  And this above all  to thine own self be true. And it doth follow  as night the day  that thou canst not then be false to any man. And those three verses are the core of authenticity. There are two dimensions to authenticity  one  being true to yourself  which is very self directed. Two  is other directed  being what you say you are to others. And I don't know about you  but whenever I encounter two dimensions  I immediately go  ahh  two by two  All right  Anybody else like that  no  Well  if you think about that  you do  in fact  get a two by two. Where  on one dimension it's a matter of being true to yourself. As businesses  are the economic offerings you are providing    are they true to themselves  And the other dimension is  are they what they say they are to others  If not  you have   is not true to itself   and  is not what it says it is   yielding a two by two matrix. And of course  if you are both true to yourself  and are what you say you are  then you're real real  The opposite  of course  is    fake fake. All right  now  there is value for fake. There will always be companies around to supply the fake  because there will always be desire for the fake. Fact is  there's a general rule  if you don't like it  it's fake  if you do like it  it's faux. Now  the other two sides of the coin are  being a real fake    is what it says it is  but is not true to itself  or being a fake real  is true to itself  but not what it says it is. You can think about those two    you know  both of these better than being fake fake    not quite as good as being real real. You can contrast them by thinking about Universal City Walk versus Disney World  or Disneyland. Universal City Walk is a real fake    in fact  we got this very term from Ada Louise Huxtable's book   The Unreal America.  A wonderful book  where she talks about Universal City Walk as    you know  she decries the fake  but she says  at least that's a real fake  right  because you can see behind the facade  right  It is what it says it is  It's Universal Studio  it's in the city of Los Angeles  you're going to walk a lot. Right  You don't tend to walk a lot in Los Angeles  well  here's a place where you are going to walk a lot  outside in this city. But is it really true to itself  Right  Is it really in the city  Is it    you can see behind all of it  and see what is going on in the facades of it. So she calls it a real fake. Disney World  on the other hand  is a fake real  or a fake reality. Right  It's not what it says it is. It's not really the magic kingdom. But it is    oh  I'm sorry  I didn't mean to       sorry. We won't talk about Santa Claus then. But Disney World is wonderfully true to itself. Right  Just wonderfully true to itself. When you are there you are just immersed in this wonderful environment. So  it's a fake real. Now the easiest way to fall down in this  and not be real real  right  the easiest way not to be true to yourself is not to understand your heritage  and thereby repudiate that heritage. Right  the key of being true to yourself is knowing who you are as a business. Knowing where your heritage is  what you have done in the past. And what you have done in the past limits what you can do  what you can get away with  essentially  in the future. So  you have to understand that past. Think about Disney again. Disney     or    years ago  right  the Disney    the company that is probably best known for family values out there  Disney bought the ABC network. The ABC network  affectionately known in the trade as the T A network  right    that's not too much jargon  is it  Right  the T A network. Then it bought Miramax  known for its NC    fare  and all of a sudden  families everywhere couldn't really trust what they were getting from Disney. It was no longer true to its heritage  no longer true to Walt Disney. That's one of the reasons why they're having such trouble today  and why Roy Disney is out to get Michael Eisner. Because it is no longer true to itself. So  understand what    your past limits what you can do in the future. When it comes to being what you say you are  the easiest mistake that companies make is that they advertise things that they are not. That's when you're perceived as fake  as a phony company    advertizing things that you're not. Think about any hotel  any airline  any hospital. Right  if you could check into the ads  you'd have a great experience. But unfortunately  you have to experience the actual hotel  airline and hospital  and then you have that disconnect. Then you have that perception that you are phony. So  the number one thing to do when it comes to being what you say you are  is to provide places for people to experience who you are. For people to experience who you are. Right  it's not advertising does it. That's why you have companies like Starbucks  right  that doesn't advertise at all. They said  you want to know who we are  you have to come experience us. And think about the economic value they have provided by that experience. Right  Coffee  at its core  is what  Right  It's beans  right  It's coffee beans. You know how much coffee is worth  when treated as a commodity as a bean  Two or three cents per cup    that's what coffee is worth. But grind it  roast it  package it  put it on a grocery store shelf  and now it'll cost five         cents  when you treat it as a good. Take that same good  and perform the service of actually brewing it for a customer  in a corner diner  in a bodega  a kiosk somewhere  you get    cents  maybe a buck per cup of coffee. But surround the brewing of that coffee with the ambiance of a Starbucks  with the authentic cedar that goes inside of there  and now  because of that authentic experience  you can charge two  three  four  five dollars for a cup of coffee. So  authenticity is becoming the new consumer sensibility. Let me summarize it  for the business people in the audience  with three rules  three basic rules. One  don't say you're authentic unless you really are authentic. Two  it's easier to be authentic if you don't say you're authentic. And three  if you say you're authentic  you better be authentic. And then for the consumers  for everyone else in the audience  let me simply summarize it by saying  increasingly  what we    what will make us happy  is spending our time and our money satisfying the desire for authenticity. Thank you. My work is play. And I play when I design. I even looked it up in the dictionary  to make sure that I actually do that  and the definition of play  number one  was engaging in a childlike activity or endeavor  and number two was gambling. And I realize I do both when I'm designing. I'm both a kid and I'm gambling all the time. And I think that if you're not  there's probably something inherently wrong with the structure or the situation you're in  if you're a designer. But the serious part is what threw me  and I couldn't quite get a handle on it until I remembered an essay. And it's an essay I read    years ago. It was written by Russell Baker  who used to write an  Observer  column in the New York Times. He's a wonderful humorist. And I'm going to read you this essay  or an excerpt from it because it really hit home for me. Here is a letter of friendly advice. Be serious  it says. What it means  of course  is  be solemn. Being solemn is easy. Being serious is hard. Children almost always begin by being serious  which is what makes them so entertaining when compared with adults as a class. Adults  on the whole  are solemn. In politics  the rare candidate who is serious  like Adlai Stevenson  is easily overwhelmed by one who is solemn  like Eisenhower. That's because it is hard for most people to recognize seriousness  which is rare  but more comfortable to endorse solemnity  which is commonplace. Jogging  which is commonplace  and widely accepted as good for you  is solemn. Poker is serious. Washington  D.C. is solemn. New York is serious. Going to educational conferences to tell you anything about the future is solemn. Taking a long walk by yourself  during which you devise a foolproof scheme for robbing Tiffany's  is serious. Now  when I apply Russell Baker's definition of solemnity or seriousness to design  it doesn't necessarily make any particular point about quality. Solemn design is often important and very effective design. Solemn design is also socially correct  and is accepted by appropriate audiences. It's what right thinking designers and all the clients are striving for. Serious design  serious play  is something else. For one thing  it often happens spontaneously  intuitively  accidentally or incidentally. It can be achieved out of innocence  or arrogance  or out of selfishness  sometimes out of carelessness. But mostly  it's achieved through all those kind of crazy parts of human behavior that don't really make any sense. Serious design is imperfect. It's filled with the kind of craft laws that come from something being the first of its kind. Serious design is also    often    quite unsuccessful from the solemn point of view. That's because the art of serious play is about invention  change  rebellion    not perfection. Perfection happens during solemn play. Now  I always saw design careers like surreal staircases. If you look at the staircase  you'll see that in your   s the risers are very high and the steps are very short  and you make huge discoveries. You sort of leap up very quickly in your youth. That's because you don't know anything and you have a lot to learn  and so that anything you do is a learning experience and you're just jumping right up there. As you get older  the risers get shallower and the steps get wider  and you start moving along at a slower pace because you're making fewer discoveries. And as you get older and more decrepit  you sort of inch along on this sort of depressing  long staircase  leading you into oblivion. I find it's actually getting really hard to be serious. I'm hired to be solemn  but I find more and more that I'm solemn when I don't have to be. And in my    years of working experience  I think I was really serious four times. And I'm going to show them to you now  because they came out of very specific conditions. It's great to be a kid. Now  when I was in my early   s  I worked in the record business  designing record covers for CBS Records  and I had no idea what a great job I had. I thought everybody had a job like that. And what    the way I looked at design and the way I looked at the world was  what was going on around me and the things that came at the time I walked into design were the enemy. I really  really  really hated the typeface Helvetica. I thought the typeface Helvetica was the cleanest  most boring  most fascistic  really repressive typeface  and I hated everything that was designed in Helvetica. And when I was in my college days  this was the sort of design that was fashionable and popular. This is actually quite a lovely book jacket by Rudy de Harak  but I just hated it  because it was designed with Helvetica  and I made parodies about it. I just thought it was  you know  completely boring. So    so  my goal in life was to do stuff that wasn't made out of Helvetica. And to do stuff that wasn't made out of Helvetica was actually kind of hard because you had to find it. And there weren't a lot of books about the history of design in the early   s. There weren't    there wasn't a plethora of design publishing. You actually had to go to antique stores. You had to go to Europe. You had to go places and find the stuff. And what I responded to was  you know  Art Nouveau  or deco  or Victorian typography  or things that were just completely not Helvetica. And I taught myself design this way  and this was sort of my early years  and I used these things in really goofy ways on record covers and in my design. I wasn't educated. I just sort of put these things together. I mixed up Victorian designs with pop  and I mixed up Art Nouveau with something else. And I made these very lush  very elaborate record covers  not because I was being a post modernist or a historicist    because I didn't know what those things were. I just hated Helvetica. And that kind of passion drove me into very serious play  a kind of play I could never do now because I'm too well educated. And there's something wonderful about that form of youth  where you can let yourself grow and play  and be really a brat  and then accomplish things. By the end of the '  s  actually  the stuff became known. I mean  these covers appeared all over the world  and they started winning awards  and people knew them. And I was suddenly a post modernist  and I began a career as    in my own business. And first I was praised for it  then criticized for it  but the fact of the matter was  I had become solemn. I didn't do what I think was a piece of serious work again for about    years. I spent most of the '  s being quite solemn  turning out these sorts of designs that I was expected to do because that's who I was  and I was living in this cycle of going from serious to solemn to hackneyed to dead  and getting rediscovered all over again. So  here was the second condition for which I think I accomplished some serious play. There's a Paul Newman movie that I love called  The Verdict.  I don't know how many of you have seen it  but it's a beaut. And in the movie  he plays a down and out lawyer who's become an ambulance chaser. And he's taken on    he's given  actually    a malpractice suit to handle that's sort of an easy deal  and in the midst of trying to connect the deal  he starts to empathize and identify with his client  and he regains his morality and purpose  and he goes on to win the case. And in the depth of despair  in the midst of the movie  when it looks like he can't pull this thing off  and he needs this case  he needs to win this case so badly. There's a shot of Paul Newman alone  in his office  saying   This is the case. There are no other cases. This is the case. There are no other cases.  And in that moment of desire and focus  he can win. And that is a wonderful position to be in to create some serious play. And I had that moment in      when I met a theater director named George Wolfe  who was going to have me design an identity for the New York Shakespeare Festival  then known  and then became the Public Theater. And I began getting immersed in this project in a way I never was before. This is what theater advertising looked like at that time. This is what was in the newspapers and in the New York Times. So  this is sort of a comment on the time. And the Public Theater actually had much better advertising than this. They had no logo and no identity  but they had these very iconic posters painted by Paul Davis. And George Wolf had taken over from another director and he wanted to change the theater  and he wanted to make it urban and loud and a place that was inclusive. So  drawing on my love of typography  I immersed myself into this project. And what was different about it was the totality of it  was that I really became the voice  the visual voice  of a place in a way I had never done before  where every aspect    the smallest ad  the ticket  whatever it was    was designed by me. There was no format. There was no in house department that these things were pushed to. I literally for three years made everything    every scrap of paper  everything online  that this theater did. And it was the only job  even though I was doing other jobs. I lived and breathed it in a way I haven't with a client since. It enabled me to really express myself and grow. And I think that you know when you're going to be given this position  and it's rare  but when you get it and you have this opportunity  it's the moment of serious play. I did these things  and I still do them. I still work for the Public Theater. I'm on their board  and I still am involved with it. The high point of the Public Theater  I think  was in       two years after I designed it  which was the  Bring in 'da Noise  Bring in 'da Funk  campaign that was all over New York. But something happened to it  and what happened to it was  it became very popular. And that is a kiss of death for something serious because it makes it solemn. And what happened was that New York City  to a degree  ate my identity because people began to copy it. Here's an ad in the New York Times somebody did for a play called  Mind Games.  Then  Chicago  came out  used similar graphics  and the Public Theater's identity was just totally eaten and taken away  which meant I had to change it. So  I changed it so that every season was different  and I continued to do these posters  but they never had the seriousness of the first identity because they were too individual  and they didn't have that heft of everything being the same thing. Now    and I think since the Public Theater  I must have done more than a dozen cultural identities for major institutions  and I don't think I ever    I ever grasped that seriousness again    I do them for very big  important institutions in New York City. The institutions are solemn  and so is the design. They're better crafted than the Public Theater was  and they spend more money on them  but I think that that moment comes and goes. The best way to accomplish serious design    which I think we all have the opportunity to do    is to be totally and completely unqualified for the job. That doesn't happen very often  but it happened to me in the year       when for some reason or another  a whole pile of different architects started to ask me to design the insides of theaters with them  where I would take environmental graphics and work them into buildings. I'd never done this kind of work before. I didn't know how to read an architectural plan  I didn't know what they were talking about  and I really couldn't handle the fact that a job    a single job    could go on for four years because I was used to immediacy in graphic design  and that kind of attention to detail was really bad for somebody like me  with ADD. So  it was a rough    it was a rough go  but I fell in love with this process of actually integrating graphics into architecture because I didn't know what I was doing. I said   Why can't the signage be on the floor   New Yorkers look at their feet. And then I found that actors and actresses actually take their cues from the floor  so it turned out that these sorts of sign systems began to make sense. They integrated with the building in really peculiar ways. They ran around corners  they went up sides of buildings  and they melded into the architecture. This is Symphony Space on   th Street and Broadway  and the type is interwoven into the stainless steel and backlit with fiber optics. And the architect  Jim Polshek  essentially gave me a canvas to play typography out on. And it was serious play. This is the children's museum in Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania  made out of completely inexpensive materials. Extruded typography that's backlit with neon. Things I never did before  built before. I just thought they'd be kind of fun to do. Donors' walls made out of Lucite. And then  inexpensive signage. I think my favorite of these was this little job in Newark  New Jersey. It's a performing arts school. This is the building that    they had no money  and they had to recast it  and they said  if we give you         dollars  what can you do with it  And I did a little Photoshop job on it  and I said  Well  I think we can paint it. And we did. And it was play. And there's the building. Everything was painted    typography over the whole damn thing  including the air conditioning ducts. I hired guys who paint flats fixed on the sides of garages to do the painting on the building  and they loved it. They got into it    they took the job incredibly seriously. They used to climb up on the building and call me and tell me that they had to correct my typography    that my spacing was wrong  and they moved it  and they did wonderful things with it. They were pretty serious  too. It was quite wonderful. By the time I did Bloomberg's headquarters my work had begun to become accepted. People wanted it in big  expensive places. And that began to make it solemn. Bloomberg was all about numbers  and we did big numbers through the space and the numbers were projected on a spectacular LED that my partner  Lisa Strausfeld  programmed. But it became the end of the seriousness of the play  and it started to  once again  become solemn. This is a current project in Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania  where I got to be goofy. I was invited to design a logo for this neighborhood  called the North Side  and I thought it was silly for a neighborhood to have a logo. I think that's rather creepy  actually. Why would a neighborhood have a logo  A neighborhood has a thing    it's got a landmark  it's got a place  it's got a restaurant. It doesn't have a logo. I mean  what would that be  So I had to actually give a presentation to a city council and neighborhood constituents  and I went to Pittsburgh and I said   You know  really what you have here are all these underpasses that separate the neighborhood from the center of town. Why don't you celebrate them  and make the underpasses landmarks   So I began doing this crazy presentation of these installations    potential installations    on these underpass bridges  and stood up in front of the city council    and was a little bit scared  I have to admit. But I was so utterly unqualified for this project  and so utterly ridiculous  and ignored the brief so desperately that I think they just embraced it with wholeheartedness  just completely because it was so goofy to begin with. And this is the bridge they're actually painting up and preparing as we speak. It will change every six months  and it will become an art installation in the North Side of Pittsburgh  and it will probably become a landmark in the area. John Hockenberry told you a bit about my travail with Citibank  that is now a    year relationship  and I still work with them. And I actually am amused by them and like them  and think that as a very  very  very  very  very big corporation they actually keep their graphics very nice. I drew the logo for Citibank on a napkin in the first meeting. That was the play part of the job. And then I spent a year going to long  tedious  boring meetings  trying to sell this logo through to a huge corporation to the point of tears. I thought I was going to go crazy at the end of this year. We made idiotic presentations showing how the Citi logo made sense  and how it was really derived from an umbrella  and we made animations of these things  and we came back and forth and back and forth and back and forth. And it was worth it  because they bought this thing  and it played out on such a grand scale  and it's so internationally recognizable  but for me it was actually a very  very depressing year. As a matter of fact  they actually never bought onto the logo until Fallon put it on its very good  Live Richly  campaign  and then everybody accepted it all over the world. So during this time I needed some kind of counterbalance for this crazy  crazy existence of going to these long  idiotic meetings. And I was up in my country house  and for some reason  I began painting these very big  very involved  laborious  complicated maps of the entire world  and listing every place on the planet  and putting them in  and misspelling them  and putting things in the wrong spot  and completely controlling the information  and going totally and completely nuts with it. They would take me about six months initially  but then I started getting faster at it. Here's the United States. Every single city of the United States is on here. And it hung for about eight months at the Cooper Hewitt  and people walked up to it  and they would point to a part of the map and they'd say   Oh  I've been here.  And  of course  they couldn't have been because it's in the wrong spot. But what I liked about it was  I was controlling my own idiotic information  and I was creating my own palette of information  and I was totally and completely at play. One of my favorites was this painting I did of Florida after the      election that has the election results rolling around in the water. I keep that for evidence. Somebody was up at my house and saw the paintings and recommended them to a gallery  and I had a first show about two and a half years ago  and I showed these paintings that I'm showing you now. And then a funny thing happened    they sold. And they sold quickly  and became rather popular. We started making prints from them. This is Manhattan  one from the series. This is a print from the United States which we did in red  white and blue. We began doing these big silkscreen prints  and they started selling  too. So  the gallery wanted me to have another show in two years  which meant that I really had to paint these paintings much faster than I had ever done them. And I    they started to become more political  and I picked areas that sort of were in the news or that I had some feeling about  and I began doing these things. And then this funny thing happened. I found that I was no longer at play. I was actually in this solemn landscape of fulfilling an expectation for a show  which is not where I started with these things. So  while they became successful  I know how to make them  so I'm not a neophyte  and they're no longer serious    they have become solemn. And that's a terrifying factor    when you start something and it turns that way    because it means that all that's left for you is to go back and to find out what the next thing is that you can push  that you can invent  that you can be ignorant about  that you can be arrogant about  that you can fail with  and that you can be a fool with. Because in the end  that's how you grow  and that's all that matters. So  I'm plugging along here    and I'm just going to have to blow up the staircase. Thank you very much. I had requested slides  kind of adamantly  up till the    pretty much  last few days  but was denied access to a slide projector. I actually find them a lot more emotional       and personal  and the neat thing about a slide projector is you can actually focus the work  unlike PowerPoint and some other programs. Now  I agree that you have to    yeah  there are certain concessions and  you know  if you use a slide projector  you're not able to have the bad type swing in from the back or the side  or up or down  but maybe that's an O.K. trade off  to trade that off for a focus. It's a thought. Just a thought. And there's something nice about slides getting stuck. And the thing you really hope for is occasionally they burn up  which we won't see tonight. So. With that  let's get the first slide up here. This  as many of you have probably guessed  is a recently emptied beer can in Portugal. This    I had just arrived in Barcelona for the first time  and I thought    you know  fly all night  I looked up  and I thought  wow  how clean. You come into this major airport  and they simply have a B. I mean  how nice is that  Everything's gotten simpler in design  and here's this mega airport  and God  I just    I took a picture. I thought  God  that is the coolest thing I've ever seen at an airport. Till a couple months later  I went back to the same airport    same plane  I think    and looked up  and it said C. It was only then that I realized it was simply a gate that I was coming into. I'm a big believer in the emotion of design  and the message that's sent before somebody begins to read  before they get the rest of the information  what is the emotional response they get to the product  to the story  to the painting    whatever it is. That area of design interests me the most  and I think this for me is a real clear  very simplified version of what I'm talking about. These are a couple of garage doors painted identical  situated next to each other. So  here's the first door. You know  you get the message. You know  it's pretty clear. Take a look at the second door and see if there's any different message. O.K.  which one would you park in front of  Same color  same message  same words. The only thing that's different is the expression that the individual door owner here put into the piece    and  again  which is the psycho killer here  Yet it doesn't say that  it doesn't need to say that. I would probably park in front of the other one. I'm sure a lot of you are aware that graphic design has gotten a lot simpler in the last five years or so. It's gotten so simple that it's already starting to kind of come back the other way again and get a little more expressive. But I was in Milan and saw this street sign  and was very happy to see that apparently this idea of minimalism has even been translated by the graffiti artist. And this graffiti artist has come along  made this sign a little bit better  and then moved on. He didn't overpower it like they have a tendency to do. This is for a book by  Metropolis.  I took some photos  and this is a billboard in Florida  and either they hadn't paid their rent  or they didn't want to pay their rent again on the sign  and the billboard people were too cheap to tear the whole sign down  so they just teared out sections of it. And I would argue that it's possibly more effective than the original billboard in terms of getting your attention  getting you to look over that way. And hopefully you don't stop and buy those awful pecan things    Stuckey's. This is from my second book. The first book is called   The End of Print   and it was done along with a film  working with William Burroughs. And  The End of Print  is now in its fifth printing. When I first contacted William Burroughs about being part of it  he said no  he said he didn't believe it was the end of print. And I said  well  that's fine  I just would love to have your input on this film and this book  and he finally agreed to it. And at the end of the film  he says in this great voice that I can't mimic but I'll kind of try  but not really  he says   I remember attending an exhibition called  'Photography  The End of Painting.'  And then he says   And  of course  it wasn't at all.  So  apparently when photography was perfected  there were people going around saying  that's it  you've just ruined painting. People are just going to take pictures now. And of course  that wasn't the case. So  this is from   nd Sight   a book I did on intuition. I think it's not the only ingredient in design  but possibly the most important. It's something everybody has. It's not a matter of teaching it  in fact  most of the schools tend to discount intuition as an ingredient of your working process because they can't quantify it  it's very hard to teach people the four steps to intuitive design  but we can teach you the four steps to a nice business card or a newsletter. So it tends to get discounted. This is a quote from Albert Einstein  who says   The intellect has little to do on the road to discovery. There comes a leap in consciousness    call it intuition or what you will    and the solution just comes to you  and you don't know from where or why.  So  it's kind of like when somebody says  Who did that song  And the more you try to think about it  the further the answer gets from you  and the minute you stop thinking about it  your intuition gives you that answer  in a sense. I like this for a couple of reasons. If you've had any design courses  they would teach you you can't read this. I think you eventually can and  more importantly  I think it's true.  Don't mistake legibility for communication.  Just because something's legible doesn't means it communicates. More importantly  it doesn't mean it communicates the right thing. So  what is the message sent before somebody actually gets into the material  And I think that's sometimes an overlooked area. This is working with Marshall McLuhan. I stayed and worked with his wife and son  Eric  and we came up with close to     quotes from Marshall that are just amazing in terms of being ahead of the times  predicting so much of what has happened in the advertising  television  media world. And so this book is called  Probes.  It's another word for quotes. And it's    a lot of them are never    have never been published before  and basically  I've interpreted the different quotes. So  this was the contents page originally. When I got done it was     pages  and then the publisher  Gingko Press  ended up cutting it down considerably  it's just under     pages now. But I decided I liked this contents page    I liked the way it looks    so I kept it. It now has no relevance to the book whatsoever  but it's a nice spread  I think  in there. So  a couple spreads from the book  here McLuhan says   The new media are not bridges between Man and Nature  they are Nature.   The invention of printing did away with anonymity  fostering ideas of literary fame and the habit of considering intellectual effort as private property   which had never been done before printing.  When new technologies impose themselves on societies long habituated to older technologies  anxieties of all kinds result.   While people are engaged in creating a totally different world  they always form vivid images of the preceding world.  I hate this stuff. It's hard to read.  People in the electronic age have no possible environment except the globe  and no possible occupation except information gathering.  That was it. That's all he saw as the options. And not too far off. So  this is a project for Nine Inch Nails. And I only show it because it seemed like it got all this relevancy all of a sudden  and it was done right after     . And I had recently discovered a bomb shelter in the backyard of a house I had bought in LA that the real estate person hadn't pointed out. There was some bomb shelter built  apparently in the '  s Cuban missile crisis. And I asked the real estate guy what it was as we were walking by  and he goes   It's something to do with the sewage system.  I was  O.K.  that's fine. I finally went down there  and it was this old rusted circular thing  and two beds  and very kind of creepy and weird. And also  surprisingly  it was done in kind of a cheap metal  and it had completely rusted through  and water everywhere  and spiders. And I thought  you know  what were they thinking  You'd think maybe cement  possibly  or something. But anyway  I used this for a cover for the Nine Inch Nails DVD  and I've also now fixed the bomb shelter with duct tape  and it's ready. I think I'm ready. So. This is an experiment  really  for a client  Quicksilver  where we were taking what was a six shot sequence and trying to use print as a medium to get people to the Web. So  this is a six shot sequence. I've taken one shot  I cropped it a few different ways. And then the tiny line of copy says  If you want to see this entire sequence    how this whole ride was    go to the website. And my guess is that a lot of the surf kids did go to the site to get this entire picture. Got no way of tracking it  so I could be totally wrong. I don't have the site. It's just the piece itself. This is a group in New York called the Coalition for a Smoke free Environment    asked me to do these posters. They were wild posted around New York City. You can't really    well  you can't see it at all    but the second line is really the more kind of payoff  in a sense. It says   If the cigarette companies can lie  then so can we.  But       but I did. These were literally wild posted all over New York one night  and there were definitely some heads turning  you know  people smoking and   Huh   And it was purposely done to look fairly serious. It wasn't some  you know  weird grunge type or something  it looked like they might be real. Anyway. Poster for Atlantic Center for the Arts  a school in Florida. This amazes me. This is a product I just found out. I was in the Caribbean at Christmas  and I'm just blown away that in this day and age they will still sell    not that they will sell    that there is felt a need for people to lighten the color of their skin. This was either an old product with new packaging  or a brand new package  and I just thought  Yikes  How's that still happening  I do a lot of workshops all over the world  really  and this particular assignment was to come up with new symbols for the restroom doors. I felt this was one of the more successful solutions. The students actually cut them up and put them up around bars and restaurants that night  and I just always have this vision of this elderly couple going to use the restroom ... I did some work for Microsoft a few years back. It was a worldwide branding campaign. And it was interesting to me    my background is in sociology  I had no design training  and sometimes people say  well  that explains it    but it was a very interesting experiment because there's no product that I had to sell  it was simply the image of Microsoft they were trying to improve. They thought some people didn't like them. I found out that's very true  working on this campaign worldwide. And our goal was to try to humanize them a bit  and what I did was add type and people to the ad  which the previous campaign had not had  and nobody remembered them  and nobody referenced them. And we were trying to say that  hey  some of these guys that work there are actually OK  some of them actually have friends and family  and they're not all awful people. And the umbrella campaign was  Thank God it's Monday.  So  we tried to take this    what was perceived as a negative  their over competitiveness  their  you know  long working hours    and turn it into a positive and not run from it. You know  Thank God it's Monday    I get to go back to that little cubicle  those fake gray walls  and hear everybody else's conversations f or    hours and then go home. But anyway  this is one of the ads I was most pleased with  because they were all elaborately art directed  and this one I thought actually felt like the girl was looking at the computer. It says   Wonder Around.  And then it's a piece of the software. And this is how the ad ran around the world. In Germany  they made one small change without checking with me    nor did they have to  because it was done through agencies    but see if you can tell the difference. This is how the ad ran throughout the world  Germany made one slight change in the ad. Now  there's kind of two issues here. If you're going to put a kid in the ad  pick one that looks alive. I just have a feeling this kid's been there for a week  you know. He's just really hoping that boots up and  you know ... And then as the agency explained to me  they said   Look  we don't have little green people in our country  why would we put little green people in our ads  for instance   So  I understand their logic. I totally disagree with it  I think it's a very small minded approach  the world is certainly much more global  and I certainly think the people of Germany could have handled a little black girl sitting in front of a computer  though we'll never know. This is some work from Ray Gun. And the point of this magazine was to read the articles  listen to the music  and try to interpret it. There's no grid  there's no system  there's nothing set up in advance. This is an opener for Brian Eno  and it's just kind of my personal interpretation of the music. This is rockstars talking about teachers they had lusted after in school. There's a lot of great writing in  Ray Gun.  And I was fortunate to find a photograph of a teacher sitting on some books. Article on Bryan Ferry    just really boring article    so I set the whole article in Dingbat. You could    you could highlight it  you could make it Helvetica or something  it is the actual article. I suppose you could eventually decode it  but it's really not very well written  it really wouldn't be worthwhile. Having done a lot of magazines  I'm very curious how big magazines handle big stories  and I was very curious to see how Time and Newsweek would handle     . And I was basically pretty disappointed to see that they had chosen to show the photo we'd already seen a million times  which was basically the moment of impact. And People magazine  I thought  got probably the best shot. It's kind of horsey type  but the texture    the second plane not quite hitting  there was something more enticing  if that's the right    it's not the right word    but in this cover than Time or Newsweek. But when I got into this magazine  there's something kind of disturbing  and this continued. On the left we see people dying  we see people running for their lives. And on the right we learn that there's a new way to support your breast. The coveted right hand page was not given up to the whole issue. Look at the image of this lady    who knows what she's going through     and the copy says   He knows just how to give me goosebumps.  Yeah  he jumps out of buildings. It's    unfortunately  this one works  kind of  as a spread. And this continued through the entire magazine. It did not let up. This says   One clean fits all.  . There were a lot of orphans made this day  and here's a dead body being brought out. It just seems to me possibly even a blank page would have been more appropriate. And this one I think is possibly the worst  two ladies  both facing the same way  both wearing jeans. One    who knows what she's going through  the other one is worried about model behavior and milk. And    I gave a talk in New York a couple months after this  and afterwards somebody came up to me and they said that    they actually emailed me    and they said that they appreciated the talk  and when they got back to their car  they found a note on their car that made them think maybe New York was getting back to being New York again after this event    it had been a few months. This was what they found on their car. There's very few times you'd be happy to find this on your car  but it did seem to indicate that we were coming back. This is my desktop. Somebody told me today there was this thing called folders  but I don't know what they are. These are my notes for the talk    there might be a correlation here. We are wrapping up. This I saw on the plane  flying in  for hot new products. I'm not sure this is an improvement  or a good idea  because  like  if you don't spend quite enough time in front of your computer  you can now get a plate in the keyboard  so there's no more faking it    that you don't really sit at your desk all day and eat and work anyway. Now there's a plate  and it would be really  really convenient to get a piece of pizza  then type a little bit  then ... I'm just not sure this is improvement. If you ever doubt the power of graphic design  this is a very generic sign that literally says   Vote for Hitler.  It says nothing else. And this to me is an extreme case of the power of emotion  of graphic design  even though  in fact  was a very generic poster at the time. What's next  What's next is going to be people. As we get more technically driven  the importance of people becomes more than it's ever been before. You have to utilize who you are in your work. Nobody else can do that  nobody else can pull from your background  from your parents  your upbringing  your whole life experience. If you allow that to happen  it's really the only way you can do some unique work  and you're going to enjoy the work a lot more as well. This is    I like found art  hand lettering's coming back in a big way  and I thought this was a great example of both. This lady's advertising for her lost pit bull. It's friendly    she's underlined friendly    that's probably why she calls it Hercules or Hercles. She can't spell. But more importantly  she's willing to give you    bucks to go find this lost pit bull. And I'm thinking  yeah  right  I'll go look for a lost pit bill for    bucks. I have visions of people going down alleyways yelling out for Hercles  and you get charged by this thing and you go  oh  please be Hercles  please be the friendly one. I'm sure she never found the dog  because I took the sign. But I was asked to give a talk at a conference in Sacramento a few years back. And the theme was courage  and they asked me to talk about how courageous it is to be a graphic designer. And I remembered seeing this photograph of my father  who was a test pilot  and he told me that when you signed up to become a test pilot  they told you that there was a    to    percent chance of death on the job. That's pretty high for most occupations. But  you know  the government would make a plane  they'd say  go see if that one flies  would you  Some of them did  some of them didn't. And I started thinking about some of these decisions I have to make between  like  serif versus san serif. And for the most part  they're not real life threatening. Why not experiment  Why not have some fun  Why not put some of yourself into the work  And when I was teaching  I used to always ask the students  What's the definition of a good job  And as teachers  after you get all the answers  you like to give them the correct answer. And the best one I've heard    I'm sure some of you have heard this    the definition of a good job is  If you could afford to    if money wasn't an issue    would you be doing that same work  And if you would  you've got a great job. And if you wouldn't  what the heck are you doing  You're going to be dead a really long time. Thank you very much. The future that we will create can be a future that we'll be proud of. I think about this every day  it's quite literally my job. I'm co founder and senior columnist at Worldchanging.com. Alex Steffen and I founded Worldchanging in late       and since then we and our growing global team of contributors have documented the ever expanding variety of solutions that are out there  right now and on the near horizon. In a little over two years  we've written up about       items    replicable models  technological tools  emerging ideas    all providing a path to a future that's more sustainable  more equitable and more desirable. Our emphasis on solutions is quite intentional. There are tons of places to go  online and off  if what you want to find is the latest bit of news about just how quickly our hell bound handbasket is moving. We want to offer people an idea of what they can do about it. We focus primarily on the planet's environment  but we also address issues of global development  international conflict  responsible use of emerging technologies  even the rise of the so called Second Superpower and much  much more. The scope of solutions that we discuss is actually pretty broad  but that reflects both the range of challenges that need to be met and the kinds of innovations that will allow us to do so. A quick sampling really can barely scratch the surface  but to give you a sense of what we cover  tools for rapid disaster relief  such as this inflatable concrete shelter  innovative uses of bioscience  such as a flower that changes color in the presence of landmines  ultra high efficiency designs for homes and offices  distributed power generation using solar power  wind power  ocean power  other clean energy sources  ultra  ultra high efficiency vehicles of the future  ultra high efficiency vehicles you can get right now  and better urban design  so you don't need to drive as much in the first place  bio mimetic approaches to design that take advantage of the efficiencies of natural models in both vehicles and buildings  distributed computing projects that will help us model the future of the climate. Also  a number of the topics that we've been talking about this week at TED are things that we've addressed in the past on Worldchanging  cradle to cradle design  MIT's Fab Labs  the consequences of extreme longevity  the One Laptop per Child project  even Gapminder. As a born in the mid     s Gen X er  hurtling all too quickly to my fortieth birthday  I'm naturally inclined to pessimism. But working at Worldchanging has convinced me  much to my own surprise  that successful responses to the world's problems are nonetheless possible. Moreover  I've come to realize that focusing only on negative outcomes can really blind you to the very possibility of success. As Norwegian social scientist Evelin Lindner has observed   Pessimism is a luxury of good times ... In difficult times  pessimism is a self fulfilling  self inflicted death sentence.  The truth is  we can build a better world  and we can do so right now. We have the tools  we saw a hint of that a moment ago  and we're coming up with new ones all the time. We have the knowledge  and our understanding of the planet improves every day. Most importantly  we have the motive  we have a world that needs fixing  and nobody's going to do it for us. Many of the solutions that I and my colleagues seek out and write up every day have some important aspects in common  transparency  collaboration  a willingness to experiment  and an appreciation of science    or  more appropriately  science  The majority of models  tools and ideas on Worldchanging encompass combinations of these characteristics  so I want to give you a few concrete examples of how these principles combine in world changing ways. We can see world changing values in the emergence of tools to make the invisible visible    that is  to make apparent the conditions of the world around us that would otherwise be largely imperceptible. We know that people often change their behavior when they can see and understand the impact of their actions. As a small example  many of us have experienced the change in driving behavior that comes from having a real time display of mileage showing precisely how one's driving habits affect the vehicle's efficiency. The last few years have all seen the rise of innovations in how we measure and display aspects of the world that can be too big  or too intangible  or too slippery to grasp easily. Simple technologies  like wall mounted devices that display how much power your household is using  and what kind of results you'll get if you turn off a few lights    these can actually have a direct positive impact on your energy footprint. Community tools  like text messaging  that can tell you when pollen counts are up or smog levels are rising or a natural disaster is unfolding  can give you the information you need to act in a timely fashion. Data rich displays like maps of campaign contributions  or maps of the disappearing polar ice caps  allow us to better understand the context and the flow of processes that affect us all. We can see world changing values in research projects that seek to meet the world's medical needs through open access to data and collaborative action. Now  some people emphasize the risks of knowledge enabled dangers  but I'm convinced that the benefits of knowledge enabled solutions are far more important. For example  open access journals  like the Public Library of Science  make cutting edge scientific research free to all    everyone in the world. And actually  a growing number of science publishers are adopting this model. Last year  hundreds of volunteer biology and chemistry researchers around the world worked together to sequence the genome of the parasite responsible for some of the developing world's worst diseases  African sleeping sickness  leishmaniasis and Chagas disease. That genome data can now be found on open access genetic data banks around the world  and it's an enormous boon to researchers trying to come up with treatments. But my favorite example has to be the global response to the SARS epidemic in             which relied on worldwide access to the full gene sequence of the SARS virus. The U.S. National Research Council in its follow up report on the outbreak specifically cited this open availability of the sequence as a key reason why the treatment for SARS could be developed so quickly. And we can see world changing values in something as humble as a cell phone. I can probably count on my fingers the number of people in this room who do not use a mobile phone    and where is Aubrey  because I know he doesn't  For many of us  cell phones have really become almost an extension of ourselves  and we're really now beginning to see the social changes that mobile phones can bring about. You may already know some of the big picture aspects  globally  more camera phones were sold last year than any other kind of camera  and a growing number of people live lives mediated through the lens  and over the network    and sometimes enter history books. In the developing world  mobile phones have become economic drivers. A study last year showed a direct correlation between the growth of mobile phone use and subsequent GDP increases across Africa. In Kenya  mobile phone minutes have actually become an alternative currency. The political aspects of mobile phones can't be ignored either  from text message swarms in Korea helping to bring down a government  to the Blairwatch Project in the UK  keeping tabs on politicians who try to avoid the press. And it's just going to get more wild. Pervasive  always on networks  high quality sound and video  even devices made to be worn instead of carried in the pocket  will transform how we live on a scale that few really appreciate. It's no exaggeration to say that the mobile phone may be among the world's most important technologies. And in this rapidly evolving context  it's possible to imagine a world in which the mobile phone becomes something far more than a medium for social interaction. I've long admired the Witness project  and Peter Gabriel told us more details about it on Wednesday  in his profoundly moving presentation. And I'm just incredibly happy to see the news that Witness is going to be opening up a Web portal to enable users of digital cameras and camera phones to send in their recordings over the Internet  rather than just hand carrying the videotape. Not only does this add a new and potentially safer avenue for documenting abuses  it opens up the program to the growing global digital generation. Now  imagine a similar model for networking environmentalists. Imagine a Web portal collecting recordings and evidence of what's happening to the planet  putting news and data at the fingertips of people of all kinds  from activists and researchers to businesspeople and political figures. It would highlight the changes that are underway  but would more importantly give voice to the people who are willing to work to see a new world  a better world  come about. It would give everyday citizens a chance to play a role in the protection of the planet. It would be  in essence  an  Earth Witness  project. Now  just to be clear  in this talk I'm using the name  Earth Witness  as part of the scenario  simply as a shorthand  for what this imaginary project could aspire to  not to piggyback on the wonderful work of the Witness organization. It could just as easily be called   Environmental Transparency Project    Smart Mobs for Natural Security     but Earth Witness is a lot easier to say. Now  many of the people who participate in Earth Witness would focus on ecological problems  human caused or otherwise  especially environmental crimes and significant sources of greenhouse gases and emissions. That's understandable and important. We need better documentation of what's happening to the planet if we're ever going to have a chance of repairing the damage. But the Earth Witness project wouldn't need to be limited to problems. In the best Worldchanging tradition  it might also serve as a showcase for good ideas  successful projects and efforts to make a difference that deserve much more visibility. Earth Witness would show us two worlds  the world we're leaving behind  and the world we're building for generations to come. And what makes this scenario particularly appealing to me is we could do it today. The key components are already widely available. Camera phones  of course  would be fundamental to the project. And for a lot of us  they're as close as we have yet to always on  widely available information tools. We may not remember to bring our digital cameras with us wherever we go  but very few of us forget our phones. You could even imagine a version of this scenario in which people actually build their own phones. Over the course of last year  open source hardware hackers have come up with multiple models for usable  Linux based mobile phones  and the Earth Phone could spin off from this kind of project. At the other end of the network  there'd be a server for people to send photos and messages to  accessible over the Web  combining a photo sharing service  social networking platforms and a collaborative filtering system. Now  you Web  .  folks in the audience know what I'm talking about  but for those of you for whom that last sentence was in a crazy moon language  I mean simply this  the online part of the Earth Witness project would be created by the users  working together and working openly. That's enough right there to start to build a compelling chronicle of what's now happening to our planet  but we could do more. An Earth Witness site could also serve as a collection spot for all sorts of data about conditions around the planet picked up by environmental sensors that attach to your cell phone. Now  you don't see these devices as add ons for phones yet  but students and engineers around the world have attached atmospheric sensors to bicycles and handheld computers and cheap robots and the backs of pigeons    that being a project that's actually underway right now at U.C. Irvine  using bird mounted sensors as a way of measuring smog forming pollution. It's hardly a stretch to imagine putting the same thing on a phone carried by a person. Now  the idea of connecting a sensor to your phone is not new  phone makers around the world offer phones that sniff for bad breath  or tell you to worry about too much sun exposure. Swedish firm Uppsala Biomedical  more seriously  makes a mobile phone add on that can process blood tests in the field  uploading the data  displaying the results. Even the Lawrence Livermore National Labs have gotten into the act  designing a prototype phone that has radiation sensors to find dirty bombs. Now  there's an enormous variety of tiny  inexpensive sensors on the market  and you can easily imagine someone putting together a phone that could measure temperature  CO  or methane levels  the presence of some biotoxins    potentially  in a few years  maybe even H N  avian flu virus. You could see that some kind of system like this would actually be a really good fit with Larry Brilliant's InSTEDD project. Now  all of this data could be tagged with geographic information and mashed up with online maps for easy viewing and analysis. And that's worth noting in particular. The impact of open access online maps over the last year or two has been simply phenomenal. Developers around the world have come up with an amazing variety of ways to layer useful data on top of the maps  from bus routes and crime statistics to the global progress of avian flu. Earth Witness would take this further  linking what you see with what thousands or millions of other people see around the world. It's kind of exciting to think about what might be accomplished if something like this ever existed. We'd have a far better    far better knowledge of what's happening on our planet environmentally than could be gathered with satellites and a handful of government sensor nets alone. It would be a collaborative  bottom up approach to environmental awareness and protection  able to respond to emerging concerns in a smart mobs kind of way    and if you need greater sensor density  just have more people show up. And most important  you can't ignore how important mobile phones are to global youth. This is a system that could put the next generation at the front lines of gathering environmental data. And as we work to figure out ways to mitigate the worst effects of climate disruption  every little bit of information matters. A system like Earth Witness would be a tool for all of us to participate in the improvement of our knowledge and  ultimately  the improvement of the planet itself. Now  as I suggested at the outset  there are thousands upon thousands of good ideas out there  so why have I spent the bulk of my time telling you about something that doesn't exist  Because this is what tomorrow could look like  bottom up  technology enabled global collaboration to handle the biggest crisis our civilization has ever faced. We can save the planet  but we can't do it alone    we need each other. Nobody's going to fix the world for us  but working together  making use of technological innovations and human communities alike  we might just be able to fix it ourselves. We have at our fingertips a cornucopia of compelling models  powerful tools  and innovative ideas that can make a meaningful difference in our planet's future. We don't need to wait for a magic bullet to save us all  we already have an arsenal of solutions just waiting to be used. There's a staggering array of wonders out there  across diverse disciplines  all telling us the same thing  success can be ours if we're willing to try. And as we say at Worldchanging  another world isn't just possible  another world is here. We just need to open our eyes. Thank you very much. What's happening in genomics  and how this revolution is about to change everything we know about the world  life  ourselves  and how we think about them. If you saw       A Space Odyssey  and you heard the boom  boom  boom  boom  and you saw the monolith  you know  that was Arthur C. Clarke's representation that we were at a seminal moment in the evolution of our species. In this case  it was picking up bones and creating a tool  using it as a tool  which meant that apes just  sort of  running around and eating and doing each other figured out they can make things if they used a tool. And that moved us to the next level. And  you know  we in the last    years in particular have seen this acceleration in knowledge and technology  and technology has bred more knowledge and given us tools. And we've seen many seminal moments. We've seen the creation of small computers in the '  s and early '  s  and who would have thought back then that every single person would not have just one computer but probably     in your home  and in not just your P.C. but in every device    in your washing machine  your cell phone. You're walking around  your car has    microprocessors. Then we go along and create the Internet and connect the world together  we flatten the world. We've seen so much change  and we've given ourselves these tools now    these high powered tools    that are allowing us to turn the lens inward into something that is common to all of us  and that is a genome. How's your genome today  Have you thought about it lately  Heard about it  at least  You probably hear about genomes these days. I thought I'd take a moment to tell you what a genome is. It's  sort of  like if you ask people  Well  what is a megabyte or megabit  And what is broadband  People never want to say  I really don't understand. So  I will tell you right off of the bat. You've heard of DNA  you probably studied a little bit in biology. A genome is really a description for  all of the DNA that is in a living organism. And one thing that is common to all of life is DNA. It doesn't matter whether you're a yeast  it doesn't matter whether you're a mouse  doesn't matter whether you're a fly  we all have DNA. The DNA is organized in words  call them  genes and chromosomes. And when Watson and Crick in the '  s first decoded this beautiful double helix that we know as the DNA molecule    very long  complicated molecule    we then started on this journey to understand that inside of that DNA is a language that determines the characteristics  our traits  what we inherit  what diseases we may get. We've also along the way discovered that this is a very old molecule  that all of the DNA in your body has been around forever  since the beginning of us  of us as creatures. There is a historical archive. Living in your genome is the history of our species  and you as an individual human being  where you're from  going back thousands and thousands and thousands of years  and that's now starting to be understood. But also  the genome is really the instruction manual. It is the program. It is the code of life. It is what makes you function  it is what makes every organism function. DNA is a very elegant molecule. It's long and it's complicated. Really all you have to know about it is that there's four letters  A  T  C  G  they represent the name of a chemical. And with these four letters  you can create a language  a language that can describe anything  and very complicated things. You know  they are generally put together in pairs  creating a word or what we call base pairs. And you would  you know  when you think about it  four letters  or the representation of four things  makes us work. And that may not sound very intuitive  but let me flip over to something else you know about  and that's computers. Look at this screen here and  you know  you see pictures and you see words  but really all there are are ones and zeros. The language of technology is binary  you've probably heard that at some point in time. Everything that happens in digital is converted  or a representation  of a one and a zero. So  when you're listening to iTunes and your favorite music  that's really just a bunch of ones and zeros playing very quickly. When you're seeing these pictures  it's all ones and zeros  and when you're talking on your telephone  your cell phone  and it's going over the network  your voice is all being turned into ones and zeros and magically whizzed around. And look at all the complex things and wonderful things we've been able to create with just a one and a zero. Well  now you ramp that up to four  and you have a lot of complexity  a lot of ways to describe mechanisms. So  let's talk about what that means. So  if you look at a human genome  they consist of  .  billion of these base pairs. That's a lot. And they mix up in all different fashions  and that makes you a human being. If you convert that to binary  just to give you a little bit of sizing  we're actually smaller than the program Microsoft Office. It's not really all that much data. I will also tell you we're at least as buggy. This here is a bug in my genome that I have struggled with for a long  long time. When you get sick  it is a bug in your genome. In fact  many  many diseases we have struggled with for a long time  like cancer  we haven't been able to cure because we just don't understand how it works at the genomic level. We are starting to understand that. So  up to this point we tried to fix it by using what I call shit against the wall pharmacology  which means  well  let's just throw chemicals at it  and maybe it's going to make it work. But if you really understand why does a cell go from normal cell to cancer  What is the code  What are the exact instructions that are making it do that  then you can go about the process of trying to fix it and figure it out. So  for your next dinner over a great bottle of wine  here's a few factoids for you. We actually have about        genes that do things. We have about a hundred          others that don't appear to function every day  but represent this archival history of how we used to work as a species going back tens of thousands of years. You might also be interested in knowing that a mouse has about the same amount of genes. They recently sequenced Pinot Noir  and it also has about        genes  so the number of genes you have may not necessarily represent the complexity or the evolutionary order of any particular species. Now  look around  just look next to your neighbor  look forward  look backward. We all look pretty different. A lot of very handsome and pretty people here  skinny  chubby  different races  cultures. We are all   .   genetically equal. It is one one hundredth of one percent of genetic material that makes the difference between any one of us. That's a tiny amount of material  but the way that ultimately expresses itself is what makes changes in humans and in all species. So  we are now able to read genomes. The first human genome took    years  three billion dollars. It was done by Dr. Craig Venter. And then James Watson's    one of the co founders of DNA    genome was done for two million dollars  and in just two months. And if you think about the computer industry and how we've gone from big computers to little ones and how they get more powerful and faster all the time  the same thing is happening with gene sequencing now  we are on the cusp of being able to sequence human genomes for about       dollars in about an hour or a half hour  you will see that happen in the next five years. And what that means is  you are going to walk around with your own personal genome on a smart card. It will be here. And when you buy medicine  you won't be buying a drug that's used for everybody. You will give your genome to the pharmacist  and your drug will be made for you and it will work much better than the ones that were    you won't have side effects. All those side effects  you know  oily residue and  you know  whatever they say in those commercials  forget about that. They're going to make all that stuff go away. What does a genome look like  Well  there it is. It is a long  long series of these base pairs. If you saw the genome for a mouse or for a human it would look no different than this  but what scientists are doing now is they're understanding what these do and what they mean. Because what Nature is doing is double clicking all the time. In other words  the first couple of sentences here  assuming this is a grape plant  make a root  make a branch  create a blossom. In a human being  down in here it could be  make blood cells  start cancer. For me it may be  every calorie you consume  you conserve  because I come from a very cold climate. For my wife  eat three times as much and you never put on any weight. It's all hidden in this code  and it's starting to be understood at breakneck pace. So  what can we do with genomes now that we can read them  now that we're starting to have the book of life  Well  there's many things. Some are exciting. Some people will find very scary. I will tell you a couple of things that will probably make you want to projectile puke on me  but that's okay. So  you know  we now can learn the history of organisms. You can do a very simple test  scrape your cheek  send it off. You can find out where your relatives come from  you can do your genealogy going back thousands of years. We can understand functionality. This is really important. We can understand  for example  why we create plaque in our arteries  what creates the starchiness inside of a grain  why does yeast metabolize sugar and produce carbon dioxide. We can also look at  at a grander scale  what creates problems  what creates disease  and how we may be able to fix them. Because we can understand this  we can fix them  make better organisms. Most importantly  what we're learning is that Nature has provided us a spectacular toolbox. The toolbox exists. An architect far better and smarter than us has given us that toolbox  and we now have the ability to use it. We are now not just reading genomes  we are writing them. This company  Synthetic Genomics  I'm involved with  created the first full synthetic genome for a little bug  a very primitive creature called Mycoplasma genitalium. If you have a UTI  you've probably    or ever had a UTI    you've come in contact with this little bug. Very simple    only has about     genes    but we were able to completely synthesize that genome. Now  you have the genome and you say to yourself  So  if I plug this synthetic genome    if I pull the old one out and plug it in    does it just boot up and live  Well  guess what. It does. Not only does it do that  if you took the genome    that synthetic genome    and you plugged it into a different critter  like yeast  you now turn that yeast into Mycoplasma. It's  sort of  like booting up a PC with a Mac O.S. software. Well  actually  you could do it the other way. So  you know  by being able to write a genome and plug it into an organism  the software  if you will  changes the hardware. And this is extremely profound. So  last year the French and Italians announced they got together and they went ahead and they sequenced Pinot Noir. The genomic sequence now exists for the entire Pinot Noir organism  and they identified  once again  about        genes. They have discovered pathways that create flavors  although it's very important to understand that those compounds that it's cranking out have to match a receptor in our genome  in our tongue  for us to understand and interpret those flavors. They've also discovered that there's a heck of a lot of activity going on producing aroma as well. They've identified areas of vulnerability to disease. They now are understanding  and the work is going on  exactly how this plant works  and we have the capability to know  to read that entire code and understand how it ticks. So  then what do you do  Knowing that we can read it  knowing that we can write it  change it  maybe write its genome from scratch. So  what do you do  Well  one thing you could do is what some people might call Franken Noir. We can build a better vine. By the way  just so you know  you get stressed out about genetically modified organisms  there is not one single vine in this valley or anywhere that is not genetically modified. They're not grown from seeds  they're grafted into root stock  they would not exist in nature on their own. So  don't worry about  don't stress about that stuff. We've been doing this forever. So  we could  you know  focus on disease resistance  we can go for higher yields without necessarily having dramatic farming techniques to do it  or costs. We could conceivably expand the climate window  we could make Pinot Noir grow maybe in Long Island  God forbid. We could produce better flavors and aromas. You want a little more raspberry  a little more chocolate here or there  All of these things could conceivably be done  and I will tell you I'd pretty much bet that it will be done. But there's an ecosystem here. In other words  we're not  sort of  unique little organisms running around  we are part of a big ecosystem. In fact    I'm sorry to inform you    that inside of your digestive tract is about    pounds of microbes which you're circulating through your body quite a bit. Our ocean's teaming with microbes  in fact  when Craig Venter went and sequenced the microbes in the ocean  in the first three months tripled the known species on the planet by discovering all new microbes in the first    feet of water. We now understand that those microbes have more impact on our climate and regulating CO  and oxygen than plants do  which we always thought oxygenate the atmosphere. We find microbial life in every part of the planet  in ice  in coal  in rocks  in volcanic vents  it's an amazing thing. But we've also discovered  when it comes to plants  in plants  as much as we understand and are starting to understand their genomes  it is the ecosystem around them  it is the microbes that live in their root systems  that have just as much impact on the character of those plants as the metabolic pathways of the plants themselves. If you take a closer look at a root system  you will find there are many  many  many diverse microbial colonies. This is not big news to viticulturists  they have been  you know  concerned with water and fertilization. And  again  this is  sort of  my notion of shit against the wall pharmacology  you know certain fertilizers make the plant more healthy so you put more in. You don't necessarily know with granularity exactly what organisms are providing what flavors and what characteristics. We can start to figure that out. We all talk about terroir  we worship terroir  we say  Wow  is my terroir great  It's so special. I've got this piece of land and it creates terroir like you wouldn't believe. Well  you know  we really  we argue and debate about it    we say it's climate  it's soil  it's this. Well  guess what  We can figure out what the heck terroir is. It's in there  waiting to be sequenced. There are thousands of microbes there. They're easy to sequence  unlike a human  they  you know  have a thousand  two thousand genes  we can figure out what they are. All we have to do is go around and sample  dig into the ground  find those bugs  sequence them  correlate them to the kinds of characteristics we like and don't like    that's just a big database    and then fertilize. And then we understand what is terroir. So  some people will say  Oh  my God  are we playing God  Are we now  if we engineer organisms  are we playing God  And  you know  people would always ask James Watson    he's not always the most politically correct guy ... ... and they would say   Are  you know  are you playing God   And he had the best answer I ever heard to this question   Well  somebody has to.  I consider myself a very spiritual person  and without  you know  the organized religion part  and I will tell you  I don't believe there's anything unnatural. I don't believe that chemicals are unnatural. I told you I'm going to make some of you puke. It's very simple  we don't invent molecules  compounds. They're here. They're in the universe. We reorganize things  we change them around  but we don't make anything unnatural. Now  we can create bad impacts    we can poison ourselves  we can poison the Earth    but that's just a natural outcome of a mistake we made. So  what's happening today is  Nature is presenting us with a toolbox  and we find that this toolbox is very extensive. There are microbes out there that actually make gasoline  believe it or not. There are microbes  you know    go back to yeast. These are chemical factories  the most sophisticated chemical factories are provided by Nature  and we now can use those. There also is a set of rules. Nature will not allow you to    we could engineer a grape plant  but guess what. We can't make the grape plant produce babies. Nature has put a set of rules out there. We can work within the rules  we can't break the rules  we're just learning what the rules are. I just ask the question  if you could cure all disease    if you could make disease go away  because we understand how it actually works  if we could end hunger by being able to create nutritious  healthy plants that grow in very hard to grow environments  if we could create clean and plentiful energy    we  right in the labs at Synthetic Genomics  have single celled organisms that are taking carbon dioxide and producing a molecule very similar to gasoline. So  carbon dioxide    the stuff we want to get rid of    not sugar  not anything. Carbon dioxide  a little bit of sunlight  you end up with a lipid that is highly refined. We could solve our energy problems  we can reduce CO    we could clean up our oceans  we could make better wine. If we could  would we  Well  you know  I think the answer is very simple  working with Nature  working with this tool set that we now understand  is the next step in humankind's evolution. And all I can tell you is  stay healthy for    years. If you can stay healthy for    years  you'll see      maybe    . Thank you. You know  I am so bad at tech that my daughter    who is now       when she was five  was overheard by me to say to a friend of hers  If it doesn't bleed when you cut it  my daddy doesn't understand it. So  the assignment I've been given may be an insuperable obstacle for me  but I'm certainly going to try. What have I heard during these last four days  This is my third visit to TED. One was to TEDMED  and one  as you've heard  was a regular TED two years ago. I've heard what I consider an extraordinary thing that I've only heard a little bit in the two previous TEDs  and what that is is an interweaving and an interlarding  an intermixing  of a sense of social responsibility in so many of the talks    global responsibility  in fact  appealing to enlightened self interest  but it goes far beyond enlightened self interest. One of the most impressive things about what some  perhaps     of the speakers have been talking about is the realization  as you listen to them carefully  that they're not saying  Well  this is what we should do  this is what I would like you to do. It's  This is what I have done because I'm excited by it  because it's a wonderful thing  and it's done something for me and  of course  it's accomplished a great deal. It's the old concept  the real Greek concept  of philanthropy in its original sense  phil anthropy  the love of humankind. And the only explanation I can have for some of what you've been hearing in the last four days is that it arises  in fact  out of a form of love. And this gives me enormous hope. And hope  of course  is the topic that I'm supposed to be speaking about  which I'd completely forgotten about until I arrived. And when I did  I thought  well  I'd better look this word up in the dictionary. So  Sarah and I    my wife    walked over to the public library  which is four blocks away  on Pacific Street  and we got the OED  and we looked in there  and there are    definitions of hope  none of which really hits you between the eyes as being the appropriate one. And  of course  that makes sense  because hope is an abstract phenomenon  it's an abstract idea  it's not a concrete word. Well  it reminds me a little bit of surgery. If there's one operation for a disease  you know it works. If there are    operations  you know that none of them work. And that's the way it is with definitions of words. If you have appendicitis  they take your appendix out  and you're cured. If you've got reflux oesophagitis  there are    procedures  and Joe Schmo does it one way and Will Blow does it another way  and none of them work  and that's the way it is with this word  hope. They all come down to the idea of an expectation of something good that is due to happen. And you know what I found out  The Indo European root of the word hope is a stem  K E U    we would spell it K E U  it's pronounced koy    and it is the same root from which the word curve comes from. But what it means in the original Indo European is a change in direction  going in a different way. And I find that very interesting and very provocative  because what you've been hearing in the last couple of days is the sense of going in different directions  directions that are specific and unique to problems. There are different paradigms. You've heard that word several times in the last four days  and everyone's familiar with Kuhnian paradigms. So  when we think of hope now  we have to think of looking in other directions than we have been looking. There's another    not definition  but description  of hope that has always appealed to me  and it was one by V clav Havel in his perfectly spectacular book  Breaking the Peace   in which he says that hope does not consist of the expectation that things will come out exactly right  but the expectation that they will make sense regardless of how they come out. I can't tell you how reassured I was by the very last sentence in that glorious presentation by Dean Kamen a few days ago. I wasn't sure I heard it right  so I found him in one of the inter sessions. He was talking to a very large man  but I didn't care. I interrupted  and I said   Did you say this   He said   I think so.  So  here's what it is  I'll repeat it.  The world will not be saved by the Internet.  It's wonderful. Do you know what the world will be saved by  I'll tell you. It'll be saved by the human spirit. And by the human spirit  I don't mean anything divine  I don't mean anything supernatural    certainly not coming from this skeptic. What I mean is this ability that each of us has to be something greater than herself or himself  to arise out of our ordinary selves and achieve something that at the beginning we thought perhaps we were not capable of. On an elemental level  we have all felt that spirituality at the time of childbirth. Some of you have felt it in laboratories  some of you have felt it at the workbench. We feel it at concerts. I've felt it in the operating room  at the bedside. It is an elevation of us beyond ourselves. And I think that it's going to be  in time  the elements of the human spirit that we've been hearing about bit by bit by bit from so many of the speakers in the last few days. And if there's anything that has permeated this room  it is precisely that. I'm intrigued by a concept that was brought to life in the early part of the   th century    actually  in the second decade of the   th century    by a    year old poet whose name was Percy Shelley. Now  we all think that Shelley obviously is the great romantic poet that he was  many of us tend to forget that he wrote some perfectly wonderful essays  too  and the most well remembered essay is one called  A Defence of Poetry.  Now  it's about five  six  seven  eight pages long  and it gets kind of deep and difficult after about the third page  but somewhere on the second page he begins talking about the notion that he calls  moral imagination.  And here's what he says  roughly translated  A man    generic man    a man  to be greatly good  must imagine clearly. He must see himself and the world through the eyes of another  and of many others. See himself and the world    not just the world  but see himself. What is it that is expected of us by the billions of people who live in what Laurie Garrett the other day so appropriately called despair and disparity  What is it that they have every right to ask of us  What is it that we have every right to ask of ourselves  out of our shared humanity and out of the human spirit  Well  you know precisely what it is. There's a great deal of argument about whether we  as the great nation that we are  should be the policeman of the world  the world's constabulary  but there should be virtually no argument about whether we should be the world's healer. There has certainly been no argument about that in this room in the past four days. So  if we are to be the world's healer  every disadvantaged person in this world    including in the United States    becomes our patient. Every disadvantaged nation  and perhaps our own nation  becomes our patient. So  it's fun to think about the etymology of the word  patient.  It comes initially from the Latin patior  to endure  or to suffer. So  you go back to the old Indo European root again  and what do you find  The Indo European stem is pronounced payen    we would spell it P A E N    and  lo and behold  mirabile dictu  it is the same root as the word compassion comes from  P A E N. So  the lesson is very clear. The lesson is that our patient    the world  and the disadvantaged of the world    that patient deserves our compassion. But beyond our compassion  and far greater than compassion  is our moral imagination and our identification with each individual who lives in that world  not to think of them as a huge forest  but as individual trees. Of course  in this day and age  the trick is not to let each tree be obscured by that Bush in Washington that can get    can get in the way. So  here we are. We are  should be  morally committed to being the healer of the world. And we have had examples over and over and over again    you've just heard one in the last    minutes    of people who have not only had that commitment  but had the charisma  the brilliance    and I think in this room it's easy to use the word brilliant  my God    the brilliance to succeed at least at the beginning of their quest  and who no doubt will continue to succeed  as long as more and more of us enlist ourselves in their cause. Now  if we're talking about medicine  and we're talking about healing  I'd like to quote someone who hasn't been quoted. It seems to me everybody in the world's been quoted here  Pogo's been quoted  Shakespeare's been quoted backwards  forwards  inside out. I would like to quote one of my own household gods. I suspect he never really said this  because we don't know what Hippocrates really said  but we do know for sure that one of the great Greek physicians said the following  and it has been recorded in one of the books attributed to Hippocrates  and the book is called  Precepts.  And I'll read you what it is. Remember  I have been talking about  essentially philanthropy  the love of humankind  the individual humankind and the individual humankind that can bring that kind of love translated into action  translated  in some cases  into enlightened self interest. And here he is        years ago   Where there is love of humankind  there is love of healing.  We have seen that here today with the sense  with the sensitivity    and in the last three days  and with the power of the indomitable human spirit. Thank you very much. I became an inventor by accident. I was out of the air force in     . No  no  that's not true  I went in in       came out in       was working at the University of Washington  and I came up with an idea  from reading a magazine article  for a new kind of a phonograph tone arm. Now  that was before cassette tapes  C.D.s  DVDs    any of the cool stuff we've got now. And it was an arm that  instead of hinging and pivoting as it went across the record  went straight  a radial  linear tracking tone arm. And it was the hardest invention I ever made  but it got me started  and I got really lucky after that. And without giving you too much of a tirade  I want to talk to you about an invention I brought with me today  my   th invention. No  that's not true either. Golly  I'm just totally losing it. My   th patent  about the   th invention. I call this hypersonic sound. I'm going to play it for you in a couple minutes  but I want to make an analogy before I do to this. I usually show this hypersonic sound and people will say  That's really cool  but what's it good for  And I say  What is the light bulb good for  Sound  light  I'm going to draw the analogy. When Edison invented the light bulb  pretty much looked like this. Hasn't changed that much. Light came out of it in every direction. Before the light bulb was invented  people had figured out how to put a reflector behind it  focus it a little bit  put lenses in front of it  focus it a little bit better. Ultimately we figured out how to make things like lasers that were totally focused. Now  think about where the world would be today if we had the light bulb  but you couldn't focus light  if when you turned one on it just went wherever it wanted to. That's the way loudspeakers pretty much are. You turn on the loudspeaker  and after almost    years of having those gadgets  the sound just kind of goes where it wants. Even when you're standing in front of a megaphone  it's pretty much every direction. A little bit of differential  but not much. If the light bulb was the way the speaker is  and you couldn't focus or sharpen the edges or define it  we wouldn't have that  or movies in general  or computers  or T.V. sets  or C.D.s  or DVDs    and just go down the list of what the importance is of being able to focus light. Now  after almost    years of having sound  I thought it was about time that we figure out a way to put sound where you want to. I have a couple of units. That guy there was made for a demo I did yesterday early in the day for a big car maker in Detroit who wants to put them in a car    small version  over your head    so that you can actually get binaural sound in a car. What if I could aim sound the way I aim light  I got this waterfall I recorded in my back yard. Now  you're not going to hear a thing unless it hits you. Maybe if I hit the side wall it will bounce around the room. The sound is being made right next to your ears. Is that cool  Because I have some limited time  I'll cut it off for a second  and tell you about how it works and what it's good for. Course  like light  it's great to be able to put sound to highlight a clothing rack  or the cornflakes  or the toothpaste  or a talking plaque in a movie theater lobby. Sony's got an idea    Sony's our biggest customers right now. They tried this back in the '  s and were too smart  and so they gave up. But they want to use it    seriously. There's a mix an inventor has to have. You have to be kind of smart  and though I did not graduate from college doesn't mean I'm stupid  because you cannot be stupid and do very much in the world today. Too many other smart people out there. So. I just happened to get my education in a little different way. I'm not at all against education. I think it's wonderful  I think sometimes people  when they get educated  lose it  they get so smart they're unwilling to look at things that they know better than. And we're living in a great time right now  because almost everything's being explored anew. I have this little slogan that I use a lot  which is  virtually nothing    and I mean this honestly    has been invented yet. We're just starting. We're just starting to really discover the laws of nature and science and physics. And this is  I hope  a little piece of it. Sony's got this vision back    to get myself on track    that when you stand in the checkout line in the supermarket  you're going to watch a new T.V. channel. They know that when you watch T.V. at home  because there are so many choices you can change channels  miss their commercials. A hundred and fifty one million people every day stand in the line at the supermarket. Now  they've tried this a couple years ago and it failed  because the checker gets tired of hearing the same message every    minutes  and reaches out  turns off the sound. And  you know  if the sound isn't there  the sale typically isn't made. For instance  like  when you're on an airplane  they show the movie  you get to watch it for free  when you want to hear the sound  you pay. And so ABC and Sony have devised this new thing where when you step in the line in the supermarket    initially it'll be Safeways. It is Safeways  they're trying this in three parts of the country right now    you'll be watching TV. And hopefully they'll be sensitive that they don't want to offend you with just one more outlet. But what's great about it  from the tests that have been done  is  if you don't want to hear it  you take about one step to the side and you don't hear it. So  we create silence as much as we create sound. ATMs that talk to you  nobody else hears it. Sit in bed  two in the morning  watch TV  your spouse  or someone  is next to you  asleep  doesn't hear it  doesn't wake up. We're also working on noise canceling things like snoring  noise from automobiles. I have been really lucky with this technology  all of a sudden as it is ready  the world is ready to accept it. They have literally beat a path to our door. We've been selling it since about last September  October  and it's been immensely gratifying. If you're interested in what it costs    I'm not selling them today    but this unit  with the electronics and everything  if you buy one  is around a thousand bucks. We expect by this time next year  it'll be hundreds  a few hundred bucks  to buy it. It's not any more pricey than regular electronics. Now  when I played it for you  you didn't hear the thunderous bass. This unit that I played goes from about     hertz to above the range of hearing. It's actually emitting ultrasound    low level ultrasound    that's about         vibrations per second. And the sound that you're hearing  unlike a regular speaker on which all the sound is made on the face  is made out in front of it  in the air. The air is not linear  as we've always been taught. You turn up the volume just a little bit    I'm talking about a little over    decibels    and all of a sudden the air begins to corrupt signals you propagate. Here's why  the speed of sound is not a constant. It's fairly slow. It changes with temperature and with barometric pressure. Now  imagine  if you will  without getting too technical  I'm making a little sine wave here in the air. Well  if I turn up the amplitude too much  I'm having an effect on the pressure  which means during the making of that sine wave  the speed at which it is propagating is shifting. All of audio as we know it is an attempt to be more and more perfectly linear. Linearity means higher quality sound. Hypersonic sound is exactly the opposite  it's     percent based on non linearity. An effect happens in the air  it's a corrupting effect of the sound    the ultrasound in this case    that's emitted  but it's so predictable that you can produce very precise audio out of that effect. Now  the question is  where's the sound made  Instead of being made on the face of the cone  it's made at literally billions of little independent points along this narrow column in the air  and so when I aim it towards you  what you hear is made right next to your ears. I said we can shorten the column  we can spread it out to cover the couch. I can put it so that one ear hears one speaker  the other ear hears the other. That's true binaural sound. When you listen to stereo on your home system  your both ears hear both speakers. Turn on the left speaker sometime and notice you're hearing it also in your right ear. So  the stage is more restricted    the sound stage that's supposed to spread out in front of you. Because the sound is made in the air along this column  it does not follow the inverse square law  which says it drops off about two thirds every time you double the distance   dB every time you go from one meter  for instance  to two meters. That means you go to a rock concert or a symphony  and the guy in the front row gets the same level as the guy in the back row  now  all of a sudden. Isn't that terrific  So  we've been  as I say  very successful  very lucky  in having companies catch the vision of this  from cars    car makers who want to put a stereo system in the front for the kids  and a separate system in the back    oh  no  the kids aren't driving today. I was seeing if you were listening. Actually  I haven't had breakfast yet. A stereo system in the front for mom and dad  and maybe there's a little DVD player in the back for the kids  and the parents don't want to be bothered with that  or their rap music or whatever. So  again  this idea of being able to put sound anywhere you want to is really starting to catch on. It also works for transmitting and communicating data. It also works five times better underwater. We've got the military    have just deployed some of these into Iraq  where you can put fake troop movements quarter of a mile away on a hillside. Or you can whisper in the ear of a supposed terrorist some Biblical verse. I'm serious. And they have these infrared devices that can look at their countenance  and see a fraction of a degree Kelvin in temperature shift from     yards away when they play this thing. And so  another way of hopefully determining who's friendly and who isn't. We make a version with this which puts out     decibels. Pain is    . So it allows you to go nearly a mile away and communicate with people  and there can be a public beach just off to the side  and they don't even know it's turned on. We sell those to the military presently for about        dollars  and they're buying them as fast as we can make them. We put it on a turret with a camera  so that when they shoot at you  you're over there  and it's there. I have a bunch of other inventions. I invented a plasma antenna  to shift gears. Looked up at the ceiling of my office one day    I was working on a ground penetrating radar project    and my physicist CEO came in and said   We have a real problem. We're using very short wavelengths. We've got a problem with the antenna ringing. When you run very short wavelengths  like a tuning fork the antenna resonates  and there's more energy coming out of the antenna than there is the backscatter from the ground that we're trying to analyze  taking too much processing.  I says   Why don't we make an antenna that only exists when you want it  Turn it on  turn it off. That's a fluorescent tube refined.  I just sold that for a million and a half dollars  cash. I took it back to the Pentagon after it got declassified  when the patent issued  and told the people back there about it  and they laughed  and then I took them back a demo and they bought. Any of you ever wore a Jabber headphone    the little cell headphones  That's my invention. I sold that for seven million dollars. Big mistake  it just sold for    million dollars two years ago. I actually drew that up on a little crummy Mac computer in my attic at my house  and one of the many designs which they have now is still the same design I drew way back when. So  I've been really lucky as an inventor. I'm the happiest guy you're ever going to meet. And my dad died before he realized anybody in the family would maybe  hopefully  make something out of themselves. You've been a great audience. I know I've jumped all over the place. I usually figure out what my talk is when I get up in front of a group. Let me give you  in the last minute  one more quick demo of this guy  for those of you that haven't heard it. Can never tell if it's on. If you haven't heard it  raise your hand. Getting it over there  Get the cameraman. Yeah  there you go. I've got a Coke can opening that's right in your head  that's really cool. Thank you once again. Appreciate it very much. So  I want to start out with this beautiful picture from my childhood. I love the science fiction movies. Here it is   This Island Earth.  And leave it to Hollywood to get it just right. Two and a half years in the making. I mean  even the creationists give us        but Hollywood goes to the chase. And in this movie  we see what we think is out there  flying saucers and aliens. Every world has an alien  and every alien world has a flying saucer  and they move about with great speed. Aliens. Well  Don Brownlee  my friend  and I finally got to the point where we got tired of turning on the TV and seeing the spaceships and seeing the aliens every night  and tried to write a counter argument to it  and put out what does it really take for an Earth to be habitable  for a planet to be an Earth  to have a place where you could probably get not just life  but complexity  which requires a huge amount of evolution  and therefore constancy of conditions. So  in      we wrote  Rare Earth.  In       we then asked  let's not think about where Earths are in space  but how long has Earth been Earth  If you go back two billion years  you're not on an Earth like planet any more. What we call an Earth like planet is actually a very short interval of time. Well   Rare Earth  actually taught me an awful lot about meeting the public. Right after  I got an invitation to go to a science fiction convention  and with all great earnestness walked in. David Brin was going to debate me on this  and as I walked in  the crowd of a hundred started booing lustily. I had a girl who came up who said   My dad says you're the devil.  You cannot take people's aliens away from them and expect to be anybody's friends. Well  the second part of that  soon after    and I was talking to Paul Allen  I saw him in the audience  and I handed him a copy of  Rare Earth.  And Jill Tarter was there  and she turned to me  and she looked at me just like that girl in  The Exorcist.  It was   It burns  It burns   Because SETI doesn't want to hear this. SETI wants there to be stuff out there. I really applaud the SETI efforts  but we have not heard anything yet. And I really do think we have to start thinking about what's a good planet and what isn't. Now  I throw this slide up because it indicates to me that  even if SETI does hear something  can we figure out what they said  Because this was a slide that was passed between the two major intelligences on Earth    a Mac to a PC    and it can't even get the letters right       so how are we going to talk to the aliens  And if they're    light years away  and we call them up  and you blah  blah  blah  blah  blah  and then    years later it comes back and they say  Please repeat  I mean  there we are. Our planet is a good planet because it can keep water. Mars is a bad planet  but it's still good enough for us to go there and to live on its surface if we're protected. But Venus is a very bad    the worst    planet. Even though it's Earth like  and even though early in its history it may very well have harbored Earth like life  it soon succumbed to runaway greenhouse    that's an     degrees  Fahrenheit  surface    because of rampant carbon dioxide. Well  we know from astrobiology that we can really now predict what's going to happen to our particular planet. We are right now in the beautiful Oreo of existence    of at least life on Planet Earth    following the first horrible microbial age. In the Cambrian explosion  life emerged from the swamps  complexity arose  and from what we can tell  we're halfway through. We have as much time for animals to exist on this planet as they have been here now  till we hit the second microbial age. And that will happen  paradoxically    everything you hear about global warming    when we hit CO  down to    parts per million  we are no longer going to have to have plants that are allowed to have any photosynthesis  and there go animals. So  after that we probably have seven billion years. The Sun increases in its intensity  in its brightness  and finally  at about    billion years after it first started  the Earth is consumed by a large Sun  and this is what's left. So  a planet like us is going to have an age and an old age  and we are in its golden summer age right now. But there's two fates to everything  isn't there  Now  a lot of you are going to die of old age  but some of you  horribly enough  are going to die in an accident. And that's the fate of a planet  too. Earth  if we're lucky enough    if it doesn't get hit by a Hale Bopp  or gets blasted by some supernova nearby in the next seven billion years    we'll find under your feet. But what about accidental death  Well  paleontologists for the last     years have been charting death. It's strange    extinction as a concept wasn't even thought about until Baron Cuvier in France found this first mastodon. He couldn't match it up to any bones on the planet  and he said  Aha  It's extinct. And very soon after  the fossil record started yielding a very good idea of how many plants and animals there have been since complex life really began to leave a very interesting fossil record. In that complex record of fossils  there were times when lots of stuff seemed to be dying out very quickly  and the father mother geologists called these  mass extinctions.  All along it was thought to be either an act of God or perhaps long  slow climate change  and that really changed in       in this rocky outcrop near Gubbio  where Walter Alvarez  trying to figure out what was the time difference between these white rocks  which held creatures of the Cretaceous period  and the pink rocks above  which held Tertiary fossils. How long did it take to go from one system to the next  And what they found was something unexpected. They found in this gap  in between  a very thin clay layer  and that clay layer    this very thin red layer here    is filled with iridium. And not just iridium  it's filled with glassy spherules  and it's filled with quartz grains that have been subjected to enormous pressure  shock quartz. Now  in this slide the white is chalk  and this chalk was deposited in a warm ocean. The chalk itself's composed by plankton which has fallen down from the sea surface onto the sea floor  so that    percent of the sediment here is skeleton of living stuff  and then you have that millimeter thick red layer  and then you have black rock. And the black rock is the sediment on the sea bottom in the absence of plankton. And that's what happens in an asteroid catastrophe  because that's what this was  of course. This is the famous K T. A    kilometer body hit the planet. The effects of it spread this very thin impact layer all over the planet  and we had very quickly the death of the dinosaurs  the death of these beautiful ammonites  Leconteiceras here  and Celaeceras over here  and so much else. I mean  it must be true  because we've had two Hollywood blockbusters since that time  and this paradigm  from      to about       totally changed how we geologists thought about catastrophes. Prior to that  uniformitarianism was the dominant paradigm  the fact that if anything happens on the planet in the past  there are present day processes that will explain it. But we haven't witnessed a big asteroid impact  so this is a type of neo catastrophism  and it took about    years for the scientific establishment to finally come to grips  yes  we were hit  and yes  the effects of that hit caused a major mass extinction. Well  there are five major mass extinctions over the last     million years  called the Big Five. They range from     million years ago to the last  the K T  number four  but the biggest of all was the P  or the Permian extinction  sometimes called the mother of all mass extinctions. And every one of these has been subsequently blamed on large body impact. But is this true  The most recent  the Permian  was thought to have been an impact because of this beautiful structure on the right. This is a Buckminsterfullerene  a carbon   . Because it looks like those terrible geodesic domes of my late beloved '  s  they're called  buckyballs.  This evidence was used to suggest that at the end of the Permian      million years ago  a comet hit us. And when the comet hits  the pressure produces the buckyballs  and it captures bits of the comet. Helium    very rare on the surface of the Earth  very common in space. But is this true  In       working on the K T extinction for    years  I moved to South Africa to begin work twice a year in the great Karoo desert. I was so lucky to watch the change of that South Africa into the new South Africa as I went year by year. And I worked on this Permian extinction  camping by this Boer graveyard for months at a time. And the fossils are extraordinary. You know  you're gazing upon your very distant ancestors. These are mammal like reptiles. They are culturally invisible. We do not make movies about these. This is a Gorgonopsian  or a Gorgon. That's an    inch long skull of an animal that was probably seven or eight feet  sprawled like a lizard  probably had a head like a lion. This is the top carnivore  the T Rex of its time. But there's lots of stuff. This is my poor son  Patrick. This is called paleontological child abuse. Hold still  you're the scale. There was big stuff back then. Fifty five species of mammal like reptiles. The age of mammals had well and truly started     million years ago ... ... and then a catastrophe happened. And what happens next is the age of dinosaurs. It was all a mistake  it should have never happened. But it did. Now  luckily  this Thrinaxodon  the size of a robin egg here  this is a skull I've discovered just before taking this picture    there's a pen for scale  it's really tiny    this is in the Lower Triassic  after the mass extinction has finished. You can see the eye socket and you can see the little teeth in the front. If that does not survive  I'm not the thing giving this talk. Something else is  because if that doesn't survive  we are not here  there are no mammals. It's that close  one species ekes through. Well  can we say anything about the pattern of who survives and who doesn't  Here's sort of the end of that    years of work. The ranges of stuff    the red line is the mass extinction. But we've got survivors and things that get through  and it turns out the things that get through preferentially are cold bloods. Warm blooded animals take a huge hit at this time. The survivors that do get through produce this world of crocodile like creatures. There's no dinosaurs yet  just this slow  saurian  scaly  nasty  swampy place with a couple of tiny mammals hiding in the fringes. And there they would hide for     million years  until liberated by that K T asteroid. So  if not impact  what  And the what  I think  is that we returned  over and over again  to the Pre Cambrian world  that first microbial age  and the microbes are still out there. They hate we animals. They really want their world back. And they've tried over and over and over again. This suggests to me that life causing these mass extinctions because it did is inherently anti Gaian. This whole Gaia idea  that life makes the world better for itself    anybody been on a freeway on a Friday afternoon in Los Angeles believing in the Gaia theory  No. So  I really suspect there's an alternative  and that life does actually try to do itself in    not consciously  but just because it does. And here's the weapon  it seems  that it did so over the last     million years. There are microbes which  through their metabolism  produce hydrogen sulfide  and they do so in large amounts. Hydrogen sulfide is very fatal to we humans. As small as     parts per million will kill you. You only have to go to the Black Sea and a few other places    some lakes    and get down  and you'll find that the water itself turns purple. It turns purple from the presence of numerous microbes which have to have sunlight and have to have hydrogen sulfide  and we can detect their presence today    we can see them    but we can also detect their presence in the past. And the last three years have seen an enormous breakthrough in a brand new field. I am almost extinct    I'm a paleontologist who collects fossils. But the new wave of paleontologists    my graduate students    collect biomarkers. They take the sediment itself  they extract the oil from it  and from that they can produce compounds which turn out to be very specific to particular microbial groups. It's because lipids are so tough  they can get preserved in sediment and last the hundreds of millions of years necessary  and be extracted and tell us who was there. And we know who was there. At the end of the Permian  at many of these mass extinction boundaries  this is what we find  isorenieratene. It's very specific. It can only occur if the surface of the ocean has no oxygen  and is totally saturated with hydrogen sulfide    enough  for instance  to come out of solution. This led Lee Kump  and others from Penn State and my group  to propose what I call the Kump Hypothesis  many of the mass extinctions were caused by lowering oxygen  by high CO . And the worst effect of global warming  it turns out  hydrogen sulfide being produced out of the oceans. Well  what's the source of this  In this particular case  the source over and over has been flood basalts. This is a view of the Earth now  if we extract a lot of it. And each of these looks like a hydrogen bomb  actually  the effects are even worse. This is when deep Earth material comes to the surface  spreads out over the surface of the planet. Well  it's not the lava that kills anything  it's the carbon dioxide that comes out with it. This isn't Volvos  this is volcanoes. But carbon dioxide is carbon dioxide. So  these are new data Rob Berner and I    from Yale    put together  and what we try to do now is track the amount of carbon dioxide in the entire rock record    and we can do this from a variety of means    and put all the red lines here  when these    what I call greenhouse mass extinctions    took place. And there's two things that are really evident here to me  is that these extinctions take place when CO  is going up. But the second thing that's not shown on here  the Earth has never had any ice on it when we've had       parts per million CO . We are at     and climbing. We should be up to a thousand in three centuries at the most  but my friend David Battisti in Seattle says he thinks a     years. So  there goes the ice caps  and there comes     feet of sea level rise. I live in a view house now  I'm going to have waterfront. All right  what's the consequence  The oceans probably turn purple. And we think this is the reason that complexity took so long to take place on planet Earth. We had these hydrogen sulfide oceans for a very great long period. They stop complex life from existing. We know hydrogen sulfide is erupting presently a few places on the planet. And I throw this slide in    this is me  actually  two months ago    and I throw this slide in because here is my favorite animal  chambered nautilus. It's been on this planet since the animals first started        million years. This is a tracking experiment  and any of you scuba divers  if you want to get involved in one of the coolest projects ever  this is off the Great Barrier Reef. And as we speak now  these nautilus are tracking out their behaviors to us. But the thing about this is that every once in a while we divers can run into trouble  so I'm going to do a little thought experiment here. This is a Great White Shark that ate some of my traps. We pulled it up  up it comes. So  it's out there with me at night. So  I'm swimming along  and it takes off my leg. I'm    miles from shore  what's going to happen to me  Well now  I die. Five years from now  this is what I hope happens to me  I'm taken back to the boat  I'm given a gas mask     parts per million hydrogen sulfide. I'm then thrown in an ice pond  I'm cooled    degrees lower and I could be taken to a critical care hospital. And the reason I could do that is because we mammals have gone through a series of these hydrogen sulfide events  and our bodies have adapted. And we can now use this as what I think will be a major medical breakthrough. This is Mark Roth. He was funded by DARPA. Tried to figure out how to save Americans after battlefield injuries. He bleeds out pigs. He puts in    parts per million hydrogen sulfide    the same stuff that survived these past mass extinctions    and he turns a mammal into a reptile.  I believe we are seeing in this response the result of mammals and reptiles having undergone a series of exposures to H S.  I got this email from him two years ago  he said   I think I've got an answer to some of your questions.  So  he now has taken mice down for as many as four hours  sometimes six hours  and these are brand new data he sent me on the way over here. On the top  now  that is a temperature record of a mouse who has gone through    the dotted line  the temperatures. So  the temperature starts at    centigrade  and down it goes  down it goes. Six hours later  up goes the temperature. Now  the same mouse is given    parts per million hydrogen sulfide in this solid graph  and look what happens to its temperature. Its temperature drops. It goes down to    degrees centigrade from     and comes out of this perfectly fine. Here is a way we can get people to critical care. Here's how we can bring people cold enough to last till we get critical care. Now  you're all thinking  yeah  what about the brain tissue  And so this is one of the great challenges that is going to happen. You're in an accident. You've got two choices  you're going to die  or you're going to take the hydrogen sulfide and  say     percent of you is saved  mentally. What are you going to do  Do we all have to have a little button saying  Let me die  This is coming towards us  and I think this is going to be a revolution. We're going to save lives  but there's going to be a cost to it. The new view of mass extinctions is  yes  we were hit  and  yes  we have to think about the long term  because we will get hit again. But there's a far worse danger confronting us. We can easily go back to the hydrogen sulfide world. Give us a few millennia    and we humans should last those few millennia    will it happen again  If we continue  it'll happen again. How many of us flew here  How many of us have gone through our entire Kyoto quota just for flying this year  How many of you have exceeded it  Yeah  I've certainly exceeded it. We have a huge problem facing us as a species. We have to beat this. I want to be able to go back to this reef. Thank you. Chris Anderson  I've just got one question for you  Peter. Am I understanding you right  that what you're saying here is that we have in our own bodies a biochemical response to hydrogen sulfide that in your mind proves that there have been past mass extinctions due to climate change  Peter Ward  Yeah  every single cell in us can produce minute quantities of hydrogen sulfide in great crises. This is what Roth has found out. So  what we're looking at now  does it leave a signal  Does it leave a signal in bone or in plant  And we go back to the fossil record and we could try to detect how many of these have happened in the past. CA  It's simultaneously an incredible medical technique  but also a terrifying ... PW  Blessing and curse. Sheryl Shade  Hi  Aimee. Aimee Mullins  Hi. SS  Aimee and I thought we'd just talk a little bit  and I wanted her to tell all of you what makes her a distinctive athlete. AM  Well  for those of you who have seen the picture in the little bio    it might have given it away    I'm a double amputee  and I was born without fibulas in both legs. I was amputated at age one  and I've been running like hell ever since  all over the place. SS  Well  why don't you tell them how you got to Georgetown    why don't we start there  Why don't we start there  AM  I'm a senior in Georgetown in the Foreign Service program. I won a full academic scholarship out of high school. They pick three students out of the nation every year to get involved in international affairs  and so I won a full ride to Georgetown and I've been there for four years. Love it. SS  When Aimee got there  she decided that she's  kind of  curious about track and field  so she decided to call someone and start asking about it. So  why don't you tell that story  AM  Yeah. Well  I guess I've always been involved in sports. I played softball for five years growing up. I skied competitively throughout high school  and I got a little restless in college because I wasn't doing anything for about a year or two sports wise. And I'd never competed on a disabled level  you know    I'd always competed against other able bodied athletes. That's all I'd ever known. In fact  I'd never even met another amputee until I was   . And I heard that they do these track meets with all disabled runners  and I figured   Oh  I don't know about this  but before I judge it  let me go see what it's all about.  So  I booked myself a flight to Boston in '       years old and definitely the dark horse candidate at this race. I'd never done it before. I went out on a gravel track a couple of weeks before this meet to see how far I could run  and about    meters was enough for me  panting and heaving. And I had these legs that were made of a wood and plastic compound  attached with Velcro straps    big  thick  five ply wool socks on    you know  not the most comfortable things  but all I'd ever known. And I'm up there in Boston against people wearing legs made of all things    carbon graphite and  you know  shock absorbers in them and all sorts of things    and they're all looking at me like  OK  we know who's not going to win this race. And  I mean  I went up there expecting    I don't know what I was expecting    but  you know  when I saw a man who was missing an entire leg go up to the high jump  hop on one leg to the high jump and clear it at six feet  two inches ... Dan O'Brien jumped  '    in '   in Atlanta  I mean  if it just gives you a comparison of    these are truly accomplished athletes  without qualifying that word  athlete.  And so I decided to give this a shot  heart pounding  I ran my first race and I beat the national record holder by three hundredths of a second  and became the new national record holder on my first try out. And  you know  people said   Aimee  you know  you've got speed    you've got natural speed    but you don't have any skill or finesse going down that track. You were all over the place. We all saw how hard you were working.  And so I decided to call the track coach at Georgetown. And I thank god I didn't know just how huge this man is in the track and field world. He's coached five Olympians  and the man's office is lined from floor to ceiling with All America certificates of all these athletes he's coached. He's just a rather intimidating figure. And I called him up and said   Listen  I ran one race and I won ...   I want to see if I can  you know    I need to just see if I can sit in on some of your practices  see what drills you do and whatever.  That's all I wanted    just two practices.  Can I just sit in and see what you do   And he said   Well  we should meet first  before we decide anything.  You know  he's thinking   What am I getting myself into   So  I met the man  walked in his office  and saw these posters and magazine covers of people he has coached. And we got to talking  and it turned out to be a great partnership because he'd never coached a disabled athlete  so therefore he had no preconceived notions of what I was or wasn't capable of  and I'd never been coached before. So this was like   Here we go    let's start on this trip.  So he started giving me four days a week of his lunch break  his free time  and I would come up to the track and train with him. So that's how I met Frank. That was fall of '  . But then  by the time that winter was rolling around  he said   You know  you're good enough. You can run on our women's track team here.  And I said   No  come on.  And he said   No  no  really. You can. You can run with our women's track team.  In the spring of       with my goal of making the U.S. Paralympic team that May coming up full speed  I joined the women's track team. And no disabled person had ever done that    run at a collegiate level. So I don't know  it started to become an interesting mix. SS  Well  on your way to the Olympics  a couple of memorable events happened at Georgetown. Why don't you just tell them  AM  Yes  well  you know  I'd won everything as far as the disabled meets    everything I competed in    and  you know  training in Georgetown and knowing that I was going to have to get used to seeing the backs of all these women's shirts    you know  I'm running against the next Flo Jo    and they're all looking at me like   Hmm  what's  you know  what's going on here   And putting on my Georgetown uniform and going out there and knowing that  you know  in order to become better    and I'm already the best in the country    you know  you have to train with people who are inherently better than you. And I went out there and made it to the Big East  which was sort of the championship race at the end of the season. It was really  really hot. And it's the first    I had just gotten these new sprinting legs that you see in that bio  and I didn't realize at that time that the amount of sweating I would be doing in the sock    it actually acted like a lubricant and I'd be  kind of  pistoning in the socket. And at about    meters of my     meters sprint  in all my glory  I came out of my leg. Like  I almost came out of it  in front of  like        people. And I  I mean  was just mortified    because I was signed up for the      you know  which went off in a half hour. I went to my coach   Please  don't make me do this.  I can't do this in front of all those people. My legs will come off. And if it came off at    there's no way I'm going     meters. And he just sat there like this. My pleas fell on deaf ears  thank god. Because you know  the man is from Brooklyn  he's a big man. He says   Aimee  so what if your leg falls off  You pick it up  you put the damn thing back on  and finish the goddamn race   And I did. So  he kept me in line. He kept me on the right track. SS  So  then Aimee makes it to the      Paralympics  and she's all excited. Her family's coming down    it's a big deal. It's now two years that you've been running  AM  No  a year. SS  A year. And why don't you tell them what happened right before you go run your race  AM  Okay  well  Atlanta. The Paralympics  just for a little bit of clarification  are the Olympics for people with physical disabilities    amputees  persons with cerebral palsy  and wheelchair athletes    as opposed to the Special Olympics  which deals with people with mental disabilities. So  here we are  a week after the Olympics and down at Atlanta  and I'm just blown away by the fact that just a year ago  I got out on a gravel track and couldn't run    meters. And so  here I am    never lost. I set new records at the U.S. Nationals    the Olympic trials    that May  and was sure that I was coming home with the gold. I was also the only  what they call  bilateral BK     below the knee. I was the only woman who would be doing the long jump. I had just done the long jump  and a guy who was missing two legs came up to me and says   How do you do that  You know  we're supposed to have a planar foot  so we can't get off on the springboard.  I said   Well  I just did it. No one told me that.  So  it's funny    I'm three inches within the world record    and kept on from that point  you know  so I'm signed up in the long jump    signed up  No  I made it for the long jump and the     meter. And I'm sure of it  you know  I made the front page of my hometown paper that I delivered for six years  you know  It was  like  this is my time for shine. And we're at the trainee warm up track  which is a few blocks away from the Olympic stadium. These legs that I was on  which I'll take out right now    I was the first person in the world on these legs. I was the guinea pig.  I'm telling you  this was  like    talk about a tourist attraction. Everyone was taking pictures     What is this girl running on   And I'm always looking around  like  where is my competition  It's my first international meet. I tried to get it out of anybody I could  you know   Who am I running against here    Oh  Aimee  we'll have to get back to you on that one.  I wanted to find out times.  Don't worry  you're doing great.  This is    minutes before my race in the Olympic stadium  and they post the heat sheets. And I go over and look. And my fastest time  which was the world record  was   .  . Then I'm looking  the next lane  lane two  is   . . Lane three is   . . Lane four is   . . I said   What's going on   And they shove us all into the shuttle bus  and all the women there are missing a hand. So  I'm just  like    they're all looking at me like 'which one of these is not like the other ' you know  I'm sitting there  like   Oh  my god. Oh  my god.  You know  I'd never lost anything  like  whether it would be the scholarship or  you know  I'd won five golds when I skied. In everything  I came in first. And Georgetown    that was great. I was losing  but it was the best training because this was Atlanta. Here we are  like  cr me de la cr me  and there is no doubt about it  that I'm going to lose big. And  you know  I'm just thinking   Oh  my god  my whole family got in a van and drove down here from Pennsylvania.  And  you know  I was the only female U.S. sprinter. So they call us out and  you know     Ladies  you have one minute.  And I remember putting my blocks in and just feeling horrified because there was just this murmur coming over the crowd  like  the ones who are close enough to the starting line to see. And I'm like   I know  Look  This isn't right.  And I'm thinking that's my last card to play here  if I'm not going to beat these girls  I'm going to mess their heads a little  you know  I mean  it was definitely the  Rocky IV  sensation of me versus Germany  and everyone else    Estonia and Poland    was in this heat. And the gun went off  and all I remember was finishing last and fighting back tears of frustration and incredible    incredible    this feeling of just being overwhelmed. And I had to think   Why did I do this   If I had won everything    but it was like  what was the point  All this training    I had transformed my life. I became a collegiate athlete  you know. I became an Olympic athlete. And it made me really think about how the achievement was getting there. I mean  the fact that I set my sights  just a year and three months before  on becoming an Olympic athlete and saying   Here's my life going in this direction    and I want to take it here for a while  and just seeing how far I could push it.  And the fact that I asked for help    how many people jumped on board  How many people gave of their time and their expertise  and their patience  to deal with me  And that was this collective glory    that there was  you know     people behind me that had joined in this incredible experience of going to Atlanta. So  I apply this sort of philosophy now to everything I do  sitting back and realizing the progression  how far you've come at this day to this goal  you know. It's important to focus on a goal  I think  but also recognize the progression on the way there and how you've grown as a person. That's the achievement  I think. That's the real achievement. SS  Why don't you show them your legs  AM  Oh  sure. SS  You know  show us more than one set of legs. AM  Well  these are my pretty legs. No  these are my cosmetic legs  actually  and they're absolutely beautiful. You've got to come up and see them. There are hair follicles on them  and I can paint my toenails. And  seriously  like  I can wear heels. Like  you guys don't understand what that's like to be able to just go into a shoe store and buy whatever you want. SS  You got to pick your height  AM  I got to pick my height  exactly. Patrick Ewing  who played for Georgetown in the '  s  comes back every summer. And I had incessant fun making fun of him in the training room because he'd come in with foot injuries. I'm like   Get it off  Don't worry about it  you know. You can be eight feet tall. Just take them off.  He didn't find it as humorous as I did  anyway. OK  now  these are my sprinting legs  made of carbon graphite  like I said  and I've got to make sure I've got the right socket. No  I've got so many legs in here. These are    do you want to hold that actually  That's another leg I have for  like  tennis and softball. It has a shock absorber in it so it  like   Shhhh   makes this neat sound when you jump around on it. All right. And then this is the silicon sheath I roll over  to keep it on. Which  when I sweat  you know  I'm pistoning out of it. SS  Are you a different height  AM  In these  SS  In these. AM  I don't know. I don't think so. I may be a little taller. I actually can put both of them on. SS  She can't really stand on these legs. She has to be moving  so ... AM  Yeah  I definitely have to be moving  and balance is a little bit of an art in them. But without having the silicon sock  I'm just going to try slip in it. And so  I run on these  and have shocked half the world on these. These are supposed to simulate the actual form of a sprinter when they run. If you ever watch a sprinter  the ball of their foot is the only thing that ever hits the track. So when I stand in these legs  my hamstring and my glutes are contracted  as they would be had I had feet and were standing on the ball of my feet. AM  It's a company in San Diego called Flex Foot. And I was a guinea pig  as I hope to continue to be in every new form of prosthetic limbs that come out. But actually these  like I said  are still the actual prototype. I need to get some new ones because the last meet I was at  they were everywhere. You know  it's like a big    it's come full circle. Moderator  Aimee and the designer of them will be at TEDMED    and we'll talk about the design of them. AM  Yes  we'll do that. SS  Yes  there you go. AM  So  these are the sprint legs  and I can put my other... SS  Can you tell about who designed your other legs  AM  Yes. These I got in a place called Bournemouth  England  about two hours south of London  and I'm the only person in the United States with these  which is a crime because they are so beautiful. And I don't even mean  like  because of the toes and everything. For me  while I'm such a serious athlete on the track  I want to be feminine off the track  and I think it's so important not to be limited in any capacity  whether it's  you know  your mobility or even fashion. I mean  I love the fact that I can go in anywhere and pick out what I want    the shoes I want  the skirts I want    and I'm hoping to try to bring these over here and make them accessible to a lot of people. They're also silicon. This is a really basic  basic prosthetic limb under here. It's like a Barbie foot under this. It is. It's just stuck in this position  so I have to wear a two inch heel. And  I mean  it's really    let me take this off so you can see it. I don't know how good you can see it  but  like  it really is. There're veins on the feet  and then my heel is pink  and my Achilles' tendon    that moves a little bit. And it's really an amazing store. I got them a year and two weeks ago. And this is just a silicon piece of skin. I mean  what happened was  two years ago this man in Belgium was saying   God  if I can go to Madame Tussauds' wax museum and see Jerry Hall replicated down to the color of her eyes  looking so real as if she breathed  why can't they build a limb for someone that looks like a leg  or an arm  or a hand   I mean  they make ears for burn victims. They do amazing stuff with silicon. SS  Two weeks ago  Aimee was up for the Arthur Ashe award at the ESPYs. And she came into town and she rushed around and she said   I have to buy some new shoes   We're an hour before the ESPYs  and she thought she'd gotten a two inch heel but she'd actually bought a three inch heel. AM  And this poses a problem for me  because it means I'm walking like that all night long. SS  For    minutes. Luckily  the hotel was terrific. They got someone to come in and saw off the shoes. AM  I said to the receptionist    I mean  I am just harried  and Sheryl's at my side    I said   Look  do you have anybody here who could help me  Because I have this problem ...   You know  at first they were just going to write me off  like   If you don't like your shoes  sorry. It's too late.   No  no  no  no. I've got these special feet that need a two inch heel. I have a three inch heel. I need a little bit off.  They didn't even want to go there. They didn't even want to touch that one. They just did it. No  these legs are great. I'm actually going back in a couple of weeks to get some improvements. I want to get legs like these made for flat feet so I can wear sneakers  because I can't with these ones. So... Moderator  That's it. SS  That's Aimee Mullins. How can we investigate this flora of viruses that surround us  and aid medicine  How can we turn our cumulative knowledge of virology into a simple  hand held  single diagnostic assay  I want to turn everything we know right now about detecting viruses and the spectrum of viruses that are out there into  let's say  a small chip. When we started thinking about this project    how we would make a single diagnostic assay to screen for all pathogens simultaneously    well  there's some problems with this idea. First of all  viruses are pretty complex  but they're also evolving very fast. This is a picornavirus. Picornaviruses    these are things that include the common cold and polio  things like this. You're looking at the outside shell of the virus  and the yellow color here are those parts of the virus that are evolving very  very fast  and the blue parts are not evolving very fast. When people think about making pan viral detection reagents  usually it's the fast evolving problem that's an issue  because how can we detect things if they're always changing  But evolution is a balance  where you have fast change  you also have ultra conservation    things that almost never change. And so we looked into this a little more carefully  and I'm going to show you data now. This is just some stuff you can do on the computer from the desktop. I took a bunch of these small picornaviruses  like the common cold  like polio and so on  and I just broke them down into small segments. And so took this first example  which is called coxsackievirus  and just break it into small windows. And I'm coloring these small windows blue if another virus shares an identical sequence in its genome to that virus. These sequences right up here    which don't even code for protein  by the way    are almost absolutely identical across all of these  so I could use this sequence as a marker to detect a wide spectrum of viruses  without having to make something individual. Now  over here there's great diversity  that's where things are evolving fast. Down here you can see slower evolution  less diversity. Now  by the time we get out here to  let's say  acute bee paralysis virus    probably a bad one to have if you're a bee     this virus shares almost no similarity to coxsackievirus  but I can guarantee you that the sequences that are most conserved among these viruses on the right hand of the screen are in identical regions right up here. And so we can encapsulate these regions of ultra conservation through evolution    how these viruses evolved    by just choosing DNA elements or RNA elements in these regions to represent on our chip as detection reagents. OK  so that's what we did  but how are we going to do that  Well  for a long time  since I was in graduate school  I've been messing around making DNA chips    that is  printing DNA on glass. And that's what you see here  These little salt spots are just DNA tacked onto glass  and so I can put thousands of these on our glass chip and use them as a detection reagent. We took our chip over to Hewlett Packard and used their atomic force microscope on one of these spots  and this is what you see  you can actually see the strands of DNA lying flat on the glass here. So  what we're doing is just printing DNA on glass    little flat things    and these are going to be markers for pathogens. OK  I make little robots in lab to make these chips  and I'm really big on disseminating technology. If you've got enough money to buy just a Camry  you can build one of these too  and so we put a deep how to guide on the Web  totally free  with basically order off the shelf parts. You can build a DNA array machine in your garage. Here's the section on the all important emergency stop switch. Every important machine's got to have a big red button. But really  it's pretty robust. You can actually be making DNA chips in your garage and decoding some genetic programs pretty rapidly. It's a lot of fun. And so what we did    and this is a really cool project    we just started by making a respiratory virus chip. I talked about that    you know  that situation where you go into the clinic and you don't get diagnosed  Well  we just put basically all the human respiratory viruses on one chip  and we threw in herpes virus for good measure    I mean  why not  The first thing you do as a scientist is  you make sure stuff works. And so what we did is  we take tissue culture cells and infect them with various viruses  and we take the stuff and fluorescently label the nucleic acid  the genetic material that comes out of these tissue culture cells    mostly viral stuff    and stick it on the array to see where it sticks. Now  if the DNA sequences match  they'll stick together  and so we can look at spots. And if spots light up  we know there's a certain virus in there. That's what one of these chips really looks like  and these red spots are  in fact  signals coming from the virus. And each spot represents a different family of virus or species of virus. And so  that's a hard way to look at things  so I'm just going to encode things as a little barcode  grouped by family  so you can see the results in a very intuitive way. What we did is  we took tissue culture cells and infected them with adenovirus  and you can see this little yellow barcode next to adenovirus. And  likewise  we infected them with parainfluenza      that's a paramyxovirus    and you see a little barcode here. And then we did respiratory syncytial virus. That's the scourge of daycare centers everywhere    it's like boogeremia  basically. You can see that this barcode is the same family  but it's distinct from parainfluenza    which gives you a very bad cold. And so we're getting unique signatures  a fingerprint for each virus. Polio and rhino  they're in the same family  very close to each other. Rhino's the common cold  and you all know what polio is  and you can see that these signatures are distinct. And Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpes virus gives a nice signature down here. And so it is not any one stripe or something that tells me I have a virus of a particular type here  it's the barcode that in bulk represents the whole thing. All right  I can see a rhinovirus    and here's the blow up of the rhinovirus's little barcode    but what about different rhinoviruses  How do I know which rhinovirus I have  There're     known variants of the common cold  and there're only     because people got bored collecting them  there are just new ones every year. And so  here are four different rhinoviruses  and you can see  even with your eye  without any fancy computer pattern matching recognition software algorithms  that you can distinguish each one of these barcodes from each other. Now  this is kind of a cheap shot  because I know what the genetic sequence of all these rhinoviruses is  and I in fact designed the chip expressly to be able to tell them apart  but what about rhinoviruses that have never seen a genetic sequencer  We don't know what the sequence is  just pull them out of the field. So  here are four rhinoviruses we never knew anything about    no one's ever sequenced them    and you can also see that you get unique and distinguishable patterns. You can imagine building up some library  whether real or virtual  of fingerprints of essentially every virus. But that's  again  shooting fish in a barrel  you know  right  You have tissue culture cells. There are a ton of viruses. What about real people  You can't control real people  as you probably know. You have no idea what someone's going to cough into a cup  and it's probably really complex  right  It could have lots of bacteria  it could have more than one virus  and it certainly has host genetic material. So how do we deal with this  And how do we do the positive control here  Well  it's pretty simple. That's me  getting a nasal lavage. And the idea is  let's experimentally inoculate people with virus. This is all IRB approved  by the way  they got paid. And basically we experimentally inoculate people with the common cold virus. Or  even better  let's just take people right out of the emergency room    undefined  community acquired respiratory tract infections. You have no idea what walks in through the door. So  let's start off with the positive control first  where we know the person was healthy. They got a shot of virus up the nose  let's see what happens. Day zero  nothing happening. They're healthy  they're clean    it's amazing. Actually  we thought the nasal tract might be full of viruses even when you're walking around healthy. It's pretty clean. If you're healthy  you're pretty healthy. Day two  we get a very robust rhinovirus pattern  and it's very similar to what we get in the lab doing our tissue culture experiment. So that's great  but again  cheap shot  right  We put a ton of virus up this guy's nose. So       I mean  we wanted it to work. He really had a cold. So  how about the people who walk in off the street  Here are two individuals represented by their anonymous ID codes. They both have rhinoviruses  we've never seen this pattern in lab. We sequenced part of their viruses  they're new rhinoviruses no one's actually even seen. Remember  our evolutionary conserved sequences we're using on this array allow us to detect even novel or uncharacterized viruses  because we pick what is conserved throughout evolution. Here's another guy. You can play the diagnosis game yourself here. These different blocks represent the different viruses in this paramyxovirus family  so you can kind of go down the blocks and see where the signal is. Well  doesn't have canine distemper  that's probably good. But by the time you get to block nine  you see that respiratory syncytial virus. Maybe they have kids. And then you can see  also  the family member that's related  RSVB is showing up here. So  that's great. Here's another individual  sampled on two separate days    repeat visits to the clinic. This individual has parainfluenza    and you can see that there's a little stripe over here for Sendai virus  that's mouse parainfluenza. The genetic relationships are very close there. That's a lot of fun. So  we built out the chip. We made a chip that has every known virus ever discovered on it. Why not  Every plant virus  every insect virus  every marine virus. Everything that we could get out of GenBank    that is  the national repository of sequences. Now we're using this chip. And what are we using it for  Well  first of all  when you have a big chip like this  you need a little bit more informatics  so we designed the system to do automatic diagnosis. And the idea is that we simply have virtual patterns  because we're never going to get samples of every virus    it would be virtually impossible. But we can get virtual patterns  and compare them to our observed result    which is a very complex mixture    and come up with some sort of score of how likely it is this is a rhinovirus or something. And this is what this looks like. If  for example  you used a cell culture that's chronically infected with papilloma  you get a little computer readout here  and our algorithm says it's probably papilloma type   . And that is  in fact  what these particular cell cultures are chronically infected with. So let's do something a little bit harder. We put the beeper in the clinic. When somebody shows up  and the hospital doesn't know what to do because they can't diagnose it  they call us. That's the idea  and we're setting this up in the Bay Area. And so  this case report happened three weeks ago. We have a    year old healthy woman  no travel history   unclear   doesn't smoke  doesn't drink.    day history of fevers  night sweats  bloody sputum    she's coughing up blood    muscle pain. She went to the clinic  and they gave her antibiotics and then sent her home. She came back after ten days of fever  right  Still has the fever  and she's hypoxic    she doesn't have much oxygen in her lungs. They did a CT scan. A normal lung is all sort of dark and black here. All this white stuff    it's not good. This sort of tree and bud formation indicates there's inflammation  there's likely to be infection. OK. So  the patient was treated then with a third generation cephalosporin antibiotic and doxycycline  and on day three  it didn't help  she had progressed to acute failure. They had to intubate her  so they put a tube down her throat and they began to mechanically ventilate her. She could no longer breathe for herself. What to do next  Don't know. Switch antibiotics  so they switched to another antibiotic  Tamiflu. It's not clear why they thought she had the flu  but they switched to Tamiflu. And on day six  they basically threw in the towel. You do an open lung biopsy when you've got no other options. There's an eight percent mortality rate with just doing this procedure  and so basically    and what do they learn from it  You're looking at her open lung biopsy. And I'm no pathologist  but you can't tell much from this. All you can tell is  there's a lot of swelling  bronchiolitis. It was  unrevealing   that's the pathologist's report. And so  what did they test her for  They have their own tests  of course  and so they tested her for over    different assays  for every sort of bacteria and fungus and viral assay you can buy off the shelf  SARS  metapneumovirus  HIV  RSV    all these. Everything came back negative  over         dollars worth of tests. I mean  they went to the max for this woman. And basically on hospital day eight  that's when they called us. They gave us endotracheal aspirate    you know  a little fluid from the throat  from this tube that they got down there    and they gave us this. We put it on the chip  what do we see  Well  we saw parainfluenza  . Well  what the hell's parainfluenza    No one tests for parainfluenza  . No one cares about it. In fact  it's not even really sequenced that much. There's just a little bit of it sequenced. There's almost no epidemiology or studies on it. No one would even consider it  because no one had a clue that it could cause respiratory failure. And why is that  Just lore. There's no data    no data to support whether it causes severe or mild disease. Clearly  we have a case of a healthy person that's going down. OK  that's one case report. I'm going to tell you one last thing in the last two minutes that's unpublished    it's going to come out tomorrow    and it's an interesting case of how you might use this chip to find something new and open a new door. Prostate cancer. I don't need to give you many statistics about prostate cancer. Most of you already know it  third leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S. Lots of risk factors  but there is a genetic predisposition to prostate cancer. For maybe about    percent of prostate cancer  there are folks that are predisposed to it. And the first gene that was mapped in association studies for this  early onset prostate cancer  was this gene called RNASEL. What is that  It's an antiviral defense enzyme. So  we're sitting around and thinking   Why would men who have the mutation    a defect in an antiviral defense system    get prostate cancer  It doesn't make sense    unless  maybe  there's a virus   So  we put tumors     and now we have over     tumors    on our array. And we know who's got defects in RNASEL and who doesn't. And I'm showing you the signal from the chip here  and I'm showing you for the block of retroviral oligos. And what I'm telling you here from the signal  is that men who have a mutation in this antiviral defense enzyme  and have a tumor  often have       percent of the time    a signature which reveals a new retrovirus. OK  that's pretty wild. What is it  So  we clone the whole virus. First of all  I'll tell you that a little automated prediction told us it was very similar to a mouse virus. But that doesn't tell us too much  so we actually clone the whole thing. And the viral genome I'm showing you right here  It's a classic gamma retrovirus  but it's totally new  no one's ever seen it before. Its closest relative is  in fact  from mice  and so we would call this a xenotropic retrovirus  because it's infecting a species other than mice. And this is a little phylogenetic tree to see how it's related to other viruses. We've done it for many patients now  and we can say that they're all independent infections. They all have the same virus  but they're different enough that there's reason to believe that they've been independently acquired. Is it really in the tissue  And I'll end up with this  yes. We take slices of these biopsies of tumor tissue and use material to actually locate the virus  and we find cells here with viral particles in them. These guys really do have this virus. Does this virus cause prostate cancer  Nothing I'm saying here implies causality. I don't know. Is it a link to oncogenesis  I don't know. Is it the case that these guys are just more susceptible to viruses  Could be. And it might have nothing to do with cancer. But now it's a door. We have a strong association between the presence of this virus and a genetic mutation that's been linked to cancer. That's where we're at. So  it opens up more questions than it answers  I'm afraid  but that's what  you know  science is really good at. This was all done by folks in the lab    I cannot take credit for most of this. This is a collaboration between myself and Don. This is the guy who started the project in my lab  and this is the guy who's been doing prostate stuff. Thank you very much.  Applause  Natalie MacMaster  I'm going to just quickly start out with a little bit of music here.  Applause  Thank you   Applause  I took my shoes off to dance  but maybe I'll get at that later. Anyways  I... where to start  Well  I'm really excited to talk a bit about my own upbringing in music and family and all of that  but I'm even more excited for you people to hear about Donnell's amazing family and maybe even a little bit about how we met  and all that sort of thing  but for those of you that may not be familiar with my upbringing  I'm from Cape Breton Island  Nova Scotia  eastern Canada  which is a very  very musical island  and its origins come from Scotland with the music and all the traditions  the dancing  the language  which unfortunately is dying out in Cape Breton. The traditional language is Gaelic  but a lot of the music came from the Gaelic language  and the dancing and the singing and everything  and my bloodline is Scottish through and through  but my mother and father are two very  very musical people. My mom taught me to dance when I was five  and my dad taught me to play fiddle when I was nine. My uncle is a very well known Cape Breton fiddler. His name's Buddy MacMaster  and just a wonderful guy  and we have a great tradition at home called square dancing  and we had parties  great parties at our house and the neighbors' houses  and you talk about kitchen c ilidhs. Well  c ilidh first of all is Gaelic for party  but kitchen party in Cape Breton is very common  and basically somebody drops into the house  and no matter what house you go to in Cape Breton  there's a fiddle there  guaranteed  and I'd say  well there's first of all more fiddlers per capita in Cape Breton than anywhere in the world  so ten chances to one  the fellow who walked in the door could play it  so you'd have someone come into the house  you'd invite them to play a tune  and lo and behold a little party would start up and somebody would dance  and somebody would sing  and all that sort of thing  so it was a wonderful  wonderful way to grow up  and that is where my beginnings in music come from  my surroundings  my family  just my bloodline in itself  and  oh  I've done lots of things with my music. I've recorded lots of CDs. I was nominated for a Grammy and I've won some awards and stuff like that  so that's awesome  but the best part was meeting my husband  and I've actually known Donnell for probably    years now  and I'm going to get into a little bit of  I guess  how music brought us together  but I'm going to introduce you right now to my new husband as of October    Donnell Leahy.  Applause  Donnell Leahy  Thank you. I'm kind of new to the TED experience and I'm glad to be here  but I'm just trying to put it all together  trying to figure all you people out  and I've been here for a short while  and I'm starting to understand a little bit better. So I asked Natalie  what do I do  And she said  just talk about yourself. It's kind of boring  but I'll just tell you a little bit about my family. I'm one of    brothers and sisters from Lakefield  Ontario  an hour and a half northeast of Toronto  and we grew up on a farm. Mom and Dad raised beef cattle  and I'm the oldest boy. There are four girls a little bit older than me. We grew up without a television. People find that strange  but I think it was a great blessing for us. We had a television for a few years  but of course we wasted so much time and the work wasn't getting done  so out went the television. We grew up playing  Mom's from Cape Breton  coincidentally. Mom and Natalie's mother knew each other. We grew up playing  and used to dance together  right  yeah. we played by ear and I think that's important for us because we were not really exposed to a lot of different styles of music. We learned to play the instruments  but we kind of had to come from within or go from within  because we didn't watch television  we didn't listen to a lot of radio. We went to church and to school sometimes  and farmed and played music  so we were able  I think  at a very critical age to develop our own style  our own self  and my mother plays  my father plays  and the style that came from the Ottawa Valley in Ontario  we call it French Canadian style but it originated in logging camps. Years ago  hundreds of men would go up for the winter to the camps in Northern Ontario and in Quebec  and they were all different cultures  and the Irish  the French  Scottish  German  they'd all meet  and of course at night  they'd play cards and step dance and play fiddles  and over the course of many years  the Ottawa Valley fiddling kind of evolved and the Ottawa Valley step dancing evolved  so that's  I kind of started out with that style and I quickly started doing my own thing  and then I met Natalie  and I was exposed to the great Cape Breton fiddling. That's how we met.  Laughter  You tell them.  Laughter  NM  You want to or no   Laughter  Well I guess I have to now. Well  it's just so interesting that Donnell's upbringing was very similar to mine  and I actually saw Donnell play when I was about    years old  and he and his family came to Inverness  which is about    minutes from where I lived  and I was just blown away  like  it was just amazing  and you'll find out why pretty soon here  but I couldn't believe the fiddling and Mom was there with me  and she was saying   Donnell's mother came up on stage and danced with her children  and Mom was saying   That's Julie MacDonnell  I used to dance with her when we were kids. Little did I think our children would be playing instruments  you know  playing music  yeah.  Twelve years  er     years later little did she think her kids would be getting married  but anyway  so  then I got a phone call about  I dunno  seven years later. I was     first or second year of college  and it was Donnell  and he said  Hi  you probably don't know me but my name is Donnell Leahy.  And I said   I know you. I have a tape of yours at home.  And he said   Well  I'm in Truro   which is where I was  and he asked me out for supper. That's it.  Laughter  Then   Will I keep going   Laughs  Then we dated for two years  broke up for     got back together and got married.  Laughter   Applause  DL  So anyway  we're running out of time  so I'll just get to it. I'm going to play a piece of music for you. It's actually a Scottish piece I've chosen. I starts out with a slow air. Airs were played in Europe at burials  as a body was carried out from the wake site to the burial site  the procession was led by a piper or a fiddle player. I'll quickly play a short part of the air  and then I'm going to get into kind of a crazy tune that is very difficult to play when you're not warmed up  so  if I mess it up  pretend you like it anyway. It's called The Banks. NM  Well  we're gonna play one together now.  Applause  We're laughing  like  because our styles are totally different  as you can hear. And so  you know  Donnell and I are actually in the process of writing new pieces of music together that we can play  but we don't have any of those ready. We just started yesterday.  Laughter  So we're gonna play something together anyway. DL  With one minute. NM  With one minute. DL  You start. NM  No  you have to start  because you've got to do your thing. NM  I'm not tuned. Hold on. NM  I feel like I'm in the duck or the bird pose right now.  Laughter  Announcer  Great news  they're running late downstairs. We've got another    minutes. NM  Okay. Sure. All right  okay. Let's get her going.  Applause  DL  What do you want to play  NM  Well  um... NM  Uh  sure. DL  How fast  NM  Not too fast. DL  We're going to play a tune and Natalie's going to accompany me on the piano. The Cape Breton piano playing is just awesome. It's very rhythmic and  you'll see it. My mom plays piano  and she learned to play before they had a piano at home in Cape Breton. Before Mom's family had a piano in Cape Breton  she learned to play the rhythms on a piece of board  and the fiddlers would all congregate to play on the cold winter's evenings and Mom would be banging on this board  so when they bought a piano  they bought it in Toronto and had it taken by train and brought in on a horse  a horse and sleigh to the house. It became the only piano in the region  and Mom said she could basically play as soon as the piano arrived  she could play it because she had learned all these rhythms. Anyway  we found the piano last year and were able to bring it back home. We purchased it. It had gone through  like  five or six families  and it was just a big thing for us  and we found actually an old picture of somebody and their family years ago. Anyway  I'm blabbering on here. NM  No  I want you to tell them about Leahy. DL  What about Leahy   Laughter  NM  Just tell them what  DL  She wants me to talk about  We have a band named Leahy. There's    siblings. We  um  What will I tell them   Laughter  We opened  NM  No surgeries. DL  No surgeries  oh yeah. We had a great opportunity. We opened for Shania Twain for two years on her international tour. It was a big thing for us  and now all my sisters are off having babies and the boys are all getting married  so we're staying close to home for  I guess  another couple of weeks. What can I say  I don't know what to say  Natalie. We  uh...  Laughter  NM  Is this what marriage is about  I like it.  Applause  DL  Oh yeah  okay  in my family we had seven girls  four boys  we had two fiddles and one piano  and of course we were all fighting to play on the instruments  so dad and mom set a rule that you couldn't kick anyone off the instrument. You had to wait until they were finished  so of course  what we would do is we'd get on the piano and you wouldn't even get off to eat  because you wouldn't want to give it up to your brother or sister  and they'd wait and wait and wait  and it'd be midnight and you'd be still sitting there on the piano  but it was their way to get us to practice. Will we play a tune  NM  It worked. DL  It worked. Sorry  I hate to carry on... So this is our last number  and we'll feature Nat on piano. Okay  play in  how about A  Right when I was    was when I first got interested in solar energy. My family had moved from Fort Lee  New Jersey to California  and we moved from the snow to lots of heat  and gas lines. There was gas rationing in     . The energy crisis was in full bore. I started reading Popular Science magazine  and I got really excited about the potential of solar energy to try and solve that crisis. I had just taken trigonometry in high school  I learned about the parabola and how it could concentrate rays of light to a single focus. That got me very excited. And I really felt that there would be potential to build some kind of thing that could concentrate light. So  I started this company called Solar Devices. And this was a company where I built parabolas  I took metal shop  and I remember walking into metal shop building parabolas and Stirling engines. And I was building this Stirling engine over on the lathe  and all the biker guys    motorcycle guys    came over and said   You're building a bong  aren't you   And I said   No  it's a Stirling engine. It really is.  But they didn't believe me. I sold the plans for this engine and for this dish in the back of Popular Science magazine  for four dollars each. And I earned enough money to pay for my first year of Caltech. It was a really big excitement for me to get into Caltech. And my first year at Caltech  I continued the business. But then  in the second year of Caltech  they started grading. The whole first year was pass fail  but the second year was graded. I wasn't able to keep up with the business  and I ended up with a    year detour. My dream had been to convert solar energy at a very practical cost  but then I had this big detour. First  the coursework at Caltech. Then  when I graduated from Caltech  the IBM P.C. came out  and I got addicted to the IBM P.C. in     . And then in       Lotus       came out  and I was completely blown away by Lotus      . I began operating my business with        began writing add ins for        wrote a natural language interface to      . I started an educational software company after I joined Lotus  and then I started Idealab so I could have a roof under which I could build multiple companies in succession Then  much much later    in       very recently    the new California energy crisis    or what was purported to be a big energy crisis    was coming. And I was trying to figure if there was some way we could build something that would capitalize on that and try and get people back up energy  in case the crisis really came. And I started looking at how we could build battery back up systems that could give people five hours     hours  maybe even a full day  or three days' worth of back up power. I'm glad you heard earlier today  batteries are unbelievably energy    lack of density compared to fuel. So much more energy can be stored with fuel than with batteries. You'd have to fill your entire parking space of one garage space just to give yourself four hours of battery back up. And I concluded  after researching every other technology that we could deploy for storing energy    flywheels  different formulations of batteries    it just wasn't practical to store energy. So what about making energy  Maybe we could make energy. I tried to figure out    maybe solar's become attractive. It's been    years since I was doing this  let me go back and look at what's been happening with solar cells. And the price had gone down from    dollars a watt to about four or five dollars a watt  but it stabilized. And it really needed to get much lower than that to be cost effective. I studied all the new things that had happened in solar cells  and was trying to look for ways we could innovate and make solar cells more inexpensively. There are a lot of new things that are happening to do that  but fundamentally the process requires a tremendous amount of energy. Some people even say it takes more energy to make a solar cell than it will give out in its entire life. Hopefully  if we can reduce the amount of energy it takes to make the cells  that will become more practical. But right now  you pretty much have to take silicon  put it in an oven at      degrees Fahrenheit for    hours  to make the cells. A lot of people are working on things to try and reduce that  but I didn't have anything to contribute in that area. So I tried to figure out what other way could we try and make cost effective solar electricity. So I thought of an idea    what if we collect the sun with a large reflector    like I had been thinking about way back when  when I was in high school    but maybe with modern technology we could make a cheaper  large collector  concentrate it to a small converter  and then the conversion device wouldn't have to be as expensive  because it's much smaller  rather than solar cells  which have to be covering the entire surface area that you want to gather sun from. This seemed practical now  because a lot of new technologies had come in the    years since I had last looked at it. First of all  there was a lot of new manufacturing techniques  not to mention really cheap miniature motors    brushless motors  servo motors  stepper motors  that are used in printers and scanners and things like that. So  that's a breakthrough. Of course  inexpensive microprocessors and then a very important breakthrough    genetic algorithms. I'll be very short on genetic algorithms. It's a powerful way of solving intractable problems using natural selection. You take a problem that you can't solve with a pure mathematical answer  you build an evolutionary system to try multiple tries at guessing  you add sex    where you take half of one solution and half of another and then make new mutations    and you use natural selection to kill off not as good solutions. Usually  with a genetic algorithm on a computer today  with a three gigahertz processor you can solve many  many formerly intractable problems in just a matter of minutes. We tried to come up with a way to use genetic algorithms to create a new type of concentrator. And I'll show you what we came up with. Traditionally  concentrators look like this. Those shapes are parabolas. They take all the parallel incoming rays and focus it to a single spot. They have to track the sun  because they have to be pointing directly at the sun. They usually have about a one degree acceptance angle  meaning once they're more than about a degree off  none of the sunlight rays will hit the focus. So we tried to come up with a way of making a non tracking collector  a collector that would gather much more than one degree of light  with no moving parts. So we created this genetic algorithm to try this out  we made a model in XL of a multi surface reflector  and an amazing thing evolved  literally evolved  from trying a billion cycles  a billion different attempts  with a fitness function that defined how can you collect the most light  from the most angles  over a day  from the sun. And this is the shape that evolved. It's this non tracking collector with these six tuba like horns  and each of them collect light in the following way    if the sunlight strikes right here  it might bounce right to the center  the hot spot  directly  but if the sun is off axis and comes from the side  it might hit two places and take two bounces. So for direct light  it takes only one bounce  for off axis light it might take two  and for extreme off axis  it might take three. Your efficiency goes down with more bounces  because you lose about    percent with each bounce  but this allowed us to collect light from a plus or minus    degree angle. So  about two and a half hours of the day we could collect with a stationary component. Solar cells collect light for four and a half hours though. On an average adjusted day  a solar cell    because the sun's moving across the sky  the solar cell is going down with a sine wave function of performance at the off axis angles. It collects about four and a half average hours of sunlight a day. So  even this  although it was great with no moving parts    we could achieve high temperatures    wasn't enough. We needed to beat solar cells. So we took a look at another idea. We looked at a way to break up a parabola into individual petals that would track. So what you see here is    separate petals  that each could be controlled with individual microprocessors that would only cost a dollar. You can buy a two megahertz microprocessor for a dollar now. And you can buy stepper motors that pretty much never wear out because they have no brushes  for a dollar. We can control all    of these petals for under    dollars and what this would allow us to do is not have to move the focus any more  but only move the petals. The whole system would have a much lower profile  but also we could gather sunlight for six and a half to seven hours a day. Now that we have concentrated sunlight  what are we going to put at the center to convert sunlight to electricity  So we tried to look at all the different heat engines that have been used in history to try and convert sunlight to electricity  or heat to electricity. And one of the great ones of all time  James Watt's steam engine of      was a major  major breakthrough. James Watt didn't actually invent the steam engine  he just refined it. But  his refinements were incredible. He added new linear motion guides to the pistons  he added a condenser to cool the steam outside the cylinder  he made the engine double acting so it had double the power. Those were major breakthroughs. I mean  all of the improvements he made    and it's justifiable that our measure of energy  the watt  today is named after him. So we looked at this engine  and this had some potential. Steam engines are dangerous  and they had tremendous impact on the world  as you know    industrial revolution and ships and locomotives. But they're usually good to be large  so they're not good for distributed power generation. But they're also very high pressure  so they're dangerous. Another type of engine is the hot air engine. And the hot air engine also was not invented by Robert Stirling  but Robert Stirling came along in      and radically improved it. This engine  because it was so interesting    it only worked on air  no steam    has led to hundreds of creative designs over the years that use the Stirling engine principle. But after the Stirling engine  Otto came along  and also  he didn't invent the internal combustion engine  he just refined it. He showed it in Paris in       and it was a major achievement because it brought the power density of the engine way up. You could now get a lot more power in a lot smaller space  and that allowed the engine to be used for mobile applications. So  once you have mobility  now you're making a lot of engines because you've got lots of units  as opposed to steam ships or big factories where you're not making as many units  so this was the engine that ended up benefiting from mass production where all the other engines didn't benefit. So  because it went into mass production  costs were reduced      years of refinement  emissions were reduced  tremendous production value. There have been hundreds of millions of internal combustion engines built  compared to thousands of Stirling engines built. And not nearly as many small steam engines being built anymore  only large ones for big operations. So after looking at these three  and    others  we concluded that the Stirling engine would be the best one to use. I want to give you a brief explanation of how we looked at it and how it works. So we tried to look at the Stirling engine in a new way  because it was practical    weight no longer mattered for our application The internal combustion engine took off because weight mattered because you were moving around. But if you're trying to generate solar energy in a static place the weight doesn't matter so much. The other thing we discovered is that efficiency doesn't matter so much if your energy source is free. Normally  efficiency is crucial because the fuel cost of your engine over its life dwarfs the cost of the engine. But if your fuel source is free  then the only thing that matters is the up front capital cost of the engine. So you don't want to optimize for efficiency  you want to optimize for power per dollar. So using that new twist  with the new criteria  we thought we could re look at the Stirling engine  and also bring genetic algorithms in. Basically  Robert Stirling didn't have Gordon Moore before him to get us three gigahertz of processor power. So we took the same genetic algorithm that we used earlier to make that concentrator  which didn't work out for us  to optimize the Stirling engine  and make its design sizes and all of its dimensions the exact optimum to get the most power per dollar  irrespective of weight  irrespective of size  to get the most conversion of solar energy  because the sun is free. And that's the process we took    let me show you how the engine works. The simplest heat engine  or hot air engine  of all time would be this    take a box  a steel canister  with a piston. Put a flame under it  the piston moves up. Take it off the flame and pour water on it  or let it cool down  the piston moves down. That's a heat engine. That's basically the most fundamental heat engine you could possibly have. The problem is the efficiency is one hundredth of one percent  because you're heating all the metal of the chamber and then cooling all the metal of the chamber each time. And you're only getting power from the air that's heating at the same time  but you're wasting all the energy heating the metal and cooling the metal. So someone came up with a very clever idea  to    instead of heating the whole cylinder and cooling the whole cylinder  what about if you put a displacer inside    a little thing that shuttles the air back and forth. You move that up and down with a little bit of energy but now you're only shifting the air down to the hot end and up to the cold end  down to the hot end and up to the cold end. So  now you're not alternately heating and cooling the metal  you're just alternately heating and cooling the air. That allows you to get the efficiency up from a hundredth of a percent to about two percent. And then Robert Stirling came along with this genius idea  which was  well I'm still not heating the metal now  with this kind of engine  but I'm still reheating all the air. I'm still heating the air every time and cooling the air every time. What about if I put a thermal sponge in the middle  in the passageway between where the air has to move between hot and cold  So he made fine wires  and cracked glass  and all different kinds of materials to be a heat sponge. So when the air pushes up to go from the hot end to the cold end  it puts some heat into the sponge. And then when the air comes back after it's been cooled it picks up that heat again. So you're reusing your energy five or six times  and that brings the efficiency up between    and    percent It's a little known  but brilliant  genius invention of Robert Stirling that takes the hot air engine from being somewhat impractical    like I found out when I made the real simple version in high school    to very potentially possible  once you get the efficiency up  if you can design this to be low enough cost. So we really set out on a path to try and make the lowest cost possible. We built a huge mathematical model of how a Stirling engine works. We applied the genetic algorithm. We got the results from that for the optimal engine. We built engines    so we built     different engines over the last two years. We measured each one  we readjusted the model to what we measured  and then we led that to the current prototype. It led to a very compact  inexpensive engine  and this is what the engine looks like. Let me show you what it looks like in real life. So this is the engine. It's just a small cylinder down here which holds the generator inside and all the linkage and it's the hot cap    the hot cylinder on the top    this part gets hot  this part is cool  and electricity comes out. The exact converse is also true. If you put electricity in  this will get hot and this will get cold  you get refrigeration. So it's a complete reversible cycle  a very efficient cycle  and quite a simple thing to make. So now you put the two things together. So you have the engine  now what if you combine the petals and the engine in the center  The petals track and the engine gets the concentrated sunlight  take that heat and turn it into electricity. This is what the first prototype of our system looked like together with the petals and the engine in the center. This is being run out in the sun  and now I want to show you what the actual thing looks like. Thank you. So this is a unit with the    petals These petals cost about a dollar each    they're lightweight  injection molded plastic  aluminized. The mechanism to control each petal is below there with a microprocessor on each one. There are thermocouples on the engine    little sensors that detect the heat when the sunlight strikes them. Each petal adjusts itself separately to keep the highest temperature on it. When the sun comes out in the morning  the petals will seek the sun  find it by searching for the highest temperature About a minute and a half or two minutes after the rays are striking the hot cap the engine will be warm enough to start and then the engine will generate electricity for about six and a half hours a day    six and a half to seven hours as the sun moves across the sky A critical part that we can take advantage of is that we have these inexpensive microprocessors and each one of these petals are autonomous  and each one of these petals figures out where the sun is with no user set up. So you don't have to tell what latitude  longitude you're at  you don't have to tell what your roof slope angle is  you don't have to tell what orientation. It doesn't really care. What it does is it searches to find the hottest spot  it searches again a half an hour later  it searches again a day later  it searches again a month later. It basically figures out where on Earth you are by watching the direction the sun moves  so you don't have to actually enter anything about that. The way the unit works is  when the sun comes out the engine will start and you get power out here. We have A.C. and D.C.  get    volts D.C.  so that could be used for certain applications. We have an inverter in there  so you get     volts A.C. and you also get hot water. The hot water's optional. You don't have to use the hot water  it will cool itself. But you can use it to optionally heat hot water and that brings the efficiency up even higher because some of the heat that you would normally be rejecting  you can now use as useful energy  whether it's for a pool or hot water. Let me show you a quick movie of what this looks like running. So this is the first test where we took it outside and each of the petals were individually seeking. And what they do is step  very coarsely at first  and then very finely afterward. Once they get a temperature reading on the thermocouple indicating they found the sun  then they slow down and do a fine search  then all the petals will move into position  and then the engine will start. So  we've been working on this for the last two years. We're very excited about the progress  we do have a very long way to go though still  and let me tell you a little bit more about that. This is how we envision it would be in a residential installation  you'd probably have more than one unit on your roof. It could be on your roof  or in your backyard  or somewhere else. You don't have to have enough units to power your entire house  you just save money with each incremental one you add. So you're still using the grid potentially  in this type of application  to be your back up supply    of course  you can't use these at night  and you can't use these on cloudy days. But by reducing your energy use  pretty much at the peak times    usually when you have you air conditioning on  or other times like that    this generates the peak power at the peak usage time  so it's very complementary in that sense. This is how we would envision a residential application. We also think there's very big potential for energy farms  especially in remote land where there happens to be a lot of sun. It's a really good combination of those two factors. It turns out there's a lot of powerful sun all around the world  obviously  but in special places where it happens to be relatively inexpensive to place these and also in many more places where there is high wind power. So an example of that is  here's the map of the United States. Pretty much everywhere that's not green or blue is a really ideal place  but even the green or blue areas are good  just not as good as the places that are red  orange and yellow. But the hot sport right around Las Vegas and Death Valley and that area is very  very good. And all this does is affect the payback period  it doesn't mean that you couldn't use solar energy  you could use solar energy anywhere on Earth. It just affects the payback period if you're comparing to grid supplied electricity. But if you don't have grid supplied electricity  then the whole question of payback is a different one entirely. It's just how many watts do you get per dollar  and how could you benefit from that using that power to change your life in some way. This is the map of the United States. This is the map of the whole Earth and again  you can see a huge swathe in the middle of pretty much where a large part of the population is  there's tremendous chances for solar energy. And of course  look at Africa. It's just unbelievable what the potential is to take advantage of solar energy there  and I'm really excited to talk more about finding ways we can help with that. So  in conclusion  I would say my journey has shown me that you can revisit old ideas in a new light  and sometimes ideas that have been discarded in the past can be practical now if you apply some new technology or new twists. We believe we're getting very close to something practical and affordable. Our short term goal for this is to be half the price of solar cells and our longer term goal is to be less than a five year payback. And at less than a five year payback  all of a sudden this becomes very economic So you don't have to just want to have a feel good attitude about energy to want to have one of these. It just makes economic sense. Right now  solar paybacks are between    and    years. If you get it down below five years then it becomes almost a no brainer because the interest to own it    someone else will finance it for you and you can just make money  basically from day one. So that's our real powerful goal that we're really shooting for in the company. Two other things that I learned that were very surprising to me    one was how casual we are about energy. I was walking from the elevator over here  and even just looking at the stage right now    so there's probably        watt lights right now. There's        watts of light pouring on the stage  one horsepower is     watts  at full power. So there's basically    horses running at full speed just to keep the stage lit. Not to mention the     horses that are probably running right now to keep the airconditioning going. And it's just amazing  walk in the elevator and there's lights on in the elevator. Of course  now I'm very sensitive at home when we leave the lights on by mistake. But  everywhere around us we have insatiable use for energy because it's so cheap. And it's cheap because we've been subsidized by energy that's been concentrated by the sun. Basically  oil is solar energy concentrate. It's been pounded for a billion years with a lot of energy to make it have all that energy contained in it. And we don't have a birthright to just use that up as fast as we are  I think. And it would be great if we could find a way to make our energy usage renewable  where as we're using the energy we're creating it at the same pace  and I really hope we can get there. Thank you very much  you've been a great audience. I wrote a letter last week talking about the work of the foundation  sharing some of the problems. And Warren Buffet had recommended I do that    being honest about what was going well  what wasn't  and making it kind of an annual thing. A goal I had there was to draw more people in to work on those problems  because I think there are some very important problems that don't get worked on naturally. That is  the market does not drive the scientists  the communicators  the thinkers  the governments to do the right things. And only by paying attention to these things and having brilliant people who care and draw other people in can we make as much progress as we need to. So this morning I'm going to share two of these problems and talk about where they stand. But before I dive into those I want to admit that I am an optimist. Any tough problem  I think it can be solved. And part of the reason I feel that way is looking at the past. Over the past century  average lifespan has more than doubled. Another statistic  perhaps my favorite  is to look at childhood deaths. As recently as           million children were born  and    million of those died before the age of five. Five years ago      million children were born    so  more    and less than    million of them died before the age of five. So that's a factor of two reduction of the childhood death rate. It's a phenomenal thing. Each one of those lives matters a lot. And the key reason we were able to it was not only rising incomes but also a few key breakthroughs  vaccines that were used more widely. For example  measles was four million of the deaths back as recently as      and now is under        . So we really can make changes. The next breakthrough is to cut that    million in half again. And I think that's doable in well under    years. Why  Well there's only a few diseases that account for the vast majority of those deaths  diarrhea  pneumonia and malaria. So that brings us to the first problem that I'll raise this morning  which is how do we stop a deadly disease that's spread by mosquitos  Well  what's the history of this disease  It's been a severe disease for thousands of years. In fact  if we look at the genetic code  it's the only disease we can see that people who lived in Africa actually evolved several things to avoid malarial deaths. Deaths actually peaked at a bit over five million in the     s. So it was absolutely gigantic. And the disease was all over the world. A terrible disease. It was in the United States. It was in Europe. People didn't know what caused it until the early     s  when a British military man figured out that it was mosquitos. So it was everywhere. And two tools helped bring the death rate down. One was killing the mosquitos with DDT. The other was treating the patients with quinine  or quinine derivatives. And so that's why the death rate did come down. Now  ironically  what happened was it was eliminated from all the temperate zones  which is where the rich countries are. So we can see        it's everywhere.       it's still most places.       the U.S. and most of Europe have gotten rid of it.       you've gotten most of the northern areas. And more recently you can see it's just around the equator. And so this leads to the paradox that because the disease is only in the poorer countries  it doesn't get much investment. For example  there's more money put into baldness drugs than are put into malaria. Now  baldness  it's a terrible thing. And rich men are afflicted. And so that's why that priority has been set. But  malaria    even the million deaths a year caused by malaria greatly understate its impact. Over     million people at any one time are suffering from it. It means that you can't get the economies in these areas going because it just holds things back so much. Now  malaria is of course transmitted by mosquitos. I brought some here  just so you could experience this. We'll let those roam around the auditorium a little bit. There's no reason only poor people should have the experience. Those mosquitos are not infected. So we've come up with a few new things. We've got bed nets. And bed nets are a great tool. What it means is the mother and child stay under the bed net at night  so the mosquitos that bite late at night can't get at them. And when you use indoor spraying with DDT and those nets you can cut deaths by over    percent. And that's happened now in a number of countries. It's great to see. But we have to be careful because malaria    the parasite evolves and the mosquito evolves. So every tool that we've ever had in the past has eventually become ineffective. And so you end up with two choices. If you go into a country with the right tools and the right way  you do it vigorously  you can actually get a local eradication. And that's where we saw the malaria map shrinking. Or  if you go in kind of half heartedly  for a period of time you'll reduce the disease burden  but eventually those tools will become ineffective  and the death rate will soar back up again. And the world has gone through this where it paid attention and then didn't pay attention. Now we're on the upswing. Bed net funding is up. There's new drug discovery going on. Our foundation has backed a vaccine that's going into phase three trial that starts in a couple months. And that should save over two thirds of the lives if it's effective. So we're going to have these new tools. But that alone doesn't give us the road map. Because the road map to get rid of this disease involves many things. It involves communicators to keep the funding high  to keep the visibility high  to tell the success stories. It involves social scientists  so we know how to get not just    percent of the people to use the bed nets  but    percent. We need mathematicians to come in and simulate this  to do Monte Carlo things to understand how these tools combine and work together. Of course we need drug companies to give us their expertise. We need rich world governments to be very generous in providing aid for these things. And so as these elements come together  I'm quite optimistic that we will be able to eradicate malaria. Now let me turn to a second question  a fairly different question  but I'd say equally important. And this is  How do you make a teacher great  It seems like the kind of question that people would spend a lot of time on  and we'd understand very well. And the answer is  really  that we don't. Let's start with why this is important. Well  all of us here  I'll bet  had some great teachers. We all had a wonderful education. That's part of the reason we're here today  part of the reason we're successful. I can say that  even though I'm a college drop out. I had great teachers. In fact  in the United States  the teaching system has worked fairly well. There are fairly effective teachers in a narrow set of places. So the top    percent of students have gotten a good education. And those top    percent have been the best in the world  if you measure them against the other top    percent. And they've gone on to create the revolutions in software and biotechnology and keep the U.S. at the forefront. Now  the strength for those top    percent is starting to fade on a relative basis  but even more concerning is the education that the balance of people are getting. Not only has that been weak. it's getting weaker. And if you look at the economy  it really is only providing opportunities now to people with a better education. And we have to change this. We have to change it so that people have equal opportunity. We have to change it so that the country is strong and stays at the forefront of things that are driven by advanced education  like science and mathematics. When I first learned the statistics  I was pretty stunned at how bad things are. Over    percent of kids never finish high school. And that had been covered up for a long time because they always took the dropout rate as the number who started in senior year and compared it to the number who finished senior year. Because they weren't tracking where the kids were before that. But most of the dropouts had taken place before that. They had to raise the stated dropout rate as soon as that tracking was done to over    percent. For minority kids  it's over    percent. And even if you graduate from high school  if you're low income  you have less than a    percent chance of ever completing a college degree. If you're low income in the United States  you have a higher chance of going to jail than you do of getting a four year degree. And that doesn't seem entirely fair. So  how do you make education better  Now  our foundation  for the last nine years  has invested in this. There's many people working on it. We've worked on small schools  we've funded scholarships  we've done things in libraries. A lot of these things had a good effect. But the more we looked at it  the more we realized that having great teachers was the very key thing. And we hooked up with some people studying how much variation is there between teachers  between  say  the top quartile    the very best    and the bottom quartile. How much variation is there within a school or between schools  And the answer is that these variations are absolutely unbelievable. A top quartile teacher will increase the performance of their class    based on test scores    by over    percent in a single year. What does that mean  That means that if the entire U.S.  for two years  had top quartile teachers  the entire difference between us and Asia would go away. Within four years we would be blowing everyone in the world away. So  it's simple. All you need are those top quartile teachers. And so you'd say   Wow  we should reward those people. We should retain those people. We should find out what they're doing and transfer that skill to other people.  But I can tell you that absolutely is not happening today. What are the characteristics of this top quartile  What do they look like  You might think these must be very senior teachers. And the answer is no. Once somebody has taught for three years their teaching quality does not change thereafter. The variation is very  very small. You might think these are people with master's degrees. They've gone back and they've gotten their Master's of Education. This chart takes four different factors and says how much do they explain teaching quality. That bottom thing  which says there's no effect at all  is a master's degree. Now  the way the pay system works is there's two things that are rewarded. One is seniority. Because your pay goes up and you vest into your pension. The second is giving extra money to people who get their master's degree. But it in no way is associated with being a better teacher. Teach for America  slight effect. For math teachers majoring in math there's a measurable effect. But  overwhelmingly  it's your past performance. There are some people who are very good at this. And we've done almost nothing to study what that is and to draw it in and to replicate it  to raise the average capability    or to encourage the people with it to stay in the system. You might say   Do the good teachers stay and the bad teacher's leave   The answer is  on average  the slightly better teachers leave the system. And it's a system with very high turnover. Now  there are a few places    very few    where great teachers are being made. A good example of one is a set of charter schools called KIPP. KIPP means Knowledge Is Power. It's an unbelievable thing. They have    schools    mostly middle schools  some high schools    and what goes on is great teaching. They take the poorest kids  and over    percent of their high school graduates go to four year colleges. And the whole spirit and attitude in those schools is very different than in the normal public schools. They're team teaching. They're constantly improving their teachers. They're taking data  the test scores  and saying to a teacher   Hey  you caused this amount of increase.  They're deeply engaged in making teaching better. When you actually go and sit in one of these classrooms  at first it's very bizarre. I sat down and I thought   What is going on   The teacher was running around  and the energy level was high. I thought   I'm in the sports rally or something. What's going on   And the teacher was constantly scanning to see which kids weren't paying attention  which kids were bored  and calling kids rapidly  putting things up on the board. It was a very dynamic environment  because particularly in those middle school years    fifth through eighth grade    keeping people engaged and setting the tone that everybody in the classroom needs to pay attention  nobody gets to make fun of it or have the position of the kid who doesn't want to be there. Everybody needs to be involved. And so KIPP is doing it. How does that compare to a normal school  Well  in a normal school  teachers aren't told how good they are. The data isn't gathered. In the teacher's contract  it will limit the number of times the principal can come into the classroom    sometimes to once per year. And they need advanced notice to do that. So imagine running a factory where you've got these workers  some of them just making crap and the management is told   Hey  you can only come down here once a year  but you need to let us know  because we might actually fool you  and try and do a good job in that one brief moment.  Even a teacher who wants to improve doesn't have the tools to do it. They don't have the test scores  and there's a whole thing of trying to block the data. For example  New York passed a law that said that the teacher improvement data could not be made available and used in the tenure decision for the teachers. And so that's sort of working in the opposite direction. But I'm optimistic about this  I think there are some clear things we can do. First of all  there's a lot more testing going on  and that's given us the picture of where we are. And that allows us to understand who's doing it well  and call them out  and find out what those techniques are. Of course  digital video is cheap now. Putting a few cameras in the classroom and saying that things are being recorded on an ongoing basis is very practical in all public schools. And so every few weeks teachers could sit down and say   OK  here's a little clip of something I thought I did well. Here's a little clip of something I think I did poorly. Advise me    when this kid acted up  how should I have dealt with that   And they could all sit and work together on those problems. You can take the very best teachers and kind of annotate it  have it so everyone sees who is the very best at teaching this stuff. You can take those great courses and make them available so that a kid could go out and watch the physics course  learn from that. If you have a kid who's behind  you would know you could assign them that video to watch and review the concept. And in fact  these free courses could not only be available just on the Internet  but you could make it so that DVDs were always available  and so anybody who has access to a DVD player can have the very best teachers. And so by thinking of this as a personnel system  we can do it much better. Now there's a book actually  about KIPP    the place that this is going on    that Jay Matthews  a news reporter  wrote    called   Work Hard  Be Nice.  And I thought it was so fantastic. It gave you a sense of what a good teacher does. I'm going to send everyone here a free copy of this book. Now  we put a lot of money into education  and I really think that education is the most important thing to get right for the country to have as strong a future as it should have. In fact we have in the stimulus bill    it's interesting    the House version actually had money in it for these data systems  and it was taken out in the Senate because there are people who are threatened by these things. But I    I'm optimistic. I think people are beginning to recognize how important this is  and it really can make a difference for millions of lives  if we get it right. I only had time to frame those two problems. There's a lot more problems like that    AIDS  pneumonia    I can just see you're getting excited  just at the very name of these things. And the skill sets required to tackle these things are very broad. You know  the system doesn't naturally make it happen. Governments don't naturally pick these things in the right way. The private sector doesn't naturally put its resources into these things. So it's going to take brilliant people like you to study these things  get other people involved    and you're helping to come up with solutions. And with that  I think there's some great things that will come out of it. Thank you. I am a writer. Writing books is my profession but it's more than that  of course. It is also my great lifelong love and fascination. And I don't expect that that's ever going to change. But  that said  something kind of peculiar has happened recently in my life and in my career  which has caused me to have to recalibrate my whole relationship with this work. And the peculiar thing is that I recently wrote this book  this memoir called  Eat  Pray  Love  which  decidedly unlike any of my previous books  went out in the world for some reason  and became this big  mega sensation  international bestseller thing. The result of which is that everywhere I go now  people treat me like I'm doomed. Seriously    doomed  doomed  Like  they come up to me now  all worried  and they say   Aren't you afraid you're never going to be able to top that  Aren't you afraid you're going to keep writing for your whole life and you're never again going to create a book that anybody in the world cares about at all  ever again   So that's reassuring  you know. But it would be worse  except for that I happen to remember that over    years ago  when I was a teenager  when I first started telling people that I wanted to be a writer  I was met with this same sort of fear based reaction. And people would say   Aren't you afraid you're never going to have any success  Aren't you afraid the humiliation of rejection will kill you  Aren't you afraid that you're going to work your whole life at this craft and nothing's ever going to come of it and you're going to die on a scrap heap of broken dreams with your mouth filled with bitter ash of failure   Like that  you know. The answer    the short answer to all those questions is   Yes.  Yes  I'm afraid of all those things. And I always have been. And I'm afraid of many  many more things besides that people can't even guess at  like seaweed and other things that are scary. But  when it comes to writing  the thing that I've been sort of thinking about lately  and wondering about lately  is why  You know  is it rational  Is it logical that anybody should be expected to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this Earth to do. And what is it specifically about creative ventures that seems to make us really nervous about each other's mental health in a way that other careers kind of don't do  you know  Like my dad  for example  was a chemical engineer and I don't recall once in his    years of chemical engineering anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer  you know   That chemical engineering block  John  how's it going   It just didn't come up like that  you know  But to be fair  chemical engineers as a group haven't really earned a reputation over the centuries for being alcoholic manic depressives. We writers  we kind of do have that reputation  and not just writers  but creative people across all genres  it seems  have this reputation for being enormously mentally unstable. And all you have to do is look at the very grim death count in the   th century alone  of really magnificent creative minds who died young and often at their own hands  you know  And even the ones who didn't literally commit suicide seem to be really undone by their gifts  you know. Norman Mailer  just before he died  last interview  he said   Every one of my books has killed me a little more.  An extraordinary statement to make about your life's work. But we don't even blink when we hear somebody say this  because we've heard that kind of stuff for so long and somehow we've completely internalized and accepted collectively this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inherently linked and that artistry  in the end  will always ultimately lead to anguish. And the question that I want to ask everybody here today is are you guys all cool with that idea  Are you comfortable with that  Because you look at it even from an inch away and  you know    I'm not at all comfortable with that assumption. I think it's odious. And I also think it's dangerous  and I don't want to see it perpetuated into the next century. I think it's better if we encourage our great creative minds to live. And I definitely know that  in my case    in my situation    it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of leaking down that dark path of assumption  particularly given the circumstance that I'm in right now in my career. Which is    you know  like check it out  I'm pretty young  I'm only about    years old. I still have maybe another four decades of work left in me. And it's exceedingly likely that anything I write from this point forward is going to be judged by the world as the work that came after the freakish success of my last book  right  I should just put it bluntly  because we're all sort of friends here now    it's exceedingly likely that my greatest success is behind me. So Jesus  what a thought  That's the kind of thought that could lead a person to start drinking gin at nine o'clock in the morning  and I don't want to go there. I would prefer to keep doing this work that I love. And so  the question becomes  how  And so  it seems to me  upon a lot of reflection  that the way that I have to work now  in order to continue writing  is that I have to create some sort of protective psychological construct  right  I have to sort of find some way to have a safe distance between me  as I am writing  and my very natural anxiety about what the reaction to that writing is going to be  from now on. And  as I've been looking  over the last year  for models for how to do that  I've been sort of looking across time  and I've been trying to find other societies to see if they might have had better and saner ideas than we have about how to help creative people sort of manage the inherent emotional risks of creativity. And that search has led me to ancient Greece and ancient Rome. So stay with me  because it does circle around and back. But  ancient Greece and ancient Rome    people did not happen to believe that creativity came from human beings back then  OK  People believed that creativity was this divine attendant spirit that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source  for distant and unknowable reasons. The Greeks famously called these divine attendant spirits of creativity  daemons.  Socrates  famously  believed that he had a daemon who spoke wisdom to him from afar. The Romans had the same idea  but they called that sort of disembodied creative spirit a genius. Which is great  because the Romans did not actually think that a genius was a particularly clever individual. They believed that a genius was this  sort of magical divine entity  who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist's studio  kind of like Dobby the house elf  and who would come out and sort of invisibly assist the artist with their work and would shape the outcome of that work. So brilliant    there it is  right there  that distance that I'm talking about    that psychological construct to protect you from the results of your work. And everyone knew that this is how it functioned  right  So the ancient artist was protected from certain things  like  for example  too much narcissism  right  If your work was brilliant  you couldn't take all the credit for it  everybody knew that you had this disembodied genius who had helped you. If your work bombed  not entirely your fault  you know  Everyone knew your genius was kind of lame. And this is how people thought about creativity in the West for a really long time. And then the Renaissance came and everything changed  and we had this big idea  and the big idea was  let's put the individual human being at the center of the universe above all gods and mysteries  and there's no more room for mystical creatures who take dictation from the divine. And it's the beginning of rational humanism  and people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual. And for the first time in history  you start to hear people referring to this or that artist as being a genius  rather than having a genius. And I got to tell you  I think that was a huge error. You know  I think that allowing somebody  one mere person to believe that he or she is like  the vessel  you know  like the font and the essence and the source of all divine  creative  unknowable  eternal mystery is just a smidge too much responsibility to put on one fragile  human psyche. It's like asking somebody to swallow the sun. It just completely warps and distorts egos  and it creates all these unmanageable expectations about performance. And I think the pressure of that has been killing off our artists for the last     years. And  if this is true  and I think it is true  the question becomes  what now  Can we do this differently  Maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative mystery. Maybe not. Maybe we can't just erase     years of rational humanistic thought in one    minute speech. And there's probably people in this audience who would raise really legitimate scientific suspicions about the notion of  basically  fairies who follow people around rubbing fairy juice on their projects and stuff. I'm not  probably  going to bring you all along with me on this. But the question that I kind of want to pose is    you know  why not  Why not think about it this way  Because it makes as much sense as anything else I have ever heard in terms of explaining the utter maddening capriciousness of the creative process. A process which  as anybody who has ever tried to make something    which is to say basically everyone here     knows does not always behave rationally. And  in fact  can sometimes feel downright paranormal. I had this encounter recently where I met the extraordinary American poet Ruth Stone  who's now in her   s  but she's been a poet her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in rural Virginia  she would be out working in the fields  and she said she would feel and hear a poem coming at her from over the landscape. And she said it was like a thunderous train of air. And it would come barreling down at her over the landscape. And she felt it coming  because it would shake the earth under her feet. She knew that she had only one thing to do at that point  and that was to  in her words   run like hell.  And she would run like hell to the house and she would be getting chased by this poem  and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pencil fast enough so that when it thundered through her  she could collect it and grab it on the page. And other times she wouldn't be fast enough  so she'd be running and running  and she wouldn't get to the house and the poem would barrel through her and she would miss it and she said it would continue on across the landscape  looking  as she put it  for another poet.  And then there were these times    this is the piece I never forgot    she said that there were moments where she would almost miss it  right  So  she's running to the house and she's looking for the paper and the poem passes through her  and she grabs a pencil just as it's going through her  and then she said  it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it. She would catch the poem by its tail  and she would pull it backwards into her body as she was transcribing on the page. And in these instances  the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact but backwards  from the last word to the first. So when I heard that I was like    that's uncanny  that's exactly what my creative process is like. That's not at all what my creative process is    I'm not the pipeline  I'm a mule  and the way that I have to work is I have to get up at the same time every day  and sweat and labor and barrel through it really awkwardly. But even I  in my mulishness  even I have brushed up against that thing  at times. And I would imagine that a lot of you have too. You know  even I have had work or ideas come through me from a source that I honestly cannot identify. And what is that thing  And how are we to relate to it in a way that will not make us lose our minds  but  in fact  might actually keep us sane  And for me  the best contemporary example that I have of how to do that is the musician Tom Waits  who I got to interview several years ago on a magazine assignment. And we were talking about this  and you know  Tom  for most of his life  he was pretty much the embodiment of the tormented contemporary modern artist  trying to control and manage and dominate these sort of uncontrollable creative impulses that were totally internalized. But then he got older  he got calmer  and one day he was driving down the freeway in Los Angeles  and this is when it all changed for him. And he's speeding along  and all of a sudden he hears this little fragment of melody  that comes into his head as inspiration often comes  elusive and tantalizing  and he wants it  it's gorgeous  and he longs for it  but he has no way to get it. He doesn't have a piece of paper  or a pencil  or a tape recorder. So he starts to feel all of that old anxiety start to rise in him like   I'm going to lose this thing  and I'll be be haunted by this song forever. I'm not good enough  and I can't do it.  And instead of panicking  he just stopped. He just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely novel. He just looked up at the sky  and he said   Excuse me  can you not see that I'm driving    Do I look like I can write down a song right now  If you really want to exist  come back at a more opportune moment when I can take care of you. Otherwise  go bother somebody else today. Go bother Leonard Cohen.  And his whole work process changed after that. Not the work  the work was still oftentimes as dark as ever. But the process  and the heavy anxiety around it was released when he took the genie  the genius out of him where it was causing nothing but trouble  and released it back where it came from  and realized that this didn't have to be this internalized  tormented thing. It could be this peculiar  wondrous  bizarre collaboration  kind of conversation between Tom and the strange  external thing that was not quite Tom. When I heard that story  it started to shift a little bit the way that I worked too  and this idea already saved me once. It saved me when I was in the middle of writing  Eat  Pray  Love   and I fell into one of those sort of pits of despair that we all fall into when we're working on something and it's not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disaster  the worst book ever written. Not just bad  but the worst book ever written. And I started to think I should just dump this project. But then I remembered Tom talking to the open air and I tried it. So I just lifted my face up from the manuscript and I directed my comments to an empty corner of the room. And I said aloud   Listen you  thing  you and I both know that if this book isn't brilliant that is not entirely my fault  right  Because you can see that I am putting everything I have into this  I don't have any more than this. If you want it to be better  you've got to show up and do your part of the deal. But if you don't do that  you know what  the hell with it. I'm going to keep writing anyway because that's my job. And I would please like the record to reflect today that I showed up for my part of the job.  Because    Because in the end it's like this  OK    centuries ago in the deserts of North Africa  people used to gather for these moonlight dances of sacred dance and music that would go on for hours and hours  until dawn. They were always magnificent  because the dancers were professionals and they were terrific  right  But every once in a while  very rarely  something would happen  and one of these performers would actually become transcendent. And I know you know what I'm talking about  because I know you've all seen  at some point in your life  a performance like this. It was like time would stop  and the dancer would sort of step through some kind of portal and he wasn't doing anything different than he had ever done        nights before  but everything would align. And all of a sudden  he would no longer appear to be merely human. He would be lit from within  and lit from below and all lit up on fire with divinity. And when this happened  back then  people knew it for what it was  you know  they called it by its name. They would put their hands together and they would start to chant   Allah  Allah  Allah  God  God  God.  That's God  you know. Curious historical footnote  when the Moors invaded southern Spain  they took this custom with them and the pronunciation changed over the centuries from  Allah  Allah  Allah   to  Ol   ol   ol    which you still hear in bullfights and in flamenco dances. In Spain  when a performer has done something impossible and magic   Allah  ol   ol   Allah  magnificent  bravo   incomprehensible  there it is    a glimpse of God. Which is great  because we need that. But  the tricky bit comes the next morning  for the dancer himself  when he wakes up and discovers that it's Tuesday at    a.m.  and he's no longer a glimpse of God. He's just an aging mortal with really bad knees  and maybe he's never going to ascend to that height again. And maybe nobody will ever chant God's name again as he spins  and what is he then to do with the rest of his life  This is hard. This is one of the most painful reconciliations to make in a creative life. But maybe it doesn't have to be quite so full of anguish if you never happened to believe  in the first place  that the most extraordinary aspects of your being came from you. But maybe if you just believed that they were on loan to you from some unimaginable source for some exquisite portion of your life to be passed along when you're finished  with somebody else. And  you know  if we think about it this way  it starts to change everything. This is how I've started to think  and this is certainly how I've been thinking in the last few months as I've been working on the book that will soon be published  as the dangerously  frighteningly over anticipated follow up to my freakish success. And what I have to sort of keep telling myself when I get really psyched out about that is don't be afraid. Don't be daunted. Just do your job. Continue to show up for your piece of it  whatever that might be. If your job is to dance  do your dance. If the divine  cockeyed genius assigned to your case decides to let some sort of wonderment be glimpsed  for just one moment through your efforts  then  Ol    And if not  do your dance anyhow. And  Ol    to you  nonetheless. I believe this and I feel that we must teach it.  Ol    to you  nonetheless  just for having the sheer human love and stubbornness to keep showing up. Thank you. Thank you. June Cohen  Ol   'Theme and variations' is one of those forms that require a certain kind of intellectual activity  because you are always comparing the variation with the theme that you hold in your mind. You might say that the theme is nature and everything that follows is a variation on the subject. I was asked  I guess about six years ago  to do a series of paintings that in some way would celebrate the birth of Piero della Francesca. And it was very difficult for me to imagine how to paint pictures that were based on Piero until I realized that I could look at Piero as nature    that I would have the same attitude towards looking at Piero della Francesca as I would if I were looking out a window at a tree. And that was enormously liberating to me. Perhaps it's not a very insightful observation  but that really started me on a path to be able to do a kind of theme and variations based on a work by Piero  in this case that remarkable painting that's in the Uffizi   The Duke of Montefeltro   who faces his consort  Battista. Once I realized that I could take some liberties with the subject  I did the following series of drawings. That's the real Piero della Francesca    one of the greatest portraits in human history. And these  I'll just show these without comment. It's just a series of variations on the head of the Duke of Montefeltro  who's a great  great figure in the Renaissance  and probably the basis for Machiavelli's  The Prince.  He apparently lost an eye in battle  which is why he is always shown in profile. And this is Battista. And then I decided I could move them around a little bit    so that for the first time in history  they're facing the same direction. Whoops  Passed each other. And then a visitor from another painting by Piero  this is from  The Resurrection of Christ     as though the cast had just gotten of the set to have a chat. And now  four large panels  this is upper left  upper right  lower left  lower right. Incidentally  I've never understood the conflict between abstraction and naturalism. Since all paintings are inherently abstract to begin with there doesn't seem to be an argument there. On another subject    I was driving in the country one day with my wife  and I saw this sign  and I said   That is a fabulous piece of design.  And she said   What are you talking about   I said   Well  it's so persuasive  because the purpose of that sign is to get you into the garage  and since most people are so suspicious of garages  and know that they're going to be ripped off  they use the word 'reliable.' But everybody says they're reliable. But  reliable Dutchman      Fantastic   Because as soon as you hear the word Dutchman    which is an archaic word  nobody calls Dutch people  Dutchmen  anymore    but as soon as you hear Dutchman  you get this picture of the kid with his finger in the dike  preventing the thing from falling and flooding Holland  and so on. And so the entire issue is detoxified by the use of  Dutchman.  Now  if you think I'm exaggerating at all in this  all you have to do is substitute something else  like  Indonesian.  Or even  French.  Now   Swiss  works  but you know it's going to cost a lot of money. I'm going to take you quickly through the actual process of doing a poster. I do a lot of work for the School of Visual Arts  where I teach  and the director of this school    a remarkable man named Silas Rhodes    often gives you a piece of text and he says   Do something with this.  And so he did. And this was the text     In words as fashion the same rule will hold  Alike fantastic if too new or old  Be not the first by whom the new are tried  Nor yet the last to lay the old aside.  I could make nothing of that. And I really struggled with this one. And the first thing I did  which was sort of in the absence of another idea  was say I'll sort of write it out and make some words big  and I'll have some kind of design on the back somehow  and I was hoping    as one often does    to stumble into something. So I took another crack at it    you've got to keep it moving    and I Xeroxed some words on pieces of colored paper and I pasted them down on an ugly board. I thought that something would come out of it  like  Words rule fantastic new old first last Pope  because it's by Alexander Pope  but I sort of made a mess out of it  and then I thought I'd repeat it in some way so it was legible. So  it was going nowhere. Sometimes  in the middle of a resistant problem  I write down things that I know about it. But you can see the beginning of an idea there  because you can see the word  new  emerging from the  old.  That's what happens. There's a relationship between the old and the new  the new emerges from the context of the old. And then I did some variations of it  but it still wasn't coalescing graphically at all. I had this other version which had something interesting about it in terms of being able to put it together in your mind from clues. The W was clearly a W  the N was clearly an N  even though they were very fragmentary and there wasn't a lot of information in it. Then I got the words  new  and  old  and now I had regressed back to a point where there seemed to be no return. I was really desperate at this point. And so  I do something I'm truthfully ashamed of  which is that I took two drawings I had made for another purpose and I put them together. It says  dreams  at the top. And I was going to do a thing  I say   Well  change the copy. Let it say something about dreams  and come to SVA and you'll sort of fulfill your dreams.  But  to my credit  I was so embarrassed about doing that that I never submitted this sketch. And  finally  I arrived at the following solution. Now  it doesn't look terribly interesting  but it does have something that distinguishes it from a lot of other posters. For one thing  it transgresses the idea of what a poster's supposed to be  which is to be understood and seen immediately  and not explained. I remember hearing all of you in the graphic arts     If you have to explain it  it ain't working.  And one day I woke up and I said   Well  suppose that's not true   So here's what it says in my explanation at the bottom left. It says   Thoughts  This poem is impossible. Silas usually has a better touch with his choice of quotations. This one generates no imagery at all.  I am now exposing myself to my audience  right  Which is something you never want to do professionally.  Maybe the words can make the image without anything else happening. What's the heart of this poem  Don't be trendy if you want to be serious. Is doing the poster this way trendy in itself  I guess one could reduce the idea further by suggesting that the new emerges behind and through the old  like this.  And then I show you a little drawing    you see  you remember that old thing I discarded  Well  I found a way to use it. So  there's that little alternative over there  and I say   Not bad      criticizing myself     but more didactic than visual. Maybe what wants to be said is that old and the new are locked in a dialectical embrace  a kind of dance where each defines the other.  And then more self questioning     Am I being simple minded  Is this the kind of simple that looks obvious  or the kind that looks profound  There's a significant difference. This could be embarrassing. Actually  I realize fear of embarrassment drives me as much as any ambition. Do you think this sort of thing could really attract a student to the school   Well  I think there are two fresh things here    two fresh things. One is the sort of willingness to expose myself to a critical audience  and not to suggest that I am confident about what I'm doing. And as you know  you have to have a front. I mean    you've got to be confident  if you don't believe in your work  who else is going to believe in it  So that's one thing  to introduce the idea of doubt into graphics. That can be a big contribution. The other thing is to actually give you two solutions for the price of one  you get the big one and if you don't like that  how about the little one  And that too is a relatively new idea. And here's just a series of experiments where I ask the question of    does a poster have to be square  Now  this is a little illusion. That poster is not folded. It's not folded  that's a photograph and it's cut on the diagonal. Same cheap trick in the upper left hand corner. And here  a very peculiar poster because  simply because of using the isometric perspective in the computer  it won't sit still in the space. At times  it seems to be wider at the back than the front  and then it shifts. And if you sit here long enough  it'll float off the page into the audience. But  we don't have time. And then an experiment    a little bit about the nature of perspective  where the outside shape is determined by the peculiarity of perspective  but the shape of the bottle    which is identical to the outside shape    is seen frontally. And another piece for the art directors' club is  Anna Rees  casting long shadows. This is another poster from the School of Visual Arts. There were    artists invited to participate in it  and it was one of those things where it was extremely competitive and I didn't want to be embarrassed  so I worked very hard on this. The idea was    and it was a brilliant idea    was to have    posters distributed throughout the city's subway system so every time you got on the subway you'd be passing a different poster  all of which had a different idea of what art is. But I was absolutely stuck on the idea of  art is  and trying to determine what art was. But then I gave up and I said   Well  art is whatever.  And as soon as I said that  I discovered that the word  hat  was hidden in the word  whatever   and that led me to the inevitable conclusion. But then again  it's on my list of didactic posters. My intent is to have a literary accompaniment that explains the poster  in case you don't get it. Now this says   Note to the viewer  I thought I might use a visual cliche of our time    Magritte's everyman    to express the idea that art is mystery  continuity and history. I'm also convinced that  in an age of computer manipulation  surrealism has become banal  a shadow of its former self. The phrase 'Art is whatever' expresses the current inclusiveness that surrounds art making    a sort of 'it ain't what you do  it's the way that you do it' notion. The shadow of Magritte falls across the central part of the poster a poetic event that occurs as the shadow man isolates the word 'hat ' hidden in the word 'whatever.' The four hats shown in the poster suggests how art might be defined  as a thing itself  the worth of the thing  the shadow of the thing  and the shape of the thing. Whatever.  OK. And the one that I did not submit  which I still like  I wanted to use the same phrase. There were wonderful experiments by Bruno Munari on letterforms some years ago    sort of  see how far you could go and still be able to read them. And that idea stuck in my head. But then I took the pieces that I had taken off and put them at the bottom. And  of course those are the remains  and they're so labeled. But what really happens is that you read it as   Art is whatever remains.  Thank you. I want to start out by asking you to think back to when you were a kid  playing with blocks. As you figured out how to reach out and grasp  pick them up and move them around  you were actually learning how to think and solve problems by understanding and manipulating spatial relationships. Spatial reasoning is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of the world around us. So  as a computer scientist inspired by this utility of our interactions with physical objects    along with my adviser Pattie  and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi    I started to wonder    what if when we used a computer  instead of having this one mouse cursor that was a like a digital fingertip moving around a flat desktop  what if we could reach in with both hands and grasp information physically  arranging it the way we wanted  This question was so compelling that we decided to explore the answer  by building Siftables. In a nutshell  a Siftable is an interactive computer the size of a cookie. They're able to be moved around by hand  they can sense each other  they can sense their motion  and they have a screen and a wireless radio. Most importantly  they're physical  so like the blocks  you can move them just by reaching out and grasping. And Siftables are an example of a new ecosystem of tools for manipulating digital information. And as these tools become more physical  more aware of their motion  aware of each other  and aware of the nuance of how we move them  we can start to explore some new and fun interaction styles. So  I'm going to start with some simple examples. This Siftable is configured to show video  and if I tilt it in one direction  it'll roll the video this way  if I tilt it the other way it rolls it backwards. And these interactive portraits are aware of each other. So if I put them next to each other  they get interested. If they get surrounded  they notice that too  they might get a little flustered. And they can also sense their motion and tilt. One of the interesting implications on interaction  we started to realize  was that we could use everyday gestures on data  like pouring a color the way we might pour a liquid. So in this case  we've got three Siftables configured to be paint buckets and I can use them to pour color into that central one  where they get mixed. If we overshoot  we can pour a little bit back. There are also some neat possibilities for education  like language  math and logic games where we want to give people the ability to try things quickly  and view the results immediately. So here I'm    This is a Fibonacci sequence that I'm making with a simple equation program. Here we have a word game that's kind of like a mash up between Scrabble and Boggle. Basically  in every round you get a randomly assigned letter on each Siftable  and as you try to make words it checks against a dictionary. Then  after about    seconds  it reshuffles  and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try. Thank you. So these are some kids that came on a field trip to the Media Lab  and I managed to get them to try it out  and shoot a video. They really loved it. And  one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don't have to give people many instructions. All you have to say is   Make words   and they know exactly what to do. So here's another few people trying it out. That's our youngest beta tester  down there on the right. Turns out  all he wanted to do was to stack the Siftables up. So to him  they were just blocks. Now  this is an interactive cartoon application. And we wanted to build a learning tool for language learners. And this is Felix  actually. And he can bring new characters into the scene  just by lifting the Siftables off the table that have that character shown on them. Here  he's bringing the sun out. Video  The sun is rising. David Merrill  Now he's brought a tractor into the scene. Video  The orange tractor. Good job  Yeah  DM  So by shaking the Siftables and putting them next to each other he can make the characters interact    Video  Woof  DM  inventing his own narrative. Video  Hello  DM  It's an open ended story  and he gets to decide how it unfolds. Video  Fly away  cat. DM  So  the last example I have time to show you today is a music sequencing and live performance tool that we've built recently  in which Siftables act as sounds like lead  bass and drums. Each of these has four different variations  you get to choose which one you want to use. And you can inject these sounds into a sequence that you can assemble into the pattern that you want. And you inject it by just bumping up the sound Siftable against a sequence Siftable. There are effects that you can control live  like reverb and filter. You attach it to a particular sound and then tilt to adjust it. And then  overall effects like tempo and volume that apply to the entire sequence. So let's have a look. Video   Music  DM  We'll start by putting a lead into two sequence Siftables  arrange them into a series  extend it  add a little more lead. Now I put a bass line in. Video   Music  DM  Now I'll put some percussion in. Video   Music  DM  And now I'll attach the filter to the drums  so I can control the effect live. Video   Music  DM  I can speed up the whole sequence by tilting the tempo one way or the other. Video   Music  DM  And now I'll attach the filter to the bass for some more expression. Video   Music  DM  I can rearrange the sequence while it plays. So I don't have to plan it out in advance  but I can improvise  making it longer or shorter as I go. And now  finally  I can fade the whole sequence out using the volume Siftable  tilted to the left. Thank you. So  as you can see  my passion is for making new human computer interfaces that are a better match to the ways our brains and bodies work. And today  I had time to show you one point in this new design space  and a few of the possibilities that we're working to bring out of the laboratory. So the thought I want to leave you with is that we're on the cusp of this new generation of tools for interacting with digital media that are going to bring information into our world on our terms. Thank you very much. I look forward to talking with all of you. In his inaugural address  Barack Obama appealed to each of us to give our best as we try to extricate ourselves from this current financial crisis. But what did he appeal to  He did not  happily  follow in the footsteps of his predecessor  and tell us to just go shopping. Nor did he tell us   Trust us. Trust your country. Invest  invest  invest.  Instead  what he told us was to put aside childish things. And he appealed to virtue. Virtue is an old fashioned word. It seems a little out of place in a cutting edge environment like this one. And besides  some of you might be wondering  what the hell does it mean  Let me begin with an example. This is the job description of a hospital janitor that is scrolling up on the screen. And all of the items on it are unremarkable. They're the things you would expect  mop the floors  sweep them  empty the trash  restock the cabinets. It may be a little surprising how many things there are  but it's not surprising what they are. But the one thing I want you to notice about them is this  even though this is a very long list  there isn't a single thing on it that involves other human beings. Not one. The janitor's job could just as well be done in a mortuary as in a hospital. And yet  when some psychologists interviewed hospital janitors to get a sense of what they thought their jobs were like  they encountered Mike  who told them about how he stopped mopping the floor because Mr. Jones was out of his bed getting a little exercise  trying to build up his strength  walking slowly up and down the hall. And Charlene told them about how she ignored her supervisor's admonition and didn't vacuum the visitor's lounge because there were some family members who were there all day  every day who  at this moment  happened to be taking a nap. And then there was Luke  who washed the floor in a comatose young man's room twice because the man's father  who had been keeping a vigil for six months  didn't see Luke do it the first time  and his father was angry. And behavior like this from janitors  from technicians  from nurses and  if we're lucky now and then  from doctors  doesn't just make people feel a little better  it actually improves the quality of patient care and enables hospitals to run well. Now  not all janitors are like this  of course. But the ones who are think that these sorts of human interactions involving kindness  care and empathy are an essential part of the job. And yet their job description contains not one word about other human beings. These janitors have the moral will to do right by other people. And beyond this  they have the moral skill to figure out what  doing right  means.  Practical wisdom   Aristotle told us   is the combination of moral will and moral skill.  A wise person knows when and how to make the exception to every rule  as the janitors knew when to ignore the job duties in the service of other objectives. A wise person knows how to improvise  as Luke did when he re washed the floor. Real world problems are often ambiguous and ill defined and the context is always changing. A wise person is like a jazz musician    using the notes on the page  but dancing around them  inventing combinations that are appropriate for the situation and the people at hand. A wise person knows how to use these moral skills in the service of the right aims. To serve other people  not to manipulate other people. And finally  perhaps most important  a wise person is made  not born. Wisdom depends on experience  and not just any experience. You need the time to get to know the people that you're serving. You need permission to be allowed to improvise  try new things  occasionally to fail and to learn from your failures. And you need to be mentored by wise teachers. When you ask the janitors who behaved like the ones I described how hard it is to learn to do their job  they tell you that it takes lots of experience. And they don't mean it takes lots of experience to learn how to mop floors and empty trash cans. It takes lots of experience to learn how to care for people. At TED  brilliance is rampant. It's scary. The good news is you don't need to be brilliant to be wise. The bad news is that without wisdom  brilliance isn't enough. It's as likely to get you and other people into trouble as anything else. Now  I hope that we all know this. There's a sense in which it's obvious  and yet  let me tell you a little story. It's a story about lemonade. A dad and his seven year old son were watching a Detroit Tigers game at the ballpark. His son asked him for some lemonade and Dad went to the concession stand to buy it. All they had was Mike's Hard Lemonade  which was five percent alcohol. Dad  being an academic  had no idea that Mike's Hard Lemonade contained alcohol. So he brought it back. And the kid was drinking it  and a security guard spotted it  and called the police  who called an ambulance that rushed to the ballpark  whisked the kid to the hospital. The emergency room ascertained that the kid had no alcohol in his blood. And they were ready to let the kid go. But not so fast. The Wayne County Child Welfare Protection Agency said no. And the child was sent to a foster home for three days. At that point  can the child go home  Well  a judge said yes  but only if the dad leaves the house and checks into a motel. After two weeks  I'm happy to report  the family was reunited. But the welfare workers and the ambulance people and the judge all said the same thing   We hate to do it but we have to follow procedure.  How do things like this happen  Scott Simon  who told this story on NPR  said   Rules and procedures may be dumb  but they spare you from thinking.  And  to be fair  rules are often imposed because previous officials have been lax and they let a child go back to an abusive household. Fair enough. When things go wrong  as of course they do  we reach for two tools to try to fix them. One tool we reach for is rules. Better ones  more of them. The second tool we reach for is incentives. Better ones  more of them. What else  after all  is there  We can certainly see this in response to the current financial crisis. Regulate  regulate  regulate. Fix the incentives  fix the incentives  fix the incentives ... The truth is that neither rules nor incentives are enough to do the job. How could you even write a rule that got the janitors to do what they did  And would you pay them a bonus for being empathic  It's preposterous on its face. And what happens is that as we turn increasingly to rules  rules and incentives may make things better in the short run  but they create a downward spiral that makes them worse in the long run. Moral skill is chipped away by an over reliance on rules that deprives us of the opportunity to improvise and learn from our improvisations. And moral will is undermined by an incessant appeal to incentives that destroy our desire to do the right thing. And without intending it  by appealing to rules and incentives  we are engaging in a war on wisdom. Let me just give you a few examples  first of rules and the war on moral skill. The lemonade story is one. Second  no doubt more familiar to you  is the nature of modern American education  scripted  lock step curricula. Here's an example from Chicago kindergarten. Reading and enjoying literature and words that begin with 'B.'  The Bath   Assemble students on a rug and give students a warning about the dangers of hot water. Say    items in this script to teach a    page picture book. All over Chicago in every kindergarten class in the city  every teacher is saying the same words in the same way on the same day. We know why these scripts are there. We don't trust the judgment of teachers enough to let them loose on their own. Scripts like these are insurance policies against disaster. And they prevent disaster. But what they assure in its place is mediocrity. Don't get me wrong. We need rules  Jazz musicians need some notes    most of them need some notes on the page. We need more rules for the bankers  God knows. But too many rules prevent accomplished jazz musicians from improvising. And as a result  they lose their gifts  or worse  they stop playing altogether. Now  how about incentives  They seem cleverer. If you have one reason for doing something and I give you a second reason for doing the same thing  it seems only logical that two reasons are better than one and you're more likely to do it. Right  Well  not always. Sometimes two reasons to do the same thing seem to compete with one another instead of complimenting  and they make people less likely to do it. I'll just give you one example because time is racing. In Switzerland  back about    years ago  they were trying to decide where to site nuclear waste dumps. There was going to be a national referendum. Some psychologists went around and polled citizens who were very well informed. And they said   Would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community   Astonishingly     percent of the citizens said yes. They knew it was dangerous. They thought it would reduce their property values. But it had to go somewhere and they had responsibilities as citizens. The psychologists asked other people a slightly different question. They said   If we paid you six weeks' salary every year would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community   Two reasons. It's my responsibility and I'm getting paid. Instead of    percent saying yes     percent said yes. What happens is that the second this introduction of incentive gets us so that instead of asking   What is my responsibility   all we ask is   What serves my interests   When incentives don't work  when CEOs ignore the long term health of their companies in pursuit of short term gains that will lead to massive bonuses  the response is always the same. Get smarter incentives. The truth is that there are no incentives that you can devise that are ever going to be smart enough. Any incentive system can be subverted by bad will. We need incentives. People have to make a living. But excessive reliance on incentives demoralizes professional activity in two senses of that word. It causes people who engage in that activity to lose morale and it causes the activity itself to lose morality. Barack Obama said  before he was inaugurated   We must ask not just 'Is it profitable ' but 'Is it right '  And when professions are demoralized  everyone in them becomes dependent on    addicted to    incentives and they stop asking  Is it right   We see this in medicine. And we certainly see it in the world of business. It is obvious that this is not the way people want to do their work. So what can we do  A few sources of hope  we ought to try to re moralize work. One way not to do it  teach more ethics courses. There is no better way to show people that you're not serious than to tie up everything you have to say about ethics into a little package with a bow and consign it to the margins as an ethics course. What to do instead  One  Celebrate moral exemplars. Acknowledge  when you go to law school  that a little voice is whispering in your ear about Atticus Finch. No    year old goes to law school to do mergers and acquisitions. People are inspired by moral heroes. But we learn that with sophistication comes the understanding that you can't acknowledge that you have moral heroes. Well  acknowledge them. Be proud that you have them. Celebrate them. And demand that the people who teach you acknowledge them and celebrate them too. That's one thing we can do. I don't know how many of you remember this  another moral hero     years ago  Aaron Feuerstein  who was the head of Malden Mills in Massachusetts    they made Polartec    The factory burned down.       employees. He kept every one of them on the payroll. Why  Because it would have been a disaster for them and for the community if he had let them go.  Maybe on paper our company is worth less to Wall Street  but I can tell you it's worth more. We're doing fine.  Just at this TED we heard talks from several moral heroes. Two were particularly inspiring to me. One was Ray Anderson  who turned       turned  you know  a part of the evil empire into a zero footprint  or almost zero footprint business. Why  Because it was the right thing to do. And a bonus he's discovering is he's actually going to make even more money. His employees are inspired by the effort. Why  Because there happy to be doing something that's the right thing to do. Yesterday we heard Willie Smits talk about re foresting in Indonesia. In many ways this is the perfect example. Because it took the will to do the right thing. God knows it took a huge amount of technical skill. I'm boggled at how much he and his associates needed to know in order to plot this out. But most important to make it work    and he emphasized this    is that it took knowing the people in the communities. Unless the people you're working with are behind you  this will fail. And there isn't a formula to tell you how to get the people behind you  because different people in different communities organize their lives in different ways. So there's a lot here at TED  and at other places  to celebrate. And you don't have to be a mega hero. There are ordinary heroes. Ordinary heroes like the janitors who are worth celebrating too. As practitioners each and every one of us should strive to be ordinary  if not extraordinary heroes. As heads of organizations  we should strive to create environments that encourage and nurture both moral skill and moral will. Even the wisest and most well meaning people will give up if they have to swim against the current in the organizations in which they work. If you run an organization  you should be sure that none of the jobs    none of the jobs    have job descriptions like the job descriptions of the janitors. Because the truth is that any work that you do that involves interaction with other people is moral work. And any moral work depends upon practical wisdom. And  perhaps most important  as teachers  we should strive to be the ordinary heroes  the moral exemplars  to the people we mentor. And there are a few things that we have to remember as teachers. One is that we are always teaching. Someone is always watching. The camera is always on. Bill Gates talked about the importance of education and  in particular  the model that KIPP was providing   Knowledge is power.  And he talked about a lot of the wonderful things that KIPP is doing to take inner city kids and turn them in the direction of college. I want to focus on one particular thing KIPP is doing that Bill didn't mention. That is that they have come to the realization that the single most important thing kids need to learn is character. They need to learn to respect themselves. They need to learn to respect their schoolmates. They need to learn to respect their teachers. And  most important  they need to learn to respect learning. That's the principle objective. If you do that  the rest is just pretty much a coast downhill. And the teachers  the way you teach these things to the kids is by having the teachers and all the other staff embody it every minute of every day. Obama appealed to virtue. And I think he was right. And the virtue I think we need above all others is practical wisdom  because it's what allows other virtues    honesty  kindness  courage and so on    to be displayed at the right time and in the right way. He also appealed to hope. Right again. I think there is reason for hope. I think people want to be allowed to be virtuous. In many ways  it's what TED is all about. Wanting to do the right thing in the right way for the right reasons. This kind of wisdom is within the grasp of each and every one of us if only we start paying attention. Paying attention to what we do  to how we do it  and  perhaps most importantly  to the structure of the organizations within which we work  so as to make sure that it enables us and other people to develop wisdom rather than having it suppressed. Thank you very much. Thank you. Chris Anderson  You have to go and stand out here a sec. Barry Schwartz  Thank you very much. There's a great big elephant in the room called the economy. So let's start talking about that. I wanted to give you a current picture of the economy. That's what I have behind myself. But of course what we have to remember is this. And what you have to think about is  when you're dancing in the flames  what's next  So what I'm going to try to do in the next    and a half minutes is I'm going to talk first about the flames    where we are in the economy    and then I'm going to take three trends that have taken place at TED over the last    years and that will take place in this conference and I will try and bring them together. And I will try and give you a sense of what the ultimate reboot looks like. Those three trends are the ability to engineer cells  the ability to engineer tissues  and robots. And somehow it will all make sense. But anyway  let's start with the economy. There's a couple of really big problems that are still sitting there. One is leverage. And the problem with leverage is it makes the U.S. financial system look like this. So  a normal commercial bank has nine to    times leverage. That means for every dollar you deposit  it loans out about nine or   . A normal investment bank is not a deposit bank  it's an investment bank  it has    to    times. It turns out that B of A in September had    times. And your friendly Citibank had    times. Oops. That means every bad loan goes bad    times over. And that  of course  is the reason why all of you are making such generous and wonderful donations to these nice folks. And as you think about that  you've got to wonder  so what do banks have in store for you now  It ain't pretty. The government  meanwhile  has been acting like Santa Claus. We all love Santa Claus  right  But the problem with Santa Clause is  if you look at the mandatory spending of what these folks have been doing and promising folks  it turned out that in          percent was mandatory spending on what we call  entitlements.  And then by      it was    percent. And we weren't supposed to run into     percent until about     . Except we've been so busy giving away a trillion here  a trillion there  that we've brought that date of reckoning forward to about     . And we thought we were going to be able to lay these debts off on our kids  but  guess what  We're going to start to pay them. And the problem with this stuff is  now that the bill's come due  it turns out Santa isn't quite as cute when it's summertime. Right  Here's some advice from one of the largest investors in the United States. This guy runs the China Investment Corporation. He is the main buyer of U.S. Treasury bonds. And he gave an interview in December. Here's his first bit of advice. And here's his second bit of advice. And  by the way  the Chinese Prime Minister reiterated this at Davos last Sunday. This stuff is getting serious enough that if we don't start paying attention to the deficit  we're going to end up losing the dollar. And then all bets are off. Let me show you what it looks like. I think I can safely say that I'm the only trillionaire in this room. This is an actual bill. And it's    triliion dollars. The only problem with this bill is it's not really worth very much. That was eight bucks last week  four bucks this week  a buck next week. And that's what happens to currencies when you don't stand behind them. So the next time somebody as cute as this shows up on your doorstep  and sometimes this creature's called Chrysler and sometimes Ford and sometimes ... whatever you want    you've just got to say no. And you've got to start banishing a word that's called  entitlement.  And the reason we have to do that in the short term is because we have just run out of cash. If you look at the federal budget  this is what it looks like. The orange slice is what's discretionary. Everything else is mandated. It makes no difference if we cut out the bridges to Alaska in the overall scheme of things. So what we have to start thinking about doing is capping our medical spending because that's a monster that's simply going to eat the entire budget. We've got to start thinking about asking people to retire a little bit later. If you're    to    you retire on time. Your     k  just got nailed. If you're    to    we want you to work two years more. If you're under    we want you to work four more years. The reason why that's reasonable is  when your grandparents were given Social Security  they got it at    and were expected to check out at   . Sixty eight is young today. We've also got to cut the military about three percent a year. We've got to limit other mandatory spending. We've got to quit borrowing as much  because otherwise the interest is going to eat that whole pie. And we've got to end up with a smaller government. And if we don't start changing this trend line  we are going to lose the dollar and start to look like Iceland. I got what you're thinking. This is going to happen when hell freezes over. But let me remind you this December it did snow in Vegas. Here's what happens if you don't address this stuff. So  Japan had a fiscal real estate crisis back in the late '  s. And its     largest companies today are worth one quarter of what they were    years ago. We don't fix this now  how would you like to see a Dow       in       Because that's the consequence of not dealing with this stuff. And unless you want this person to not just become the CFO of Florida  but the United States  we'd better deal with this stuff. That's the short term. That's the flame part. That's the financial crisis. Now  right behind the financial crisis there's a second and bigger wave that we need to talk about. That wave is much larger  much more powerful  and that's of course the wave of technology. And what's really important in this stuff is  as we cut  we also have to grow. Among other things  because startup companies are .   percent of U.S. GDP investmentm and they're about   .  percent of output. It's groups like that in this room that generate the future of the U.S. economy. And that's what we've got to keep growing. We don't have to keep growing these bridges to nowhere. So let's bring a romance novelist into this conversation. And that's where these three trends come together. That's where the ability to engineer microbes  the ability to engineer tissues  and the ability to engineer robots begin to lead to a reboot. And let me recap some of the stuff you've seen. Craig Venter showed up last year and showed you the first fully programmable cell that acts like hardware where you can insert DNA and have it boot up as a different species. In parallel  the folks at MIT have been building a standard registry of biological parts. So think of it as a Radio Shack for biology. You can go out and get your proteins  your RNA  your DNA  whatever. And start building stuff. In      they brought together high school students and college students and started to build these little odd creatures. They just happened to be alive instead of circuit boards. Here was one of the first things they built. So  cells have this cycle. First they don't grow. Then they grow exponentially. Then they stop growing. Graduate students wanted a way of telling which stage they were in. So they engineered these cells so that when they're growing in the exponential phase  they would smell like wintergreen. And when they stopped growing they would smell like bananas. And you could tell very easily when your experiment was working and wasn't  and where it was in the phase. This got a bit more complicated two years later. Twenty one countries came together. Dozens of teams. They started competing. The team from Rice University started to engineer the substance in red wine that makes red wine good for you into beer. So you take resveratrol and you put it into beer. Of course  one of the judges is wandering by  and he goes   Wow  Cancer fighting beer  There is a God.  The team from Taiwan was a little bit more ambitious. They tried to engineer bacterias in such a way that they would act as your kidneys. Four years ago  I showed you this picture. And people oohed and ahhed  because Cliff Tabin had been able to grow an extra wing on a chicken. And that was very cool stuff back then. But now moving from bacterial engineering to tissue engineering  let me show you what's happened in that period of time. Two years ago  you saw this creature. An almost extinct animal from Xochimilco  Mexico called an axolotl that can re generate its limbs. You can freeze half its heart. It regrows. You can freeze half the brain. It regrows. It's almost like leaving Congress. But now  you don't have to have the animal itself to regenerate  because you can build cloned mice molars in Petri dishes. And  of course if you can build mice molars in Petri dishes  you can grow human molars in Petri dishes. This should not surprise you  right  I mean  you're born with no teeth. You give away all your teeth to the tooth fairy. You re grow a set of teeth. But then if you lose one of those second set of teeth  they don't regrow  unless  if you're a lawyer. But  of course  for most of us  we know how to grow teeth  and therefore we can take adult stem teeth  put them on a biodegradable mold  re grow a tooth  and simply implant it. And we can do it with other things. So  a Spanish woman who was dying of T.B. had a donor trachea  they took all the cells off the trachea  they spraypainted her stem cells onto that cartilage. She regrew her own trachea  and    hours later it was implanted. She's now running around with her kids. This is going on in Tony Atala's lab in Wake Forest where he is re growing ears for injured soldiers  and he's also re growing bladders. So there are now nine women walking around Boston with re grown bladders  which is much more pleasant than walking around with a whole bunch of plastic bags for the rest of your life. This is kind of getting boring  right  I mean  you understand where this story's going. But  I mean it gets more interesting. Last year  this group was able to take all the cells off a heart  leaving just the cartilage. Then  they sprayed stem cells onto that heart  from a mouse. Those stem cells self organized  and that heart started to beat. Life happens. This may be one of the ultimate papers. This was done in Japan and in the U.S.  published at the same time  and it rebooted skin cells into stem cells  last year. That meant that you can take the stuff right here  and turn it into almost anything in your body. And this is becoming common  it's moving very quickly  it's moving in a whole series of places. Third trend  robots. Those of us of a certain age grew up expecting that by now we would have Rosie the Robot from  The Jetsons  in our house. And all we've got is a Roomba. We also thought we'd have this robot to warn us of danger. Didn't happen. And these were robots engineered for a flat world  right  So  Rosie runs around on skates and the other one ran on flat threads. If you don't have a flat world  that's not good  which is why the robot's we're designing today are a little different. This is Boston Dynamics'  BigDog.  And this is about as close as you can get to a physical Turing test. O.K.  so let me remind you  a Turing test is where you've got a wall  you're talking to somebody on the other side of the wall  and when you don't know if that thing is human or animal    that's when computers have reached human intelligence. This is not an intelligence Turing rest  but this is as close as you can get to a physical Turing test. And this stuff is moving very quickly  and by the way  that thing can carry about     pounds of weight. These are not the only interesting robots. You've also got flies  the size of flies  that are being made by Robert Wood at Harvard. You've got Stickybots that are being made at Stanford. And as you bring these things together  as you bring cells  biological tissue engineering and mechanics together  you begin to get some really odd questions. In the last Olympics  this gentleman  who had several world records in the Special Olympics  tried to run in the normal Olympics. The only issue with Oscar Pistorius is he was born without bones in the lower part of his legs. He came within about a second of qualifying. He sued to be allowed to run  and he won the suit  but didn't qualify by time. Next Olympics  you can bet that Oscar  or one of Oscar's successors  is going to make the time. And two or three Olympics after that  they are going to be unbeatable. And as you bring these trends together  and as you think of what it means to take people who are profoundly deaf  who can now begin to hear    I mean  remember the evolution of hearing aids  right  I mean  your grandparents had these great big cones  and then your parents had these odd boxes that would squawk at odd times during dinner  and now we have these little buds that nobody sees. And now you have cochlear implants that go into people's heads and allow the deaf to begin to hear. Now  they can't hear as well as you and I can. But  in    or    machine generations they will  and these are machine generations  not human generations. And about two or three years after they can hear as well as you and I can  they'll be able to hear maybe how bats sing  or how whales talk  or how dogs talk  and other types of tonal scales. They'll be able to focus their hearing  they'll be able to increase the sensitivity  decrease the sensitivity  do a series of things that we can't do. And the same thing is happening in eyes. This is a group in Germany that's beginning to engineer eyes so that people who are blind can begin to see light and dark. Very primitive. And then they'll be able to see shape. And then they'll be able to see color  and then they'll be able to see in definition  and one day  they'll see as well as you and I can. And a couple of years after that  they'll be able to see in ultraviolet  they'll be able to see in infrared  they'll be able to focus their eyes  they'll be able to come into a microfocus. They'll do stuff you and I can't do. All of these things are coming together  and it's a particularly important thing to understand  as we worry about the flames of the present  to keep an eye on the future. And  of course  the future is looking back     years  because next week is the    th anniversary of Darwin's birth. And it's the    th anniversary of the publication of  The Origin of Species.  And Darwin  of course  argued that evolution is a natural state. It is a natural state in everything that is alive  including hominids. There have actually been    species of hominids that have been around  have evolved  have wandered in different places  have gone extinct. It is common for hominids to evolve. And that's the reason why  as you look at the hominid fossil record  erectus  and heidelbergensis  and floresiensis  and Neanderthals  and Homo sapiens  all overlap. The common state of affairs is to have overlapping versions of hominids  not one. And as you think of the implications of that  here's a brief history of the universe. The universe was created   .  billion years ago  and then you created all the stars  and all the planets  and all the galaxies  and all the Milky Ways. And then you created Earth about  .  billion years ago  and then you got life about four billion years ago  and then you got hominids about  .    billion years ago  and then you got our version of hominids about  .     billion years ago. Ta dah  Maybe the reason for thr creation of the universe  and all the galaxies  and all the planets  and all the energy  and all the dark energy  and all the rest of stuff is to create what's in this room. Maybe not. That would be a mildly arrogant viewpoint. So  if that's not the purpose of the universe  then what's next  I think what we're going to see is we're going to see a different species of hominid. I think we're going to move from a Homo sapiens into a Homo evolutis. And I think this isn't       years out. I think most of us are going to glance at it  and our grandchildren are going to begin to live it. And a Homo evolutis brings together these three trends into a hominid that takes direct and deliberate control over the evolution of his species  her species and other species. And that  of course  would be the ultimate reboot. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Let's now see the extraordinary speech that we captured a couple weeks ago. Jose Antonio Abreu  My dear friends  ladies and gentlemen  I am overjoyed today at being awarded the TED Prize on behalf of all the distinguished music teachers  artists and educators from Venezuela who have selflessly and loyally accompanied me for    years in founding  growing and developing in Venezuela the National System of Youth and Children's Orchestras and Choirs. Since I was a boy  in my early childhood  I always wanted to be a musician  and  thank God  I made it. From my teachers  my family and my community  I had all the necessary support to become a musician. All my life I've dreamed that all Venezuelan children have the same opportunity that I had. From that desire and from my heart stemmed the idea to make music a deep and global reality for my country. From the very first rehearsal  I saw the bright future ahead. Because the rehearsal meant a great challenge to me. I had received a donation of    music stands to be used by     boys in that rehearsal. When I arrived at the rehearsal  only    kids had shown up  and I said to myself   Do I close the program or multiply these kids   I decided to face the challenge  and on that same night  I promised those    children I'd turn our orchestra into one of the leading orchestras in the world. Two months ago  I remembered that promise I made  when a distinguished English critic published an article in the London Times  asking who could be the winner of the Orchestra World Cup. He mentioned four great world orchestras  and the fifth one was Venezuela's Youth Symphony Orchestra. Today we can say that art in Latin America is no longer a monopoly of elites and that it has become a social right  a right for all the people. Child  There is no difference here between classes  nor white or black  nor if you have money or not. Simply  if you are talented  if you have the vocation and the will to be here  you get in. You share with us and make music. JA  During the recent tour by the Simon Bolivar Youth Orchestra of Venezuela of U.S. and Europe  we saw how our music moved young audiences to the bottom of their souls  how children and adolescents rushed up to the stage to receive the jackets from our musicians  how the standing ovations  sometimes    minutes long  seemed to last forever  and how the public  after the concert was over  went out into the street to greet our young people in triumph. This meant not only an artistic triumph  but also a profound emotional sympathy between the public of the most advanced nations of the world and the musical youth of Latin America  as seen in Venezuela  giving these audiences a message of music  vitality  energy  enthusiasm and strength. In its essence  the orchestra and the choir are much more than artistic structures. They are examples and schools of social life  because to sing and to play together means to intimately coexist toward perfection and excellence  following a strict discipline of organization and coordination in order to seek the harmonic interdependence of voices and instruments. That's how they build a spirit of solidarity and fraternity among them  develop their self esteem and foster the ethical and aesthetical values related to the music in all its senses. This is why music is immensely important in the awakening of sensibility  in the forging of values and in the training of youngsters to teach other kids. Child  After all this time here  music is life. Nothing else. Music is life. JA  Each teenager and child in El Sistema has his own story  and they are all important and of great significance to me. Let me mention the case of Edicson Ruiz. He is a boy from a parish in Caracas who passionately attended to his double bass lessons at the San Agustin's Junior Orchestra. With his effort  and the support of his mother  his family and his community  he became a principal member in the double bass segment of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. We have another well known case    Gustavo Dudamel. He started as a boy member of the children's orchestra in his hometown  Barquisimeto. There  he grew as a violinist and as a conductor. He became the conductor of Venezuela's junior orchestras  and today conducts the world's greatest orchestras. He is the musical director of Los Angeles Philharmonic  and is still the overall leader of Venezuela's junior orchestras. He was the conductor of the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra  and he's an unbeatable example for young musicians in Latin America and the world. The structure of El Sistema is based on a new and flexible managing style adapted to the features of each community and region  and today attends to         children of the lower and middle class all over Venezuela. It's a program of social rescue and deep cultural transformation designed for the whole Venezuelan society with absolutely no distinctions whatsoever  but emphasizing the vulnerable and endangered social groups. The effect of El Sistema is felt in three fundamental circles  in the personal social circle  in the family circle and in the community. In the personal social circle  the children in the orchestras and choirs develop their intellectual and emotional side. The music becomes a source for developing the dimensions of the human being  thus elevating the spirit and leading man to a full development of his personality. So  the emotional and intellectual profits are huge    the acquisition of leadership  teaching and training principles  the sense of commitment  responsibility  generosity and dedication to others  and the individual contribution to achieve great collective goals. All this leads to the development of self esteem and confidence. Mother Teresa of Calcutta insisted on something that always impressed me  the most miserable and tragic thing about poverty is not the lack of bread or roof  but the feeling of being no one    the feeling of not being anyone  the lack of identification  the lack of public esteem. That's why the child's development in the orchestra and the choir provides him with a noble identity and makes him a role model for his family and community. It makes him a better student at school because it inspires in him a sense of responsibility  perseverance and punctuality that will greatly help him at school. Within the family  the parents' support is unconditional. The child becomes a role model for both his parents  and this is very important for a poor child. Once the child discovers he is important to his family  he begins to seek new ways of improving himself and hopes better for himself and his community. Also  he hopes for social and economic improvements for his own family. All this makes up a constructive and ascending social dynamic. The large majority of our children belong  as I already mentioned  to the most vulnerable strata of the Venezuelan population. That encourages them to embrace new dreams  new goals  and progress in the various opportunities that music has to offer. Finally  in the circle of the community  the orchestras prove to be the creative spaces of culture and sources of exchange and new meanings. The spontaneity music has excludes it as a luxury item and makes it a patrimony of society. It's what makes a child play a violin at home  while his father works in his carpentry. It's what makes a little girl play the clarinet at home  while her mother does the housework. The idea is that the families join with pride and joy in the activities of the orchestras and the choirs that their children belong to. The huge spiritual world that music produces in itself  which also lies within itself  ends up overcoming material poverty. From the minute a child's taught how to play an instrument  he's no longer poor. He becomes a child in progress heading for a professional level  who'll later become a full citizen. Needless to say that music is the number one prevention against prostitution  violence  bad habits  and everything degrading in the life of a child. A few years ago  historian Arnold Toynbee said that the world was suffering a huge spiritual crisis. Not an economic or social crisis  but a spiritual one. I believe that to confront such a crisis  only art and religion can give proper answers to humanity  to mankind's deepest aspirations  and to the historic demands of our times. Education    the synthesis of wisdom and knowledge    is the means to strive for a more perfect  more aware  more noble and more just society. With passion and enthusiasm we pay profound respects to TED for its outstanding humanism  the scope of its principles  for its open and generous promotion of young values. We hope that TED can contribute in a full and fundamental way to the building of this new era in the teaching of music  in which the social  communal  spiritual and vindicatory aims of the child and the adolescent become a beacon and a goal for a vast social mission. No longer putting society at the service of art  and much less at the services of monopolies of the elite  but instead art at the service of society  at the service of the weakest  at the service of the children  at the service of the sick  at the service of the vulnerable  and at the service of all those who cry for vindication through the spirit of their human condition and the raising up of their dignity. CA  We are going live now to Caracas. We are going live to Caracas to hear Maestro Abreu's TED Prize wish. JA  Here is my TED Prize wish  I wish that you'll help to create and document a special training program for    gifted young musicians  passionate about their art and social justice  and dedicated to bringing El Sistema to the United States and other countries. Thank you very much. Fifty years ago  when I began exploring the ocean  no one    not Jacques Perrin  not Jacques Cousteau or Rachel Carson    imagined that we could do anything to harm the ocean by what we put into it or by what we took out of it. It seemed  at that time  to be a sea of Eden  but now we know  and now we are facing paradise lost. I want to share with you my personal view of changes in the sea that affect all of us  and to consider why it matters that in    years  we've lost    actually  we've taken  we've eaten    more than    percent of the big fish in the sea  why you should care that nearly half of the coral reefs have disappeared  why a mysterious depletion of oxygen in large areas of the Pacific should concern not only the creatures that are dying  but it really should concern you. It does concern you  as well. I'm haunted by the thought of what Ray Anderson calls  tomorrow's child   asking why we didn't do something on our watch to save sharks and bluefin tuna and squids and coral reefs and the living ocean while there still was time. Well  now is that time. I hope for your help to explore and protect the wild ocean in ways that will restore the health and  in so doing  secure hope for humankind. Health to the ocean means health for us. And I hope Jill Tarter's wish to engage Earthlings includes dolphins and whales and other sea creatures in this quest to find intelligent life elsewhere in the universe. And I hope  Jill  that someday we will find evidence that there is intelligent life among humans on this planet. Did I say that  I guess I did. For me  as a scientist  it all began in      when I first tried scuba. It's when I first got to know fish swimming in something other than lemon slices and butter. I actually love diving at night  you see a lot of fish then that you don't see in the daytime. Diving day and night was really easy for me in       when I led a team of aquanauts living underwater for weeks at a time    at the same time that astronauts were putting their footprints on the moon. In      I had a chance to put my footprints on the ocean floor while using this personal submersible called Jim. It was six miles offshore and       feet down. It's one of my favorite bathing suits. Since then  I've used about    kinds of submarines and I've started three companies and a nonprofit foundation called Deep Search to design and build systems to access the deep sea. I led a five year National Geographic expedition  the Sustainable Seas expeditions  using these little subs. They're so simple to drive that even a scientist can do it. And I'm living proof. Astronauts and aquanauts alike really appreciate the importance of air  food  water  temperature    all the things you need to stay alive in space or under the sea. I heard astronaut Joe Allen explain how he had to learn everything he could about his life support system and then do everything he could to take care of his life support system  and then he pointed to this and he said   Life support system.  We need to learn everything we can about it and do everything we can to take care of it. The poet Auden said   Thousands have lived without love  none without water.  Ninety seven percent of Earth's water is ocean. No blue  no green. If you think the ocean isn't important  imagine Earth without it. Mars comes to mind. No ocean  no life support system. I gave a talk not so long ago at the World Bank and I showed this amazing image of Earth and I said   There it is  The World Bank   That's where all the assets are  And we've been trawling them down much faster than the natural systems can replenish them. Tim Worth says the economy is a wholly owned subsidiary of the environment. With every drop of water you drink  every breath you take  you're connected to the sea. No matter where on Earth you live. Most of the oxygen in the atmosphere is generated by the sea. Over time  most of the planet's organic carbon has been absorbed and stored there  mostly by microbes. The ocean drives climate and weather  stabilizes temperature  shapes Earth's chemistry. Water from the sea forms clouds that return to the land and the seas as rain  sleet and snow  and provides home for about    percent of life in the world  maybe in the universe. No water  no life  no blue  no green. Yet we have this idea  we humans  that the Earth    all of it  the oceans  the skies    are so vast and so resilient it doesn't matter what we do to it. That may have been true        years ago  and maybe even       years ago but in the last      especially in the last     we've drawn down the assets  the air  the water  the wildlife that make our lives possible. New technologies are helping us to understand the nature of nature  the nature of what's happening  showing us our impact on the Earth. I mean  first you have to know that you've got a problem. And fortunately  in our time  we've learned more about the problems than in all preceding history. And with knowing comes caring. And with caring  there's hope that we can find an enduring place for ourselves within the natural systems that support us. But first we have to know. Three years ago  I met John Hanke  who's the head of Google Earth  and I told him how much I loved being able to hold the world in my hands and go exploring vicariously. But I asked him   When are you going to finish it  You did a great job with the land  the dirt. What about the water   Since then  I've had the great pleasure of working with the Googlers  with DOER Marine  with National Geographic  with dozens of the best institutions and scientists around the world  ones that we could enlist  to put the ocean in Google Earth. And as of just this week  last Monday  Google Earth is now whole. Consider this  Starting right here at the convention center  we can find the nearby aquarium  we can look at where we're sitting  and then we can cruise up the coast to the big aquarium  the ocean  and California's four national marine sanctuaries  and the new network of state marine reserves that are beginning to protect and restore some of the assets We can flit over to Hawaii and see the real Hawaiian Islands  not just the little bit that pokes through the surface  but also what's below. To see    wait a minute  we can go kshhplash     right there  ha    under the ocean  see what the whales see. We can go explore the other side of the Hawaiian Islands. We can go actually and swim around on Google Earth and visit with humpback whales. These are the gentle giants that I've had the pleasure of meeting face to face many times underwater. There's nothing quite like being personally inspected by a whale. We can pick up and fly to the deepest place  seven miles down  the Mariana Trench  where only two people have ever been. Imagine that. It's only seven miles  but only two people have been there     years ago. One way trips are easy. We need new deep diving submarines. How about some X Prizes for ocean exploration  We need to see deep trenches  the undersea mountains  and understand life in the deep sea. We can now go to the Arctic. Just ten years ago I stood on the ice at the North Pole. An ice free Arctic Ocean may happen in this century. That's bad news for the polar bears. That's bad news for us too. Excess carbon dioxide is not only driving global warming  it's also changing ocean chemistry  making the sea more acidic. That's bad news for coral reefs and oxygen producing plankton. Also it's bad news for us. We're putting hundreds of millions of tons of plastic and other trash into the sea. Millions of tons of discarded fishing nets  gear that continues to kill. We're clogging the ocean  poisoning the planet's circulatory system  and we're taking out hundreds of millions of tons of wildlife  all carbon based units. Barbarically  we're killing sharks for shark fin soup  undermining food chains that shape planetary chemistry and drive the carbon cycle  the nitrogen cycle  the oxygen cycle  the water cycle    our life support system. We're still killing bluefin tuna  truly endangered and much more valuable alive than dead. All of these parts are part of our life support system. We kill using long lines  with baited hooks every few feet that may stretch for    miles or more. Industrial trawlers and draggers are scraping the sea floor like bulldozers  taking everything in their path. Using Google Earth you can witness trawlers    in China  the North Sea  the Gulf of Mexico    shaking the foundation of our life support system  leaving plumes of death in their path. The next time you dine on sushi    or sashimi  or swordfish steak  or shrimp cocktail  whatever wildlife you happen to enjoy from the ocean    think of the real cost. For every pound that goes to market  more than    pounds  even     pounds  may be thrown away as bycatch. This is the consequence of not knowing that there are limits to what we can take out of the sea. This chart shows the decline in ocean wildlife from      to     . The highest concentrations are in red. In my lifetime  imagine     percent of the big fish have been killed. Most of the turtles  sharks  tunas and whales are way down in numbers. But  there is good news. Ten percent of the big fish still remain. There are still some blue whales. There are still some krill in Antarctica. There are a few oysters in Chesapeake Bay. Half the coral reefs are still in pretty good shape  a jeweled belt around the middle of the planet. There's still time  but not a lot  to turn things around. But business as usual means that in    years  there may be no coral reefs    and no commercial fishing  because the fish will simply be gone. Imagine the ocean without fish. Imagine what that means to our life support system. Natural systems on the land are in big trouble too  but the problems are more obvious  and some actions are being taken to protect trees  watersheds and wildlife. And in       with Yellowstone National Park  the United States began establishing a system of parks that some say was the best idea America ever had. About    percent of the land around the world is now protected  safeguarding biodiversity  providing a carbon sink  generating oxygen  protecting watersheds. And  in       this nation began to establish a counterpart in the sea  National Marine Sanctuaries. That's another great idea. The good news is that there are now more than       places in the sea  around the world  that have some kind of protection. And you can find them on Google Earth. The bad news is that you have to look hard to find them. In the last three years  for example  the U.S. protected         square miles of ocean as national monuments. But it only increased from  .  of one percent to  .  of one percent of the ocean protected  globally. Protected areas do rebound  but it takes a long time to restore    year old rockfish or monkfish  sharks or sea bass  or     year old orange roughy. We don't consume     year old cows or chickens. Protected areas provide hope that the creatures of Ed Wilson's dream of an encyclopedia of life  or the census of marine life  will live not just as a list  a photograph  or a paragraph. With scientists around the world  I've been looking at the    percent of the ocean that is open to fishing    and mining  and drilling  and dumping  and whatever    to search out hope spots  and try to find ways to give them and us a secure future. Such as the Arctic    we have one chance  right now  to get it right. Or the Antarctic  where the continent is protected  but the surrounding ocean is being stripped of its krill  whales and fish. Sargasso Sea's three million square miles of floating forest is being gathered up to feed cows.    percent of the land in the Galapagos Islands is protected  but the adjacent sea is being ravaged by fishing. It's true too in Argentina on the Patagonian shelf  which is now in serious trouble. The high seas  where whales  tuna and dolphins travel    the largest  least protected  ecosystem on Earth  filled with luminous creatures  living in dark waters that average two miles deep. They flash  and sparkle  and glow with their own living light. There are still places in the sea as pristine as I knew as a child. The next    years may be the most important  and the next        years the best chance our species will have to protect what remains of the natural systems that give us life. To cope with climate change  we need new ways to generate power. We need new ways  better ways  to cope with poverty  wars and disease. We need many things to keep and maintain the world as a better place. But  nothing else will matter if we fail to protect the ocean. Our fate and the ocean's are one. We need to do for the ocean what Al Gore did for the skies above. A global plan of action with a world conservation union  the IUCN  is underway to protect biodiversity  to mitigate and recover from the impacts of climate change  on the high seas and in coastal areas  wherever we can identify critical places. New technologies are needed to map  photograph and explore the    percent of the ocean that we have yet to see. The goal is to protect biodiversity  to provide stability and resilience. We need deep diving subs  new technologies to explore the ocean. We need  maybe  an expedition    a TED at sea    that could help figure out the next steps. And so  I suppose you want to know what my wish is. I wish you would use all means at your disposal    films  expeditions  the web  new submarines    and campaign to ignite public support for a global network of marine protected areas    hope spots large enough to save and restore the ocean  the blue heart of the planet. How much  Some say    percent  some say    percent. You decide  how much of your heart do you want to protect  Whatever it is  a fraction of one percent is not enough. My wish is a big wish  but if we can make it happen  it can truly change the world  and help ensure the survival of what actually    as it turns out    is my favorite species  that would be us. For the children of today  for tomorrow's child  as never again  now is the time. Thank you. So  my question  are we alone  The story of humans is the story of ideas    scientific ideas that shine light into dark corners  ideas that we embrace rationally and irrationally  ideas for which we've lived and died and killed and been killed  ideas that have vanished in history  and ideas that have been set in dogma. It's a story of nations  of ideologies  of territories  and of conflicts among them. But  every moment of human history  from the Stone Age to the Information Age  from Sumer and Babylon to the iPod and celebrity gossip  they've all been carried out    every book that you've read  every poem  every laugh  every tear    they've all happened here. Here. Here. Here. Perspective is a very powerful thing. Perspectives can change. Perspectives can be altered. From my perspective  we live on a fragile island of life  in a universe of possibilities. For many millennia  humans have been on a journey to find answers  answers to questions about naturalism and transcendence  about who we are and why we are  and of course  who else might be out there. Is it really just us  Are we alone in this vast universe of energy and matter and chemistry and physics  Well  if we are  it's an awful waste of space. But  what if we're not  What if  out there  others are asking and answering similar questions  What if they look up at the night sky  at the same stars  but from the opposite side  Would the discovery of an older cultural civilization out there inspire us to find ways to survive our increasingly uncertain technological adolescence  Might it be the discovery of a distant civilization and our common cosmic origins that finally drives home the message of the bond among all humans  Whether we're born in San Francisco  or Sudan  or close to the heart of the Milky Way galaxy  we are the products of a billion year lineage of wandering stardust. We  all of us  are what happens when a primordial mixture of hydrogen and helium evolves for so long that it begins to ask where it came from. Fifty years ago  the journey to find answers took a different path and SETI  the Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence  began. So  what exactly is SETI  Well  SETI uses the tools of astronomy to try and find evidence of someone else's technology out there. Our own technologies are visible over interstellar distances  and theirs might be as well. It might be that some massive network of communications  or some shield against asteroidal impact  or some huge astro engineering project that we can't even begin to conceive of  could generate signals at radio or optical frequencies that a determined program of searching might detect. For millennia  we've actually turned to the priests and the philosophers for guidance and instruction on this question of whether there's intelligent life out there. Now  we can use the tools of the   st century to try and observe what is  rather than ask what should be  believed. SETI doesn't presume the existence of extra terrestrial intelligence  it merely notes the possibility  if not the probability in this vast universe  which seems fairly uniform. The numbers suggest a universe of possibilities. Our sun is one of     billion stars in our galaxy  and we know that many other stars have planetary systems. We've discovered over     in the last    years  including the small planet  announced earlier this week  which has a radius just twice the size of the Earth. And  if even all of the planetary systems in our galaxy were devoid of life  there are still     billion other galaxies out there  altogether       stars. Now  I'm going to try a trick  and recreate an experiment from this morning. Remember  one billion  But  this time not one billion dollars  one billion stars. Alright  one billion stars. Now  up there     feet above the stage  that's    trillion. Well  what about        Where's the line that marks that  That line would have to be  .  million miles above this stage.    times farther away than the moon  or four percent of the distance to the sun. So  there are many possibilities. And much of this vast universe  much more may be habitable than we once thought  as we study extremophiles on Earth    organisms that can live in conditions totally inhospitable for us  in the hot  high pressure thermal vents at the bottom of the ocean  frozen in ice  in boiling battery acid  in the cooling waters of nuclear reactors. These extremophiles tell us that life may exist in many other environments. But those environments are going to be widely spaced in this universe. Even our nearest star  the Sun    its emissions suffer the tyranny of light speed. It takes a full eight minutes for its radiation to reach us. And the nearest star is  .  light years away  which means its light takes  .  years to get here. And the edge of our galaxy is        light years away  and the nearest galaxy to us   .  million light years. That means any signal we detect would have started its journey a long time ago. And a signal would give us a glimpse of their past  not their present. Which is why Phil Morrison calls SETI   the archaeology of the future.  It tells us about their past  but detection of a signal tells us it's possible for us to have a long future. I think this is what David Deutsch meant in       when he ended his Oxford TEDTalk by saying he had two principles he'd like to share for living  and he would like to carve them on stone tablets. The first is that problems are inevitable. The second is that problems are soluble. So  ultimately what's going to determine the success or failure of SETI is the longevity of technologies  and the mean distance between technologies in the cosmos    distance over space and distance over time. If technologies don't last and persist  we will not succeed. And we're a very young technology in an old galaxy  and we don't yet know whether it's possible for technologies to persist. So  up until now I've been talking to you about really large numbers. Let me talk about a relatively small number. And that's the length of time that the Earth was lifeless. Zircons that are mined in the Jack Hills of western Australia  zircons taken from the Jack Hills of western Australia tell us that within a few hundred million years of the origin of the planet there was abundant water and perhaps even life. So  our planet has spent the vast majority of its  .   billion year history developing life  not anticipating its emergence. Life happened very quickly  and that bodes well for the potential of life elsewhere in the cosmos. And the other thing that one should take away from this chart is the very narrow range of time over which humans can claim to be the dominant intelligence on the planet. It's only the last few hundred thousand years modern humans have been pursuing technology and civilization. So  one needs a very deep appreciation of the diversity and incredible scale of life on this planet as the first step in preparing to make contact with life elsewhere in the cosmos. We are not the pinnacle of evolution. We are not the determined product of billions of years of evolutionary plotting and planning. We are one outcome of a continuing adaptational process. We are residents of one small planet in a corner of the Milky Way galaxy. And Homo sapiens are one small leaf on a very extensive Tree of Life  which is densely populated by organisms that have been honed for survival over millions of years. We misuse language  and talk about the  ascent  of man. We understand the scientific basis for the interrelatedness of life but our ego hasn't caught up yet. So this  ascent  of man  pinnacle of evolution  has got to go. It's a sense of privilege that the natural universe doesn't share. Loren Eiseley has said   One does not meet oneself until one catches the reflection from an eye other than human.  One day that eye may be that of an intelligent alien  and the sooner we eschew our narrow view of evolution the sooner we can truly explore our ultimate origins and destinations. We are a small part of the story of cosmic evolution  and we are going to be responsible for our continued participation in that story  and perhaps SETI will help as well. Occasionally  throughout history  this concept of this very large cosmic perspective comes to the surface  and as a result we see transformative and profound discoveries. So in       Nicholas Copernicus published  The Revolutions of Heavenly Spheres   and by taking the Earth out of the center  and putting the sun in the center of the solar system  he opened our eyes to a much larger universe  of which we are just a small part. And that Copernican revolution continues today to influence science and philosophy and technology and theology. So  in       Giuseppe Coccone and Philip Morrison published the first SETI article in a refereed journal  and brought SETI into the scientific mainstream. And in       Frank Drake conducted the first SETI observation looking at two stars  Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani  for about     hours. Now Drake did not discover extraterrestrial intelligence  but he learned a very valuable lesson from a passing aircraft  and that's that terrestrial technology can interfere with the search for extraterrestrial technology. We've been searching ever since  but it's impossible to overstate the magnitude of the search that remains. All of the concerted SETI efforts  over the last    some years  are equivalent to scooping a single glass of water from the oceans. And no one would decide that the ocean was without fish on the basis of one glass of water. The   st century now allows us to build bigger glasses    much bigger glasses. In Northern California  we're beginning to take observations with the first    telescopes of the Allen Telescope Array    and I've got to take a moment right now to publicly thank Paul Allen and Nathan Myhrvold and all the TeamSETI members in the TED community who have so generously supported this research. The ATA is the first telescope built from a large number of small dishes  and hooked together with computers. It's making silicon as important as aluminum  and we'll grow it in the future by adding more antennas to reach     for more sensitivity and leveraging Moore's law for more processing capability. Today  our signal detection algorithms can find very simple artifacts and noise. If you look very hard here you can see the signal from the Voyager   spacecraft  the most distant human object in the universe      times as far away from us as the sun is. And over those long distances  its signal is very faint when it reaches us. It may be hard for your eye to see it  but it's easily found with our efficient algorithms. But this is a simple signal  and tomorrow we want to be able to find more complex signals. This is a very good year.      is the    th anniversary of Galileo's first use of the telescope  Darwin's    th birthday  the    th anniversary of the publication of  On the Origin of Species   the   th anniversary of SETI as a science  the   th anniversary of the incorporation of the SETI Institute as a non profit  and of course  the   th anniversary of TED. And next month  the Kepler Spacecraft will launch and will begin to tell us just how frequent Earth like planets are  the targets for SETI's searches. In       the U.N. has declared it to be the International Year of Astronomy  a global festival to help us residents of Earth rediscover our cosmic origins and our place in the universe. And in       change has come to Washington  with a promise to put science in its rightful position. So  what would change everything  Well  this is the question the Edge foundation asked this year  and four of the respondents said   SETI.  Why  Well  to quote   The discovery of intelligent life beyond Earth would eradicate the loneliness and solipsism that has plagued our species since its inception. And it wouldn't simply change everything  it would change everything all at once.  So  if that's right  why did we only capture four out of those     minds  I think it's a problem of completion and delivery  because the fine print said   What game changing ideas and scientific developments would you expect to live to see   So  we have a fulfillment problem. We need bigger glasses and more hands in the water  and then working together  maybe we can all live to see the detection of the first extraterrestrial signal. That brings me to my wish. I wish that you would empower Earthlings everywhere to become active participants in the ultimate search for cosmic company. The first step would be to tap into the global brain trust  to build an environment where raw data could be stored  and where it could be accessed and manipulated  where new algorithms could be developed and old algorithms made more efficient. And this is a technically creative challenge  and it would change the perspective of people who worked on it. And then  we'd like to augment the automated search with human insight. We'd like to use the pattern recognition capability of the human eye to find faint  complex signals that our current algorithms miss. And  of course  we'd like to inspire and engage the next generation. We'd like to take the materials that we have built for education  and get them out to students everywhere  students that can't come and visit us at the ATA. We'd like to tell our story better  and engage young people  and thereby change their perspective. I'm sorry Seth Godin  but over the millennia  we've seen where tribalism leads. We've seen what happens when we divide an already small planet into smaller islands. And  ultimately  we actually all belong to only one tribe  to Earthlings. And SETI is a mirror    a mirror that can show us ourselves from an extraordinary perspective  and can help to trivialize the differences among us. If SETI does nothing but change the perspective of humans on this planet  then it will be one of the most profound endeavors in history. So  in the opening days of       a visionary president stood on the steps of the U.S. Capitol and said   We cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass  that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve  that  as the world grows smaller  our common humanity shall reveal itself.  So  I look forward to working with the TED community to hear about your ideas about how to fulfill this wish  and in collaborating with you  hasten the day that that visionary statement can become a reality. Thank you. I'm here today representing a team of artists and technologists and filmmakers that worked together on a remarkable film project for the last four years. And along the way they created a breakthrough in computer visualization. So I want to show you a clip of the film now. Hopefully it won't stutter. And if we did our jobs well  you won't know that we were even involved. Voice  Video   I don't know how it's possible ... but you seem to have more hair. Brad Pitt  What if I told you that I wasn't getting older ... but I was getting younger than everybody else  I was born with some form of disease. Voice  What kind of disease  BP  I was born old. Man  I'm sorry. BP  No need to be. There's nothing wrong with old age. Girl  Are you sick  BP  I heard momma and Tizzy whisper  and they said I was gonna die soon. But ... maybe not. Girl  You're different than anybody I've ever met. BB  There were many changes ... some you could see  some you couldn't. Hair started growing in all sorts of places  along with other things. I felt pretty good  considering. Ed Ulbrich  That was a clip from  The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.  Many of you  maybe you've seen it or you've heard of the story  but what you might not know is that for nearly the first hour of the film  the main character  Benjamin Button  who's played by Brad Pitt  is completely computer generated from the neck up. Now  there's no use of prosthetic makeup or photography of Brad superimposed over another actor's body. We've created a completely digital human head. So I'd like to start with a little bit of history on the project. This is based on an F. Scott Fitzgerald short story. It's about a man who's born old and lives his life in reverse. Now  this movie has floated around Hollywood for well over half a century  and we first got involved with the project in the early '  s  with Ron Howard as the director. We took a lot of meetings and we seriously considered it. But at the time we had to throw in the towel. It was deemed impossible. It was beyond the technology of the day to depict a man aging backwards. The human form  in particular the human head  has been considered the Holy Grail of our industry. The project came back to us about a decade later  and this time with a director named David Fincher. Now  Fincher is an interesting guy. David is fearless of technology  and he is absolutely tenacious. And David won't take  no.  And David believed  like we do in the visual effects industry  that anything is possible as long as you have enough time  resources and  of course  money. And so David had an interesting take on the film  and he threw a challenge at us. He wanted the main character of the film to be played from the cradle to the grave by one actor. It happened to be this guy. We went through a process of elimination and a process of discovery with David  and we ruled out  of course  swapping actors. That was one idea  that we would have different actors  and we would hand off from actor to actor. We even ruled out the idea of using makeup. We realized that prosthetic makeup just wouldn't hold up  particularly in close up. And makeup is an additive process. You have to build the face up. And David wanted to carve deeply into Brad's face to bring the aging to this character. He needed to be a very sympathetic character. So we decided to cast a series of little people that would play the different bodies of Benjamin at the different increments of his life and that we would in fact create a computer generated version of Brad's head  aged to appear as Benjamin  and attach that to the body of the real actor. Sounded great. Of course  this was the Holy Grail of our industry  and the fact that this guy is a global icon didn't help either  because I'm sure if any of you ever stand in line at the grocery store  you know    we see his face constantly. So there really was no tolerable margin of error. There were two studios involved  Warner Brothers and Paramount. And they both believed this would make an amazing film  of course  but it was a very high risk proposition. There was lots of money and reputations at stake. But we believed that we had a very solid methodology that might work ... But despite our verbal assurances  they wanted some proof. And so  in       they commissioned us to do a screen test of Benjamin. And we did it in about five weeks. But we used lots of cheats and shortcuts. We basically put something together to get through the meeting. I'll roll that for you now. This was the first test for Benjamin Button. And in here  you can see  that's a computer generated head    pretty good    attached to the body of an actor. And it worked. And it gave the studio great relief. After many years of starts and stops on this project  and making that tough decision  they finally decided to greenlight the movie. And I can remember  actually  when I got the phone call to congratulate us  to say the movie was a go  I actually threw up. You know  this is some tough stuff. So we started to have early team meetings  and we got everybody together  and it was really more like therapy in the beginning  convincing each other and reassuring each other that we could actually undertake this. We had to hold up an hour of a movie with a character. And it's not a special effects film  it has to be a man. We really felt like we were in a    kind of a    step program. And of course  the first step is  admit you've got a problem.  Laughter  So we had a big problem  we didn't know how we were going to do this. But we did know one thing. Being from the visual effects industry  we  with David  believed that we now had enough time  enough resources  and  God  we hoped we had enough money. And we had enough passion to will the processes and technology into existence. So  when you're faced with something like that  of course you've got to break it down. You take the big problem and you break it down into smaller pieces and you start to attack that. So we had three main areas that we had to focus on. We needed to make Brad look a lot older    needed to age him    years or so. And we also needed to make sure that we could take Brad's idiosyncrasies  his little tics  the little subtleties that make him who he is and have that translate through our process so that it appears in Benjamin on the screen. And we also needed to create a character that could hold up under  really  all conditions. He needed to be able to walk in broad daylight  at nighttime  under candlelight  he had to hold an extreme close up  he had to deliver dialogue  he had to be able to run  he had to be able to sweat  he had to be able to take a bath  to cry  he even had to throw up. Not all at the same time    but he had to  you know  do all of those things. And the work had to hold up for almost the first hour of the movie. We did about     shots. So we needed a system that would allow Benjamin to do everything a human being can do. And we realized that there was a giant chasm between the state of the art of technology in      and where we needed it to be. So we focused on motion capture. I'm sure many of you have seen motion capture. The state of the art at the time was something called marker based motion capture. I'll give you an example here. It's basically the idea of  you wear a leotard  and they put some reflective markers on your body  and instead of using cameras  there're infrared sensors around a volume  and those infrared sensors track the three dimensional position of those markers in real time. And then animators can take the data of the motion of those markers and apply them to a computer generated character. You can see the computer characters on the right are having the same complex motion as the dancers. But we also looked at numbers of other films at the time that were using facial marker tracking  and that's the idea of putting markers on the human face and doing the same process. And as you can see  it gives you a pretty crappy performance. That's not terribly compelling. And what we realized was that what we needed was the information that was going on between the markers. We needed the subtleties of the skin. We needed to see skin moving over muscle moving over bone. We needed creases and dimples and wrinkles and all of those things. Our first revelation was to completely abort and walk away from the technology of the day  the status quo  the state of the art. So we aborted using motion capture. And we were now well out of our comfort zone  and in uncharted territory. So we were left with this idea that we ended up calling  technology stew.  We started to look out in other fields. The idea was that we were going to find nuggets or gems of technology that come from other industries like medical imaging  the video game space  and re appropriate them. And we had to create kind of a sauce. And the sauce was code in software that we'd written to allow these disparate pieces of technology to come together and work as one. Initially  we came across some remarkable research done by a gentleman named Dr. Paul Ekman in the early '  s. He believed that he could  in fact  catalog the human face. And he came up with this idea of Facial Action Coding System  or FACS. He believed that there were    basic poses or shapes of the human face  and that those basic poses or shapes of the face can be combined to create infinite possibilities of everything the human face is capable of doing. And of course  these transcend age  race  culture  gender. So this became the foundation of our research as we went forward. And then we came across some remarkable technology called Contour. And here you can see a subject having phosphorus makeup stippled on her face. And now what we're looking at is really creating a surface capture as opposed to a marker capture. The subject stands in front of a computer array of cameras  and those cameras can  frame by frame  reconstruct the geometry of exactly what the subject's doing at the moment. So  effectively  you get  D data in real time of the subject. And if you look in a comparison  on the left  we see what volumetric data gives us and on the right you see what markers give us. So  clearly  we were in a substantially better place for this. But these were the early days of this technology  and it wasn't really proven yet. We measure complexity and fidelity of data in terms of polygonal count. And so  on the left  we were seeing         polygons. We could go up into the millions of polygons. It seemed to be infinite. This was when we had our  Aha   This was the breakthrough. This is when we're like   OK  we're going to be OK  This is actually going to work.  And the  Aha   was  what if we could take Brad Pitt  and we could put Brad in this device  and use this Contour process  and we could stipple on this phosphorescent makeup and put him under the black lights  and we could  in fact  scan him in real time performing Ekman's FACS poses. Right  So  effectively  we ended up with a  D database of everything Brad Pitt's face is capable of doing. From there  we actually carved up those faces into smaller pieces and components of his face. So we ended up with literally thousands and thousands and thousands of shapes  a complete database of all possibilities that his face is capable of doing. Now  that's great  except we had him at age   . We need to put another    years on him at this point. We brought in Rick Baker  and Rick is one of the great makeup and special effects gurus of our industry. And we also brought in a gentleman named Kazu Tsuji  and Kazu Tsuji is one of the great photorealist sculptors of our time. And we commissioned them to make a maquette  or a bust  of Benjamin. So  in the spirit of  The Great Unveiling     I had to do this    I had to unveil something. So this is Ben   . We created three of these  there's Ben     there's Ben     there's Ben   . And this really became the template for moving forward. Now  this was made from a life cast of Brad. So  in fact  anatomically  it is correct. The eyes  the jaw  the teeth  everything is in perfect alignment with what the real guy has. We have these maquettes scanned into the computer at very high resolution    enormous polygonal count. And so now we had three age increments of Benjamin in the computer. But we needed to get a database of him doing more than that. We went through this process  then  called retargeting. This is Brad doing one of the Ekman FACS poses. And here's the resulting data that comes from that  the model that comes from that. Retargeting is the process of transposing that data onto another model. And because the life cast  or the bust    the maquette    of Benjamin was made from Brad  we could transpose the data of Brad at    onto Brad at   . So now  we had a  D database of everything Brad Pitt's face can do at age     in his   s and in his   s. Next we had to go into the shooting process. So while all that's going on  we're down in New Orleans and locations around the world. And we shot our body actors  and we shot them wearing blue hoods. So these are the gentleman who played Benjamin. And the blue hoods helped us with two things  one  we could easily erase their heads  and we also put tracking markers on their heads so we could recreate the camera motion and the lens optics from the set. But now we needed to get Brad's performance to drive our virtual Benjamin. And so we edited the footage that was shot on location with the rest of the cast and the body actors and about six months later we brought Brad onto a sound stage in Los Angeles and he watched on the screen. His job  then  was to become Benjamin. And so we looped the scenes. He watched again and again. We encouraged him to improvise. And he took Benjamin into interesting and unusual places that we didn't think he was going to go. We shot him with four HD cameras so we'd get multiple views of him and then David would choose the take of Brad being Benjamin that he thought best matched the footage with the rest of the cast. From there we went into a process called image analysis. And so here  you can see again  the chosen take. And you are seeing  now  that data being transposed on to Ben   . And so  what's interesting about this is we used something called image analysis  which is taking timings from different components of Benjamin's face. And so we could choose  say  his left eyebrow. And the software would tell us that  well  in frame    the left eyebrow begins to move from here to here  and it concludes moving in frame   . And so we could choose numbers of positions on the face to pull that data from. And then  the sauce I talked about with our technology stew    that secret sauce was  effectively  software that allowed us to match the performance footage of Brad in live action with our database of aged Benjamin  the FACS shapes that we had. On a frame by frame basis  we could actually reconstruct a  D head that exactly matched the performance of Brad. So this was how the finished shot appeared in the film. And here you can see the body actor. And then this is what we called the  dead head   no reference to Jerry Garcia. And then here's the reconstructed performance now with the timings of the performance. And then  again  the final shot. It was a long process. The next section here  I'm going to just blast through this  because we could do a whole TEDTalk on the next several slides. We had to create a lighting system. So really  a big part of our processes was creating a lighting environment for every single location that Benjamin had to appear so that we could put Ben's head into any scene and it would exactly match the lighting that's on the other actors in the real world. We also had to create an eye system. We found the old adage  you know   The eyes are the window to the soul   absolutely true. So the key here was to keep everybody looking in Ben's eyes. And if you could feel the warmth  and feel the humanity  and feel his intent coming through the eyes  then we would succeed. So we had one person focused on the eye system for almost two full years. We also had to create a mouth system. We worked from dental molds of Brad. We had to age the teeth over time. We also had to create an articulating tongue that allowed him to enunciate his words. There was a whole system written in software to articulate the tongue. We had one person devoted to the tongue for about nine months. He was very popular. Skin displacement  another big deal. The skin had to be absolutely accurate. He's also in an old age home  he's in a nursing home around other old people  so he had to look exactly the same as the others. So  lots of work on skin deformation  you can see in some of these cases it works  in some cases it looks bad. This is a very  very  very early test in our process. So  effectively we created a digital puppet that Brad Pitt could operate with his own face. There were no animators necessary to come in and interpret behavior or enhance his performance. There was something that we encountered  though  that we ended up calling  the digital Botox effect.  So  as things went through this process  Fincher would always say   It sandblasts the edges off of the performance.  And thing our process and the technology couldn't do  is they couldn't understand intent  the intent of the actor. So it sees a smile as a smile. It doesn't recognize an ironic smile  or a happy smile  or a frustrated smile. So it did take humans to kind of push it one way or another. But we ended up calling the entire process and all the technology  emotion capture   as opposed to just motion capture. Take another look. Brad Pitt  Well  I heard momma and Tizzy whisper  and they said I was gonna die soon  but ... maybe not. EU  That's how to create a digital human in    minutes. A couple of quick factoids  it really took     people over two years  and we didn't even talk about    hairstyles and an all digital haircut. But  that is Benjamin. Thank you. Let's talk trash. You know  we had to be taught to renounce the powerful conservation ethic we developed during the Great Depression and World War II. After the war  we needed to direct our enormous production capacity toward creation of products for peacetime. Life Magazine helped in this effort by announcing the introduction of throwaways that would liberate the housewife from the drudgery of doing dishes. Mental note to the liberators  throwaway plastics take a lot of space and don't biodegrade. Only we humans make waste that nature can't digest. Plastics are also hard to recycle. A teacher told me how to express the under five percent of plastics recovered in our waste stream. It's diddly point squat. That's the percentage we recycle. Now  melting point has a lot to do with this. Plastic is not purified by the re melting process like glass and metal. It begins to melt below the boiling point of water and does not drive off the oily contaminants for which it is a sponge. Half of each year's     billion pounds of thermal plastic pellets will be made into fast track trash. A large  unruly fraction of our trash will flow downriver to the sea. Here is the accumulation at Biona Creek next to the L.A. airport. And here is the flotsam near California State University Long Beach and the diesel plant we visited yesterday. In spite of deposit fees  much of this trash leading out to the sea will be plastic beverage bottles. We use two million of them in the United States every five minutes  here imaged by TED presenter Chris Jordan  who artfully documents mass consumption and zooms in for more detail. Here is a remote island repository for bottles off the coast of Baja California. Isla San Roque is an uninhabited bird rookery off Baja's sparsely populated central coast. Notice that the bottles here have caps on them. Bottles made of polyethylene terephthalate  PET  will sink in seawater and not make it this far from civilization. Also  the caps are produced in separate factories from a different plastic  polypropylene. They will float in seawater  but unfortunately do not get recycled under the bottle bills. Let's trace the journey of the millions of caps that make it to sea solo. After a year the ones from Japan are heading straight across the Pacific  while ours get caught in the California current and first head down to the latitude of Cabo San Lucas. After ten years  a lot of the Japanese caps are in what we call the Eastern Garbage Patch  while ours litter the Philippines. After    years  we see emerging the debris accumulation zone of the North Pacific Gyre. It so happens that millions of albatross nesting on Kure and Midway atolls in the Northwest Hawaiian Islands National Monument forage here and scavenge whatever they can find for regurgitation to their chicks. A four month old Laysan Albatross chick died with this in its stomach. Hundreds of thousands of the goose sized chicks are dying with stomachs full of bottle caps and other rubbish  like cigarette lighters ... but  mostly bottle caps. Sadly  their parents mistake bottle caps for food tossing about in the ocean surface. The retainer rings for the caps also have consequences for aquatic animals. This is Mae West  still alive at a zookeeper's home in New Orleans. I wanted to see what my home town of Long Beach was contributing to the problem  so on Coastal Clean Up Day in      I went to the Long Beach Peninsula  at the east end of our long beach. We cleaned up the swaths of beach shown. I offered five cents each for bottle caps. I got plenty of takers. Here are the       bottle caps they collected. I thought I would spend    bucks. That day I ended up spending nearly   . I separated them by color and put them on display the next Earth Day at Cabrillo Marine Aquarium in San Pedro. Governor Schwarzenegger and his wife Maria stopped by to discuss the display. In spite of my  girly man  hat  crocheted from plastic shopping bags  they shook my hand.  Laughter  I showed him and Maria a zooplankton trawl from the gyre north of Hawaii with more plastic than plankton. Here's what our trawl samples from the plastic soup our ocean has become look like. Trawling a zooplankton net on the surface for a mile produces samples like this. And this. Now  when the debris washes up on the beaches of Hawaii it looks like this. And this particular beach is Kailua Beach  the beach where our president and his family vacationed before moving to Washington. Now  how do we analyze samples like this one that contain more plastic than plankton  We sort the plastic fragments into different size classes  from five millimeters to one third of a millimeter. Small bits of plastic concentrate persistent organic pollutants up to a million times their levels in the surrounding seawater. We wanted to see if the most common fish in the deep ocean  at the base of the food chain  was ingesting these poison pills. We did hundreds of necropsies  and over a third had polluted plastic fragments in their stomachs. The record holder  only two and a half inches long  had    pieces in its tiny stomach. Now  you can buy certified organic produce. But no fishmonger on Earth can sell you a certified organic wild caught fish. This is the legacy we are leaving to future generations. The throwaway society cannot be contained    it has gone global. We simply cannot store and maintain or recycle all our stuff. We have to throw it away. Now  the market can do a lot for us  but it can't fix the natural system in the ocean we've broken. All the king's horses and all the king's men ... will never gather up all the plastic and put the ocean back together again. Narrator  Video   The levels are increasing  the amount of packaging is increasing  the  throwaway  concept of living is proliferating  and it's showing up in the ocean. Anchor  He offers no hope of cleaning it up. Straining the ocean for plastic would be beyond the budget of any country and it might kill untold amounts of sea life in the process. The solution  Moore says  is to stop the plastic at its source  stop it on land before it falls in the ocean. And in a plastic wrapped and packaged world  he doesn't hold out much hope for that  either. This is Brian Rooney for Nightline  in Long Beach  California. Charles Moore  Thank you. This is the first of two rather extraordinary photographs I'm going to show you today. It was taken    years ago. I was    years old at the time. I had just returned from one of the deepest dives I'd ever made at that time     a little over     feet    and  I had caught this little fish here. It turns out that that particular one was the first live one of that ever taken alive. I'm not just an ichthyologist  I'm a bona fide fish nerd. And to a fish nerd  this is some pretty exciting stuff. And more exciting was the fact that the person who took this photo was a guy named Jack Randall  the greatest living ichthyologist on Earth  the Grand Poobah of fish nerds  if you will. And so  it was really exciting to me to have this moment in time  it really set the course for the rest of my life. But really the most significant thing  the most profound thing about this picture is that it was taken two days before I was completely paralyzed from the neck down. I made a really stupid kind of mistake that most    year old males do when they think they're immortal  and I got a bad case of the bends  and was paralyzed  and had to be flown back for treatment. I learned two really important things that day. The first thing I learned    well  I'm mortal  that's a really big one. And the second thing I learned was that I knew  with profound certainty  that this is exactly what I was going to do for the rest of my life. I had to focus all my energies towards going to find new species of things down on deep coral reefs. Now  when you think of a coral reef  this is what most people think of  all these big  hard  elaborate corals and lots of bright  colorful fishes and things. But  this is really just the tip of the iceberg. If you look at this diagram of a coral reef  we know a lot about that part up near the top  and the reason we know so much about it is scuba divers can very easily go down there and access it. There is a problem with scuba though  in that it imposes some limitations on how deep you can go  and it turns out that depth is about     feet. I'll get into why that is in just a minute. But  the point is that scuba divers generally stay less than     feet deep  and very rarely go much below this  at least  not with any kind of sanity. So  to go deeper  most biologists have turned to submersibles. Now  submersibles are great  wonderful things  but if you're going to spend        dollars a day to use one of these things  and it's capable of going       feet  you're sure not going to go farting around up here in a couple of hundred feet  you're going to go way  way  way  down deep. So  the bottom line is that almost all research using submersibles has taken place well below     feet. Now  it's pretty obvious at this point that there's this zone here in the middle and that's the zone that really centers around my own personal pursuit of happiness. I want to find out what's in this zone. We know almost nothing about it. Scuba divers can't get there  submarines go right on past it. It took me a year to learn how to walk again after I had my diving accident in Palau and during that year I spent a lot of time learning about the physics and physiology of diving and figuring out how to overcome these limitations. So  I'm just going to show you a basic idea. We're all breathing air right now. Air is a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen  about    percent oxygen. About    percent nitrogen is in our lungs. And there's a phenomenon called Henry's Law that says that gases will dissolve into a fluid in proportion to the partial pressures which you're exposing them to. So  basically the gas dissolves into our body. The oxygen is bound by metabolism  we use it for energy. The nitrogen just sort of floats around in our blood and tissues  and that's all fine  that's how we're designed. The problem happens when you start to go underwater. Now  the deeper you go underwater  the higher the pressure is. If you were to go down to a depth of about     feet  which is the recommended limit for most scuba divers  you get this pressure effect. And the effect of that pressure is that you have an increased density of gas molecules in every breath you take. Over time  those gas molecules dissolve into your blood and tissues and start to fill you up. Now  if you were to go down to  say      feet  you don't have five times as many gas molecules in your lungs    you've got    times as many gas molecules in your lungs. And  sure enough  they dissolve into your blood  and into your tissues as well. And of course  if you were to down to where there's    times as much    the deeper you go  the more exacerbating the problem becomes. And the problem  the limitation of diving with air is all those dots in your body    all the nitrogen and all the oxygen. There're three basic limitations of scuba diving. The first limitation is the oxygen    oxygen toxicity. Now  we all know the song   Love is like oxygen.  You get too much  you get too high.  Not enough  and you're going to die.  Well  in the context of diving  you get too much  you die also. You die also because oxygen toxicity can cause a seizure    makes you convulse underwater  not a good thing to happen underwater. It happens because there's too much concentration of oxygen in your body. The nitrogen has two problems. One of them is what Jacques Cousteau called  rapture of the deep.  It's nitrogen narcosis. It makes you loopy. The deeper you go  the loopier you get. You don't want to drive drunk  you don't want to dive drunk  so that's a real big problem. And of course  the third problem is the one I found out the hard way in Palau  which is the bends. Now the one thing that I forgot to mention  is that to obviate the problem of the nitrogen narcosis    all of those blue dots in our body    you remove the nitrogen and you replace it with helium. Now helium's a gas  there're a lot of reasons why helium's good  it's a tiny molecule  it's inert  it doesn't give you narcosis. So that's the basic concept that we use. But  the theory's relatively easy. The tricky part is the implementation. So  this is how I began  about    years ago. I'll admit  it wasn't exactly the smartest of starts  but  you know  you got to start somewhere. At the time  I wasn't the only one who didn't know what I was doing    almost nobody did. And this rig was actually used for a dive of     feet. Over time we got a little bit better at it  and we came up with this really sophisticated looking rig with four scuba tanks and five regulators and all the right gas mixtures and all that good stuff. And it was fine and dandy  and it allowed us to go down and find new species. This picture was taken     feet deep  catching new species of fish. But  the problem was that it didn't allow us much time. For all its bulk and size  it only gave us about    minutes at most down at those sorts of depths. We needed more time. There had to be a better way. And  indeed  there is a better way. In       I was fortunate enough to get access to these prototype closed circuit rebreathers. Alright  closed circuit rebreather    what is it about it that makes it different from scuba  and why is it better  Well  there are three main advantages to a rebreather. One  they're quiet  they don't make any noise. Two  they allow you to stay underwater longer. Three  they allow you to go deeper. How is it that they do that  Well  in order to really understand how they do that you have to take off the hood  and look underneath and see what's going on. There are three basic systems to a closed  circuit rebreather. The most fundamental of these is called the breathing loop. It's a breathing loop because you breathe off of it  and it's a closed loop  and you breathe the same gas around and around and around. So there's a mouthpiece that you put in your mouth  and there's also a counterlung  or in this case  two counterlungs. Now  the counterlungs aren't high tech  they're just simply flexible bags. They allow you to mechanically breathe  or mechanically ventilate. When you exhale your breath  it goes in the exhale counterlung  when you inhale a breath  it comes from the inhale counterlung. It's just pure mechanics  allowing you to cycle air through this breathing loop. And  the other component on a breathing loop is the carbon dioxide absorbent canister. Now  as we breathe  we produce carbon dioxide  and that carbon dioxide needs to be scrubbed out of the system. There's a chemical filter in there that pulls the carbon dioxide out of the breathing gas    so that  when it comes back to us to breathe again  it's safe to breathe again. So that's the breathing loop in a nutshell. The second main component of a closed circuit rebreather is the gas system. The primary purpose of the gas system is to provide oxygen  to replenish the oxygen that your body consumes. So the main tank  the main critical thing  is this oxygen gas supply cylinder we have here. But  if we only had an oxygen gas supply cylinder we wouldn't be able to go very deep  because we'd run into oxygen toxicity very  very quickly. So we need another gas  something to dilute the oxygen with. And that  fittingly enough  is called the diluent gas supply. In our applications  we generally put air inside this diluent gas supply  because it's a very cheap and easy source of nitrogen. So that's where we get our nitrogen from. But  if we want to go deeper  of course  we need another gas supply. We need helium  and the helium is what we really need to go deep. And usually we'll have a slightly larger cylinder mounted exterior on the rebreather  like this. And that's what we use to inject  as we start to do our deep dives. We also have a second oxygen cylinder  that's solely as a back up in case there's a problem with our first oxygen supply we can continue to breathe. And the way you manage all these different gases and all these different gas supplies is this really high tech  sophisticated gas block up on the front here  where it's easy to reach. It's got all the valves and knobs and things you need to do to inject the right gases at the right time. Now  normally you don't have to do that because all of it's done automatically for you with the electronics  the third system of a rebreather. The most critical part of a rebreather is the oxygen sensors. You need three of them  so that if one of them goes bad  you know which one it is. You need voting logic. You also have three microprocessors. Any one of those computers can run the entire system  so if you have to lose two of them  there's also back up power supplies. And of course there're multiple displays  to get the information to the diver. This is the high tech gadgetry that allows us to do what we do on these kinds of deep dives. And I can talk about it all day    just ask my wife    but I want to move on to something that's kind of much more interesting. I'm going to take you on a deep dive. I'm going to show you what it's like to do one of these dives that we do. We start up here on the boat  and for all this high tech  expensive equipment  this is still the best way to get in the water    just pfft     flop over the side of the boat. Now  as I showed you in the earlier diagram  these reefs that we dive on start out near the surface and they go almost vertically  completely straight down. So  we drop in the water  and we just sort of go over the edge of this cliff  and then we just start dropping  dropping  dropping. People have asked me   It must take a long time to get there   No  it only takes a couple of minutes to get all the way down to three or four hundred feet  which is where we're aiming for. It's kind of like skydiving in slow motion. It's really a very interesting    you ever see  The Abyss  where Ed Harris  you know  he's sinking down along the side of the wall  That's kind of what it feels like. It's pretty amazing. Also  when you get down there  you find that the water is very  very clear. It's extremely clear water  because there's hardly any plankton. But  when you turn on your light  you look around at the caves  and all of a sudden you're confronted with a tremendous amount of diversity  much more than anyone used to believe. Now not all of it is new species    like that fish you see with the white stripe  that's a known species. But  if you look carefully into the cracks and crevices  you'll see little things scurrying all over the place. There's a just unbelievable diversity. It's not just fish  either. These are crinoids  sponges  black corals. There're some more fishes. And those fishes that you see right now are new species. They're still new species because I had a video camera on this dive instead of my net  so they're still waiting down there for someone to go find them. But this is what it looks like  and this kind of habitat just goes on and on and on for miles. This is Papua  New Guinea. Now little fishes and invertebrates aren't the only things we see down there. We also see sharks  much more regularly than I would have expected to. And we're not quite sure why. But what I want you to do right now is imagine yourself     feet underwater  with all this high tech gear on your back  you're in a remote reef off Papua  New Guinea  thousands of miles from the nearest recompression chamber  and you're completely surrounded by sharks. Video  Look at those ... Uh oh ... uh oh  I think we have their attention.  Laughter  Richard Pyle  When you start talking like Donald Duck  there's no situation in the world that can seem tense. So  we're down there  and this is at     feet    that's looking straight up  by the way  so you can get a sense of how far away the surface is. And if you're a biologist and you know about sharks  and you want to assess  you know  how much jeopardy am I really in here  there's one question that sort of jumps to the forefront of your mind immediately which is    Diver    Video   What kind of sharks  Diver    Uh  silvertip sharks. Diver    Oh. RP  Silvertip sharks    they're actually three species of sharks here. The silvertips are the one with the white edges on the fin  and there're also gray reef sharks and some hammerheads off in the distance. And yes  it's a little nerve wracking. Diver    Video   Hoo  That little guy is frisky   Laughter  Now  you've seen video like this on TV a lot  and it's very intimidating  and I think it gives the wrong impression about sharks. Sharks are actually not very dangerous animals and that's why we weren't worried much  why we were joking around down there. More people are killed by pigs  more people are killed by lightning strikes  more people are killed at soccer games in England. There's a lot of other ways you can die. And I'm not making that stuff up. Coconuts  You can get killed by a coconut more likely than killed by a shark. So sharks aren't quite as dangerous as most people make them out to be. Now  I don't know if any of you get U.S. News and World Report    I got the recent issue. There's a cover story all about the great explorers of our time. The last article is an article entitled  No New Frontiers.  It questions whether or not there really are any new frontiers out there  whether there are any real  true  hardcore discoveries that can still be made. And this is my favorite line from the article. As a fish nerd  I have to laugh  because you know they don't call us fish nerds for nothing    we actually do get excited about finding a new dorsal spine in a guppy. But  it's much more than that. And  I want to show you a few of the guppies we've found over the years. This one's    you know  you can see how ugly it is. Even if you ignore the scientific value of this thing  just look at the monetary value of this thing. A couple of these ended up getting sold through the aquarium trade to Japan  where they sold for        dollars apiece. That's half a million dollars per pound. Here's another new angelfish we discovered. This one we actually first discovered back in the air days    the bad old air days  as we used to say    when we were doing these kind of dives with air. We were at     feet. And I remember coming up from one of these deep dives  and I had this fog  and the narcosis takes a little while to  you know  fade away. It's sort of like sobering up. And I had this vague recollection of seeing these yellow fish with a black spot  and I thought   Aw  damn. I should have caught one. I think that's a new species.  And then  eventually  I got around to looking in my bucket. Sure enough  I had caught one    I just completely forgot that I had caught one.  Laughter  And so this one we decided to give the name Centropyge narcosis to. So that's it's official scientific name  in reference to its deep dwelling habits. And this is another neat one. When we first found it  we weren't even sure what family this thing belonged to  so we just called it the Dr. Seuss fish  because it looked like something out of one of those books. Now  this one's pretty cool. If you go to Papua  New Guinea  and go down     feet  you're going to see these big mounds. And this may be kind of hard to see  but they're about    oh  a couple meters in diameter. If you look closely  you'll see there's a little white fish and gray fish that hangs out near them. Well  it turns out this little white fish builds these giant mounds  one pebble at a time. It's really extraordinary to find something like this. It's not just new species  it's new behavior  it's new ecology it's all kind of new things. So  what I'm going to show you right now  very quickly  is just a sampling of a few of the new species we've discovered. What's extraordinary about this is not just the sheer number of species we're finding    although as you can see that's pretty amazing  this is only half of what we've found    what's extraordinary is how quickly we find them. We're up to seven new species per hour of time we spend at that depth. Now  if you go to an Amazon jungle and fog a tree  you may get a lot of bugs  but for fishes  there's nowhere in the world you can get seven new species per hour of time. Now  we've done some back of the envelope calculations  and we're predicting that there are probably on the order of       to       new species in the Indo Pacific alone. There are only five to six thousand known species. So a very large percentage of what is out there isn't really known. We thought we had a handle on all the reef fish diversity    evidently not. And I'm going to just close on a very somber note. At the beginning I told you that I was going to show you two extraordinary photographs. This is the second extraordinary photograph I'm going to show you. This one was taken at the exact moment I was down there filming those sharks. This was taken exactly     feet above my head. And the reason this photograph is extraordinary is because it captures a moment in the very last minute of a person's life. Less than    seconds after this picture was taken  this guy was dead. When we recovered his body  we figured out what had gone wrong. He had made a very simple mistake. He turned the wrong valve when he filled his cylinder    he had    percent oxygen in his tank when he should have had   . He had an oxygen toxicity seizure and he drowned. The reason I show this    not to put a downer on everything    but I just want to use it to key off my philosophy of life in general  which is that we all have two goals. The first goal we share with every other living thing on this planet  which is to survive. I call it perpetuation  the survival of the species and survival of ourselves  because they're both about perpetuating the genome. And the second goal  for those of us who have mastered that first goal  is to    you know  you call it spiritual fulfillment  you can call it financial success  you can call it any number of different things. I call it seeking joy    this pursuit of happiness. So  I guess my theme on this is this guy lived his life to the fullest  he absolutely did. You have to balance those two goals. If you live your whole life in fear    I mean  life is a sexually transmitted disease with     percent mortality. So  you can't live your life in fear. I thought that was an old one. But  at the same time you don't want to get so focused on rule number two  or goal number two  that you neglect goal number one. Because once you're dead  you really can't enjoy anything after that. I wish you all the best of luck in maintaining that balance in your future endeavors. Thanks. I was raised in Seoul  Korea  and moved to New York City in      to attend college. I was pre med at the time  and I thought I would become a surgeon because I was interested in anatomy and dissecting animals really piqued my curiosity. At the same time  I fell in love with New York City. I started to realize that I could look at the whole city as a living organism. I wanted to dissect it and look into its unseen layers. And the way to it  for me  was through artistic means. So  eventually I decided to pursue an MFA instead of an M.D. and in grad school I became interested in creatures that dwell in the hidden corners of the city. In New York City  rats are part of commuters' daily lives. Most people ignore them or are frightened of them. But I took a liking to them because they dwell on the fringes of society. And even though they're used in labs to promote human lives  they're also considered pests. I also started looking around in the city and trying to photograph them. One day  in the subway  I was snapping pictures of the tracks hoping to catch a rat or two  and a man came up to me and said   You can't take photographs here. The MTA will confiscate your camera.  I was quite shocked by that  and thought to myself   Well  OK then. I'll follow the rats.  Then I started going into the tunnels  which made me realize that there's a whole new dimension to the city that I never saw before and most people don't get to see. Around the same time  I met like minded individuals who call themselves urban explorers  adventurers  spelunkers  guerrilla historians  etc. I was welcomed into this loose  Internet based network of people who regularly explore urban ruins such as abandoned subway stations  tunnels  sewers  aqueducts  factories  hospitals  shipyards and so on. When I took photographs in these locations  I felt there was something missing in the pictures. Simply documenting these soon to be demolished structures wasn't enough for me. So I wanted to create a fictional character or an animal that dwells in these underground spaces  and the simplest way to do it  at the time  was to model myself. I decided against clothing because I wanted the figure to be without any cultural implications or time specific elements. I wanted a simple way to represent a living body inhabiting these decaying  derelict spaces. This was taken in the Riviera Sugar Factory in Red Hook  Brooklyn. It's now an empty  six acre lot waiting for a shopping mall right across from the new Ikea. I was very fond of this space because it's the first massive industrial complex I found on my own that is abandoned. When I first went in  I was scared  because I heard dogs barking and I thought they were guard dogs. But they happened to be wild dogs living there  and it was right by the water  so there were swans and ducks swimming around and trees growing everywhere and bees nesting in the sugar barrels. The nature had really reclaimed the whole complex. And  in a way  I wanted the human figure in the picture to become a part of that nature. When I got comfortable in the space  it also felt like a big playground. I would climb up the tanks and hop across exposed beams as if I went back in time and became a child again. This was taken in the old Croton Aqueduct  which supplied fresh water to New York City for the first time. The construction began in     . It lasted about five years. It got abandoned when the new Croton Aqueducts opened in     . When you go into spaces like this  you're directly accessing the past  because they sit untouched for decades. I love feeling the aura of a space that has so much history. Instead of looking at reproductions of it at home  you're actually feeling the hand laid bricks and shimmying up and down narrow cracks and getting wet and muddy and walking in a dark tunnel with a flashlight. This is a tunnel underneath Riverside Park. It was built in the     s by Robert Moses. The murals were done by a graffiti artist to commemorate the hundreds of homeless people that got relocated from the tunnel in      when the tunnel reopened for trains. Walking in this tunnel is very peaceful. There's nobody around you  and you hear the kids playing in the park above you  completely unaware of what's underneath. When I was going out a lot to these places  I was feeling a lot of anxiety and isolation because I was in a solitary phase in my life  and I decided to title my series  Naked City Spleen   which references Charles Baudelaire.  Naked City  is a nickname for New York  and  Spleen  embodies the melancholia and inertia that come from feeling alienated in an urban environment. This is the same tunnel. You see the sunbeams coming from the ventilation ducts and the train approaching. This is a tunnel that's abandoned in Hell's Kitchen. I was there alone  setting up  and a homeless man approached. I was basically intruding in his living space. I was really frightened at first  but I calmly explained to him that I was working on an art project and he didn't seem to mind and so I went ahead and put my camera on self timer and ran back and forth. And when I was done  he actually offered me his shirt to wipe off my feet and kindly walked me out. It must have been a very unusual day for him. One thing that struck me  after this incident  was that a space like that holds so many deleted memories of the city. That homeless man  to me  really represented an element of the unconscious of the city. He told me that he was abused above ground and was once in Riker's Island  and at last he found peace and quiet in that space. The tunnel was once built for the prosperity of the city  but is now a sanctuary for outcasts  who are completely forgotten in the average urban dweller's everyday life. This is underneath my alma mater  Columbia University. The tunnels are famous for having been used during the development of the Manhattan Project. This particular tunnel is interesting because it shows the original foundations of Bloomingdale Insane Asylum  which was demolished in      when Columbia moved in. This is the New York City Farm Colony  which was a poorhouse in Staten Island from the     s to the     s. Most of my photos are set in places that have been abandoned for decades  but this is an exception. This children's hospital was closed in       it's located in Newark. When I was there three years ago  the windows were broken and the walls were peeling  but everything was left there as it was. You see the autopsy table  morgue trays  x ray machines and even used utensils  which you see on the autopsy table. After exploring recently abandoned buildings  I felt that everything could fall into ruins very fast  your home  your office  a shopping mall  a church    any man made structures around you. I was reminded of how fragile our sense of security is and how vulnerable people truly are. I love to travel  and Berlin has become one of my favorite cities. It's full of history  and also full of underground bunkers and ruins from the war. This was taken under a homeless asylum built in      to house       people. I saw the structure while I was on the train  and I got off at the next station and met people there that gave me access to their catacomb like basement  which was used for ammunition storage during the war and also  at some point  to hide groups of Jewish refugees. This is the actual catacombs in Paris. I explored there extensively in the off limits areas and fell in love right away. There are more than     miles of tunnels  and only about a mile is open to the public as a museum. The first tunnels date back to    B.C. They were consistently dug as limestone quarries and by the   th century  the caving in of some of these quarries posed safety threats  so the government ordered reinforcing of the existing quarries and dug new observation tunnels in order to monitor and map the whole place. As you can see  the system is very complex and vast. It's very dangerous to get lost in there. And at the same time  there was a problem in the city with overflowing cemeteries. So the bones were moved from the cemeteries into the quarries  making them into the catacombs. The remains of over six million people are housed in there  some over       years old. This was taken under the Montparnasse Cemetery where most of the ossuaries are located. There are also phone cables that were used in the '  s and many bunkers from the World War II era. This is a German bunker. Nearby there's a French bunker  and the whole tunnel system is so complex that the two parties never met. The tunnels are famous for having been used by the Resistance  which Victor Hugo wrote about in  Les Miserables.  And I saw a lot of graffiti from the     s  like this one. After exploring the underground of Paris  I decided to climb up  and I climbed a Gothic monument that's right in the middle of Paris. This is the Tower of Saint Jacques. It was built in the early     s. I don't recommend sitting on a gargoyle in the middle of January  naked. It was not very comfortable.  Laughter  And all this time  I never saw a single rat in any of these places  until recently  when I was in the London sewers. This was probably the toughest place to explore. I had to wear a gas mask because of the toxic fumes    I guess  except for in this picture. And when the tides of waste matter come in it sounds as if a whole storm is approaching you. This is a still from a film I worked on recently  called  Blind Door.  I've become more interested in capturing movement and texture. And the   mm black and white film gave a different feel to it. And this is the first theater project I worked on. I adapted and produced  A Dream Play  by August Strindberg. It was performed last September one time only in the Atlantic Avenue tunnel in Brooklyn  which is considered to be the oldest underground train tunnel in the world  built in     . I've been leaning towards more collaborative projects like these  lately. But whenever I get a chance I still work on my series. The last place I visited was the Mayan ruins of Copan  Honduras. This was taken inside an archaeological tunnel in the main temple. I like doing more than just exploring these spaces. I feel an obligation to animate and humanize these spaces continually in order to preserve their memories in a creative way    before they're lost forever. Thank you. Four years ago  on the TED stage  I announced a company I was working with at the time called Odeo. And because of that announcement  we got a big article in The New York Times  which led to more press  which led to more attention  and me deciding to become CEO of that company    whereas I was just an adviser    and raising a round of venture capital and ramping up hiring. One of the guys I hired was an engineer named Jack Dorsey  and a year later  when we were trying to decide which way to go with Odeo  Jack presented an idea he'd been tinkering around with for a number of years that was based around sending simple status updates to friends. We were also playing with SMS at the time at Odeo  so we kind of put two and two together  and in early      we launched Twitter as a side project at Odeo. Now  it's hard to justify doing a side project at a startup  where focus is so critical  but I had actually launched Blogger as a side project to my previous company  thinking it was just a little thing we'd do on the side  and it ended up taking over not only the company  but my life for the next five or six years. So I learned to follow hunches even though you can't necessarily justify them or know where they're going to go. And that's kind of what's happened with Twitter  time after time. So  for those of you unfamiliar  Twitter is based around a very simple  seemingly trivial concept. You say what you're doing in     characters or less  and people who are interested in you get those updates. If they're really interested  they get the update as a text message on their cell phone. So  for instance  I may Twitter right now that I'm giving a talk at TED. And in my case  when I hit send  up to        people will receive that message in a matter of seconds. Now  the fundamental idea is that Twitter lets people share moments of their lives whenever they want  be they momentous occasions or mundane ones. It is by sharing these moments as they're happening that lets people feel more connected and in touch  despite distance  and in real time. This is the primary use we saw of Twitter from the beginning  and what got us excited. What we didn't anticipate was the many  many other uses that would evolve from this very simple system. One of the things we realized was how important Twitter could be during real time events. When the wildfires broke out in San Diego  in October of       people turned to Twitter to report what was happening and to find information from neighbors about what was happening around them. But it wasn't just individuals. The L.A. Times actually turned to Twitter to dispense information as well  and put a Twitter feed on the front page  and the L.A. Fire Department and Red Cross used it to dispense news and updates as well. At this event  dozens of people here are Twittering and thousands of people around the world are following along because they want to know what it feels like to be here and what's happening. Among the other interesting things that have cropped up are many things from businesses  from marketing and communications and predictable things  to an insanely popular Korean barbecue taco truck that drives around L.A. and Twitters where it stops  causing a line to form around the block. Politicians have recently begun Twittering. In fact  there are    members of Congress who currently have Twitter accounts. And they're tweeting  in some cases  from behind closed door sessions with the President. In this case  this guy's not liking what he's hearing. The President himself is our most popular Twitter user  although his tweets have dropped off as of late  while Senator McCain's have picked up. As have this guy's. Twitter was originally designed as a broadcast medium  you send one message and it goes out to everybody  and you receive the messages you're interested in. One of the many ways that users shaped the evolution of Twitter was by inventing a way to reply to a specific person or a specific message. So  this syntax  the   username  that Shaquille O'Neal's using here to reply to one of his fans  was completely invented by users  and we didn't build it into the system until it already became popular and then we made it easier. This is one of the many ways that users have shaped the system. Another is via the API. We built an application programming interface  which basically means that programmers can write software that interacts with Twitter. We currently know about over       pieces of software that can send Twitter updates    interfaces for Mac  Windows  your iPhone  your BlackBerry    as well as things like a device that lets an unborn baby Twitter when it kicks or a plant Twitter when it needs water. Probably the most important third party development came from a little company in Virginia called Summize. Summize built a Twitter search engine. And they tapped into the fact that  if you have millions of people around the world talking about what they're doing and what's around them  you have an incredible resource to find out about any topic or event while it's going on. This really changed how we perceived Twitter. For instance  here's what people are saying about TED. This is another way that our mind was shifted  and Twitter wasn't what we thought it was. We liked this so much we actually bought the company and are folding it into the main product. This not only lets you view Twitters in different ways  but it introduces new use cases as well. One of my favorites is what happened a few months ago when there was a gas shortage in Atlanta. Some users figured out that they would Twitter when they found gas    where it was  and how much it cost    and then appended the keyword   atlgas  which let other people search for that and find gas themselves. And this trend of people using this communication network to help each other out goes far beyond the original idea of just keeping up with family and friends. It's happened more and more lately  whether it's raising money for homeless people or to dig wells in Africa or for a family in crisis. People have raised tens of thousands of dollars over Twitter in a matter of days on several occasions. It seems like when you give people easier ways to share information  more good things happen. I have no idea what will happen next with Twitter. I've learned to follow the hunch  but never assume where it will go. Thanks. Chris Anderson  We're not quite done yet. So  look  if we could have this screen live. This is actually the most terrifying thing that any speaker can do after they've been to an event. It's totally intimidating. So  this would be the Twitter search screen. So we're going to just type a couple of random words into Twitter. For example   Evan Williams.   Evan Williams  give people more good ways to share information and follow your hunch at TED.   Currently listening to Evan Williams.   Currently listening to Evan Williams.   Evan Williams     Oh.  Evan Williams is just dying on stage here at TED. Worst talk ever    Laughter  Evan Williams  Nice. Thanks. CA  Just kidding. But  literally in the eight minutes he was talking  there are about fifty tweets that already came on the talk. So he'll see every aspect of the reaction  the fact that Barack Obama is the biggest Twitterer  the fact that it came out of TED. I don't think there's any other way of getting instant feedback that way. You have build something very fascinating  and it looks like its best times are still ahead of it. So  thank you very much  Evan. EW  Thank you. CA  That was very interesting. Back in       I started working for a company called Interval Research  which was just then being founded by David Lidell and Paul Allen as a for profit research enterprise in Silicon Valley. I met with David to talk about what I might do in his company. I was just coming out of a failed virtual reality business and supporting myself by being on the speaking circuit and writing books    after twenty years or so in the computer game industry having ideas that people didn't think they could sell. And David and I discovered that we had a question in common  that we really wanted the answer to  and that was   Why hasn't anybody built any computer games for little girls   Why is that  It can't just be a giant sexist conspiracy. These people aren't that smart. There's six billion dollars on the table. They would go for it if they could figure out how. So  what is the deal here  And as we thought about our goals    I should say that Interval is really a humanistic institution  in the classical sense that humanism  at its best  finds a way to combine clear eyed empirical research with a set of core values that fundamentally love and respect people. The basic idea of humanism is the improvable quality of life  that we can do good things  that there are things worth doing because they're good things to do  and that clear eyed empiricism can help us figure out how to do them. So  contrary to popular belief  there is not a conflict of interest between empiricism and values. And Interval Research is kind of the living example of how that can be true. So David and I decided to go find out  through the best research we could muster  what it would take to get a little girl to put her hands on a computer  to achieve the level of comfort and ease with the technology that little boys have because they play video games. We spent two and a half years conducting research  we spent another year and a half in advance development. Then we formed a spin off company. In the research phase of the project at Interval  we partnered with a company called Cheskin Research  and these people    Davis Masten and Christopher Ireland    changed my mind entirely about what market research was and what it could be. They taught me how to look and see  and they did not do the incredibly stupid thing of saying to a child   Of all these things we already make you  which do you like best      which gives you zero answers that are usable. So  what we did for the first two and a half years was four things  We did an extensive review of the literature in related fields  like cognitive psychology  spatial cognition  gender studies  play theory  sociology  primatology. Thank you Frans de Waal  wherever you are  I love you and I'd give anything to meet you. After we had done that with a pretty large team of people and discovered what we thought the salient issues were with girls and boys and playing    because  after all  that's really what this is about    we moved to the second phase of our work  where we interviewed adult experts in academia  some of the people who'd produced the literature that we found relevant. Also  we did focus groups with people who were on the ground with kids every day  like playground supervisors. We talked to them  confirmed some hypotheses and identified some serious questions about gender difference and play. Then we did what I consider to be the heart of the work  interviewed       children  boys and girls  ages seven to     all over the United States    except for Silicon Valley  Boston and Austin because we knew that their little families would have millions of computers in them and they wouldn't be a representative sample. And at the end of those remarkable conversations with kids and their best friends across the United States  after two years  we pulled together some survey data from another        children  drew up a set up of what we thought were the key findings of our research  and spent another year transforming them into design heuristics  for designing computer based products    and  in fact  any kind of products    for little girls  ages eight to   . And we spent that time designing interactive prototypes for computer software and testing them with little girls. In       in November  we formed the company Purple Moon which was a spinoff of Interval Research  and our chief investors were Interval Research  Vulcan Northwest  Institutional Venture Partners and Allen and Company. We launched a website on September  nd that has now served    million pages  and has        registered young girl users. They visit an average of one and a half times a day  spend an average of    minutes a visit  and look at    pages a visit. So we feel that we've formed a successful online community with girls. We launched two titles in October     Rockett's New School     the first of a series of products    is about a character called Rockett beginning her first day of school in eighth grade at a brand new place  with a blank slate  which allows girls to play with the question of   What will I be like when I'm older    What's it going to be like to be in high school or junior high school  Who are my friends    to exercise the love of social complexity and the narrative intelligence that drives most of their play behavior  and which embeds in it values about noticing that we have lots of choices in our lives and the ways that we conduct ourselves. The other title that we launched is called  Secret Paths in the Forest   which addresses the more fantasy oriented  inner lives of girls. These two titles both showed up in the top    entertainment titles in PC Data    entertainment titles in PC Data in December  right up there with  John Madden Football   which thrills me to death. So  we're real  and we've touched several hundreds of thousands of little girls. We've made half a billion impressions with marketing and PR for this brand  Purple Moon. Ninety six percent of them  roughly  have been positive  four percent of them have been  other.  I want to talk about the other  because the politics of this enterprise  in a way  have been the most fascinating part of it  for me. There are really two kinds of negative reviews that we've received. One kind of reviewer is a male gamer who thinks he knows what games ought to be  and won't show the product to little girls. The other kind of reviewer is a certain flavor of feminist who thinks they know what little girls ought to be. And so it's funny to me that these interesting  odd bedfellows have one thing in common  they don't listen to little girls. They haven't looked at children and they're certainly not demonstrating any love for them. I'd like to play you some voices of little girls from the two and a half years of research that we did    actually  some of the voices are more recent. And these voices will be accompanied by photographs that they took for us of their lives  of the things that they value and care about. These are pictures the girls themselves never saw  but they gave to us This is the stuff those reviewers don't know about and aren't listening to and this is the kind of research I recommend to those who want to do humanistic work. Girl    Yeah  my character is usually a tomboy. Hers is more into boys. Girl    Uh  yeah. Girl    We have    in the very beginning of the whole game  always we do this  we each have a piece of paper  we write down our name  our age    are we rich  very rich  not rich  poor  medium  wealthy  boyfriends  dogs  pets    what else    sisters  brothers  and all those. Girl    Divorced    parents divorced  maybe. Girl    This is my pretend  unclear  one. Girl    We make a school newspaper on the computer. Girl    For a girl's game also usually they'll have really pretty scenery with clouds and flowers. Girl    Like  if you were a girl and you were really adventurous and a real big tomboy  you would think that girls' games were kinda sissy. Girl    I run track  I played soccer  I play basketball  and I love a lot of things to do. And sometimes I feel like I can't really enjoy myself unless it's like a vacation  like when I get Mondays and all those days off. Girl    Well  sometimes there is a lot of stuff going on because I have music lessons and I'm on swim team    all this different stuff that I have to do  and sometimes it gets overwhelming. Girl    My friend Justine kinda took my friend Kelly  and now they're being mean to me. Girl     Well  sometimes it gets annoying when your brothers and sisters  or brother or sister  when they copy you and you get your idea first and they take your idea and they do it themselves. Girl     Because my older sister  she gets everything and  like  when I ask my mom for something  she'll say   No     all the time. But she gives my sister everything. Brenda Laurel  I want to show you  real quickly  just a minute of  Rockett's Tricky Decision   which went gold two days ago. Let's hope it's really stable. This is the second day in Rockett's life. The reason I'm showing you this is I'm hoping that the scene that I'm going to show you will look familiar and sound familiar  now that you've listened to some girls' voices. And you can see how we've tried to incorporate the issues that matter to them in the game that we've created. Miko  Hey Rockett  C'mere  Rockett  Hi Miko  What's going on  Miko  Did you hear about Nakilia's big Halloween party this weekend  She asked me to make sure you knew about it. Nakilia invited Reuben too  but    Rockett  But what  Isn't he coming  Miko  I don't think so. I mean  I heard his band is playing at another party the same night. Rockett  Really  What other party  Girl  Max's party is going to be so cool  Whitney. He's invited all the best people. BL  I'm going to fast forward to the decision point because I know I don't have a lot of time. After this awful event occurs  Rocket gets to decide how she feels about it. Rockett  Who'd want to show up at that party anyway  I could get invited to that party any day if I wanted to. Gee  I doubt I'll make Max's best people list. BL  OK  so we're going to emotionally navigate. If we were playing the game  that's what we'd do. If at any time during the game we want to learn more about the characters  we can go into this hidden hallway  and I'll quickly just show you the interface. We can  for example  go find Miko's locker and get some more information about her. Oops  I turned the wrong way. But you get the general idea of the product. I wanted to show you the ways  innocuous as they seem  in which we're incorporating what we've learned about girls    their desires to experience greater emotional flexibility  and to play around with the social complexity of their lives. I want to make the point that what we're giving girls  I think  through this effort  is a kind of validation  a sense of being seen. And a sense of the choices that are available in their lives. We love them. We see them. We're not trying to tell them who they ought to be. But we're really  really happy about who they are. It turns out they're really great. I want to close by showing you a videotape that's a version of a future game in the Rockett series that our graphic artists and design people put together  that we feel would please that four percent of reviewers.  Rockett      Rockett  It's like I'm just waking up  you know  BL  Thanks. I was walking in the market one day with my wife  and somebody stuck a cage in my face. And in between those slits were the saddest eyes I've ever seen. There was a very sick orangutan baby  my first encounter. That evening I came back to the market in the dark and I heard  uhh  uhh   and sure enough I found a dying orangutan baby on a garbage heap. Of course  the cage was salvaged. I took up the little baby  massaged her  forced her to drink until she finally started breathing normally. This is Uce. She's now living in the jungle of Sungai Wain  and this is Matahari  her second son  which  by the way  is also the son of the second orangutan I rescued  Dodoy. That changed my life quite dramatically  and as of today  I have almost       babies in my two centers. No. No. No. Wrong. It's horrible. It's a proof of our failing to save them in the wild. It's not good. This is merely proof of everyone failing to do the right thing. Having more than all the orangutans in all the zoos in the world together  just now like victims for every baby  six have disappeared from the forest. The deforestation  especially for oil palm  to provide biofuel for Western countries is what's causing these problems. And those are the peat swamp forests on    meters of peat  the largest accumulation of organic material in the world. When you open this for growing oil palms you're creating CO  volcanoes that are emitting so much CO  that my country is now the third largest emitter of greenhouse gasses in the world  after China and the United States. And we don't have any industry at all    it's only because of this deforestation. And these are horrible images. I'm not going to talk too long about it  but there are so many of the family of Uce  which are not so fortunate to live out there in the forest  that still have to go through that process. And I don't know anymore where to put them. So I decided that I had to come up with a solution for her but also a solution that will benefit the people that are trying to exploit those forests  to get their hands on the last timber and that are causing  in that way  the loss of habitat and all those victims. So I created the place Samboja Lestari  and the idea was  if I can do this on the worst possible place that I can think of where there is really nothing left  no one will have an excuse to say   Yeah  but ...  No. Everyone should be able to follow this. So we're in East Borneo. This is the place where I started. As you can see there's only yellow terrain. There's nothing left    just a bit of grass there. In      we had about    percent of the people jobless there. There was a huge amount of crime. People spent so much of their money on health issues and drinking water. There was no agricultural productivity left. This was the poorest district in the whole province and it was a total extinction of wildlife. This was like a biological desert. When I stood there in the grass  it's hot    not even the sound of insects    just this waving grass. Still  four years later we have created jobs for about       people. The climate has changed. I will show you  no more flooding  no more fires. It's no longer the poorest district  and there is a huge development of biodiversity. We've got over       species. We have     bird species as of today. We have    species of reptiles. So what happened here  We created a huge economic failure in this forest. So basically the whole process of destruction had gone a bit slower than what is happening now with the oil palm. But we saw the same thing. We had slash and burn agriculture  people cannot afford the fertilizer  so they burn the trees and have the minerals available there  the fires become more frequent  and after a while you're stuck with an area of land where there is no fertility left. There are no trees left. Still  in this place  in this grassland where you can see our very first office there on that hill  four years later  there is this one green blop on the Earth's surface ... And there are all these animals  and all these people happy  and there's this economic value. So how's this possible  It was quite simple. If you'll look at the steps  we bought the land  we dealt with the fire  and then only  we started doing the reforestation by combining agriculture with forestry. Only then we set up the infrastructure and management and the monetary. But we made sure that in every step of the way the local people were going to be fully involved so that no outside forces would be able to interfere with that. The people would become the defenders of that forest. So we do the  people  profit  planet  principles  but we do it in addition to a sure legal status    because if the forest belongs to the state  people say   It belongs to me  it belongs to everyone.  And then we apply all these other principles like transparency  professional management  measurable results  scalability   unclear   etc. What we did was we formulated recipes    how to go from a starting situation where you have nothing to a target situation. You formulate a recipe based upon the factors you can control  whether it be the skills or the fertilizer or the plant choice. And then you look at the outputs and you start measuring what comes out. Now in this recipe you also have the cost. You also know how much labor is needed. If you can drop this recipe on the map on a sandy soil  on a clay soil  on a steep slope  on flat soil  you put those different recipes  if you combine them  out of that comes a business plan  comes a work plan  and you can optimize it for the amount of labor you have available or for the amount of fertilizer you have  and you can do it. This is how it looks like in practice. We have this grass we want to get rid of. It exudes  unclear  like compounds from the roots. The acacia trees are of a very low value but we need them to restore the micro climate  to protect the soil and to shake out the grasses. And after eight years they might actually yield some timber    that is  if you can preserve it in the right way  which we can do with bamboo peels. It's an old temple building technique from Japan but bamboo is very fire susceptible. So if we would plant that in the beginning we would have a very high risk of losing everything again. So we plant it later  along the waterways to filter the water  provide the raw products just in time for when the timber becomes available. So the idea is  how to integrate these flows in space  over time and with the limited means you have. So we plant the trees  we plant these pineapples and beans and ginger in between  to reduce the competition for the trees  the crop fertilizer. Organic material is useful for the agricultural crops  for the people  but also helps the trees. The farmers have free land  the system yields early income  the orangutans get healthy food and we can speed up ecosystem regeneration while even saving some money. So beautiful. What a theory. But is it really that easy  Not really  because if you looked at what happened in       the fire started. This is an area of about    million hectares. January. February. March. April. May. We lost  .  million hectares in just a matter of a few months. This is because we have        of those underground fires that you also have in Pennsylvania here in the United States. And once the soil gets dried  you're in a dry season    you get cracks  oxygen goes in  flames come out and the problem starts all over again. So how to break that cycle  Fire is the biggest problem. This is what it looked like for three months. For three months  the automatic lights outside did not go off because it was that dark. We lost all the crops. No children gained weight for over a year  they lost    IQ points. It was a disaster for orangutans and people. So these fires are really the first things to work on. That was why I put it as a single point up there. And you need the local people for that because these grasslands  once they start burning ... It goes through it like a windstorm and you lose again the last bit of ash and nutrients to the first rainfall    going to the sea killing off the coral reefs there. So you have to do it with the local people. That is the short term solution but you also need a long term solution. So what we did is  we created a ring of sugar palms around the area. These sugar palms turn out to be fire resistant    also flood resistant  by the way    and they provide a lot of income for local people. This is what it looks like  the people have to tap them twice a day    just a millimeter slice    and the only thing you harvest is sugar water  carbon dioxide  rain fall and a little bit of sunshine. In principle  you make those trees into biological photovoltaic cells. And you can create so much energy from this    they produce three times more energy per hectare per year  because you can tap them on a daily basis. You don't need to harvest  unclear  or any other of the crops. So this is the combination where we have all this genetic potential in the tropics  which is still unexploited  and doing it in combination with technology. But also your legal side needs to be in very good order. So we bought that land  and here is where we started our project    in the middle of nowhere. And if you zoom in a bit you can see that all of this area is divided into strips that go over different types of soil  and we were actually monitoring  measuring every single tree in these       hectares        acres. And this forest is quite different. What I really did was I just followed nature  and nature doesn't know monocultures  but a natural forest is multilayered. That means that both in the ground and above the ground it can make better use of the available light  it can store more carbon in the system  it can provide more functions. But  it's more complicated. It's not that simple  and you have to work with the people. So  just like nature  we also grow fast planting trees and underneath that  we grow the slower growing  primary grain forest trees of a very high diversity that can optimally use that light. Then  what is just as important  get the right fungi in there that will grow into those leaves  bring back the nutrients to the roots of the trees that have just dropped that leaf within    hours. And they become like nutrient pumps. You need the bacteria to fix nitrogen  and without those microorganisms  you won't have any performance at all. And then we started planting    only       trees a day. We could have planted many  many more  but we didn't want to because we wanted to keep the number of jobs stable. We didn't want to lose the people that are going to work in that plantation. And we do a lot of work here. We use indicator plants to look at what soil types  or what vegetables will grow  or what trees will grow here. And we have monitored every single one of those trees from space. This is what it looks like in reality  you have this irregular ring around it  with strips of     meters wide  with sugar palms that can provide income for     families. It's only a small part of the area. The nursery  in here  is quite different. If you look at the number of tree species we have in Europe  for instance  from the Urals up to England  you know how many     . In this nursery  we're going to grow    times more than the number of species. Can you imagine  You do need to know what you are working with  but it's that diversity which makes it work. That you can go from this zero situation  by planting the vegetables and the trees  or directly  the trees in the lines in that grass there  putting up the buffer zone  producing your compost  and then making sure that at every stage of that up growing forest there are crops that can be used. In the beginning  maybe pineapples and beans and corn  in the second phase  there will be bananas and papayas  later on  there will be chocolate and chilies. And then slowly  the trees start taking over  bringing in produce from the fruits  from the timber  from the fuel wood. And finally  the sugar palm forest takes over and provides the people with permanent income. On the top left  underneath those green stripes  you see some white dots    those are actually individual pineapple plants that you can see from space. And in that area we started growing some acacia trees that you just saw before. So this is after one year. And this is after two years. And that's green. If you look from the tower    this is when we start attacking the grass. We plant in the seedlings mixed with the bananas  the papayas  all the crops for the local people  but the trees are growing up fast in between as well. And three years later      species of birds are living here. So we lowered air temperature three to five degrees Celsius. Air humidity is up    percent. Cloud cover    I'm going to show it to you    is up. Rainfall is up. And all these species and income. This ecolodge that I built here  three years before  was an empty  yellow field. This transponder that we operate with the European Space Agency    it gives us the benefit that every satellite that comes over to calibrate itself is taking a picture. Those pictures we use to analyze how much carbon  how the forest is developing  and we can monitor every tree using satellite images through our cooperation. We can use these data now to provide other regions with recipes and the same technology. We actually have it already with Google Earth. If you would use a little bit of your technology to put tracking devices in trucks  and use Google Earth in combination with that  you could directly tell what palm oil has been sustainably produced  which company is stealing the timber  and you could save so much more carbon than with any measure of saving energy here. So this is the Samboja Lestari area. You measure how the trees grow back  but you can also measure the biodiversity coming back. And biodiversity is an indicator of how much water can be balanced  how many medicines can be kept here. And finally I made it into the rain machine because this forest is now creating its own rain. This nearby city of Balikpapan has a big problem with water  it's    percent surrounded by seawater  and we have now a lot of intrusion there. Now we looked at the clouds above this forest  we looked at the reforestation area  the semi open area and the open area. And look at these images. I'll just run them very quickly through. In the tropics  raindrops are not formed from ice crystals  which is the case in the temperate zones  you need the trees with  unclear   chemicals that come out of the leaves of the trees that initiate the raindrops. So you create a cool place where clouds can accumulate  and you have the trees to initiate the rain. And look  there's now   .  percent more clouds    already  after three years. If you look at rainfall  it was already up    percent at that time. Let's look at the next year  and you can see that that trend is continuing. Where at first we had a small cap of higher rainfall  that cap is now widening and getting higher. And if we look at the rainfall pattern above Samboja Lestari  it used to be the driest place  but now you see consistently see a peak of rain forming there. So you can actually change the climate. When there are trade winds of course the effect disappears  but afterwards  as soon as the wind stabilizes  you see again that the rainfall peaks come back above this area. So to say it is hopeless is not the right thing to do  because we actually can make that difference if you integrate the various technologies. And it's nice to have the science  but it still depends mostly upon the people  on your education. We have our farmer schools. But the real success of course  is our band    because if a baby is born  we will play  so everyone's our family and you don't make trouble with your family. This is how it looks. We have this road going around the area  which brings the people electricity and water from our own area. We have the zone with the sugar palms  and then we have this fence with very thorny palms to keep the orangutans    that we provide with a place to live in the middle    and the people apart. And inside  we have this area for reforestation as a gene bank to keep all that material alive  because for the last    years not a single seedling of the tropical hardwood trees has grown up because the climatic triggers have disappeared. All the seeds get eaten. So now we do the monitoring on the inside    from towers  satellites  ultralights. Each of the families that have sold their land now get a piece of land back. And it has two nice fences of tropical hardwood trees    you have the shade trees planted in year one  then you underplanted with the sugar palms  and you plant this thorny fence. And after a few years  you can remove some of those shade trees. The people get that acacia timber which we have preserved with the bamboo peel  and they can build a house  they have some fuel wood to cook with. And they can start producing from the trees as many as they like. They have enough income for three families. But whatever you do in that program  it has to be fully supported by the people  meaning that you also have to adjust it to the local  cultural values. There is no simple one recipe for one place. You also have to make sure that it is very difficult to corrupt    that it's transparent. Like here  in Samboja Lestari  we divide that ring in groups of    families. If one member trespasses the agreement  and does cut down trees  the other    members have to decide what's going to happen to him. If the group doesn't take action  the other    groups have to decide what is going to happen to the group that doesn't comply with those great deals that we are offering them. In North Sulawesi it is the cooperative    they have a democratic culture there  so there you can use the local justice system to protect your system. In summary  if you look at it  in year one the people can sell their land to get income  but they get jobs back in the construction and the reforestation  the working with the orangutans  and they can use the waste wood to make handicraft. They also get free land in between the trees  where they can grow their crops. They can now sell part of those fruits to the orangutan project. They get building material for houses  a contract for selling the sugar  so we can produce huge amounts of ethanol and energy locally. They get all these other benefits  environmentally  money  they get education    it's a great deal. And everything is based upon that one thing    make sure that forest remains there. So if we want to help the orangutans    what I actually set out to do    we must make sure that the local people are the ones that benefit. Now I think the real key to doing it  to give a simple answer  is integration. I hope    if you want to know more  you can read more. Trees are wonderful arenas for discovery because of their tall stature  their complex structure  the biodiversity they foster and their quiet beauty. I used to climb trees for fun all the time and now  as a grown up  I have made my profession understanding trees and forests  through the medium of science. The most mysterious part of forests is the upper tree canopy. And Dr. Terry Erwin  in       called the canopy   the last biotic frontier.  I'd like to take you all on a journey up to the forest canopy  and share with you what canopy researchers are asking and also how they're communicating with other people outside of science. Let's start our journey on the forest floor of one of my study sites in Costa Rica. Because of the overhanging leaves and branches  you'll notice that the understory is very dark  it's very still. And what I'd like to do is take you up to the canopy  not by putting all of you into ropes and harnesses  but rather showing you a very short clip from a National Geographic film called  Heroes of the High Frontier.  This was filmed in Monteverde  Costa Rica and I think it gives us the best impression of what it's like to climb a giant strangler fig. So what you'll see up there is that it's really like the atmosphere of an open field  and there are tremendous numbers of plants and animals that have adapted to make their way and their life in the canopy. Common groups  like the sloth here  have clear adaptations for forest canopies  hanging on with their very strong claws. But I'd like to describe to you a more subtle kind of diversity and tell you about the ants. There are        species of ants that taxonomists    people who describe and name animals    have named.       of those ants live exclusively in the forest canopy. One of the reasons I tell you about ants is because of my husband  who is in fact an ant taxonomist and when we got married  he promised to name an ant after me  which he did    Procryptocerus nalini  a canopy ant. We've had two children  August Andrew and Erika and actually  he named ants after them. So we may be the only family that has an ant named after each one of us. But my passion    in addition to Jack and my children    are the plants  the so called epiphytes  those plants that grow up on trees. They don't have roots that go into trunks nor to the forest floor. But rather  it is their leaves that are adapted to intercept the dissolved nutrients that come to them in the form of mist and fog. These plants occur in great diversity  over        species around the world. They grow in tropical forests like this one and they also grow in temperate rainforests  that we find in Washington state. These epiphytes are mainly dominated by the mosses. One thing I want to point out is that underneath these live epiphytes  as they die and decompose  they actually construct an arboreal soil  both in the temperate zone and in the tropics. And these mosses  generated by decomposing  are like peat moss in your garden. They have a tremendous capacity for holding on to nutrients and water. One of the surprising things I discovered is that  if you pull back with me on those mats of epiphytes  what you'll find underneath them are connections  networks of what we call canopy roots. These are not epiphyte roots  these are roots that emerge from the trunk and branch of the host trees themselves. And so those epiphytes are actually paying the landlord a bit of rent in exchange for being supported high above the forest floor. I was interested  and my canopy researcher colleagues have been interested in the dynamics of the canopy plants that live in the forest. We've done stripping experiments where we've removed mats of epiphytes and looked at the rates of recolonization. We had predicted that they would grow back very quickly and that they would come in encroaching from the side. What we found  however  was that they took an extremely long time    over    years    to regenerate  starting from the bottom and growing up. And even now  after    years  they're not up there  they have not recolonized completely. And I use this little image to say this is what happens to mosses. If it's gone  it's gone  and if you're really lucky you might get something growing back from the bottom. So  recolonization is really very slow. These canopy communities are fragile. Well  when we look out  you and I  over that canopy of the intact primary forest  what we see is this enormous carpet of carbon. One of the challenges that canopy researchers are attacking today is trying to understand the amount of carbon that is being sequestered. We know it's a lot  but we do not yet know the answers to how much  and by what processes  carbon is being taken out of the atmosphere  held in its biomass  and moving on through the ecosystem. So I hope I've showed you that canopy dwellers are not just insignificant bits of green up high in the canopy that Tarzan and Jane were interested in  but rather that they foster biodiversity contribute to ecosystem nutrient cycles  and they also help to keep our global climate stable. Up in the canopy  if you were sitting next to me and you turned around from those primary forest ecosystems  you would also see scenes like this. Scenes of forest destruction  forest harvesting and forest fragmentation  thereby making that intact tapestry of the canopy unable to function in the marvelous ways that it has when it is not disturbed by humans. I've also looked out on urban places like this and thought about people who are disassociated from trees in their lives. People who grew up in a place like this did not have the opportunity to climb trees and form a relationship with trees and forests  as I did when I was a young girl. This troubles me. Here in       you know  it's not an easy thing to be a forest ecologist  gripping ourselves with these kinds of questions and trying to figure out how we can answer them. And especially  you know  as a small brown woman in a little college  in the upper northwest part of our country  far away from the areas of power and money  I really have to ask myself   What can I do about this  How can I reconnect people with trees   Well  I think that I can do something. I know that as a scientist  I have information and as a human being  I can communicate with anybody  inside or outside of academia. And so  that's what I've begin doing  and so I'd like to unveil the International Canopy Network here. We consult to the media about canopy questions  we have a canopy newsletter  we have an email LISTSERV. And so we're trying to disseminate information about the importance of the canopy  the beauty of the canopy  the necessity of intact canopies  to people outside of academia. We also recognize that a lot of the products that we make    those videos and so forth    you know  they don't reach everybody  and so we've been fostering projects that reach people outside of academia  and outside of the choir that most ecologists preach to. Treetop Barbie is a great example of that. What we do  my students in my lab and I  is we buy Barbies from Goodwill and Value Village  we dress her in clothes that have been made by seamstresses and we send her out with a canopy handbook. And my feeling is    Thank you.    that we've taken this pop icon and we have just tweaked her a little bit to become an ambassador who can carry the message that being a woman scientist studying treetops is actually a really great thing. We've also made partnerships with artists  with people who understand and can communicate the aesthetic beauty of trees and forest canopies. And I'd like to just tell you one of our projects  which is the generation of Canopy Confluences. What I do is I bring together scientists and artists of all kinds  and we spend a week in the forest on these little platforms  and we look at nature  we look at trees  we look at the canopy  and we communicate  and exchange  and express what we see together. The results have been fantastic. I'll just give you a few examples. This is a fantastic installation by Bruce Chao who is chair of the Sculpture and Glass Blowing Department at Rhode Island School of Design. He saw nests in the canopy at one of our Canopy Confluences in the Pacific Northwest  and created this beautiful sculpture. We've had dance people up in the canopy. Jodi Lomask  and her wonderful troupe Capacitor  joined me in the canopy in my rainforest site in Costa Rica. They made a fabulous dance called  Biome.  They danced in the forest  and we are taking this dance  my scientific outreach communications  and also linking up with environmental groups  to go to different cities and to perform the science  the dance and the environmental outreach that we hope will make a difference. We brought musicians to the canopy  and they made their music    and it's fantastic music. We had wooden flutists  we had oboists  we had opera singers  we had guitar players  and we had rap singers. And I brought a little segment to give you of Duke Brady's  Canopy Rap.  This experience of working with Duke also led me to initiate a program called Sound Science. I saw the power of Duke's song with urban youth    an audience  you know  I as a middle aged professor  I don't have a hope of getting to    in terms of convincing them of the importance of wildlands. So I engaged Caution  this rap singer  with a group of young people from inner city Tacoma. We went out to the forest  I would pick up a branch  Caution would rap on it  and suddenly that branch was really cool. And then the students would come into our sound studios  they would make their own rap songs with their own beats. They ended up making a CD which they took home to their family and friends  thereby expressing their own experiences with nature in their own medium. The final project I'll talk about is one that's very close to my heart  and it involves an economic and social value that is associated with epiphytic plants. In the Pacific Northwest  there's a whole industry of moss harvesting from old growth forests. These mosses are taken from the forest  they're used by the floriculture industry  by florists  to make arrangements and make hanging baskets. It's a     million dollar industry and it's increasing rapidly. If you remember that bald guy  you'll know that what has been stripped off of these trunks in the Pacific Northwest old growth forest is going to take decades and decades to come back. So this whole industry is unsustainable. What can I  as an ecologist  do about that  Well  my thought was that I could learn how to grow mosses  and that way we wouldn't have to take them out of the wild. And I thought  if I had some partners that could help me with this  that would be great. And so  I thought perhaps incarcerated men and women    who don't have access to nature  who often have a lot of time  they often have space  and you don't need any sharp tools to work with mosses    would be great partners. And they have become excellent partners. The best I can imagine. They were very enthusiastic. They were incredibly enthusiastic about the work. They learned how to distinguish different species of mosses  which  to tell you the truth  is a lot more than my undergraduate students at the Evergreen College can do. And they embraced the idea that they could help develop a research design in order to grow these mosses. We've been successful as partners in figuring out which species grow the fastest  and I've just been overwhelmed with how successful this has been. Because the prison wardens were very enthusiastic about this as well  I started a Science and Sustainability Seminar in the prisons. I brought my scientific colleagues and sustainability practitioners into the prison. We gave talks once a month  and that actually ended up implementing some amazing sustainability projects at the prisons    organic gardens  worm culture  recycling  water catchment and beekeeping.  Applause  Our latest endeavor  with a grant from the Department of Corrections at Washington state  they've asked us to expand this program to three more prisons. And our new project is having the inmates and ourselves learn how to raise the Oregon spotted frog which is a highly endangered amphibian in Washington state and Oregon. So they will raise them    in captivity  of course    from eggs to tadpoles and onward to frogs. And they will have the pleasure  many of them  of seeing those frogs that they've raised from eggs and helped develop  helped nurture  move out into protected wildlands to augment the number of endangered species out there in the wild. And so  I think for many reasons    ecological  social  economic and perhaps even spiritual    this has been a tremendous project and I'm really looking forward to not only myself and my students doing it  but also to promote and teach other scientists how to do this. As many of you are aware  the world of academia is a rather inward looking one. I'm trying to help researchers move more outward to have their own partnerships with people outside of the academic community. And so I'm hoping that my husband Jack  the ant taxonomist  can perhaps work with Mattel to make Taxonomist Ken. Perhaps Ben Zander and Bill Gates could get together and make an opera about AIDS. Or perhaps Al Gore and Naturally   could make a song about climate change that would really make you clap your hands. So  although it's a little bit of a fantasy  I think it's also a reality. Given the duress that we're feeling environmentally in these times  it is time for scientists to reach outward  and time for those outside of science to reach towards academia as well. I started my career with trying to understand the mysteries of forests with the tools of science. By making these partnerships that I described to you  I have really opened my mind and  I have to say  my heart to have a greater understanding  to make other discoveries about nature and myself. When I look into my heart  I see trees    this is actually an image of a real heart    there are trees in our hearts  there are trees in your hearts. When we come to understand nature  we are touching the most deep  the most important parts of our self. In these partnerships  I have also learned that people tend to compartmentalize themselves into IT people  and movie star people  and scientists  but when we share nature  when we share our perspectives about nature  we find a common denominator. Finally  as a scientist and as a person and now  as part of the TED community  I feel that I have better tools to go out to trees  to go out to forests  to go out to nature  to make new discoveries about nature    and about humans' place in nature wherever we are and whomever you are. Thank you very much. The  Dirty Jobs  crew and I were called to a little town in Colorado  called Craig. It's only a couple dozen square miles. It's in the Rockies. And the job in question was sheep rancher. My role on the show  for those of you who haven't seen it    it's pretty simple. I'm an apprentice  and I work with the people who actually do the jobs in question. And my responsibilities are to simply try and keep up and give an honest account of what it's like to be these people  for one day in their life. The job in question  herding sheep. Great. We go to Craig and we check in to a hotel and I realize the next day that castration is going to be an absolute part of this work. So  normally  I never do any research at all. But  this is a touchy subject  and I work for the Discovery Channel  and we want to portray accurately whatever it is we do  and we certainly want to do it with a lot of respect for the animals. So I called the Humane Society and I say   Look  I'm going to be castrating some lambs  Can you tell me the deal   And they're like   Yeah  it's pretty straightforward.  They use a band    basically a rubber band  like this  only a little smaller. This one was actually around the playing cards I got yesterday  but it had a certain familiarity to it. And I said   Well  what exactly is the process   And they said   The band is applied to the tail  tightly. And then another band is applied to the scrotum  tightly. Blood flow is slowly retarded  a week later the parts in question fall off.  Great    got it.  OK  I call the SPCA to confirm this    they confirm it. I also call PETA  just for fun  and they don't like it    but they confirm it. OK  that's basically how you do it. So the next day I go out. And I'm given a horse and we go get the lambs and we take them to a pen that we built  and we go about the business of animal husbandry. Melanie is the wife of Albert. Albert is the shepherd in question. Melanie picks up the lamb    two hands    one hand on both legs on the right  likewise on the left. Lamb goes on the post  she opens it up. Alright. Great. Albert goes in  I follow Albert  the crew is around. I always watch the process done the first time before I try it. Being an apprentice  you know  you do that. Albert reaches in his pocket to pull out  you know  this black rubber band but what comes out instead is a knife. And I'm like that's not rubber at all  you know. And he kind of flicked it open in a way that caught the sun that was just coming over the Rockies  it was very    it was  it was impressive. In the space of about two seconds  Albert had the knife between the cartilage of the tail  right next to the butt of the lamb  and very quickly the tail was gone and in the bucket that I was holding. A second later  with a big thumb and a well calloused forefinger  he had the scrotum firmly in his grasp. And he pulled it toward him  like so  and he took the knife and he put it on the tip. Now you think you know what's coming  Michael    you don't  OK  He snips it  throws the tip over his shoulder  and then grabs the scrotum and pushes it upward  and then his head dips down  obscuring my view  but what I hear is a slurping sound  and a noise that sounds like Velcro being yanked off a sticky wall and I am not even kidding. Can we roll the video  No I'm kidding    we don't    I thought it best to talk in pictures. So  I do something now I've never ever done on a  Dirty Jobs  shoot  ever. I say   Time out. Stop.  You guys know the show  we use take one  we don't do take two. There's no writing  there's no scripting  there's no nonsense. We don't fool around  we don't rehearse    we shoot what we get  I said   Stop. This is nuts.  I mean  you know.  This is crazy. We can't do this.  And Albert's like   What   And I'm like   I don't know what just happened  but there are testicles in this bucket and that's not how we do it.  And he said  Well  that's how we do it.  And I said   Why would you do it this way   And before I even let him explain  I said   I want to do it the right way  with the rubber bands.  And he says   Like the Humane Society   And I said   Yes  like the Humane Society. Let's do something that doesn't make the lamb squeal and bleed    we're on in five continents  dude. We're on twice a day on the Discovery Channel    we can't do this.  He says   OK.  He goes to his box and he pulls out a bag of these little rubber bands. Melanie picks up another lamb  puts it on the post  band goes on the tail  band goes on the scrotum. Lamb goes on the ground  lamb takes two steps  falls down  gets up  shakes a little  takes another couple steps  falls down. I'm like  this is not a good sign for this lamb  at all. Gets up  walks to the corner  it's quivering  and it lies down and it's in obvious distress. And I'm looking at the lamb and I say   Albert  how long  When does he get up   He's like   A day.  I said   A day  How long does it take them to fall off    A week.  Meanwhile  the lamb that he had just did his little procedure on is  you know  he's just prancing around  bleeding stopped. He's  you know  nibbling on some grass  frolicking. And I was just so blown away at how wrong I was  in that second. And I was reminded how utterly wrong I am  so much of the time. And I was especially reminded of what an ridiculously short straw I had that day because now I had to do what Albert had just done  and there are like     of these lambs in the pen  and suddenly this whole thing's starting to feel like a German porno  and I'm like ...  Laughter  Melanie picks up the lamb  puts it on the post  opens it up. Albert hands me the knife. I go in  tail comes off. I go in  I grab the scrotum  tip comes off. Albert instructs   Push it way up there.  I do.  Push it further.  I do. The testicles emerge    they look like thumbs  coming right at you    and he says   Bite 'em. Just bite 'em off.  And I heard him  I heard all the words. Like  how did    how did I get here  How did    you know    I mean    how did I get here  It's just    it's one of those moments where the brain goes off on it's own  and suddenly  I'm standing there  in the Rockies  and all I can think of is the Aristotelian definition of a tragedy. You know  Aristotle says a tragedy is that moment when the hero comes face to face with his true identity. And I'm like   What is this jacked up metaphor  I don't like what I'm thinking right now.  And I can't get this thought out of my head  and I can't get that vision out of my sight  so I did what I had to do. I went in and I took them. I took them like this  and I yanked my face back. And I'm standing there with two testicles on my chin. And now I can't get    I can't shake the metaphor. OK  I'm still in  Poetics   in Aristotle  and I'm thinking    out of nowhere  two terms come crashing into my head that I haven't heard since my classics professor in college drilled them there. And they are anagnorisis and peripeteia. Anagnorisis and peripeteia. Anagnorisis is the Greek word for discovery. Literally  the transition from ignorance to knowledge is anagnorisis. It's what our network does  it's what  Dirty Jobs  is. And I'm up to my neck in anagnorises every single day. Great. The other word  peripeteia  that's the moment in the great tragedies  you know    Euripides and Sophocles    the moment where Oedipus has his moment  where he suddenly realizes that hot chick he's been sleeping with and having babies with is his mother. OK. That's peripety or peripeteia. And this metaphor in my head    I got anagnorisis and peripetia on my chin. I got to tell you  it's such a great device though. When you start to look for peripetia  you find it everywhere. I mean  Bruce Willis in  The Sixth Sense   right  Spends the whole movie trying to help the little kid who sees dead people  and then  boom     Oh  I'm dead     peripetia. You know  It's crushing when the audience sees it the right way. Neo in  The Matrix   you know   Oh  I'm living in a computer program     that's weird. These discoveries that lead to sudden realizations  and I've been having them  over     dirty jobs  I have them all the time  but that one    that one drilled something home in a way that I just wasn't prepared for. And  as I stood there  looking at the happy lamb that I had just defiled    but it looked OK. Looking at that poor other little thing that I'd done it the right way on  and I just was struck by if I'm wrong about that and if I'm wrong so often  in a literal way  what other peripatetic misconceptions might I be able to comment upon  Because  look  I'm not a social anthropologist but I have a friend who is. And I talk to him. And he says   Hey Mike. Look  I don't know if your brain is interested in this sort of thing or not  but do you realize you've shot in every state  You've worked in mining  you've worked in fishing  you've worked in steel  you've worked in every major industry. You've had your back shoulder to shoulder with these guys that our politicians are desperate to relate to every four years  right   I can still see Hillary doing the shots of rye  dribbling down her chin  with the steel workers. I mean  these are the people that I work with every single day.  And if you have something to say about their thoughts  collectively  it might be time to think about it. Because  dude  you know  four years.  You know  that's in my head  testicles are on my chin  thoughts are bouncing around. And  after that shoot  Dirty Jobs really didn't change  in terms of what the show is  but it changed for me  personally. And now  when I talk about the show  I no longer just tell the story you heard and     like it. I do  but I also start to talk about some of the other things I got wrong  some of the other notions of work that I've just been assuming are sacrosanct  and they're not. People with dirty jobs are happier than you think. As a group  they're the happiest people I know. And I don't want to start whistling  Look for the Union Label   and all that happy worker crap. I'm just telling you that these are balanced people who do unthinkable work. Roadkill picker uppers whistle while they work. I swear to God    I did it with them. They've got this amazing sort of symmetry to their life. And I see it over and over and over again. So I started to wonder what would happen if we challenged some of these sacred cows. Follow your passion    we've been talking about it here for the last    hours. Follow your passion    what could possibly be wrong with that  Probably the worst advice I ever got. You know  follow your dreams and go broke  right  I mean  that's all I heard growing up. I didn't know what to do with my life  but I was told if you follow your passion  it's going to work out. I can give you    examples  right now    Bob Combs  the pig farmer in Las Vegas who collects the uneaten scraps of food from the casinos and feeds them them to his swine. Why  Because there's so much protein in the stuff we don't eat his pigs grow at twice the normal speed  and he is one rich pig farmer  and he is good for the environment  and he spends his days doing this incredible service  and he smells like hell  but God bless him. He's making a great living. You ask him   Did you follow your passion here   and he'd laugh at you. The guy's worth    he just got offered like    million dollars for his farm and turned it down  outside of Vegas. He didn't follow his passion. He stepped back and he watched where everybody was going and he went the other way. And I hear that story over and over. Matt Froind  a dairy farmer in New Canaan  Connecticut  who woke up one day and realized the crap from his cows was worth more than their milk  if he could use it to make these biodegradable flower pots. Now  he's selling them to Walmart. Follow his passion  The guy's    come on. So I started to look at passion  I started to look at efficiency versus effectiveness    as Tim talked about earlier  that's a huge distinction. I started to look at teamwork and determination  and basically all those platitudes they call  successories  that hang with that schmaltzy art in boardrooms around the world right now. That stuff    it's suddenly all been turned on its head. Safety    safety first  Going back to  you know  OSHA and PETA and the Humane Society  what if OSHA got it wrong  I mean    this is heresy  what I'm about to say    but what if it's really safety third  Right  No  I mean really. What I mean to say is I value my safety on these crazy jobs as much as the people that I'm working with  but the ones who really get it done  they're not out there talking about safety first. They know that other things come first    the business of doing the work comes first  the business of getting it done. And I'll never forget  up in the Bering Sea  I was on a crab boat with the  Deadliest Catch  guys    which I also work on    in the first season. We're about     miles off the coast of Russia     foot seas  big waves  green water coming over the wheelhouse  right  Most hazardous environment I'd ever seen  and I was back with a guy  lashing the pots down. So  I'm    feet off the deck  which is like looking down at the top of your shoe  you know  and it's doing this in the ocean. Unspeakably dangerous. I scamper down  I go into the wheelhouse and I say  with some level of incredulity   Captain  OSHA.  And he says   OSHA  Ocean.  And he points out there. But in that moment  what he said next can't be repeated in the lower   . It can't be repeated on any factory floor or any construction site. But he looked at me  and he said   Son     he's my age  by the way  he calls me son  I love that    he says   Son  I'm a captain of a crab boat. My responsibility is not to get you home alive. My responsibility is to get you home rich.  You want to get home alive  that's on you. And for the rest of that day  safety first. I was like    So  the idea that we create this false    this sense of complacency when all we do is talk about somebody else's responsibility as though it's our own  and vice versa. Anyhow  a whole lot of things. I could talk at length about the many little distinctions we made and the endless list of ways that I got it wrong. But  what it all comes down to is this. I formed a theory  and I'm going to share it now in my remaining two minutes and    seconds. It goes like this    we've declared war on work  as a society  all of us. It's a civil war. It's a cold war  really. We didn't set out to do it and we didn't twist our mustache in some Machiavellian way  but we've done it. And we've waged this war on at least four fronts  certainly in Hollywood. The way we portray working people on TV    it's laughable. If there's a plumber  he's     pounds and he's got a giant butt crack. Admit it. You see him all the time. That's what plumbers look like  right  We turn them into heroes  or we turn them into punch lines. That's what TV does. We try hard on  Dirty Jobs  not to do that  which is why I do the work and I don't cheat. But  we've waged this war on Madison Avenue. I mean  so many of the commercials that come out there    in the way of a message  what's really being said  Your life would be better if you could work a little less  if you didn't have to work so hard  if you could get home a little earlier  if you could retire a little faster  if you could punch out a little sooner    it's all in there  over and over  again and again. Washington  I can't even begin to talk about the deals and policies in place that affect the bottom line reality of the available jobs because I don't really know. I just know that that's a front in this war. And right here guys  Silicon Valley  I mean    how many people have an iPhone on them right now  How many people have their Blackberries  We're plugged in  we're connected. I would never suggest for a second that something bad has come out of the tech revolution. Good grief  not to this crowd. But I would suggest that innovation without imitation is a complete waste of time. And nobody celebrates imitation the way  Dirty Jobs  guys know it has to be done. Your iPhone without those people making the same interface  the same circuitry  the same board  over and over  All of that  That's what makes it equally as possible as the genius that goes inside of it. So  we've got this new toolbox  you know. Our tools today don't look like shovels and picks. They look like the stuff we walk around with. And so the collective effect of all of that has been this marginalization of lots and lots of jobs. And I realized  probably too late in this game    I hope not  because I don't know if I can do     more of these things    but we're going to do as many as we can. And to me the most important thing to know and to really come face to face with  is that fact that I got it wrong about a lot of things  not just the testicles on my chin. I got a lot wrong. So  we're thinking    by we  I mean me    that the thing to do is to talk about a PR campaign for work  manual labor  skilled labor. Somebody needs to be out there talking about the forgotten benefits. I'm talking about grandfather stuff  the stuff a lot us probably grew up with but we've kind of    you know  kind of lost a little. Barack wants to create two and a half million jobs. The infrastructure is a huge deal. This war on work  that I suppose exists  has casualties like any other war. The infrastructure's the first one  declining trade school enrollments are the second one. Every single year  fewer electricians  fewer carpenters  fewer plumbers  fewer welders  fewer pipefitters  fewer steamfitters. The infrastructure jobs that everybody is talking about creating are those guys    the ones that have been in decline  over and over. Meanwhile  we've got two trillion dollars    at a minimum  according to the American Society of Civil Engineers    that we need to expend to even make a dent in the infrastructure  which is currently rated at a D minus. So  if I were running for anything  and I'm not  I would simply say that the jobs we hope to make and the jobs we hope to create aren't going to stick unless they're jobs that people want. And I know the point of this conference is to celebrate things that are near and dear to us  but I also know that clean and dirty aren't opposites. They're two sides of the same coin  just like innovation and imitation  like risk and responsibility  like peripetia and anagnorisis  like that poor little lamb  who I hope isn't quivering anymore  and like my time that's gone. It's been great talking to you and get back to work  will you  The new me is beauty. Yeah  people used to say   Norman's OK  but if you followed what he said  everything would be usable but it would be ugly.  Well  I didn't have that in mind  so ... This is neat. Thank you for setting up my display. I mean  it's just wonderful. And I haven't the slightest idea of what it does or what it's good for  but I want it. And that's my new life. My new life is trying to understand what beauty is about  and  pretty   and  emotions.  The new me is all about making things kind of neat and fun. And so this is a Philippe Starck juicer  produced by Alessi. It's just neat  it's fun. It's so much fun I have it in my house    but I have it in the entryway  I don't use it to make juice. In fact  I bought the gold plated special edition and it comes with a little slip of paper that says   Don't use this juicer to make juice.  The acid will ruin the gold plating. So actually  I took a carton of orange juice and I poured it in the glass to take this picture. Beneath it is a wonderful knife. It's a Global cutting knife made in Japan. First of all  look at the shape    it's just wonderful to look at. Second of all  it's really beautifully balanced  it holds well  it feels well. And third of all  it's so sharp  it just cuts. It's a delight to use. And so it's got everything  right  It's beautiful and it's functional. And I can tell you stories about it  which makes it reflective  and so you'll see I have a theory of emotion. And those are the three components. Hiroshi Ishii and his group at the MIT Media Lab took a ping pong table and placed a projector above it  and on the ping pong table they projected an image of water with fish swimming in it. And as you play ping pong  whenever the ball hits part of the table  the ripples spread out and the fish run away. But of course  then the ball hits the other side  the ripples hit the    poor fish  they can't find any peace and quiet. Is that a good way to play ping pong  No. But is it fun  Yeah  Yeah. Or look at Google. If you type in  oh say   emotion and design   you get    pages of results. So Google just took their logo and they spread it out. Instead of saying   You got        results. This is one through   . Next   they just give you as many o's as there are pages. It's really simple and subtle. I bet a lot of you have seen it and never noticed it. That's the subconscious mind that sort of notices it    it probably is kind of pleasant and you didn't know why. And it's just clever. And of course  what's especially good is  if you type  design and emotion   the first response out of those    pages is my website. Now  the weird thing is Google lies  because if I type  design and emotion   it says   You don't need the 'and.' We do it anyway.  So  OK. So I type  design emotion  and my website wasn't first again. It was third. Oh well  different story. There was this wonderful review in The New York Times about the MINI Cooper automobile. It said   You know  this is a car that has lots of faults. Buy it anyway. It's so much fun to drive.  And if you look at the inside of the car    I mean  I loved it  I wanted to see it  I rented it  this is me taking a picture while my son is driving    and the inside of the car  the whole design is fun. It's round  it's neat. The controls work wonderfully. So that's my new life  it's all about fun. I really have the feeling that pleasant things work better  and that never made any sense to me until I finally figured out    look ... I'm going to put a plank on the ground. So  imagine I have a plank about two feet wide and    feet long and I'm going to walk on it  and you see I can walk on it without looking  I can go back and forth and I can jump up and down. No problem. Now I'm going to put the plank     feet in the air    and I'm not going to go near it  thank you. Intense fear paralyzes you. It actually affects the way the brain works. So  Paul Saffo  before his talk said that he didn't really have it down until just a few days or hours before the talk  and that anxiety was really helpful in causing him to focus. That's what fear and anxiety does  it causes you to be    what's called depth first processing    to focus  not be distracted. And I couldn't force myself across that. Now some people can    circus workers  steel workers. But it really changes the way you think. And then  a psychologist  Alice Isen  did this wonderful experiment. She brought students in to solve problems. So  she'd bring people into the room  and there'd be a string hanging down here and a string hanging down here. It was an empty room  except for a table with a bunch of crap on it    some papers and scissors and stuff. And she'd bring them in  and she'd say   This is an IQ test and it determines how well you do in life. Would you tie those two strings together   So they'd take one string and they'd pull it over here and they couldn't reach the other string. Still can't reach it. And  basically  none of them could solve it. You bring in a second group of people  and you say   Oh  before we start  I got this box of candy  and I don't eat candy. Would you like the box of candy   And turns out they liked it  and it made them happy    not very happy  but a little bit of happy. And guess what    they solved the problem. And it turns out that when you're anxious you squirt neural transmitters in the brain  which focuses you makes you depth first. And when you're happy    what we call positive valence    you squirt dopamine into the prefrontal lobes  which makes you a breadth first problem solver  you're more susceptible to interruption  you do out of the box thinking. That's what brainstorming is about  right  With brainstorming we make you happy  we play games  and we say   No criticism   and you get all these weird  neat ideas. But in fact  if that's how you always were you'd never get any work done because you'd be working along and say   Oh  I got a new way of doing it.  So to get work done  you've got to set a deadline  right  You've got be anxious. The brain works differently if you're happy. Things work better because you're more creative. You get a little problem  you say   Ah  I'll figure it out.  No big deal. There's something I call the visceral level of processing  and there will be visceral level design. Biology    we have co adapted through biology to like bright colors. That's especially good that mammals and primates like fruits and bright plants  because you eat the fruit and you thereby spread the seed. There's an amazing amount of stuff that's built into the brain. We dislike bitter tastes  we dislike loud sounds  we dislike hot temperatures  cold temperatures. We dislike scolding voices. We dislike frowning faces  we like symmetrical faces  etc.  etc. So that's the visceral level. In design  you can express visceral in lots of ways  like the choice of type fonts and the red for hot  exciting. Or the      Jaguar  It's actually a crummy car  falls apart all the time  but the owners love it. And it's beautiful    it's in the Museum of Modern Art. A water bottle  You buy it because of the bottle  not because of the water. And when people are finished  they don't throw it away. They keep it for    you know  it's like the old wine bottles  you keep it for decoration or maybe fill it with water again  which proves it's not the water. It's all about the visceral experience. The middle level of processing is the behavioral level and that's actually where most of our stuff gets done. Visceral is subconscious  you're unaware of it. Behavioral is subconscious  you're unaware of it. Almost everything we do is subconscious. I'm walking around the stage    I'm not attending to the control of my legs. I'm doing a lot  most of my talk is subconscious  it has been rehearsed and thought about a lot. Most of what we do is subconscious. Automatic behavior    skilled behavior    is subconscious  controlled by the behavioral side. And behavioral design is all about feeling in control  which includes usability  understanding    but also the feel and heft. That's why the Global knives are so neat. They're so nicely balanced  so sharp  that you really feel you're in control of the cutting. Or  just driving a high performance sports car over a demanding curb    again  feeling that you are in complete control of the environment. Or the sensual feeling. This is a Kohler shower  a waterfall shower  and actually  all those knobs beneath are also showerheads. It will squirt you all around and you can stay in that shower for hours    and not waste water  by the way  because it recirculates the same dirty water. Or this    this is a really neat teapot I found at high tea at The Four Seasons Hotel in Chicago. It's a Ronnefeldt tilting teapot. That's kind of what the teapot looks like but the way you use it is you lay it on its back  and you put tea in  and then you fill it with water. The water then seeps over the tea. And the tea is sitting in this stuff to the right    the tea is to the right of this line. There's a little ledge inside  so the tea is sitting there and the water is filling it up like that. And when the tea is ready  or almost ready  you tilt it. And that means the tea is partially covered while it completes the brewing. And when it's finished  you put it vertically  and now the tea is    you remember    above this line and the water only comes to here    and so it keeps the tea out. On top of that  it communicates  which is what emotion does. Emotion is all about acting  emotion is really about acting. It's being safe in the world. Cognition is about understanding the world  emotion is about interpreting it    saying good  bad  safe  dangerous  and getting us ready to act  which is why the muscles tense or relax. And that's why we can tell the emotion of somebody else    because their muscles are acting  subconsciously  except that we've evolved to make the facial muscles really rich with emotion. Well  this has emotions if you like  because it signals the waiter that   Hey  I'm finished. See    upright.  And the waiter can come by and say   Would you like more water   It's kind of neat. What a wonderful design. And the third level is reflective  which is  if you like the superego  it's a little part of the brain that has no control over what you do  no control over the    doesn't see the senses  doesn't control the muscles. It looks over what's going on. It's that little voice in your head that's watching and saying   That's good. That's bad.  Or   Why are you doing that  I don't understand.  It's that little voice in your head that's the seat of consciousness. Here's a great reflective product. Owners of the Hummer have said   You know I've owned many cars in my life    all sorts of exotic cars  but never have I had a car that attracted so much attention.  It's about attention. It's about their image  not about the car. If you want a more positive model    this is the GM car. And the reason you might buy it now is because you care about the environment. And you'll buy it to protect the environment  even though the first few cars are going to be really expensive and not perfected. But that's reflective design as well. Or an expensive watch  so you can impress people     Oh gee  I didn't know you had that watch.  As opposed to this one  which is a pure behavioral watch  which probably keeps better time than the         watch I just showed you. But it's ugly. This is a clear Don Norman watch. And what's neat is sometimes you pit one emotion against the other  the visceral fear of falling against the reflective state saying   It's OK. It's OK. It's safe. It's safe.  If that amusement park were rusty and falling apart  you'd never go on the ride. So  it's pitting one against the other. The other neat thing ... So Jake Cress is this furniture maker  and he makes this unbelievable set of furniture. And this is his chair with claw  and the poor little chair has lost its ball and it's trying to get it back before anybody notices. And what's so neat about it is how you accept that story. And that's what's nice about emotion. So that's the new me. I'm only saying positive things from now on. I've been intrigued by this question of whether we could evolve or develop a sixth sense    a sense that would give us seamless access and easy access to meta information or information that may exist somewhere that may be relevant to help us make the right decision about whatever it is that we're coming across. And some of you may argue   Well  don't today's cell phones do that already   But I would say no. When you meet someone here at TED    and this is the top networking place  of course  of the year    you don't shake somebody's hand and then say   Can you hold on for a moment while I take out my phone and Google you   Or when you go to the supermarket and you're standing there in that huge aisle of different types of toilet papers  you don't take out your cell phone  and open a browser  and go to a website to try to decide which of these different toilet papers is the most ecologically responsible purchase to make. So we don't really have easy access to all this relevant information that can just help us make optimal decisions about what to do next and what actions to take. And so my research group at the Media Lab has been developing a series of inventions to give us access to this information in a sort of easy way  without requiring that the user changes any of their behavior. And I'm here to unveil our latest effort  and most successful effort so far  which is still very much a work in process. I'm actually wearing the device right now and we've sort of cobbled it together with components that are off the shelf    and that  by the way  only cost     dollars at this point in time. I'm wearing a camera  just a simple web cam  a portable  battery powered projection system with a little mirror. These components communicate to my cell phone in my pocket which acts as the communication and computation device. And in the video here we see my student Pranav Mistry  who's really the genius who's been implementing and designing this whole system. And we see how this system lets him walk up to any surface and start using his hands to interact with the information that is projected in front of him. The system tracks the four significant fingers. In this case  he's wearing simple marker caps that you may recognize. But if you want a more stylish version  you could also paint your nails in different colors. And the camera basically tracks these four fingers and recognizes any gestures that he's making so he can just go to  for example  a map of Long Beach  zoom in and out  etc. The system also recognizes iconic gestures such as the  take a picture  gesture  and then takes a picture of whatever is in front of you. And when he then walks back to the Media Lab  he can just go up to any wall and project all the pictures that he's taken  sort through them and organize them  and re size them  etc.  again using all natural gestures. So  some of you most likely were here two years ago and saw the demo by Jeff Han  or some of you may think   Well  doesn't this look like the Microsoft Surface Table   And yes  you also interact using natural gestures  both hands  etc. But the difference here is that you can use any surface  you can walk up to any surface  including your hand  if nothing else is available  and interact with this projected data. The device is completely portable  and can be    So  one important difference is that it's totally mobile. Another even more important difference is that in mass production  this would not cost more tomorrow than today's cell phones and would actually not sort of be a bigger packaging    could look a lot more stylish than this version that I'm wearing around my neck. But other than letting some of you live out your fantasy of looking as cool as Tom Cruise in  Minority Report   the reason why we're really excited about this device is that it really can act as one of these sixth sense devices that gives you relevant information about whatever is in front of you. So we see Pranav here going into the supermarket and he's shopping for some paper towels. And  as he picks up a product  the system can recognize the product that he's picking up  using either image recognition or marker technology  and give him the green light or an orange light. He can ask for additional information. So this particular choice here is a particularly good choice  given his personal criteria. Some of you may want the toilet paper with the most bleach in it rather than the most ecologically responsible choice. If he picks up a book in the bookstore  he can get an Amazon rating    it gets projected right on the cover of the book. This is Juan's book  our previous speaker  which gets a great rating  by the way  at Amazon. And so  Pranav turns the page of the book and can then see additional information about the book    reader comments  maybe sort of information by his favorite critic  etc. If he turns to a particular page  he finds an annotation by maybe an expert or a friend of ours that gives him a little bit of additional information about whatever is on that particular page. Reading the newspaper    it never has to be outdated. You can get video annotations of the events that you're reading about. You can get the latest sports scores  etc. This is a more controversial one. As you interact with someone at TED  maybe you can see a word cloud of the tags  the words that are associated with that person in their blog and personal web pages. In this case  the student is interested in cameras  etc. On your way to the airport  if you pick up your boarding pass  it can tell you that your flight is delayed  that the gate has changed  etc. And  if you need to know what the current time is  it's as simple as drawing a watch    on your arm. So that's where we're at so far in developing this sixth sense that would give us seamless access to all this relevant information about the things that we may come across. My student Pranav  who's really  like I said  the genius behind this. He does deserve a lot of applause  because I don't think he's slept much in the last three months  actually. And his girlfriend is probably not very happy about him either. But it's not perfect yet  it's very much a work in progress. And who knows  maybe in another    years we'll be here with the ultimate sixth sense brain implant. Thank you. I was speaking to a group of about     kids  ages six to eight  at a children's museum  and I brought with me a bag full of legs  similar to the kinds of things you see up here  and had them laid out on a table for the kids. And  from my experience  you know  kids are naturally curious about what they don't know  or don't understand  or is foreign to them. They only learn to be frightened of those differences when an adult influences them to behave that way  and maybe censors that natural curiosity  or you know  reins in the question asking in the hopes of them being polite little kids. So I just pictured a first grade teacher out in the lobby with these unruly kids  saying   Now  whatever you do  don't stare at her legs.  But  of course  that's the point. That's why I was there  I wanted to invite them to look and explore. So I made a deal with the adults that the kids could come in without any adults for two minutes on their own. The doors open  the kids descend on this table of legs  and they are poking and prodding  and they're wiggling toes  and they're trying to put their full weight on the sprinting leg to see what happens with that. And I said   Kids  really quickly    I woke up this morning  I decided I wanted to be able to jump over a house    nothing too big  two or three stories    but  if you could think of any animal  any superhero  any cartoon character  anything you can dream up right now  what kind of legs would you build me   And immediately a voice shouted   Kangaroo    No  no  no  Should be a frog    No. It should be Go Go Gadget    No  no  no  It should be the Incredibles.  And other things that I don't    aren't familiar with. And then  one eight year old said   Hey  why wouldn't you want to fly too   And the whole room  including me  was like   Yeah.  And just like that  I went from being a woman that these kids would have been trained to see as  disabled  to somebody that had potential that their bodies didn't have yet. Somebody that might even be super abled. Interesting. So some of you actually saw me at TED     years ago. And there's been a lot of talk about how life changing this conference is for both speakers and attendees  and I am no exception. TED literally was the launch pad to the next decade of my life's exploration. At the time  the legs I presented were groundbreaking in prosthetics. I had woven carbon fiber sprinting legs modeled after the hind leg of a cheetah  which you may have seen on stage yesterday. And also these very life like  intrinsically painted silicone legs. So at the time  it was my opportunity to put a call out to innovators outside the traditional medical prosthetic community to come bring their talent to the science and to the art of building legs. So that we can stop compartmentalizing form  function and aesthetic  and assigning them different values. Well  lucky for me  a lot of people answered that call. And the journey started  funny enough  with a TED conference attendee    Chee Pearlman  who hopefully is in the audience somewhere today. She was the editor then of a magazine called ID  and she gave me a cover story. This started an incredible journey. Curious encounters were happening to me at the time  I'd been accepting numerous invitations to speak on the design of the cheetah legs around the world. And people would come up to me after the conference  after my talk  men and women. And the conversation would go something like this   You know Aimee  you're very attractive. You don't look disabled.  I thought   Well  that's amazing  because I don't feel disabled.  And it really opened my eyes to this conversation that could be explored  about beauty. What does a beautiful woman have to look like  What is a sexy body  And interestingly  from an identity standpoint  what does it mean to have a disability  I mean  people    Pamela Anderson has more prosthetic in her body than I do. Nobody calls her disabled. So this magazine  through the hands of graphic designer Peter Saville  went to fashion designer Alexander McQueen  and photographer Nick Knight  who were also interested in exploring that conversation. So  three months after TED I found myself on a plane to London  doing my first fashion shoot  which resulted in this cover     Fashion able   Three months after that  I did my first runway show for Alexander McQueen on a pair of hand carved wooden legs made from solid ash. Nobody knew    everyone thought they were wooden boots. Actually  I have them on stage with me  grapevines  magnolias    truly stunning. Poetry matters. Poetry is what elevates the banal and neglected object to a realm of art. It can transform the thing that might have made people fearful into something that invites them to look  and look a little longer  and maybe even understand. I learned this firsthand with my next adventure. The artist Matthew Barney  in his film opus called the  The Cremaster Cycle.  This is where it really hit home for me    that my legs could be wearable sculpture. And even at this point  I started to move away from the need to replicate human ness as the only aesthetic ideal. So we made what people lovingly referred to as glass legs even though they're actually optically clear polyurethane  a.k.a. bowling ball material. Heavy  Then we made these legs that are cast in soil with a potato root system growing in them  and beetroots out the top  and a very lovely brass toe. That's a good close up of that one. Then another character was a half woman  half cheetah    a little homage to my life as an athlete.    hours of prosthetic make up to get into a creature that had articulated paws  claws and a tail that whipped around  like a gecko. And then another pair of legs we collaborated on were these    look like jellyfish legs  also polyurethane. And the only purpose that these legs can serve  outside the context of the film  is to provoke the senses and ignite the imagination. So whimsy matters. Today  I have over a dozen pair of prosthetic legs that various people have made for me  and with them I have different negotiations of the terrain under my feet  and I can change my height    I have a variable of five different heights. Today  I'm  '  . And I had these legs made a little over a year ago at Dorset Orthopedic in England and when I brought them home to Manhattan  my first night out on the town  I went to a very fancy party. And a girl was there who has known me for years at my normal  '  . Her mouth dropped open when she saw me  and she went   But you're so tall   And I said   I know. Isn't it fun   I mean  it's a little bit like wearing stilts on stilts  but I have an entirely new relationship to door jams that I never expected I would ever have. And I was having fun with it. And she looked at me  and she said   But  Aimee  that's not fair.  And the incredible thing was she really meant it. It's not fair that you can change your height  as you want it. And that's when I knew    that's when I knew that the conversation with society has changed profoundly in this last decade. It is no longer a conversation about overcoming deficiency. It's a conversation about augmentation. It's a conversation about potential. A prosthetic limb doesn't represent the need to replace loss anymore. It can stand as a symbol that the wearer has the power to create whatever it is that they want to create in that space. So people that society once considered to be disabled can now become the architects of their own identities and indeed continue to change those identities by designing their bodies from a place of empowerment. And what is exciting to me so much right now is that by combining cutting edge technology    robotics  bionics    with the age old poetry  we are moving closer to understanding our collective humanity. I think that if we want to discover the full potential in our humanity  we need to celebrate those heartbreaking strengths and those glorious disabilities that we all have. I think of Shakespeare's Shylock   If you prick us  do we not bleed  and if you tickle us  do we not laugh   It is our humanity  and all the potential within it  that makes us beautiful. Thank you. So  here we go  a flyby of play. It's got to be serious if the New York Times puts a cover story of their February   th Sunday magazine about play. At the bottom of this  it says   It's deeper than gender. Seriously  but dangerously fun. And a sandbox for new ideas about evolution.  Not bad  except if you look at that cover  what's missing  You see any adults  Well  lets go back to the   th century. This is a courtyard in Europe  and a mixture of     different kinds of play. All ages  solo play  body play  games  taunting. And there it is. And I think this is a typical picture of what it was like in a courtyard then. I think we may have lost something in our culture. So I'm gonna take you through what I think is a remarkable sequence. North of Churchill  Manitoba  in October and November  there's no ice on Hudson Bay. And this polar bear that you see  this      pound male  he's wild and fairly hungry. And Norbert Rosing  a German photographer  is there on scene  making a series of photos of these huskies  who are tethered. And from out of stage left comes this wild  male polar bear  with a predatory gaze. Any of you who've been to Africa or had a junkyard dog come after you  there is a fixed kind of predatory gaze that you know you're in trouble. But on the other side of that predatory gaze is a female husky in a play bow  wagging her tail. And something very unusual happens. That fixed behavior    which is rigid and stereotyped and ends up with a meal    changes. And this polar bear stands over the husky  no claws extended  no fangs taking a look. And they begin an incredible ballet. A play ballet. This is in nature  it overrides a carnivorous nature and what otherwise would have been a short fight to the death. And if you'll begin to look closely at the husky that's bearing her throat to the polar bear  and look a little more closely  they're in an altered state. They're in a state of play. And it's that state that allows these two creatures to explore the possible. They are beginning to do something that neither would have done without the play signals. And it is a marvelous example of how a differential in power can be overridden by a process of nature that's within all of us. Now how did I get involved in this  John mentioned that I've done some work with murderers  and I have. The Texas Tower murderer opened my eyes  in retrospect  when we studied his tragic mass murder  to the importance of play  in that that individual  by deep study  was found to have severe play deprivation. Charles Whitman was his name. And our committee  which consisted of a lot of hard scientists  did feel at the end of that study that the absence of play and a progressive suppression of developmentally normal play led him to be more vulnerable to the tragedy that he perpetrated. And that finding has stood the test of time    unfortunately even into more recent times  at Virginia Tech. And other studies of populations at risk sensitized me to the importance of play  but I didn't really understand what it was. And it was many years in taking play histories of individuals before I really began to recognize that I didn't really have a full understanding of it. And I don't think any of us has a full understanding of it  by any means. But there are ways of looking at it that I think can give you    give us all a taxonomy  a way of thinking about it. And this image is  for humans  the beginning point of play. When that mother and infant lock eyes  and the infant's old enough to have a social smile  what happens    spontaneously    is the eruption of joy on the part of the mother. And she begins to babble and coo and smile  and so does the baby. If we've got them wired up with an electroencephalogram  the right brain of each of them becomes attuned  so that the joyful emergence of this earliest of play scenes and the physiology of that is something we're beginning to get a handle on. And I'd like you to think that every bit of more complex play builds on this base for us humans. And so now I'm going to take you through sort of a way of looking at play  but it's never just singularly one thing. We're going to look at body play  which is a spontaneous desire to get ourselves out of gravity. This is a mountain goat. If you're having a bad day  try this  jump up and down  wiggle around    you're going to feel better. And you may feel like this character  who is also just doing it for its own sake. It doesn't have a particular purpose  and that's what's great about play. If its purpose is more important than the act of doing it  it's probably not play. And there's a whole other type of play  which is object play. And this Japanese macaque has made a snowball  and he or she's going to roll down a hill. And    they don't throw it at each other  but this is a fundamental part of being playful. The human hand  in manipulation of objects  is the hand in search of a brain  the brain is in search of a hand  and play is the medium by which those two are linked in the best way. JPL we heard this morning    JPL is an incredible place. They have located two consultants  Frank Wilson and Nate Johnson  who are    Frank Wilson is a neurologist  Nate Johnson is a mechanic. He taught mechanics in a high school in Long Beach  and found that his students were no longer able to solve problems. And he tried to figure out why. And he came to the conclusion  quite on his own  that the students who could no longer solve problems  such as fixing cars  hadn't worked with their hands. Frank Wilson had written a book called  The Hand.  They got together    JPL hired them. Now JPL  NASA and Boeing  before they will hire a research and development problem solver    even if they're summa cum laude from Harvard or Cal Tech    if they haven't fixed cars  haven't done stuff with their hands early in life  played with their hands  they can't problem solve as well. So play is practical  and it's very important. Now one of the things about play is that it is born by curiosity and exploration.  Laughter  But it has to be safe exploration. This happens to be OK    he's an anatomically interested little boy and that's his mom. Other situations wouldn't be quite so good. But curiosity  exploration  are part of the play scene. If you want to belong  you need social play. And social play is part of what we're about here today  and is a byproduct of the play scene. Rough and tumble play. These lionesses  seen from a distance  looked like they were fighting. But if you look closely  they're kind of like the polar bear and husky  no claws  flat fur  soft eyes  open mouth with no fangs  balletic movements  curvilinear movements    all specific to play. And rough and tumble play is a great learning medium for all of us. Preschool kids  for example  should be allowed to dive  hit  whistle  scream  be chaotic  and develop through that a lot of emotional regulation and a lot of the other social byproducts    cognitive  emotional and physical    that come as a part of rough and tumble play. Spectator play  ritual play    we're involved in some of that. Those of you who are from Boston know that this was the moment    rare    where the Red Sox won the World Series. But take a look at the face and the body language of everybody in this fuzzy picture  and you can get a sense that they're all at play. Imaginative play. I love this picture because my daughter  who's now almost     is in this picture  but it reminds me of her storytelling and her imagination  her ability to spin yarns at this age    preschool. A really important part of being a player is imaginative solo play. And I love this one  because it's also what we're about. We all have an internal narrative that's our own inner story. The unit of intelligibility of most of our brains is the story. I'm telling you a story today about play. Well  this bushman  I think  is talking about the fish that got away that was that long  but it's a fundamental part of the play scene. So what does play do for the brain  Well  a lot. We don't know a whole lot about what it does for the human brain  because funding has not been exactly heavy for research on play. I walked into the Carnegie asking for a grant. They'd given me a large grant when I was an academician for the study of felony drunken drivers  and I thought I had a pretty good track record  and by the time I had spent half an hour talking about play  it was obvious that they were not    did not feel that play was serious. I think that    that's a few years back    I think that wave is past  and the play wave is cresting  because there is some good science. Nothing lights up the brain like play. Three dimensional play fires up the cerebellum  puts a lot of impulses into the frontal lobe    the executive portion    helps contextual memory be developed  and    and  and  and. So it's    for me  its been an extremely nourishing scholarly adventure to look at the neuroscience that's associated with play  and to bring together people who in their individual disciplines hadn't really thought of it that way. And that's part of what the National Institute for Play is all about. And this is one of the ways you can study play    is to get a     lead electroencephalogram. I'm sorry I don't have a playful looking subject  but it allows mobility  which has limited the actual study of play. And we've got a mother infant play scenario that we're hoping to complete underway at the moment. The reason I put this here is also to queue up my thoughts about objectifying what play does. The animal world has objectified it. In the animal world  if you take rats  who are hardwired to play at a certain period of their juvenile years and you suppress play    they squeak  they wrestle  they pin each other  that's part of their play. If you stop that behavior on one group that you're experimenting with  and you allow it in another group that you're experimenting with  and then you present those rats with a cat odor saturated collar  they're hardwired to flee and hide. Pretty smart    they don't want to get killed by a cat. So what happens  They both hide out. The non players never come out    they die. The players slowly explore the environment  and begin again to test things out. That says to me  at least in rats    and I think they have the same neurotransmitters that we do and a similar cortical architecture    that play may be pretty important for our survival. And  and  and    there are a lot more animal studies that I could talk about. Now  this is a consequence of play deprivation.  Laughter  This took a long time    I had to get Homer down and put him through the fMRI and the SPECT and multiple EEGs  but as a couch potato  his brain has shrunk. And we do know that in domestic animals and others  when they're play deprived  they don't    and rats also    they don't develop a brain that is normal. Now  the program says that the opposite of play is not work  it's depression. And I think if you think about life without play    no humor  no flirtation  no movies  no games  no fantasy and  and  and. Try and imagine a culture or a life  adult or otherwise without play. And the thing that's so unique about our species is that we're really designed to play through our whole lifetime. And we all have capacity to play signal. Nobody misses that dog I took a picture of on a Carmel beach a couple of weeks ago. What's going to follow from that behavior is play. And you can trust it. The basis of human trust is established through play signals. And we begin to lose those signals  culturally and otherwise  as adults. That's a shame. I think we've got a lot of learning to do. Now  Jane Goodall has here a play face along with one of her favorite chimps. So part of the signaling system of play has to do with vocal  facial  body  gestural. You know  you can tell    and I think when we're getting into collective play  its really important for groups to gain a sense of safety through their own sharing of play signals. You may not know this word  but it should be your biological first name and last name. Because neoteny means the retention of immature qualities into adulthood. And we are  by physical anthropologists  by many  many studies  the most neotenous  the most youthful  the most flexible  the most plastic of all creatures. And therefore  the most playful. And this gives us a leg up on adaptability. Now  there is a way of looking at play that I also want to emphasize here  which is the play history. Your own personal play history is unique  and often is not something we think about particularly. This is a book written by a consummate player by the name of Kevin Carroll. Kevin Carroll came from extremely deprived circumstances  alcoholic mother  absent father  inner city Philadelphia  black  had to take care of a younger brother. Found that when he looked at a playground out of a window into which he had been confined  he felt something different. And so he followed up on it. And his life    the transformation of his life from deprivation and what one would expect    potentially prison or death    he become a linguist  a trainer for the   ers and now is a motivational speaker. And he gives play as a transformative force over his entire life. Now there's another play history that I think is a work in progress. Those of you who remember Al Gore  during the first term and then during his successful but unelected run for the presidency  may remember him as being kind of wooden and not entirely his own person  at least in public. And looking at his history  which is common in the press  it seems to me  at least    looking at it from a shrink's point of view    that a lot of his life was programmed. Summers were hard  hard work  in the heat of Tennessee summers. He had the expectations of his senatorial father and Washington  D.C. And although I think he certainly had the capacity for play    because I do know something about that    he wasn't as empowered  I think  as he now is by paying attention to what is his own passion and his own inner drive  which I think has its basis in all of us in our play history. So what I would encourage on an individual level to do  is to explore backwards as far as you can go to the most clear  joyful  playful image that you have  whether it's with a toy  on a birthday or on a vacation. And begin to build to build from the emotion of that into how that connects with your life now. And you'll find  you may change jobs    which has happened to a number people when I've had them do this    in order to be more empowered through their play. Or you'll be able to enrich your life by prioritizing it and paying attention to it. Most of us work with groups  and I put this up because the d.school  the design school at Stanford  thanks to David Kelley and a lot of others who have been visionary about its establishment  has allowed a group of us to get together and create a course called  From Play to Innovation.  And you'll see this course is to investigate the human state of play  which is kind of like the polar bear husky state and its importance to creative thinking   to explore play behavior  its development and its biological basis  to apply those principles  through design thinking  to promote innovation in the corporate world  and the students will work with real world partners on design projects with widespread application.  This is our maiden voyage in this. We're about two and a half  three months into it  and it's really been fun. There is our star pupil  this labrador  who taught a lot of us what a state of play is  and an extremely aged and decrepit professor in charge there. And Brendan Boyle  Rich Crandall    and on the far right is  I think  a person who will be in cahoots with George Smoot for a Nobel Prize    Stuart Thompson  in neuroscience. So we've had Brendan  who's from IDEO  and the rest of us sitting aside and watching these students as they put play principles into practice in the classroom. And one of their projects was to see what makes meetings boring  and to try and do something about it. So what will follow is a student made film about just that. Narrator  Flow is the mental state of apparition in which the person is fully immersed in what he or she is doing. Characterized by a feeling of energized focus  full involvement and success in the process of the activity. An important key insight that we learned about meetings is that people pack them in one after another  disruptive to the day. Attendees at meetings don't know when they'll get back to the task that they left at their desk. But it doesn't have to be that way. Some sage and repeatedly furry monks at this place called the d.school designed a meeting that you can literally step out of when it's over. Take the meeting off  and have peace of mind that you can come back to me. Because when you need it again  the meeting is literally hanging in your closet. The Wearable Meeting. Because when you put it on  you immediately get everything you need to have a fun and productive and useful meeting. But when you take it off    that's when the real action happens. Stuart Brown  So I would encourage you all to engage not in the work play differential    where you set aside time to play    but where your life becomes infused minute by minute  hour by hour  with body  object  social  fantasy  transformational kinds of play. And I think you'll have a better and more empowered life. Thank You. John Hockenberry  So it sounds to me like what you're saying is that there may be some temptation on the part of people to look at your work and go    I think I've heard this  in my kind of pop psychological understanding of play  that somehow  the way animals and humans deal with play  is that it's some sort of rehearsal for adult activity. Your work seems to suggest that that is powerfully wrong. SB  Yeah  I don't think that's accurate  and I think probably because animals have taught us that. If you stop a cat from playing    which you can do  and we've all seen how cats bat around stuff    they're just as good predators as they would be if they hadn't played. And if you imagine a kid pretending to be King Kong  or a race car driver  or a fireman  they don't all become race car drivers or firemen  you know. So there's a disconnect between preparation for the future    which is what most people are comfortable in thinking about play as    and thinking of it as a separate biological entity. And this is where my chasing animals for four  five years really changed my perspective from a clinician to what I am now  which is that play has a biological place  just like sleep and dreams do. And if you look at sleep and dreams biologically  animals sleep and dream  and they rehearse and they do some other things that help memory and that are a very important part of sleep and dreams. The next step of evolution in mammals and creatures with divinely superfluous neurons will be to play. And the fact that the polar bear and husky or magpie and a bear or you and I and our dogs can crossover and have that experience sets play aside as something separate. And its hugely important in learning and crafting the brain. So it's not just something you do in your spare time. JH  How do you keep    and I know you're part of the scientific research community  and you have to justify your existence with grants and proposals like everyone else    how do you prevent    and some of the data that you've produced  the good science that you're talking about you've produced  is hot to handle. How do you prevent either the media's interpretation of your work or the scientific community's interpretation of the implications of your work  kind of like the Mozart metaphor  where   Oh  MRIs show that play enhances your intelligence. Well  let's round these kids up  put them in pens and make them play for months at a time  they'll all be geniuses and go to Harvard.  How do you prevent people from taking that sort of action on the data that you're developing  SB  Well  I think the only way I know to do it is to have accumulated the advisers that I have who go from practitioners    who can establish through improvisational play or clowning or whatever    a state of play. So people know that it's there. And then you get an fMRI specialist  and you get Frank Wilson  and you get other kinds of hard scientists  including neuroendocrinologists. And you get them into a group together focused on play  and it's pretty hard not to take it seriously. Unfortunately  that hasn't been done sufficiently for the National Science Foundation  National Institute of Mental Health or anybody else to really look at it in this way seriously. I mean you don't hear about anything that's like cancer or heart disease associated with play. And yet I see it as something that's just as basic for survival    long term    as learning some of the basic things about public health. JH  Stuart Brown  thank you very much. Time flies. It's actually almost    years ago when I wanted to reframe the way we use information  the way we work together  I invented the World Wide Web. Now     years on  at TED  I want to ask your help in a new reframing. So going back to       I wrote a memo suggesting the global hypertext system. Nobody really did anything with it  pretty much. But    months later    this is how innovation happens       months later  my boss said I could do it on the side  as a sort of a play project  kick the tires of a new computer we'd got. And so he gave me the time to code it up. So I basically roughed out what HTML should look like  hypertext protocol  HTTP  the idea of URLs  these names for things which started with HTTP. I wrote the code and put it out there. Why did I do it  Well  it was basically frustration. I was frustrated    I was working as a software engineer in this huge  very exciting lab  lots of people coming from all over the world. They brought all sorts of different computers with them. They had all sorts of different data formats  all sorts  all kinds of documentation systems. So that  in all that diversity  if I wanted to figure out how to build something out of a bit of this and a bit of this  everything I looked into  I had to connect to some new machine  I had to learn to run some new program  I would find the information I wanted in some new data format. And these were all incompatible. It was just very frustrating. The frustration was all this unlocked potential. In fact  on all these discs there were documents. So if you just imagined them all being part of some big  virtual documentation system in the sky  say on the Internet  then life would be so much easier. Well  once you've had an idea like that it kind of gets under your skin and even if people don't read your memo    actually he did  it was found after he died  his copy. He had written   Vague  but exciting   in pencil  in the corner. But in general it was difficult    it was really difficult to explain what the web was like. It's difficult to explain to people now that it was difficult then. But then    OK  when TED started  there was no web so things like  click  didn't have the same meaning. I can show somebody a piece of hypertext  a page which has got links  and we click on the link and bing    there'll be another hypertext page. Not impressive. You know  we've seen that    we've got things on hypertext on CD ROMs. What was difficult was to get them to imagine  so  imagine that that link could have gone to virtually any document you could imagine. Alright  that is the leap that was very difficult for people to make. Well  some people did. So yeah  it was difficult to explain  but there was a grassroots movement. And that is what has made it most fun. That has been the most exciting thing  not the technology  not the things people have done with it  but actually the community  the spirit of all these people getting together  sending the emails. That's what it was like then. Do you know what  It's funny  but right now it's kind of like that again. I asked everybody  more or less  to put their documents    I said   Could you put your documents on this web thing   And you did. Thanks. It's been a blast  hasn't it  I mean  it has been quite interesting because we've found out that the things that happen with the web really sort of blow us away. They're much more than we'd originally imagined when we put together the little  initial website that we started off with. Now  I want you to put your data on the web. Turns out that there is still huge unlocked potential. There is still a huge frustration that people have because we haven't got data on the web as data. What do you mean   data   What's the difference    documents  data  Well  documents you read  OK  More or less  you read them  you can follow links from them  and that's it. Data    you can do all kinds of stuff with a computer. Who was here or has otherwise seen Hans Rosling's talk  One of the great    yes a lot of people have seen it    one of the great TED Talks. Hans put up this presentation in which he showed  for various different countries  in various different colors    he showed income levels on one axis and he showed infant mortality  and he shot this thing animated through time. So  he'd taken this data and made a presentation which just shattered a lot of myths that people had about the economics in the developing world. He put up a slide a little bit like this. It had underground all the data OK  data is brown and boxy and boring  and that's how we think of it  isn't it  Because data you can't naturally use by itself But in fact  data drives a huge amount of what happens in our lives and it happens because somebody takes that data and does something with it. In this case  Hans had put the data together he had found from all kinds of United Nations websites and things. He had put it together  combined it into something more interesting than the original pieces and then he'd put it into this software  which I think his son developed  originally  and produces this wonderful presentation. And Hans made a point of saying   Look  it's really important to have a lot of data.  And I was happy to see that at the party last night that he was still saying  very forcibly   It's really important to have a lot of data.  So I want us now to think about not just two pieces of data being connected  or six like he did  but I want to think about a world where everybody has put data on the web and so virtually everything you can imagine is on the web and then calling that linked data. The technology is linked data  and it's extremely simple. If you want to put something on the web there are three rules  first thing is that those HTTP names    those things that start with  http      we're using them not just for documents now  we're using them for things that the documents are about. We're using them for people  we're using them for places  we're using them for your products  we're using them for events. All kinds of conceptual things  they have names now that start with HTTP. Second rule  if I take one of these HTTP names and I look it up and I do the web thing with it and I fetch the data using the HTTP protocol from the web  I will get back some data in a standard format which is kind of useful data that somebody might like to know about that thing  about that event. Who's at the event  Whatever it is about that person  where they were born  things like that. So the second rule is I get important information back. Third rule is that when I get back that information it's not just got somebody's height and weight and when they were born  it's got relationships. Data is relationships. Interestingly  data is relationships. This person was born in Berlin  Berlin is in Germany. And when it has relationships  whenever it expresses a relationship then the other thing that it's related to is given one of those names that starts HTTP. So  I can go ahead and look that thing up. So I look up a person    I can look up then the city where they were born  then I can look up the region it's in  and the town it's in  and the population of it  and so on. So I can browse this stuff. So that's it  really. That is linked data. I wrote an article entitled  Linked Data  a couple of years ago and soon after that  things started to happen. The idea of linked data is that we get lots and lots and lots of these boxes that Hans had  and we get lots and lots and lots of things sprouting. It's not just a whole lot of other plants. It's not just a root supplying a plant  but for each of those plants  whatever it is    a presentation  an analysis  somebody's looking for patterns in the data    they get to look at all the data and they get it connected together  and the really important thing about data is the more things you have to connect together  the more powerful it is. So  linked data. The meme went out there. And  pretty soon Chris Bizer at the Freie Universitat in Berlin who was one of the first people to put interesting things up  he noticed that Wikipedia    you know Wikipedia  the online encyclopedia with lots and lots of interesting documents in it. Well  in those documents  there are little squares  little boxes. And in most information boxes  there's data. So he wrote a program to take the data  extract it from Wikipedia  and put it into a blob of linked data on the web  which he called dbpedia. Dbpedia is represented by the blue blob in the middle of this slide and if you actually go and look up Berlin  you'll find that there are other blobs of data which also have stuff about Berlin  and they're linked together. So if you pull the data from dbpedia about Berlin  you'll end up pulling up these other things as well. And the exciting thing is it's starting to grow. This is just the grassroots stuff again  OK  Let's think about data for a bit. Data comes in fact in lots and lots of different forms. Think of the diversity of the web. It's a really important thing that the web allows you to put all kinds of data up there. So it is with data. I could talk about all kinds of data. We could talk about government data  enterprise data is really important  there's scientific data  there's personal data  there's weather data  there's data about events  there's data about talks  and there's news and there's all kinds of stuff. I'm just going to mention a few of them so that you get the idea of the diversity of it  so that you also see how much unlocked potential. Let's start with government data. Barack Obama said in a speech  that he    American government data would be available on the Internet in accessible formats. And I hope that they will put it up as linked data. That's important. Why is it important  Not just for transparency  yeah transparency in government is important  but that data    this is the data from all the government departments Think about how much of that data is about how life is lived in America. It's actual useful. It's got value. I can use it in my company. I could use it as a kid to do my homework. So we're talking about making the place  making the world run better by making this data available. In fact if you're responsible    if you know about some data in a government department  often you find that these people  they're very tempted to keep it    Hans calls it database hugging. You hug your database  you don't want to let it go until you've made a beautiful website for it. Well  I'd like to suggest that rather    yes  make a beautiful website  who am I to say don't make a beautiful website  Make a beautiful website  but first give us the unadulterated data  we want the data. We want unadulterated data. OK  we have to ask for raw data now. And I'm going to ask you to practice that  OK  Can you say  raw   Audience  Raw. Tim Berners Lee  Can you say  data   Audience  Data. TBL  Can you say  now   Audience  Now  TBL  Alright   raw data now   Audience  Raw data now  Practice that. It's important because you have no idea the number of excuses people come up with to hang onto their data and not give it to you  even though you've paid for it as a taxpayer. And it's not just America. It's all over the world. And it's not just governments  of course    it's enterprises as well. So I'm just going to mention a few other thoughts on data. Here we are at TED  and all the time we are very conscious of the huge challenges that human society has right now    curing cancer  understanding the brain for Alzheimer's  understanding the economy to make it a little bit more stable  understanding how the world works. The people who are going to solve those    the scientists    they have half formed ideas in their head  they try to communicate those over the web. But a lot of the state of knowledge of the human race at the moment is on databases  often sitting in their computers  and actually  currently not shared. In fact  I'll just go into one area    if you're looking at Alzheimer's  for example  drug discovery    there is a whole lot of linked data which is just coming out because scientists in that field realize this is a great way of getting out of those silos  because they had their genomics data in one database in one building  and they had their protein data in another. Now  they are sticking it onto    linked data    and now they can ask the sort of question  that you probably wouldn't ask  I wouldn't ask    they would. What proteins are involved in signal transduction and also related to pyramidal neurons  Well  you take that mouthful and you put it into Google. Of course  there's no page on the web which has answered that question because nobody has asked that question before. You get         hits    no results you can use. You ask the linked data    which they've now put together       hits  each of which is a protein which has those properties and you can look at. The power of being able to ask those questions  as a scientist    questions which actually bridge across different disciplines    is really a complete sea change. It's very very important. Scientists are totally stymied at the moment    the power of the data that other scientists have collected is locked up and we need to get it unlocked so we can tackle those huge problems. Now if I go on like this  you'll think that all the data comes from huge institutions and has nothing to do with you. But  that's not true. In fact  data is about our lives. You just    you log on to your social networking site  your favorite one  you say   This is my friend.  Bing  Relationship. Data. You say   This photograph  it's about    it depicts this person.   Bing  That's data. Data  data  data. Every time you do things on the social networking site  the social networking site is taking data and using it    re purposing it    and using it to make other people's lives more interesting on the site. But  when you go to another linked data site    and let's say this is one about travel  and you say   I want to send this photo to all the people in that group   you can't get over the walls. The Economist wrote an article about it  and lots of people have blogged about it    tremendous frustration. The way to break down the silos is to get inter operability between social networking sites. We need to do that with linked data. One last type of data I'll talk about  maybe it's the most exciting. Before I came down here  I looked it up on OpenStreetMap The OpenStreetMap's a map  but it's also a Wiki. Zoom in and that square thing is a theater    which we're in right now    The Terrace Theater. It didn't have a name on it. So I could go into edit mode  I could select the theater  I could add down at the bottom the name  and I could save it back. And now if you go back to the OpenStreetMap. org  and you find this place  you will find that The Terrace Theater has got a name. I did that. Me  I did that to the map. I just did that  I put that up on there. Hey  you know what  If I    that street map is all about everybody doing their bit and it creates an incredible resource because everybody else does theirs. And that is what linked data is all about. It's about people doing their bit to produce a little bit  and it all connecting. That's how linked data works. You do your bit. Everybody else does theirs. You may not have lots of data which you have yourself to put on there but you know to demand it. And we've practiced that. So  linked data    it's huge. I've only told you a very small number of things There are data in every aspect of our lives  every aspect of work and pleasure  and it's not just about the number of places where data comes  it's about connecting it together. And when you connect data together  you get power in a way that doesn't happen just with the web  with documents. You get this really huge power out of it. So  we're at the stage now where we have to do this    the people who think it's a great idea. And all the people    and I think there's a lot of people at TED who do things because    even though there's not an immediate return on the investment because it will only really pay off when everybody else has done it    they'll do it because they're the sort of person who just does things which would be good if everybody else did them. OK  so it's called linked data. I want you to make it. I want you to demand it. And I think it's an idea worth spreading. Thanks. I m going around the world giving talks about Darwin  and usually what I m talking about is Darwin s strange inversion of reasoning. Now that title  that phrase  comes from a critic  an early critic  and this is a passage that I just love  and would like to read for you.  In the theory with which we have to deal  Absolute Ignorance is the artificer  so that we may enunciate as the fundamental principle of the whole system  that  in order to make a perfect and beautiful machine  it is not requisite to know how to make it. This proposition will be found on careful examination to express  in condensed form  the essential purport of the Theory  and to express in a few words all Mr. Darwin s meaning  who  by a strange inversion of reasoning  seems to think Absolute Ignorance fully qualified to take the place of Absolute Wisdom in the achievements of creative skill.  Exactly. Exactly. And it is a strange inversion. A creationist pamphlet has this wonderful page in it   Test Two  Do you know of any building that didn t have a builder  Yes No. Do you know of any painting that didn t have a painter  Yes No. Do you know of any car that didn t have a maker  Yes No. If you answered 'Yes' for any of the above  give details.  A ha  I mean  it really is a strange inversion of reasoning. You would have thought it stands to reason that design requires an intelligent designer. But Darwin shows that it s just false. Today  though  I m going to talk about Darwin s other strange inversion  which is equally puzzling at first  but in some ways just as important. It stands to reason that we love chocolate cake because it is sweet. Guys go for girls like this because they are sexy. We adore babies because they re so cute. And  of course  we are amused by jokes because they are funny. This is all backwards. It is. And Darwin shows us why. Let s start with sweet. Our sweet tooth is basically an evolved sugar detector  because sugar is high energy  and it s just been wired up to the preferer  to put it very crudely  and that s why we like sugar. Honey is sweet because we like it  not  we like it because honey is sweet.  There s nothing intrinsically sweet about honey. If you looked at glucose molecules till you were blind  you wouldn t see why they tasted sweet. You have to look in our brains to understand why they re sweet. So if you think first there was sweetness  and then we evolved to like sweetness  you ve got it backwards  that s just wrong. It s the other way round. Sweetness was born with the wiring which evolved. And there s nothing intrinsically sexy about these young ladies. And it s a good thing that there isn t  because if there were  then Mother Nature would have a problem  How on earth do you get chimps to mate  Now you might think  ah  there s a solution  hallucinations. That would be one way of doing it  but there s a quicker way. Just wire the chimps up to love that look  and apparently they do. That s all there is to it. Over six million years  we and the chimps evolved our different ways. We became bald bodied  oddly enough  for one reason or another  they didn t. If we hadn t  then probably this would be the height of sexiness. Our sweet tooth is an evolved and instinctual preference for high energy food. It wasn t designed for chocolate cake. Chocolate cake is a supernormal stimulus. The term is owed to Niko Tinbergen  who did his famous experiments with gulls  where he found that that orange spot on the gull s beak    if he made a bigger  oranger spot the gull chicks would peck at it even harder. It was a hyperstimulus for them  and they loved it. What we see with  say  chocolate cake is it s a supernormal stimulus to tweak our design wiring. And there are lots of supernormal stimuli  chocolate cake is one. There's lots of supernormal stimuli for sexiness. And there's even supernormal stimuli for cuteness. Here s a pretty good example. It s important that we love babies  and that we not be put off by  say  messy diapers. So babies have to attract our affection and our nurturing  and they do. And  by the way  a recent study shows that mothers prefer the smell of the dirty diapers of their own baby. So nature works on many levels here. But now  if babies didn t look the way they do    if babies looked like this  that s what we would find adorable  that s what we would find    we would think  oh my goodness  do I ever want to hug that. This is the strange inversion. Well now  finally what about funny. My answer is  it s the same story  the same story. This is the hard one  the one that isn t obvious. That s why I leave it to the end. And I won t be able to say too much about it. But you have to think evolutionarily  you have to think  what hard job that has to be done    it s dirty work  somebody s got to do it    is so important to give us such a powerful  inbuilt reward for it when we succeed. Now  I think we've found the answer    I and a few of my colleagues. It s a neural system that s wired up to reward the brain for doing a grubby clerical job. Our bumper sticker for this view is that this is the joy of debugging. Now I m not going to have time to spell it all out  but I ll just say that only some kinds of debugging get the reward. And what we re doing is we re using humor as a sort of neuroscientific probe by switching humor on and off  by turning the knob on a joke    now it s not funny ... oh  now it s funnier ... now we ll turn a little bit more ... now it s not funny    in this way  we can actually learn something about the architecture of the brain  the functional architecture of the brain. Matthew Hurley is the first author of this. We call it the Hurley Model. He s a computer scientist  Reginald Adams a psychologist  and there I am  and we re putting this together into a book. Thank you very much. I want to talk to you today a little bit about predictable irrationality. And my interest in irrational behavior started many years ago in the hospital. I was burned very badly. And if you spend a lot of time in hospital  you'll see a lot of types of irrationalities. And the one that particularly bothered me in the burn department was the process by which the nurses took the bandage off me. Now  you must have all taken a Band Aid off at some point  and you must have wondered what's the right approach. Do you rip it off quickly    short duration but high intensity    or do you take your Band Aid off slowly    you take a long time  but each second is not as painful    which one of those is the right approach  The nurses in my department thought that the right approach was the ripping one  so they would grab hold and they would rip  and they would grab hold and they would rip. And because I had    percent of my body burned  it would take about an hour. And as you can imagine  I hated that moment of ripping with incredible intensity. And I would try to reason with them and say   Why don't we try something else  Why don't we take it a little longer    maybe two hours instead of an hour    and have less of this intensity   And the nurses told me two things. They told me that they had the right model of the patient    that they knew what was the right thing to do to minimize my pain    and they also told me that the word patient doesn't mean to make suggestions or to interfere or ... This is not just in Hebrew  by the way. It's in every language I've had experience with so far. And  you know  there's not much    there wasn't much I could do  and they kept on doing what they were doing. And about three years later  when I left the hospital  I started studying at the university. And one of the most interesting lessons I learned was that there is an experimental method that if you have a question you can create a replica of this question in some abstract way  and you can try to examine this question  maybe learn something about the world. So that's what I did. I was still interested in this question of how do you take bandages off burn patients. So originally I didn't have much money  so I went to a hardware store and I bought a carpenter's vice. And I would bring people to the lab and I would put their finger in it  and I would crunch it a little bit. And I would crunch it for long periods and short periods  and pain that went up and pain that went down  and with breaks and without breaks    all kinds of versions of pain. And when I finished hurting people a little bit  I would ask them  so  how painful was this  Or  how painful was this  Or  if you had to choose between the last two  which one would you choose  I kept on doing this for a while. And then  like all good academic projects  I got more funding. I moved to sounds  electrical shocks    I even had a pain suit that I could get people to feel much more pain. But at the end of this process  what I learned was that the nurses were wrong. Here were wonderful people with good intentions and plenty of experience  and nevertheless they were getting things wrong predictably all the time. It turns out that because we don't encode duration in the way that we encode intensity  I would have had less pain if the duration would have been longer and the intensity was lower. It turns out it would have been better to start with my face  which was much more painful  and move toward my legs  giving me a trend of improvement over time    that would have been also less painful. And it also turns out that it would have been good to give me breaks in the middle to kind of recuperate from the pain. All of these would have been great things to do  and my nurses had no idea. And from that point on I started thinking  are the nurses the only people in the world who get things wrong in this particular decision  or is it a more general case  And it turns out it's a more general case    there's a lot of mistakes we do. And I want to give you one example of one of these irrationalities  and I want to talk to you about cheating. And the reason I picked cheating is because it's interesting  but also it tells us something  I think  about the stock market situation we're in. So  my interest in cheating started when Enron came on the scene  exploded all of a sudden  and I started thinking about what is happening here. Is it the case that there was kind of a few apples who are capable of doing these things  or are we talking a more endemic situation  that many people are actually capable of behaving this way  So  like we usually do  I decided to do a simple experiment. And here's how it went. If you were in the experiment  I would pass you a sheet of paper with    simple math problems that everybody could solve  but I wouldn't give you enough time. When the five minutes were over  I would say   Pass me the sheets of paper  and I'll pay you a dollar per question.  People did this. I would pay people four dollars for their task    on average people would solve four problems. Other people I would tempt to cheat. I would pass their sheet of paper. When the five minutes were over  I would say   Please shred the piece of paper. Put the little pieces in your pocket or in your backpack  and tell me how many questions you got correctly.  People now solved seven questions on average. Now  it wasn't as if there was a few bad apples    a few people cheated a lot. Instead  what we saw is a lot of people who cheat a little bit. Now  in economic theory  cheating is a very simple cost benefit analysis. You say  what's the probability of being caught  How much do I stand to gain from cheating  And how much punishment would I get if I get caught  And you weigh these options out    you do the simple cost benefit analysis  and you decide whether it's worthwhile to commit the crime or not. So  we try to test this. For some people  we varied how much money they could get away with    how much money they could steal. We paid them    cents per correct question     cents  a dollar  five dollars     dollars per correct question. You would expect that as the amount of money on the table increases  people would cheat more  but in fact it wasn't the case. We got a lot of people cheating by stealing by a little bit. What about the probability of being caught  Some people shredded half the sheet of paper  so there was some evidence left. Some people shredded the whole sheet of paper. Some people shredded everything  went out of the room  and paid themselves from the bowl of money that had over     dollars. You would expect that as the probability of being caught goes down  people would cheat more  but again  this was not the case. Again  a lot of people cheated by just by a little bit  and they were insensitive to these economic incentives. So we said   If people are not sensitive to the economic rational theory explanations  to these forces  what could be going on   And we thought maybe what is happening is that there are two forces. At one hand  we all want to look at ourselves in the mirror and feel good about ourselves  so we don't want to cheat. On the other hand  we can cheat a little bit  and still feel good about ourselves. So  maybe what is happening is that there's a level of cheating we can't go over  but we can still benefit from cheating at a low degree  as long as it doesn't change our impressions about ourselves. We call this like a personal fudge factor. Now  how would you test a personal fudge factor  Initially we said  what can we do to shrink the fudge factor  So  we got people to the lab  and we said   We have two tasks for you today.  First  we asked half the people to recall either    books they read in high school  or to recall The Ten Commandments  and then we tempted them with cheating. Turns out the people who tried to recall The Ten Commandments    and in our sample nobody could recall all of The Ten Commandments    but those people who tried to recall The Ten Commandments  given the opportunity to cheat  did not cheat at all. It wasn't that the more religious people    the people who remembered more of the Commandments    cheated less  and the less religious people    the people who couldn't remember almost any Commandments    cheated more. The moment people thought about trying to recall The Ten Commandments  they stopped cheating. In fact  even when we gave self declared atheists the task of swearing on the Bible and we give them a chance to cheat  they don't cheat at all. Now  Ten Commandments is something that is hard to bring into the education system  so we said   Why don't we get people to sign the honor code   So  we got people to sign   I understand that this short survey falls under the MIT Honor Code.  Then they shredded it. No cheating whatsoever. And this is particularly interesting  because MIT doesn't have an honor code. So  all this was about decreasing the fudge factor. What about increasing the fudge factor  The first experiment    I walked around MIT and I distributed six packs of Cokes in the refrigerators    these were common refrigerators for the undergrads. And I came back to measure what we technically call the half lifetime of Coke    how long does it last in the refrigerators  As you can expect it doesn't last very long  people take it. In contrast  I took a plate with six one dollar bills  and I left those plates in the same refrigerators. No bill ever disappeared. Now  this is not a good social science experiment  so to do it better I did the same experiment as I described to you before. A third of the people we passed the sheet  they gave it back to us. A third of the people we passed it to  they shredded it  they came to us and said   Mr. Experimenter  I solved X problems. Give me X dollars.  A third of the people  when they finished shredding the piece of paper  they came to us and said   Mr Experimenter  I solved X problems. Give me X tokens.  We did not pay them with dollars  we paid them with something else. And then they took the something else  they walked    feet to the side  and exchanged it for dollars. Think about the following intuition. How bad would you feel about taking a pencil from work home  compared to how bad would you feel about taking    cents from a petty cash box  These things feel very differently. Would being a step removed from cash for a few seconds by being paid by token make a difference  Our subjects doubled their cheating. I'll tell you what I think about this and the stock market in a minute. But this did not solve the big problem I had with Enron yet  because in Enron  there's also a social element. People see each other behaving. In fact  every day when we open the news we see examples of people cheating. What does this cause us  So  we did another experiment. We got a big group of students to be in the experiment  and we prepaid them. So everybody got an envelope with all the money for the experiment  and we told them that at the end  we asked them to pay us back the money they didn't make. OK  The same thing happens. When we give people the opportunity to cheat  they cheat. They cheat just by a little bit  all the same. But in this experiment we also hired an acting student. This acting student stood up after    seconds  and said   I solved everything. What do I do now   And the experimenter said   If you've finished everything  go home. That's it. The task is finished.  So  now we had a student    an acting student    that was a part of the group. Nobody knew it was an actor. And they clearly cheated in a very  very serious way. What would happen to the other people in the group  Will they cheat more  or will they cheat less  Here is what happens. It turns out it depends on what kind of sweatshirt they're wearing. Here is the thing. We ran this at Carnegie Mellon and Pittsburgh. And at Pittsburgh there are two big universities  Carnegie Mellon and University of Pittsburgh. All of the subjects sitting in the experiment were Carnegie Mellon students. When the actor who was getting up was a Carnegie Mellon student    he was actually a Carnegie Mellon student    but he was a part of their group  cheating went up. But when he actually had a University of Pittsburgh sweatshirt  cheating went down. Now  this is important  because remember  when the moment the student stood up  it made it clear to everybody that they could get away with cheating  because the experimenter said   You've finished everything. Go home   and they went with the money. So it wasn't so much about the probability of being caught again. It was about the norms for cheating. If somebody from our in group cheats and we see them cheating  we feel it's more appropriate  as a group  to behave this way. But if it's somebody from another group  these terrible people    I mean  not terrible in this    but somebody we don't want to associate ourselves with  from another university  another group  all of a sudden people's awareness of honesty goes up    a little bit like The Ten Commandments experiment    and people cheat even less. So  what have we learned from this about cheating  We've learned that a lot of people can cheat. They cheat just by a little bit. When we remind people about their morality  they cheat less. When we get bigger distance from cheating  from the object of money  for example  people cheat more. And when we see cheating around us  particularly if it's a part of our in group  cheating goes up. Now  if we think about this in terms of the stock market  think about what happens. What happens in a situation when you create something where you pay people a lot of money to see reality in a slightly distorted way  Would they not be able to see it this way  Of course they would. What happens when you do other things  like you remove things from money  You call them stock  or stock options  derivatives  mortgage backed securities. Could it be that with those more distant things  it's not a token for one second  it's something that is many steps removed from money for a much longer time    could it be that people will cheat even more  And what happens to the social environment when people see other people behave around them  I think all of those forces worked in a very bad way in the stock market. More generally  I want to tell you something about behavioral economics. We have many intuitions in our life  and the point is that many of these intuitions are wrong. The question is  are we going to test those intuitions  We can think about how we're going to test this intuition in our private life  in our business life  and most particularly when it goes to policy  when we think about things like No Child Left Behind  when you create new stock markets  when you create other policies    taxation  health care and so on. And the difficulty of testing our intuition was the big lesson I learned when I went back to the nurses to talk to them. So I went back to talk to them and tell them what I found out about removing bandages. And I learned two interesting things. One was that my favorite nurse  Ettie  told me that I did not take her pain into consideration. She said   Of course  you know  it was very painful for you. But think about me as a nurse  taking  removing the bandages of somebody I liked  and had to do it repeatedly over a long period of time. Creating so much torture was not something that was good for me  too.  And she said maybe part of the reason was it was difficult for her. But it was actually more interesting than that  because she said   I did not think that your intuition was right. I felt my intuition was correct.  So  if you think about all of your intuitions  it's very hard to believe that your intuition is wrong. And she said   Given the fact that I thought my intuition was right ...     she thought her intuition was right    it was very difficult for her to accept doing a difficult experiment to try and check whether she was wrong. But in fact  this is the situation we're all in all the time. We have very strong intuitions about all kinds of things    our own ability  how the economy works  how we should pay school teachers. But unless we start testing those intuitions  we're not going to do better. And just think about how better my life would have been if these nurses would have been willing to check their intuition  and how everything would have been better if we just start doing more systematic experimentation of our intuitions. Thank you very much. About four years ago  the New Yorker published an article about a cache of dodo bones that was found in a pit on the island of Mauritius. Now  the island of Mauritius is a small island off the east coast of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean  and it is the place where the dodo bird was discovered and extinguished  all within about     years. Everyone was very excited about this archaeological find  because it meant that they might finally be able to assemble a single dodo skeleton. See  while museums all over the world have dodo skeletons in their collection  nobody    not even the actual Natural History Museum on the island of Mauritius    has a skeleton that's made from the bones of a single dodo. Well  this isn't exactly true. The fact is  is that the British Museum had a complete specimen of a dodo in their collection up until the   th century    it was actually mummified  skin and all    but in a fit of space saving zeal  they actually cut off the head and they cut off the feet and they burned the rest in a bonfire. If you go look at their website today  they'll actually list these specimens  saying  the rest was lost in a fire. Not quite the whole truth. Anyway. The frontispiece of this article was this photo  and I'm one of the people that thinks that Tina Brown was great for bringing photos to the New Yorker  because this photo completely rocked my world. I became obsessed with the object    not just the beautiful photograph itself  and the color  the shallow depth of field  the detail that's visible  the wire you can see on the beak there that the conservator used to put this skeleton together    there's an entire story here. And I thought to myself  wouldn't it be great if I had my own dodo skeleton  I want to point out here at this point that I've spent my life obsessed by objects and the stories that they tell  and this was the very latest one. So I began looking around for    to see if anyone sold a kit  some kind of model that I could get  and I found lots of reference material  lots of lovely pictures. No dice  no dodo skeleton for me. But the damage had been done. I had saved a few hundred photos of dodo skeletons into my  Creative Projects  folder    it's a repository for my brain  everything that I could possibly be interested in. Any time I have an internet connection  there's a sluice of stuff moving into there  everything from beautiful rings to cockpit photos. The key that the Marquis du Lafayette sent to George Washington to celebrate the storming of the Bastille. Russian nuclear launch key  The one on the top is the picture of the one I found on eBay  the one on the bottom is the one I made for myself  because I couldn't afford the one on eBay. Storm trooper costumes. Maps of Middle Earth    that's one I hand drew myself. There's the dodo skeleton folder. This folder has        photos    over    gigabytes of information    and it's growing constantly. And one day  a couple of weeks later  it might have been maybe a year later  I was in the art store with my kids  and I was buying some clay tools    we were going to have a craft day. I bought some Super Sculpeys  some armature wire  some various materials. And I looked down at this Sculpey  and I thought  maybe  yeah  maybe I could make my own dodo skull. I should point out at this time    I'm not a sculptor  I'm a hard edged model maker. You give me a drawing  you give me a prop to replicate  you give me a crane  scaffolding  parts from  Star Wars     especially parts from  Star Wars     I can do this stuff all day long. It's exactly how I made my living for    years. But you give me something like this    my friend Mike Murnane sculpted this  it's a maquette for  Star Wars  Episode Two     this is not my thing    this is something other people do    dragons  soft things. However  I felt like I had looked at enough photos of dodo skulls to actually be able to understand the topology and perhaps replicate it    I mean  it couldn't be that difficult. So  I started looking at the best photos I could find. I grabbed all the reference  and I found this lovely piece of reference. This is someone selling this on eBay  it was clearly a woman s hand  hopefully a woman's hand. Assuming it was roughly the size of my wife's hand  I made some measurements of her thumb  and I scaled them out to the size of the skull. I blew it up to the actual size  and I began using that  along with all the other reference that I had  comparing it to it as size reference for figuring out exactly how big the beak should be  exactly how long  etc. And over a few hours  I eventually achieved what was actually a pretty reasonable dodo skull. And I didn't mean to continue  I    it's kind of like  you know  you can only clean a super messy room by picking up one thing at a time  you can't think about the totality. I wasn't thinking about a dodo skeleton  I just noticed that as I finished this skull  the armature wire that I had been used to holding it up was sticking out of the back just where a spine would be. And one of the other things I'd been interested in and obsessed with over the years is spines and skeletons  having collected a couple of hundred. I actually understood the mechanics of vertebrae enough to kind of start to imitate them. And so button by button  vertebrae by vertebrae  I built my way down. And actually  by the end of the day  I had a reasonable skull  a moderately good vertebrae and half of a pelvis. And again  I kept on going  looking for more reference  every bit of reference I could find    drawings  beautiful photos. This guy    I love this guy  He put a dodo leg bones on a scanner with a ruler. This is the kind of accuracy that I wanted  and I replicated every last bone and put it in. And after about six weeks  I finished  painted  mounted my own dodo skeleton. You can see that I even made a museum label for it that includes a brief history of the dodo. And TAP Plastics made me    although I didn't photograph it    a museum vitrine. I don't have the room for this in my house  but I had to finish what I had started. And this actually represented kind of a sea change to me. Again  like I said  my life has been about being fascinated by objects and the stories that they tell  and also making them for myself  obtaining them  appreciating them and diving into them. And in this folder   Creative Projects   there are tons of projects that I'm currently working on  projects that I've already worked on  things that I might want to work on some day  and things that I may just want to find and buy and have and look at and touch. But now there was potentially this new category of things that I could sculpt that was different  that I    you know  I have my own R D   but that's    honestly  relative to sculpting  to me  that's easy. And so I went back and looked through my  Creative Projects  folder  and I happened across the Maltese Falcon. Now  this is funny for me  to fall in love with an object from a Hammett novel  because if it's true that the world is divided into two types of people  Chandler people and Hammett people  I am absolutely a Chandler person. But in this case  it's not about the author  it's not about the book or the movie or the story  it's about the object in and of itself. And in this case  this object is    plays on a host of levels. First of all  there's the object in the world. This is the  Kniphausen Hawk.  It is a ceremonial pouring vessel made around      for a Swedish Count  and it is very likely the object from which Hammett drew his inspiration for the Maltese Falcon. Then there is the fictional bird  the one that Hammett created for the book. Built out of words  it is the engine that drives the plot of his book and also the movie  in which another object is created  a prop that has to represent the thing that Hammett created out of words  inspired by the Kniphausen Hawk  and this represents the falcon in the movie. And then there is this fourth level  which is a whole new object in the world  the prop made for the movie  the representative of the thing  becomes  in its own right  a whole other thing  a whole new object of desire. And so now it was time to do some research. I actually had done some research a few years before    it's why the folder was there. I'd bought a replica  a really crappy replica  of the Maltese Falcon on eBay  and had downloaded enough pictures to actually have some reasonable reference. But I discovered  in researching further  really wanting precise reference  that one of the original lead birds had been sold at Christie's in       and so I contacted an antiquarian bookseller who had the original Christie's catalogue  and in it I found this magnificent picture  which included a size reference. I was able to scan the picture  blow it up to exactly full size. I found other reference. Avi  Ara  Chekmayan  a New Jersey editor  actually found this resin Maltese Falcon at a flea market in       although it took him five years to authenticate this bird to the auctioneers' specifications  because there was a lot of controversy about it. It was made out of resin  which wasn't a common material for movie props about the time the movie was made. It's funny to me that it took a while to authenticate it  because I can see it compared to this thing  and I can tell you    it's real  it's the real thing  it's made from the exact same mold that this one is. In this one  because the auction was actually so controversial  Profiles in History  the auction house that sold this    I think in      for about         dollars    they actually included    you can see here on the bottom    not just a front elevation  but also a side  rear and other side elevation. So now  I had all the topology I needed to replicate the Maltese Falcon. What do they do  how do you start something like that  I really don't know. So what I did was  again  like I did with the dodo skull  I blew all my reference up to full size  and then I began cutting out the negatives and using those templates as shape references. So I took Sculpey  and I built a big block of it  and I passed it through until  you know  I got the right profiles. And then slowly  feather by feather  detail by detail  I worked out and achieved    working in front of the television and Super Sculpey    here's me sitting next to my wife    it's the only picture I took of the entire process. As I moved through  I achieved a very reasonable facsimile of the Maltese Falcon. But again  I am not a sculptor  and so I don't know a lot of the tricks  like  I don't know how my friend Mike gets beautiful  shiny surfaces with his Sculpey  I certainly wasn't able to get it. So  I went down to my shop  and I molded it and I cast it in resin  because in the resin  then  I could absolutely get the glass smooth finished. Now there's a lot of ways to fill and get yourself a nice smooth finish. My preference is about    coats of this    matte black auto primer. I spray it on for about three or four days  it drips to hell  but it allows me a really  really nice gentle sanding surface and I can get it glass smooth. Oh  finishing up with triple zero steel wool. Now  the great thing about getting it to this point was that because in the movie  when they finally bring out the bird at the end  and they place it on the table  they actually spin it. So I was able to actually screen shot and freeze frame to make sure. And I'm following all the light kicks on this thing and making sure that as I'm holding the light in the same position  I'm getting the same type of reflection on it    that's the level of detail I'm going into this thing. I ended up with this  my Maltese Falcon. And it's beautiful. And I can state with authority at this point in time  when I'd finished it  of all of the replicas out there    and there is a few    this is by far the most accurate representation of the original Maltese Falcon than anyone has sculpted. Now the original one  I should tell you  is sculpted by a guy named Fred Sexton. This is where it gets weird. Fred Sexton was a friend of this guy  George Hodel. Terrifying guy    agreed by many to be the killer of the Black Dahlia. Now  James Ellroy believes that Fred Sexton  the sculptor of the Maltese Falcon  killed James Elroy's mother. I'll go you one stranger than that  In       during the production of a weird comedy sequel to  The Maltese Falcon   called  The Black Bird   starring George Segal  the Los Angeles County Museum of Art had a plaster original of the Maltese Falcon    one of the original six plasters  I think  made for the movie    stolen out of the museum. A lot of people thought it was a publicity stunt for the movie. John's Grill  which actually is seen briefly in  The Maltese Falcon   is still a viable San Francisco eatery  counted amongst its regular customers Elisha Cook  who played Wilmer Cook in the movie  and he gave them one of his original plasters of the Maltese Falcon. And they had it in their cabinet for about    years  until it got stolen in January of     . It would seem that the object of desire only comes into its own by disappearing repeatedly. So here I had this Falcon  and it was lovely. It looked really great  the light worked on it really well  it was better than anything that I could achieve or obtain out in the world. But there was a problem. And the problem was that  I wanted the entirety of the object  I wanted the weight behind the object. This thing was made of resin and it was too light. There's this group online that I frequent. It's a group of prop crazies just like me called the Replica Props Forum  and it's people who trade  make and travel in information about movie props. And it turned out that one of the guys there  a friend of mine that I never actually met  but befriended through some prop deals  was the manager of a local foundry. He took my master Falcon pattern  he actually did lost wax casting in bronze for me  and this is the bronze I got back. And this is  after some acid etching  the one that I ended up with. And this thing  it's deeply  deeply satisfying to me. Here  I'm going to put it out there  later on tonight  and I want you to pick it up and handle it. You want to know how obsessed I am. This project's only for me  and yet I went so far as to buy on eBay a      Chinese San Francisco based newspaper  in order so that the bird could properly be wrapped ... like it is in the movie. Yeah  I know  There you can see  it's weighing in at    and a half pounds. That's half the weight of my dog  Huxley. But there's a problem. Now  here's the most recent progression of Falcons. On the far left is a piece of crap    a replica I bought on eBay. There's my somewhat ruined Sculpey Falcon  because I had to get it back out of the mold. There's my first casting  there's my master and there's my bronze. There's a thing that happens when you mold and cast things  which is that every time you throw it into silicone and cast it in resin  you lose a little bit of volume  you lose a little bit of size. And when I held my bronze one up against my Sculpey one  it was shorter by three quarters of an inch. Yeah  no  really  this was like aah    why didn't I remember this  Why didn't I start and make it bigger  So what do I do  I figure I have two options. One  I can fire a freaking laser at it  which I have already done  to do a  D scan    there's a  D scan of this Falcon. I had figured out the exact amount of shrinkage I achieved going from a wax master to a bronze master and blown this up big enough to make a  D lithography master of this  which I will polish  then I will send to the mold maker and then I will have it done in bronze. Or  There are several people who own originals  and I have been attempting to contact them and reach them  hoping that they will let me spend a few minutes in the presence of one of the real birds  maybe to take a picture  or even to pull out the hand held laser scanner that I happen to own that fits inside a cereal box  and could maybe  without even touching their bird  I swear  get a perfect  D scan. And I'm even willing to sign pages saying that I'll never let anyone else have it  except for me in my office  I promise. I'll give them one if they want it. And then  maybe  then I'll achieve the end of this exercise. But really  if we're all going to be honest with ourselves  I have to admit that achieving the end of the exercise was never the point of the exercise to begin with  was it. Thank you. I don't know what the hell I'm doing here. I was born in a Scots Presbyterian ghetto in Canada  and dropped out of high school. I don't own a cell phone  and I paint on paper using gouache  which hasn't changed in     years. But about three years ago I had an art show in New York  and I titled it  Serious Nonsense.  So I think I'm actually the first one here    I lead. I called it  Serious Nonsense  because on the serious side  I use a technique of painstaking realism of editorial illustration from when I was a kid. I copied it and I never unlearned it    it's the only style I know. And it's very kind of staid and formal. And meanwhile  I use nonsense  as you can see. This is a Scottish castle where people are playing golf indoors  and the trick was to bang the golf ball off of suits of armor    which you can't see there. This was one of a series called  Zany Afternoons   which became a book. This is a home built rocket propelled car. That's a      Henry J    I'm a bug for authenticity    in a quiet neighborhood in Toledo. This is my submission for the L.A. Museum of Film. You can probably tell Frank Gehry and I come from the same town. My work is so personal and so strange that I have to invent my own lexicon for it. And I work a lot in what I call  retrofuturism   which is looking back to see how yesterday viewed tomorrow. And they're always wrong  always hilariously  optimistically wrong. And the peak time for that was the   s  because the Depression was so dismal that anything to get away from the present into the future ... and technology was going to carry us along. This is Popular Workbench. Popular science magazines in those days    I had a huge collection of them from the '  s    all they are is just poor people being asked to make sunglasses out of wire coat hangers and everything improvised and dreaming about these wonderful giant radio robots playing ice hockey at     miles an hour    it's all going to happen  it's all going to be wonderful. Automotive retrofuturism is one of my specialties. I was both an automobile illustrator and an advertising automobile copywriter  so I have a lot of revenge to take on the subject. Detroit has always been halfway into the future    the advertising half. This is the '   Bulgemobile  so new  they make tomorrow look like yesterday. This is a chain gang of guys admiring the car. That's from a whole catalog    it's    pages or so    ran back in the days of the Lampoon  where I cut my teeth. Techno archaeology is digging back and finding past miracles that never happened    for good reason  usually. The zeppelin    this was from a brochure about the zeppelin based  obviously  on the Hindenburg. But the zeppelin was the biggest thing that ever moved made by man. And it carried    people at the speed of a Buick at an altitude you could hear dogs bark  and it cost twice as much as a first class cabin on the Normandie to fly it. So the Hindenburg wasn't  you know  it was inevitable it was going to go. This is auto gyro jousting in Malibu in the   s. The auto gyro couldn't wait for the invention of the helicopter  but it should have    it wasn't a big success. It's the only Spanish innovation  technologically  of the   th century  by the way. You needed to know that. The flying car which never got off the ground    it was a post war dream. My old man used to tell me we were going to get a flying car. This is pitched into the future from       looking at the day all American families have them.  There's Moscow  Shirley. Hope they speak Esperanto   Faux nostalgia  which I'm sort of    not  say  famous for  but I work an awful lot in it. It's the achingly sentimental yearning for times that never happened. Somebody once said that nostalgia is the one utterly most useless human emotion    so I think that s a case for serious play. This is emblematic of it    this is wing dining  recalling those balmy summer days somewhere over France in the   s  dining on the wing of a plane. You can't see it very well here  but that's Hemingway reading some pages from his new novel to Fitzgerald and Ford Madox Ford until the slipstream blows him away. This is tank polo in the South Hamptons. The brainless rich are more fun to make fun of than anybody. I do a lot of that. And authenticity is a major part of my serious nonsense. I think it adds a huge amount. Those  for example  are Mark IV British tanks from     . They had two machine guns and a cannon  and they had    horsepower Ricardo engines. They went five miles an hour and inside it was     degrees in the pitch dark. And they had a canary hung inside the thing to make sure the Germans weren't going to use gas. Happy little story  isn't it  This is Motor Ritz Towers in Manhattan in the   s  where you drove up to your front door  if you had the guts. Anybody who was anybody had an apartment there. I managed to stick in both the zeppelin and an ocean liner out of sheer enthusiasm. And I love cigars    there's a cigar billboard down there. And faux nostalgia works even in serious subjects like war. This is those wonderful days of the Battle of Britain in       when a Messerschmitt ME    bursts into the House of Commons and buzzes around  just to piss off Churchill  who's down there somewhere. It's a fond memory of times past. Hyperbolic overkill is a way of taking exaggeration to the absolute ultimate limit  just for the fun of it. This was a piece I did    a brochure again     RMS Tyrannic  The Biggest Thing in All the World.  The copy  which you can't see because it goes on and on for several pages  says that steerage passengers can't get their to bunks before the voyage is over  and it's so safe it carries no insurance. It's obviously modeled on the Titanic. But it's not a cri de coeur about man's hubris in the face of the elements. It's just a sick  silly joke. Shamelessly cheap is something  I think    this will wake you up. It has no meaning  just    Desoto discovers the Mississippi  and it's a Desoto discovering the Mississippi. I did that as a quick back page    I had like four hours to do a back page for an issue of the Lampoon  and I did that  and I thought   Well  I'm ashamed. I hope nobody knows it.  People wrote in for reprints of that thing. Urban absurdism    that's what the New Yorker really calls for. I try to make life in New York look even weirder than it is with those covers. I've done about    of them  and I'd say    of them are based on that concept. I was driving down  th Avenue one night at   a.m.  and this steam pouring out of the street  and I thought   What causes that   And that    who s to say  The Temple of Dendur at the Metropolitan in New York    it's a very somber place. I thought I could jazz it up a bit  have a little fun with it. This is a very un PC cover. Not in New York. I couldn't resist  and I got a nasty email from some environmental group saying   This is too serious and solemn to make fun of. You should be ashamed  please apologize on our website.  Haven't got around to it yet but    I may. This is the word side of my brain. I love the word  Eurotrash.  That's all the Eurotrash coming through JFK customs. This was the New York bike messenger meeting the Tour de France. If you live in New York  you know how the bike messengers move. Except that he's carrying a tube for blueprints and stuff    they all do    and a lot of people thought that meant it was a terrorist about to shoot rockets at the Tour de France    sign of our times  I guess. This is the only fashion cover I've ever done. It's the little old lady that lives in a shoe  and then this thing    the title of that was   There Goes the Neighborhood.  I don't know a hell of a lot about fashion    I was told to do what they call a Mary Jane  and then I got into this terrible fight between the art director and the editor saying   Put a strap on it      No  don't put a strap on it      Put a strap on it     Don't put a strap on it     because it obscures the logo and looks terrible and it's bad and    I finally chickened out and did it for the sake of the authenticity of the shoe. This is a tiny joke    E ZR pass. One letter makes an idea. This is a big joke. This is the audition for  King Kong.  People always ask me  where do you get your ideas  how do your ideas come  Truth about that one is I had a horrible red wine hangover  in the middle of the night  this came to me like a Xerox    all I had to do was write it down. It was perfectly clear. I didn't do any thinking about it. And then when it ran  a lovely lady  an old lady named Mrs. Edgar Rosenberg    if you know that name    called me and said she loved the cover  it was so sweet. Her former name was Fay Wray  and so that was    I didn't have the wit to say   Take the painting.  Finally  this was a three page cover  never done before  and I don't think it will ever be done again    successive pages in the front of the magazine. It's the ascent of man using an escalator  and it's in three parts. You can't see it all together  unfortunately  but if you look at it enough  you can sort of start to see how it actually starts to move. Pretty elegant. Nothing like a crash to end a joke. That completes my oeuvre. I would just like to add a crass commercial    I have a kids' book coming out in the fall called  Marvel Sandwiches   a compendium of all the serious play that ever was  and it s going to be available in fine bookstores  crummy bookstores  tables on the street in October. So thank you very much. Some    years ago  I became allergic to Delhi's air. My doctors told me that my lung capacity had gone down to    percent  and it was killing me. With the help of IIT  TERI  and learnings from NASA  we discovered that there are three basic green plants  common green plants  with which we can grow all the fresh air we need indoors to keep us healthy. We've also found that you can reduce the fresh air requirements into the building  while maintaining industry indoor air quality standards. The three plants are Areca palm  Mother in Law's Tongue and money plant. The botanical names are in front of you. Areca palm is a plant which removes CO  and converts it into oxygen. We need four shoulder high plants per person  and in terms of plant care  we need to wipe the leaves every day in Delhi  and perhaps once a week in cleaner air cities. We had to grow them in vermi manure  which is sterile  or hydroponics  and take them outdoors every three to four months. The second plant is Mother in law's Tongue  which is again a very common plant  and we call it a bedroom plant  because it converts CO  into oxygen at night. And we need six to eight waist high plants per person. The third plant is money plant  and this is again a very common plant  preferably grows in hydroponics. And this particular plant removes formaldehydes and other volatile chemicals. With these three plants  you can grow all the fresh air you need. In fact  you could be in a bottle with a cap on top  and you would not die at all  and you would not need any fresh air. We have tried these plants at our own building in Delhi  which is a        square feet     year old building. And it has close to       such plants for     occupants. Our studies have found that there is a    percent probability of one's blood oxygen going up by one percent if one stays indoors in this building for    hours. The government of India has discovered or published a study to show that this is the healthiest building in New Delhi. And the study showed that  compared to other buildings  there is a reduced incidence of eye irritation by    percent  respiratory systems by    percent  headaches by    percent  lung impairment by    percent and asthma by nine percent. And this study has been published on September          and it's available on the government of India website. Our experience points to an amazing increase in human productivity by over    percent by using these plants. And also a reduction in energy requirements in buildings by an outstanding    percent  because you need less fresh air. We are now replicating this in a  .   million square feet building  which will have        indoor plants. Why is this important  It is also important for the environment  because the world's energy requirements are expected to grow by    percent in the next decade.    percent of the world's energy is taken up by buildings currently  and    percent of the world's population will be living in buildings in cities with a population of over one million in the next    years. And there is a growing preference for living and working in air conditioned places.  Be the change you want to see in the world   said Mahatma Gandhi. And thank you for listening. If you're at all like me  this is what you do with the sunny summer weekends in San Francisco  you build experimental kite powered hydrofoils capable of more than    knots. And you realize that there is incredible power in the wind  and it can do amazing things. And one day  a vessel not unlike this will probably break the world speed record. But kites aren't just toys like this. Kites  I'm going to give you a brief history  and tell you about the magnificent future of every child's favorite plaything. So  kites are more than a thousand years old  and the Chinese used them for military applications  and even for lifting men. So they knew at that stage they could carry large weights. I'm not sure why there is a hole in this particular man. In       a fellow called George Pocock actually pioneered the use of kites for towing buggies in races against horse carriages across the English countryside. Then of course  at the dawn of aviation  all of the great inventors of the time    like Hargreaves  like Langley  even Alexander Graham Bell  inventor of the telephone  who was flying this kite    were doing so in the pursuit of aviation. Then these two fellows came along  and they were flying kites to develop the control systems that would ultimately enable powered human flight. So this is of course Orville and Wilbur Wright  and the Wright Flyer. And their experiments with kites led to this momentous occasion  where we powered up and took off for the first ever    second human flight. And that was fantastic for the future of commercial aviation. But unfortunately  it relegated kites once again to be considered children's toys. That was until the     s  where we had the last energy crisis. And a fabulous man called Miles Loyd who lives on the outskirts of San Francisco  wrote this seminal paper that was completely ignored in the Journal of Energy about how to use basically an airplane on a piece of string to generate enormous amounts of electricity. The real key observation he made is that a free flying wing can sweep through more sky and generate more power in a unit of time than a fixed wing turbine. So turbines grew. And they can now span up to three hundred feet at the hub height  but they can't really go a lot higher  and more height is where the more wind is  and more power    as much as twice as much. So cut to now. We still have an energy crisis  and now we have a climate crisis as well. You know  so humans generate about    trillion watts  or    terawatts  from fossil fuels. And Al Gore has spoken to why we need to hit one of these targets  and in reality what that means is in the next    to    years  we have to make    trillion watts or more of new clean energy somehow. Wind is the second largest renewable resource after solar       terawatts  more than enough to supply humanity     times over. The majority of it is in the higher altitudes  above     feet  where we don't have a technology as yet to get there. So this is the dawn of the new age of kites. This is our test site on Maui  flying across the sky. I'm now going to show you the first autonomous generation of power by every child's favorite plaything. As you can tell  you need to be a robot to fly this thing for thousands of hours. It makes you a little nauseous. And here we're actually generating about    kilowatts    so  enough to power probably five United States households    with a kite not much larger than this piano. And the real significant thing here is we're developing the control systems  as did the Wright brothers  that would enable sustained  long duration flight. And it doesn't hurt to do it in a location like this either. So this is the equivalent for a kite flier of peeing in the snow    that's tracing your name in the sky. And this is where we're actually going. So we're beyond the    second steps. And we're working towards megawatt scale machines that fly at      feet and generate tons of clean electricity. So you ask  how big are those machines  Well  this paper plane would be maybe a    oop  That would be enough to power your cell phone. Your Cessna would be     killowatts. If you'd loan me your Gulfstream  I'll rip its wings off and generate you a megawatt. If you give me a      I'll make six megawatts  which is more than the largest wind turbines today. And the Spruce Goose would be a    megawatt wing. So that is audacious  you say. I agree. But audacious is what has happened many times before in history. This is a refrigerator factory  churning out airplanes for World War II. Prior to World War II  they were making      planes a year. By       they were making        . With this factory and         planes a year  we could make all of America's electricity in about    years. So really this is a story about the audacious plans of young people with these dreams. There are many of us. I am lucky enough to work with    of them. And I think we need to support all of the dreams of the kids out there doing these crazy things. Thank you. I've been working on issues of poverty for more than    years  and so it's ironic that the problem that and question that I most grapple with is how you actually define poverty. What does it mean  So often  we look at dollar terms    people making less than a dollar or two or three a day. And yet the complexity of poverty really has to look at income as only one variable. Because really  it's a condition about choice  and the lack of freedom. And I had an experience that really deepened and elucidated for me the understanding that I have. It was in Kenya  and I want to share it with you. I was with my friend Susan Meiselas  the photographer  in the Mathare Valley slums. Now  Mathare Valley is one of the oldest slums in Africa. It's about three miles out of Nairobi  and it's a mile long and about two tenths of a mile wide  where over half a million people live crammed in these little tin shacks  generation after generation  renting them  often eight or    people to a room. And it's known for prostitution  violence  drugs  a hard place to grow up. And when we were walking through the narrow alleys  it was literally impossible not to step in the raw sewage and the garbage alongside the little homes. But at the same time it was also impossible not to see the human vitality  the aspiration and the ambition of the people who live there  women washing their babies  washing their clothes  hanging them out to dry. I met this woman  Mama Rose  who has rented that little tin shack for    years  where she lives with her seven children. Four sleep in one twin bed  and three sleep on the mud and linoleum floor. And she keeps them all in school by selling water from that kiosk  and from selling soap and bread from the little store inside. It was also the day after the inauguration  and I was reminded how Mathare is still connected to the globe. And I would see kids on the street corners  and they'd say  Obama  he's our brother   And I'd say  Well  Obama's my brother  so that makes you my brother too.  And they would look quizzically  and then be like   High five   And it was here that I met Jane. I was struck immediately by the kindness and the gentleness in her face  and I asked her to tell me her story. She started off by telling me her dream. She said   I had two. My first dream was to be a doctor  and the second was to marry a good man who would stay with me and my family  because my mother was a single mom  and couldn't afford to pay for school fees. So I had to give up the first dream  and I focused on the second.  She got married when she was     had a baby right away. And when she turned     found herself pregnant with a second child  her mom died and her husband left her    married another woman. So she was again in Mathare  with no income  no skill set  no money. And so she ultimately turned to prostitution. It wasn't organized in the way we often think of it. She would go into the city at night with about    girls  look for work  and sometimes come back with a few shillings  or sometimes with nothing. And she said   You know  the poverty wasn't so bad. It was the humiliation and the embarrassment of it all.  In       her life changed. She had a girlfriend who had heard about this organization  Jamii Bora  that would lend money to people no matter how poor you were  as long as you provided a commensurate amount in savings. And so she spent a year to save    dollars  and started borrowing  and over time she was able to buy a sewing machine. She started tailoring. And that turned into what she does now  which is to go into the secondhand clothing markets  and for about three dollars and    cents she buys an old ball gown. Some of them might be ones you gave. And she repurposes them with frills and ribbons  and makes these frothy confections that she sells to women for their daughter's Sweet    or first Holy Communion    those milestones in a life that people want to celebrate all along the economic spectrum. And she does really good business. In fact  I watched her walk through the streets hawking. And before you knew it  there was a crowd of women around her  buying these dresses. And I reflected  as I was watching her sell the dresses  and also the jewelry that she makes  that now Jane makes more than four dollars a day. And by many definitions she is no longer poor. But she still lives in Mathare Valley. And so she can't move out. She lives with all of that insecurity  and in fact  in January  during the ethnic riots  she was chased from her home and had to find a new shack in which she would live. Jamii Bora understands that and understands that when we're talking about poverty  we've got to look at people all along the economic spectrum. And so with patient capital from Acumen and other organizations  loans and investments that will go the long term with them  they built a low cost housing development  about an hour outside Nairobi central. And they designed it from the perspective of customers like Jane herself  insisting on responsibility and accountability. So she has to give    percent of the mortgage    of the total value  or about     dollars in savings. And then they match her mortgage to what she paid in rent for her little shanty. And in the next couple of weeks  she's going to be among the first     families to move into this development. When I asked her if she feared anything  or whether she would miss anything from Mathare  she said   What would I fear that I haven't confronted already  I'm HIV positive. I've dealt with it all.  And she said   What would I miss  You think I will miss the violence or the drugs  The lack of privacy  Do you think I'll miss not knowing if my children are going to come home at the end of the day   She said  If you gave me    minutes my bags would be packed.  I said   Well what about your dreams   And she said   Well  you know  my dreams don't look exactly like I thought they would when I was a little girl. But if I think about it  I thought I wanted a husband  but what I really wanted was a family that was loving. And I fiercely love my children  and they love me back.  She said   I thought that I wanted to be a doctor  but what I really wanted to be was somebody who served and healed and cured. And so I feel so blessed with everything that I have  that two days a week I go and I counsel HIV patients. And I say  'Look at me. You are not dead. You are still alive. And if you are still alive you have to serve.'  And she said   I'm not a doctor who gives out pills. But maybe me  I give out something better because I give them hope.  And in the middle of this economic crisis  where so many of us are inclined to pull in with fear  I think we're well suited to take a cue from Jane and reach out  recognizing that being poor doesn't mean being ordinary. Because when systems are broken  like the ones that we're seeing around the world  it's an opportunity for invention and for innovation. It's an opportunity to truly build a world where we can extend services and products to all human beings  so that they can make decisions and choices for themselves. I truly believe it's where dignity starts. We owe it to the Janes of the world. And just as important  we owe it to ourselves. Thank you. I'm the weekly tech critic for the New York Times. I review gadgets and stuff. And mostly what good dads should be doing this time of year is nestling with their kids and decorating the Christmas tree. What I'm mostly doing this year is going on cable TV and answering the same question   What are the tech trends for next year   And I'm like   Didn't we just go through this last year   But I'm going to pick the one that interests me most  and that is the completed marriage of the cell phone and the Internet. You know  I found that volcano on Google Images  not realizing how much it makes me look like the cover of Dianetics. Anyway  this all started a few years ago  when they started carrying your voice over the Internet rather than over a phone line  and we've come a long way since that. But that was interesting in itself. This is companies like Vonage. Basically you take an ordinary telephone  you plug it into this little box that they give you and the box plugs into your cable modem. Now  it works just like a regular phone. So you can pick up the phone  you hear a dial tone  but its just a fake out. It's a WAV file of a dial tone  just to reassure you that the world hasn't ended. It could be anything. It could be salsa music or a comedy routine    it doesn't matter. The little box has your phone number. So that's really cool    you can take it to London or Siberia  and your next door neighbor can dial your home number and your phone will ring  because it's got everything in the box. They've got every feature known to man in there  because adding a new feature is just software. And as a result of Voice Over IP    I hate that term    Voice Over Internet    land line home phone service has gone down    percent in the last three years. I mean  no self respecting college kid has home phone service anymore. This is what college kids are more likely to have. It's the most popular VOIP service in the world  It's Skype. It's a free program you download for your Mac or PC  and you make free phone calls anywhere in the world The downside is that you have to wear a headset like a nerd. It's not your phone    it's your computer. But nonetheless  if you're a college kid and you have no money  believe me  this is better than trying to use your cell phone. It's really cute seeing middle aged people like me  try out Skype for the first time  which is usually when their kid goes away for a semester abroad. They don't want to pay the international fees  so they're like   Timmy  Is that you   It's really cute. But I    at least it was when I did it    I think where VOIP is really going to get interesting is when they start putting it on cell phones. Imagine if you had an ordinary cell phone  and any time you were in a wireless hotspot    free calls anywhere in the world  never pay the cellular company a nickel. It'd be really  really cool    and yet  even though the technology for this has been available for five years  incredibly  the number of standard cell phones offered by US carriers with free VOIP is zero  I can't figure out why  Actually  I need to update that. There's one now. And it's so interesting that I thought I would tell you about it. It comes from T Mobile. And I am not paid by T Mobile. I'm not plugging T Mobile. The New York Times has very rigid policies about that. Ever since that Jayson Blair jerk ruined it for all of us. Basically  the reason you haven't heard about this program is because it was introduced last year on June   . Does anyone remember what else happened on June    last year  It was the iPhone. The iPhone came out that day. I'm like  can you imagine being the T Mobile PR lady  You know   Hi  we have an announcement to    WAH     But it's actually really  really cool. You have a choice of phones  and we're not talking smartphones    ordinary phones  including a Blackberry  that have Wi Fi. The deal is  any time you're in a Wi Fi hotspot  all your calls are free. And when you're out of the hotspot  you're on the regular cellular network. You're thinking   Well  how often am I in a hotspot   The answer is   All the time   Because they give you a regular wireless router that works with the phone  for your house. Which is really ingenious  because we all know that T Mobile is the most pathetic carrier. They have coverage like the size of my thumbnail. But it's a hundred million dollars to put up one of those towers. Right  They don't have that kind of money. Instead they give each of us a seven dollar and    cent box. They're like a stealth tower installation program. We're putting it in our homes for them  Anyway  they have Wi Fi phones in Europe. But the thing that T Mobile did that nobody's done before is  when you're on a call an you move from Wi Fi into cellular range  the call is handed off in mid syllable  seamlessly. I'll show you the advanced technologies we use at the New York Times to test this gear. This is me with a camcorder on a phone going like this. As I walk out of the house from my Wi Fi hotspot into the cellular network on a call with my wife    look at the upper left. That's the Wi Fi signal. David Pogue  Hi babes  it's me. JP  Oh  hi darling  how are you  DP  You're on Wi Fi. How does it sound  JP  Oh  it sounds pretty good. Now  I'm leaving the house. DP  I'm going for a walk    do you mind  JP  No not at all. I'm having a great day with the kids. DP  What are you guys doing  Right there  It just changed to the cellular tower in mid call. I don't know why my wife says I never listen to her. I don't get that. The bottom line is that the boundaries  because of the Internet plus cell phone  are melting. The cool thing about the T Mobile phones is that although switching technologies is very advanced  the billing technology has not caught up. So what I mean is that you can start a call in your house in the Wi Fi hotspot  you can get in your car and talk until the battery's dead    which would be like    minutes    And the call will continue to be free. Because they don't  they haven't    well  no  wait  Not so fast. It also works the other way. So if you start a call on your cellular network and you come home  you keep being billed. Which is why most people with this service get into the habit of saying   Hey  I just got home. Can I call you right back   Now you get it. It's also true that if you use one of these phones overseas  it doesn't know what Internet hotspot you're in. On the Internet nobody knows you're a dog  right  Nobody knows you're in Pakistan. You can make free unlimited calls home to the US with these phones. So  very  very interesting. This is another favorite of mine. Does anyone here have a working cell phone that's on  with coverage  who can make a call right now without a lot of fussing  OK. Would you call me please right now   Phone number given.  And don't you all call me at three a.m. asking me to fix your printer. I have two cell phones  so this going to be very odd  if it works. I should know not to do technology demos in front of an audience. It's just  like  absurd. This one is going off. And    oh  I have the ringer off. Tsh  Great. Anyway  this one is also going off. So they're both ringing at the same time. Excuse me one second. Hello  Oh. Where are you calling from  No  no just kidding. There he is. Thank you very much for doing that. I didn't even know it was you    I was looking at this guy. Oh great  Yeah. Yeah you can all stop calling now  All right  We've made the point. All right. Ringer off. Everyone wants in on the action. So this is Grand Central at work    it's a    oh  for gods sake  I have your numbers now  You will pay. Grand Central is this really brilliant idea where they give you a new phone number  and then at that point one phone number rings all your phones at once. Your home phone  your work phone  your cell phone  your yacht phone The beauty of that is you never miss a call. I know a lot of you are like   Ooh  I don't want to be reached at any hour.  But the beauty is it's all going through the internet  so you get all of these really cool features    like you can say  I want these people to be able to call me only during these hours. And I want these people to hear this greeting   Hi boss  I'm out making us both some money. Leave a message.  And then your wife calls  and   Hi honey  leave me a message.  Very  very customizable. Google bought it  and they've been working on it for a year. They're supposed to come out with it very shortly in a public method. By the way  this is something that really bothers me. I don't know if you realize this. When you call     on your cell phone  they charge you two bucks. Did you know that  It's an outrage. I actually got a photograph of the Verizon employee right there. I'm going to tell you how to avoid that now. What you're going to use is Google Cellular. It's totally free    there's not even ads. If you know how to send a text message  you can get the same information for free. I'm about to change your life. So here's me doing it. You send a text message to the word  Google   which turns out to be      . Leave off the last  e  for savings. Anyway  so lets say you need a drugstore near Chicago. You type  pharmacy Chicago   or the zip code. You hit send  and in five seconds  they will send you back the two closest drugstores  complete with name address and phone number. Here it comes. And it's already written down    so  like  if you're driving  you don't have to do one of these things   Uh huh  uh huh  uh huh.  It works with weather  too. You can say  Weather   and the name of the city you're going to travel to. And then in five seconds  they send you back the complete weather forecast for that town. Shortly I'll tell you why I was in Milan. Here we go. And those are just the beginning. These are all the different things that you can text to Google and they will    yeah  You're all trying to write this down. That's cute. I do have an email address. You can just ask me. It's absolutely phenomenal. The only downside is that it requires you to know how to text    send a text message. Nobody over    knows how to do that. So I'm going to teach you something even better. This is called Google Info. They've just launched this voice activated version of the same thing. It's speech recognition like you've never heard before. So lets say I'm in Monterey  and I want what  I want to find what  Bagels. OK. Google  Say the business and the city and state. DP  Bagels  Monterey  California. I got the Chinese line. Google  Bagels  Monterey  California. Top eight results  Number one  Bagel Bakery on El Dorado Street. To select number one  you can press one or say  number one.  Number two  Bagel Bakery  commissary department. Number Two. Number Two. Two. Why do I listen to people in the audience  Well anyway    oh  Here we go  Google  ... commissary department on McClellan Avenue  Monterey. I'll connect you  or say  details   or  go back.  DP  He's connecting me  He doesn't even tell me the phone number. He's just connecting me directly. It's like having a personal valet. Google  Hold on. DP  Hi  could I have     with a schmear  No  no  no    just kidding  no no. So anyway  you never even find out the number. It's just so amazing. And it has incredible  incredible accuracy. This is even more amazing. Put this in your speed dial. This you can ask by voice any question. Who won the      World Series  What's the recipe for a certain cocktail  It's absolutely amazing    and they text you back the answer. I tried this this morning just to make sure it's still alive.  Which actors have played James Bond   They text me back this   Sean Connery  George Lazenby  Roger Moore  Timothy Dalton  Pierce Brosnan  Daniel Craig.  Right  And then I was trying to pretend I was like a Valley girl. I'm like   What's the word that means you know  like  when the sun  the moon and the earth are  like  all in a line   Just to see how the recognition was. They texted me back   It's called a syzygy.  Which I knew  because it's the word that won me the Ohio spelling bee in     . You know  there's a lot of people wondering   How on earth are they going to make money doing this   And the answer is  look at the last line. They put this teeny weeny little ad  about    characters long. And a lot of people also want to know   How does it work  How can it be so good  It's as though there is a human being on the other end of the line.  Because there is one  They have        people who are being paid    cents per answer. As you can imagine  it's college kids and old people. That's who can afford to do that. But it's a human being on the line. And it's gotten me out of so many tough positions like   When's the last flight out of Chicago   You know. It's just absolutely amazing. Another thing that really bothers me about cell phones today    this is probably my biggest pet peeve in all of technology. When I call to leave you a message  I get    seconds of instructions from a third grade teacher on Ambien   To page this person ...   Page  What is this        Nobody has pagers anymore.  You may begin speaking at the tone. When you have finished recording  you may hang up.  No  And then it gets worse  when I call to retrieve my messages  first of all   You have    messages. To listen to your messages ...   Why else am I calling  Of course I want to listen to the messages  Oh  You all have cell phones too. So last year I went to Milan  Italy  and I got to speak to an audience of cellular executives from     countries around the world. And I said as a joke    as a joke  I said   I did the math. Verizon has    million customers. If you check your voicemail twice a day  that's     million dollars a year. I bet you guys are doing this just to run up our airtime  aren't you   No chuckle. They're like this    Where is the outrage  people  Rise up  Sorry. I'm not bitter. So now I'm going to tell you how to get out of that. There are these services that transcribe your voicemail into text. And they send it either to your email or as text messages to your phone. It is a life changer. And by the way  they don't always get the words right  because it's over the phone and all that. So they attach the audio file at the bottom of the email so you can listen to double check. The services are called things like Spinvox  Phonetag    this is the one I use    Callwave. A lot of people say   How are they doing this  I don't really want people listening in to my calls.  The executives at these companies told me   Well we use a proprietary B to B  best of breed  peer to peer soluti      you know. I think basically it's like these guys in India with headsets  you know  listening in. The reason I think that is that on the first day I tried one of these services  I got two voicemail messages. One was from a guy named Michael Stevenson  which shouldn't be that hard to transcribe  and it was misspelled. The other was from my video producer at the Times  whose name is Vijaiy Singh  with the silent 'h'. Nailed that one. So you be the judge. Anyway  this service  Callwave  promises that it's all software    nobody is listening to your messages. And they also promise that they're going to transcribe only the gist of your messages. So I thought I'd see how that goes. This is me testing it out. Hope you're doing well. I'm fine here. Everything's good. Hey  I was walking along the street and the sky was blue. And your daughter broke her leg at soccer practice. I'm going to have a sandwich for lunch. She's in room    emergency room   W. OK  talk to you later    bye. I love my job. So a couple minutes later  this I got by email. It's a very good transcription. But a couple minutes after that  I got the text message version. Now remember  a text message can only be     characters long. So it had better be the gist of the gist  right  I'm not kidding you. The message said   Was walking along the street  and  sky was blue  and  emergency   What the f      Well I guess that was the gist. And lastly  I just have to talk about this one. This is my favorite of all time. It's called Popularitydialer.com. Basically  you're going to go on some iffy date  or a potentially bad meeting. So you go and you type in your phone number  and at the exact minute where you want to be called    And at that moment your phone will ring. And you're like   I'm sorry. I've got to take this.  The really beautiful thing is  you know how when somebody's sitting next to you  sometimes they can sort of hear a little bit of the caller. So they give you a choice of what you want to hear on the other end. Here's the girlfriend. Phone  Hey you  what's going on  DP  I'm kinda  like  giving a talk right now. Phone  Well  that's good. DP  What are you doing  Phone  I was just wondering what you were up to. DP  Right  I can't really talk right now. This is the    I love this    the boss call. Phone  Hey  this is Mr. Johnson calling from the office. DP  Oh  hi  sir. Phone  Did you complete that thing about a month ago  That photocopier training  DP  Oh    sorry I forgot. Phone  Yeah  well so when was the last time you used the photocopier  DP  It was like three weeks ago. Phone  Well  I don't know if you heard  you might have heard from Lenny  but    I think the biggest change when Internet met phone was with the iPhone. Not my finest moment in New York Times journalism. It was when in the fall of       I explained why Apple would never do a cell phone. I looked like a moron. However  my logic was good  because    I don't know if you realize this  but    until the iPhone came along  the carriers    Verizon  AT T  Cingular    held veto power over every aspect of every design of every phone. I know the people who worked on the Treo. They went around to these carriers and said   Look at these cool features.  And Verizon is like   Hmm  no. I don't think so.  It was not very conducive to innovation. What I didn't anticipate was that Steve Jobs went around and said   Tell you what    I'll give you a five year exclusive if you'll let me design this phone in peace    and you won't even see it till it's done.  Actually  even so  he was turned down by Verizon and others. Finally Cingular said OK. I'm going to talk about the effect of the iPhone. Please don't corner me at the party tonight and go   What are you  An Apple fan boy     you know. I'm not. You can see what I said about it. It's a flawed masterpiece. It's got bad things and good things. Lets all acknowledge that right now. But it did change a few things. The first thing it changed was that all those carriers saw that they sold    million of these things in a year. And they said   Oh my gosh  maybe we've been doing it wrong. Maybe we should let phone designers design the phones.  Another thing was that it let    million people  for the first time  experience being online all the time. Not using these    dollar a month cellular cards for their laptops. I don't understand why we're not there yet. When I'm an old man  I'm going to tell my grandchildren   When I was your age  if I wanted to check my email  I used to drive around town looking for a coffee shop. I did    We had wireless base stations that could broadcast    yay  about     feet across.  It's absurd. We have power outlets in every room of every building. We have running water. What's the problem  Anyway    but this teaches people what it's like. You have to go to YouTube and type in  iPhone Shuffle.  This guy did a mock video of one that's one inch square  like the real iPod Shuffle. It's like   It only has one button. Touch it and it dials a number at random.   Who the hell is this   But the other thing it did is it opened up this idea of an app store. It downloads right to the phone. And you can use the tilt sensor to steer this car using this game. These programs can use all the components of the iPhone    the touch screen. This is the Etch A Sketch program    the theme of EG     . You know how you erase it  Of course. You shake it. Right  of course. We shake it to erase  like this. They have        of these programs. This is the translator program. They have every language in the world. You type in what you want  and it gives you the translation. This is amazing. This is Midomi. A song is running through your head    you sing it into the thing  do do do do do  da da da da da da  da dum ... OK  you tap   Done  and it will find out the song and play it for you. I know. It's insane  right  This is Pandora. Free Internet radio. Not just free Internet radio    you type in a band or a song name. It will immediately play you that song or that band. It has a thumbs up and a thumbs down. You say if you like this song or not. If you like it  it tries another song on you from a different band  with the same instrumentation  vocals  theme and tempo. If you like that one  or don't like it  you do thumbs up and thumbs down. Over time it tailors the songs so that it completely stops playing bad songs. It eventually only plays songs you like. This is Urbanspoon. You're in a city. It knows from GPS where you're standing. You want to find a place to eat. You shake it. It proposes a restaurant. It gives you the price  and the location and ratings. Video  I'm not going all the way to Flushing. Anyway  just amazing  amazing things. Of course  its not just about the iPhone. The iPhone broke the dyke  the wall. But now it's everybody else. So Google has done their own Android operating system that will soon be on handsets    phones from    companies. Touch screen    very  very nice. Also with its own app store  where you can download programs. This is amazing. In the wake of all this  Verizon  the most calcified  corporate  conservative carrier of all  said   You can use any phone you want on our network.  I love the Wired headline  Pigs Fly  Hell Freezes Over and Verizon Opens Up Its Network    No. Really. So everything is changing. We've entered a new world of innovation  where the cell phone becomes your laptop  customized the way you want it. Every cell phone is unique. There is software that you can add on. Can I do one more one minute song  Thank you. Just to round it up    this is the new Apple Power Music Stand. It's only three pounds  or    if you install Microsoft Office. Sorry  that was mean. This is a song I did for the New York Times website as a music video. Ladies and gentlemen  for seven blissful hours it was the number one video on YouTube. And now the end is near. I'm sick to death of this old cell phone. Bad sound  the signal's weak  the software stinks. A made in Hell phone. I've heard there's something new    a million times more rad than my phone. I too will join the cult. I want an iPhone. Concerns    I have a few. It's got some flaws  we may just face it. No keys  no memory card  the battery's sealed    you can't replace it. But God  this thing is sweet. A multitouch  iPod  Wi Fi phone. You had me from   Hello.  I want an iPhone. I want to touch its precious screen. I want to wipe the smudges clean. I want my friends to look and drool. I want to say   Look    now I'm cool  I stood in line and I'll get mine. I want an iPhone. For what is a man  What has he got  If not iPhone  then he's got squat. It's all the things a phone should be. Who cares if it's AT T  I took a stand  paid half a grand  And I got an iPhone  Thank you. Thank you very much. I coined my own definition of success in       when I was teaching at a high school in South Bend  Indiana  being a little bit disappointed  and  disillusioned  perhaps  by the way parents of the youngsters in my English classes expected their youngsters to get an A or a B. They thought a C was all right for the neighbors' children  because they were all average. But they weren't satisfied when their own    it would make the teacher feel that they had failed  or the youngster had failed. And that's not right. The good Lord in his infinite wisdom didn't create us all equal as far as intelligence is concerned  any more than we're equal for size  appearance. Not everybody could earn an A or a B  and I didn't like that way of judging  and I did know how the alumni of various schools back in the '  s judged coaches and athletic teams. If you won them all  you were considered to be reasonably successful    not completely. Because I found out    we had a number of years at UCLA where we didn't lose a game. But it seemed that we didn't win each individual game by the margin that some of our alumni had predicted    And quite frequently I really felt that they had backed up their predictions in a more materialistic manner. But that was true back in the   s  so I understood that. But I didn't like it  I didn't agree with it. I wanted to come up with something I hoped could make me a better teacher  and give the youngsters under my supervision  be it in athletics or the English classroom  something to which to aspire  other than just a higher mark in the classroom  or more points in some athletic contest. I thought about that for quite a spell  and I wanted to come up with my own definition. I thought that might help. And I knew how Mr. Webster defined it  as the accumulation of material possessions or the attainment of a position of power or prestige  or something of that sort  worthy accomplishments perhaps  but in my opinion  not necessarily indicative of success. So I wanted to come up with something of my own. And I recalled    I was raised on a small farm in Southern Indiana  and Dad tried to teach me and my brothers that you should never try to be better than someone else. I'm sure at the time he did that  I didn't    it didn't    well  somewhere  I guess in the hidden recesses of the mind  it popped out years later. Never try to be better than someone else  always learn from others. Never cease trying to be the best you can be    that's under your control. If you get too engrossed and involved and concerned in regard to the things over which you have no control  it will adversely affect the things over which you have control. Then I ran across this simple verse that said   At God's footstool to confess  a poor soul knelt  and bowed his head. 'I failed ' he cried. The Master said  'Thou didst thy best  that is success.'  From those things  and one other perhaps  I coined my own definition of success  which is  Peace of mind attained only through self satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to do the best of which you're capable. I believe that's true. If you make the effort to do the best of which you're capable  trying to improve the situation that exists for you  I think that's success  and I don't think others can judge that  it's like character and reputation    your reputation is what you're perceived to be  your character is what you really are. And I think that character is much more important than what you are perceived to be. You'd hope they'd both be good  but they won't necessarily be the same. Well  that was my idea that I was going to try to get across to the youngsters. I ran across other things. I love to teach  and it was mentioned by the previous speaker that I enjoy poetry  and I dabble in it a bit  and love it. There are some things that helped me  I think  be better than I would have been. I know I'm not what I ought to be  what I should be  but I think I'm better than I would have been if I hadn't run across certain things. One was just a little verse that said   No written word  no spoken plea can teach our youth what they should be  nor all the books on all the shelves    it's what the teachers are themselves.  That made an impression on me in the     s. And I tried to use that more or less in my teaching  whether it be in sports  or whether it be in the English classroom. I love poetry and always had an interest in that somehow. Maybe it's because Dad used to read to us at night  by coal oil lamp    we didn't have electricity in our farm home. And Dad would read poetry to us. So I always liked it. And about the same time I ran across this one verse  I ran across another one. Someone asked a lady teacher why she taught  and after some time  she said she wanted to think about that. Then she came up and said   They ask me why I teach  and I reply  'Where could I find such splendid company ' There sits a statesman  strong  unbiased  wise  another Daniel Webster  silver tongued. A doctor sits beside him  whose quick  steady hand may mend a bone  or stem the life blood's flow. And there a builder  upward rise the arch of a church he builds  wherein that minister may speak the word of God  and lead a stumbling soul to touch the Christ. And all about  a gathering of teachers  farmers  merchants  laborers    those who work and vote and build and plan and pray into a great tomorrow. And I may say  I may not see the church  or hear the word  or eat the food their hands may grow  but yet again I may  And later I may say  I knew him once  and he was weak  or strong  or bold or proud or gay. I knew him once  but then he was a boy. They ask me why I teach and I reply  'Where could I find such splendid company '  And I believe the teaching profession    it's true  you have so many youngsters  and I've got to think of my youngsters at UCLA       some attorneys     dentists and doctors  many  many teachers and other professions. And that gives you a great deal of pleasure  to see them go on. I always tried to make the youngsters feel that they're there to get an education  number one  basketball was second  because it was paying their way  and they do need a little time for social activities  but you let social activities take a little precedence over the other two  and you're not going to have any very long. So that was the idea that I tried to get across to the youngsters under my supervision. I had three rules  pretty much  that I stuck with practically all the time. I'd learned these prior to coming to UCLA  and I decided they were very important. One was  Never be late.  Later on I said certain things    the players  if we were leaving for somewhere  had to be neat and clean. There was a time when I made them wear jackets and shirts and ties. Then I saw our chancellor coming to school in denims and turtlenecks  and thought  it's not right for me to keep this other  rule  so I let them just    they had to be neat and clean. I had one of my greatest players that you probably heard of  Bill Walton. He came to catch the bus  we were leaving for somewhere to play. And he wasn't clean and neat  so I wouldn't let him go. He couldn't get on the bus  he had to go home and get cleaned up to get to the airport. So I was a stickler for that. I believed in that. I believe in time  very important. I believe you should be on time  but I felt at practice  for example    we start on time  we close on time. The youngsters didn't have to feel that we were going to keep them over. When I speak at coaching clinics  I often tell young coaches    and at coaching clinics  more or less  they'll be the younger coaches getting in the profession. Most of them are young  you know  and probably newly married. And I tell them   Don't run practices late  because you'll go home in a bad mood  and that's not good  for a young married man to go home in a bad mood. When you get older  it doesn't make any difference  but     So I did believe  on time. I believe starting on time  and I believe closing on time. And another one I had was  not one word of profanity. One word of profanity  and you are out of here for the day. If I see it in a game  you're going to come out and sit on the bench. And the third one was  never criticize a teammate. I didn't want that. I used to tell them I was paid to do that. That's my job. I'm paid to do it. Pitifully poor  but I am paid to do it. Not like the coaches today  for gracious sakes  no. It's a little different than it was in my day. Those were three things that I stuck with pretty closely all the time. And those actually came from my dad. That's what he tried to teach me and my brothers at one time. I came up with a pyramid eventually  that I don't have the time to go on that. But that helped me  I think  become a better teacher. It's something like this  And I had blocks in the pyramid  and the cornerstones being industriousness and enthusiasm  working hard and enjoying what you're doing  coming up to the apex  according to my definition of success. And right at the top  faith and patience. And I say to you  in whatever you're doing  you must be patient. You have to have patience to    we want things to happen. We talk about our youth being impatient a lot  and they are. They want to change everything. They think all change is progress. And we get a little older    we sort of let things go. And we forget there is no progress without change. So you must have patience  and I believe that we must have faith. I believe that we must believe  truly believe. Not just give it word service  believe that things will work out as they should  providing we do what we should. I think our tendency is to hope things will turn out the way we want them to much of the time  but we don't do the things that are necessary to make those things become reality. I worked on this for some    years  and I think it helped me become a better teacher. But it all revolved around that original definition of success. You know  a number of years ago  there was a Major League Baseball umpire by the name of George Moriarty. He spelled Moriarty with only one 'i'. I'd never seen that before  but he did. Big league baseball players    they're very perceptive about those things  and they noticed he had only one 'i' in his name. You'd be surprised how many also told him that that was one more than he had in his head at various times. But he wrote something where I think he did what I tried to do in this pyramid. He called it  The Road Ahead  or the Road Behind.  He said   Sometimes I think the Fates must grin as we denounce them and insist the only reason we can't win  is the Fates themselves have missed. Yet there lives on the ancient claim  we win or lose within ourselves. The shining trophies on our shelves can never win tomorrow's game. You and I know deeper down  there's always a chance to win the crown. But when we fail to give our best  we simply haven't met the test  of giving all and saving none until the game is really won  of showing what is meant by grit  of playing through when others quit  of playing through  not letting up. It's bearing down that wins the cup. Of dreaming there's a goal ahead  of hoping when our dreams are dead  of praying when our hopes have fled  yet losing  not afraid to fall  if  bravely  we have given all. For who can ask more of a man than giving all within his span. Giving all  it seems to me  is not so far from victory. And so the Fates are seldom wrong  no matter how they twist and wind. It's you and I who make our fates    we open up or close the gates on the road ahead or the road behind.  Reminds me of another set of threes that my dad tried to get across to us  Don't whine. Don't complain. Don't make excuses. Just get out there  and whatever you're doing  do it to the best of your ability. And no one can do more than that. I tried to get across  too  that    my opponents will tell you    you never heard me mention winning. Never mention winning. My idea is that you can lose when you outscore somebody in a game  and you can win when you're outscored. I've felt that way on certain occasions  at various times. And I just wanted them to be able to hold their head up after a game. I used to say that when a game is over  and you see somebody that didn't know the outcome  I hope they couldn't tell by your actions whether you outscored an opponent or the opponent outscored you. That's what really matters  if you make an effort to do the best you can regularly  the results will be about what they should be. Not necessarily what you'd want them to be but they'll be about what they should  only you will know whether you can do that. And that's what I wanted from them more than anything else. And as time went by  and I learned more about other things  I think it worked a little better  as far as the results. But I wanted the score of a game to be the byproduct of these other things  and not the end itself. I believe it was one great philosopher who said    no  no    Cervantes. Cervantes said   The journey is better than the end.  And I like that. I think that it is    it's getting there. Sometimes when you get there  there's almost a let down. But it's the getting there that's the fun. As a basketball coach at UCLA  I liked our practices to be the journey  and the game would be the end  the end result. I liked to go up and sit in the stands and watch the players play  and see whether I'd done a decent job during the week. There again  it's getting the players to get that self satisfaction  in knowing that they'd made the effort to do the best of which they are capable. Sometimes I'm asked who was the best player I had  or the best teams. I can never answer that. As far as the individuals are concerned    I was asked one time about that  and they said   Suppose that you  in some way  could make the perfect player. What would you want   And I said   Well  I'd want one that knew why he was at UCLA  to get an education  he was a good student  really knew why he was there in the first place. But I'd want one that could play  too. I'd want one to realize that defense usually wins championships  and who would work hard on defense. But I'd want one who would play offense  too. I'd want him to be unselfish  and look for the pass first and not shoot all the time. And I'd want one that could pass and would pass. I've had some that could and wouldn't  and I've had some that would and could. So  yeah  I'd want that. And I wanted them to be able to shoot from the outside. I wanted them to be good inside too. I'd want them to be able to rebound well at both ends  too. Why not just take someone like Keith Wilkes and let it go at that. He had the qualifications. Not the only one  but he was one that I used in that particular category  because I think he made the effort to become the best. There was a couple. I mention in my book   They Call Me Coach   two players that gave me great satisfaction  that came as close as I think anyone I ever had to reach their full potential  one was Conrad Burke  and one was Doug McIntosh. When I saw them as freshmen  on our freshmen team    freshmen couldn't play varsity when I taught. I thought   Oh gracious  if these two players  either one of them     they were different years  but I thought about each one at the time he was there     Oh  if he ever makes the varsity  our varsity must be pretty miserable  if he's good enough to make it.  And you know  one of them was a starting player for a season and a half. The other one  his next year  played    minutes in a national championship game  Did a tremendous job for us. The next year  he was a starting player on the national championship team  and here I thought he'd never play a minute  when he was    so those are the things that give you great joy  and great satisfaction to see. Neither one of those youngsters could shoot very well. But they had outstanding shooting percentages  because they didn't force it. And neither one could jump very well  but they kept good position  and so they did well rebounding. They remembered that every shot that's taken  they assumed would be missed. I've had too many stand around and wait to see if it's missed  then they go and it's too late  somebody else is in there ahead of them. They weren't very quick  but they played good position  kept in good balance. And so they played pretty good defense for us. So they had qualities that    they came close to    as close to reaching possibly their full potential as any players I ever had. So I consider them to be as successful as Lewis Alcindor or Bill Walton  or many of the others that we had  there were some outstanding players. Have I rambled enough  I was told that when he makes his appearance  I was supposed to shut up. When most people think about the beginnings of AIDS  they're gonna think back to the     s. And certainly  this was the decade in which we discovered AIDS and the virus that causes it  HIV. But in fact this virus crossed over into humans many decades before  from chimpanzees  where the virus originated  into humans who hunt these apes. This photo was taken before the Great Depression in Brazzaville  Congo. At this time  there were thousands of individuals  we think  that were infected with HIV. So I have a couple of really important questions for you. If this virus was in thousands of individuals at this point  why was it the case that it took us until      to be able to discover this virus  OK now  more importantly  had we been there in the '  s and '  s  '  s  had we seen this disease  had we understood exactly what was going on with it  how might that have changed and completely transformed the nature of the way this pandemic moved  In fact  this is not unique to HIV. The vast majority of viruses come from animals. And you can kind of think of this as a pyramid of this bubbling up of viruses from animals into human populations. But only at the very top of this pyramid do these things become completely human. Nevertheless  we spend the vast majority of our energy focused on this level of the pyramid  trying to tackle things that are already completely adapted to human beings  that are going to be very very difficult to address    as we've seen in the case of HIV. So during the last    years  I've been working to actually study the earlier interface here    what I've labeled  viral chatter   which was a term coined by my mentor Don Burke. This is the idea that we can study the sort of pinging of these viruses into human populations  the movement of these agents over into humans  and by capturing this moment  we might be able to move to a situation where we can catch them early. OK  so this is a picture  and I'm going to show you some pictures now from the field. This is a picture of a central African hunter. It's actually a fairly common picture. One of the things I want you to note from it is blood    that you see a tremendous amount of blood contact. This was absolutely key for us. This is a very intimate form of connection. So if we're going to study viral chatter  we need to get to these populations who have intensive contact with wild animals. And so we've been studying people like this individual. We collect blood from them  other specimens. We look at the diseases  which are in the animals as well as the humans. And ideally  this is going to allow us to catch these things early on  as they're moving over into human populations. And the basic objective of this work is not to just go out once and look at these individuals  but to establish thousands of individuals in these populations that we would monitor continuously on a regular basis. When they were sick  we would collect specimens from them. We would actually enlist them    which we've done now    to collect specimens from animals. We give them these little pieces of filter paper. When they sample from animals  they collect the blood on the filter paper and this allows us to identify yet unknown viruses from exactly the right animals    the ones that are actually being hunted. two hunters stalk their prey. Their names are Patrice and Patee. They're searching for bush meat  forest animals they can kill to feed their families. Patrice and Patee set out most days to go out hunting in the forest around their homes. They have a series of traps  of snares that they've set up to catch wild pigs  snakes  monkeys  rodents    anything they can  really. Patrice and Patee have been out for hours but found nothing. The animals are simply gone. We stop for a drink of water. Then there is a rustle in the brush. A group of hunters approach  their packs loaded with wild game. There's at least three viruses that you know about  which are in this particular monkey. Nathan Wolfe  This species  yeah. And there's many many more pathogens that are present in these animals. These individuals are at specific risk  particularly if there's blood contact  they're at risk for transmission and possibly infection with novel viruses. Narrator  As the hunters display their kills  something surprising happens. They show us filter paper they've used to collect the animals' blood. The blood will be tested for zoonotic viruses  part of a program Dr. Wolfe has spent years setting up. NW  So this is from this animal right here  Greater Spot Nosed Guenon. Every person who has one of those filter papers has at least  at a minimum  been through our basic health education about the risks associated with these activities  which presumably  from our perspective  gives them the ability to decrease their own risk  and then obviously the risk to their families  the village  the country  and the world. NW  OK  before I continue  I think it's important to take just a moment to talk about bush meat. Bush meat is the hunting of wild game. OK  And you can consider all sorts of different bush meat. I'm going to be talking about this. When your children and grandchildren sort of pose questions to you about this period of time  one of the things they're gonna ask you  is how it was they we allowed some of our closest living relatives  some of the most valuable and endangered species on our planet  to go extinct because we weren't able to address some of the issues of poverty in these parts of the world. But in fact that's not the only question they're going to ask you about this. They're also going to ask you the question that when we knew that this was the way that HIV entered into the human population  and that other diseases had the potential to enter like this  why did we let these behaviors continue  Why did we not find some other solution to this  They're going to say  in regions of profound instability throughout the world  where you have intense poverty  where populations are growing and you don't have sustainable resources like this  this is going to lead to food insecurity. But they're also going to ask you probably a different question. It's one that I think we all need to ask ourselves  which is  why we thought the responsibility rested with this individual here. Now this is the individual    you can see just right up over his right shoulder    this is the individual that hunted the monkey from the last picture that I showed you. OK  take a look at his shirt. You know  take a look at his face. Bush meat is one of the central crises  which is occurring in our population right now  in humanity  on this planet. But it can't be the fault of somebody like this. OK  And solving it cannot be his responsibility alone. There's no easy solutions  but what I'm saying to you is that we neglect this problem at our own peril. So  in       along with my mentors Don Burke and Colonel Mpoudi Ngole  we went to actually start this work in Central Africa  to work with hunters in this part of the world. And my job    at that time I was a post doctoral fellow  and I was really tasked with setting this up. So I said to myself   OK  great    we're gonna collect all kinds of specimens. We're gonna go to all these different locations. It's going to be wonderful.  You know  I looked at the map  I picked out    sites  I figured  no problem. Needless to say  I was drastically wrong. This is challenging work to do. Fortunately  I had and continue to have an absolutely wonderful team of colleagues and collaborators in my own team  and that's the only way that this work can really occur. We have a whole range of challenges about this work. One of them is just obtaining trust from individuals that we work with in the field. The person you see on the right hand side is Paul DeLong Minutu. He's one of the best communicators that I've really ever dealt with. When I arrived I didn't speak a word of French  and I still seemed to understand what it was he was saying. Paul worked for years on the Cameroonian national radio and television  and he spoke about health issues. He was a health correspondent. So we figured we'd hire this person    when we got there he could be a great communicator. When we would get to these rural villages  though  what we found out is that no one had television  so they wouldn't recognize his face. But    when he began to speak they would actually recognize his voice from the radio. And this was somebody who had incredible potential to spread aspects of our message  whether it be with regards to wildlife conservation or health prevention. Often we run into obstacles. This is us coming back from one of these very rural sites  with specimens from     individuals that we needed to get back to the lab within    hours. I like to show this shot    this is Ubald Tamoufe  who's the lead investigator in our Cameroon site. Ubald laughs at me when I show this photo because of course you can't see his face. But the reason I like to show the shot is because you can see that he's about to solve this problem. Which    which he did  which he did. Just a few quick before and after shots. This was our laboratory before. This is what it looks like now. Early on  in order to ship our specimens  we had to have dry ice. To get dry ice we had to go to the breweries    beg  borrow  steal to get these folks to give it to us. Now we have our own liquid nitrogen. I like to call our laboratory the coldest place in Central Africa    it might be. And here's a shot of me  this is the before shot of me. No comment. So what happened  So during the    years that we've been doing this work  we actually surprised ourselves. We made a number of discoveries. And what we've found is that if you look in the right place  you can actually monitor the flow of these viruses into human populations. That gave us a tremendous amount of hope. What we've found is a whole range of new viruses in these individuals  including new viruses in the same group as HIV    so  brand new retroviruses. And let's face it  any new retrovirus in the human population    it's something we should be aware of. It's something we should be following. It's not something that we should be surprised by. Needless to say in the past these viruses entering into these rural communities might very well have gone extinct. That's no longer the case. Logging roads provide access to urban areas. And critically  what happens in central Africa doesn't stay in Central Africa. So  once we discovered that it was really possible that we could actually do this monitoring  we decided to move this from research  to really attempt to phase up to a global monitoring effort. Through generous support and partnership scientifically with Google.org and the Skoll Foundation  we were able to start the Global Viral Forecasting Initiative and begin work in four different sites in Africa and Asia. Needless to say  different populations from different parts of the world have different sorts of contact. So it's not just hunters in Central Africa. It's also working in live animal markets    these wet markets    which is exactly the place where SARS emerged in Asia. But really  this is just the beginning from our perspective. Our objective right now  in addition to deploying to these sites and getting everything moving  is to identify new partners because we feel like this effort needs to be extended to probably    or more sites throughout the world    to viral hotspots    because really the idea here is to cast an incredibly wide net so that we can catch these things  ideally  before they make it to blood banks  sexual networks  airplanes. And that's really our objective. There was a time not very long ago when the discovery of unknown organisms was something that held incredible awe for us. It had potential to really change the way that we saw ourselves  and thought about ourselves. Many people  I think  on our planet right now despair  and they think we've reached a point where we've discovered most of the things. I'm going tell you right now  please don't despair. If an intelligent extra terrestrial was taxed with writing the encyclopedia of life on our planet     out of    of these volumes would be devoted to bacteria and virus  with just a few of the volumes left for plants  fungus and animals  humans being a footnote  interesting footnote but a footnote nonetheless. This is honestly the most exciting period ever for the study of unknown life forms on our planet. The dominant things that exist here we know almost nothing about. And yet finally  we have the tools  which will allow us to actually explore that world and understand them. Thank you very much. I thought I would read poems I have that relate to the subject of youth and age. I was sort of astonished to find out how many I have actually. The first one is dedicated to Spencer  and his grandmother  who was shocked by his work. My poem is called  Dirt.  My grandmother is washing my mouth out with soap  half a long century gone and still she comes at me with that thick cruel yellow bar. All because of a word I said  not even said really  only repeated. But  Open   she says   open up   her hand clawing at my head. I know now her life was hard  she lost three children as babies  then her husband died too  leaving young sons  and no money. She'd stand me in the sink to pee because there was never room in the toilet. But oh  her soap  Might its bitter burning have been what made me a poet  The street she lived on was unpaved  her flat  two cramped rooms and a fetid kitchen where she stalked and caught me. Dare I admit that after she did it I never really loved her again  She lived to a hundred  even then. All along it was the sadness  the squalor  but I never  until now loved her again. When that was published in a magazine I got an irate letter from my uncle.  You have maligned a great woman.  It took some diplomacy. This is called  The Dress.  It's a longer poem. In those days  those days which exist for me only as the most elusive memory now  when often the first sound you'd hear in the morning would be a storm of birdsong  then the soft clop of the hooves of the horse hauling a milk wagon down your block  and the last sound at night as likely as not would be your father pulling up in his car  having worked late again  always late  and going heavily down to the cellar  to the furnace  to shake out the ashes and damp the draft before he came upstairs to fall into bed    in those long ago days  women  my mother  my friends' mothers  our neighbors  all the women I knew    wore  often much of the day  what were called housedresses  cheap  printed  pulpy  seemingly purposefully shapeless light cotton shifts that you wore over your nightgown and  when you had to go look for a child  hang wash on the line  or run down to the grocery store on the corner  under a coat  the twisted hem of the nightgown always lank and yellowed  dangling beneath. More than the curlers some of the women seemed constantly to have in their hair in preparation for some great event    a ball  one would think    that never came to pass  more than the way most women's faces not only were never made up during the day  but seemed scraped  bleached  and  with their plucked eyebrows  scarily masklike  more than all that it was those dresses that made women so unknowable and forbidding  adepts of enigmas to which men could have no access  and boys no conception. Only later would I see the dresses also as a proclamation  that in your dim kitchen  your laundry  your bleak concrete yard  what you revealed of yourself was a fabulation  your real sensual nature  veiled in those sexless vestments  was utterly your dominion. In those days  one hid much else as well  grown men didn't embrace one another  unless someone had died  and not always then  you shook hands or  at a ball game  thumped your friend's back and exchanged blows meant to be codes for affection  once out of childhood you'd never again know the shock of your father's whiskers on your cheek  not until mores at last had evolved  and you could hug another man  then hold on for a moment  then even kiss  your fathers bristles white and stiff now . What release finally  the embrace  though we were wary    it seemed so audacious    how much unspoken joy there was in that affirmation of equality and communion  no matter how much misunderstanding and pain had passed between you by then. We knew so little in those days  as little as now  I suppose about healing those hurts  even the women  in their best dresses  with beads and sequins sewn on the bodices  even in lipstick and mascara  their hair aflow  could only stand wringing their hands  begging for peace  while father and son  like thugs  like thieves  like Romans  simmered and hissed and hated  inflicting sorrows that endured  the worst anyway  through the kiss and embrace  bleeding from brother to brother  into the generations. In those days there was still countryside close to the city  farms  cornfields  cows  even not far from our building with its blurred brick and long shadowy hallway you could find tracts with hills and trees you could pretend were mountains and forests. Or you could go out by yourself even to a half block long empty lot  into the bushes  like a creature of leaves you'd lurk  crouched  crawling  simplified  savage  alone  already there was wanting to be simpler  wanting  when they called you  never to go back. This is another longish one  about the old and the young. It actually happened right at the time we met. Part of the poem takes place in space we shared and time we shared. It's called  The Neighbor.  Her five horrid  deformed little dogs who incessantly yap on the roof under my window. Her cats  God knows how many  who must piss on her rugs    her landing's a sickening reek. Her shadow once  fumbling the chain on her door  then the door slamming fearfully shut  only the barking and the music    jazz    filtering as it does  day and night into the hall. The time it was Chris Connor singing  Lush Life     how it brought back my college sweetheart  my first real love  who    till I left her    played the same record. And head on my shoulder  hand on my thigh  sang sweetly along  of regrets and depletions she was too young for  as I was too young  later  to believe in her pain. It startled  then bored  then repelled me. My starting to fancy she'd ended up in this fire trap in the Village  that my neighbor was her. My thinking we'd meet  recognize one another  become friends  that I'd accomplish a penance. My seeing her  it wasn't her  at the mailbox. Gray yellow hair  army pants under a nightgown  her turning away  hiding her ravaged face in her hands  muttering an inappropriate  Hi.  Sometimes there are frightening goings on in the stairwell. A man shouting   Shut up   The dogs frantically snarling  claws scrabbling  then her    her voice hoarse  harsh  hollow  almost only a tone  incoherent  a note  a squawk  bone on metal  metal gone molten  calling them back   Come back darlings  come back dear ones. My sweet angels  come back.  Medea she was  next time I saw her. Sorceress  tranced  ecstatic  stock still on the sidewalk ragged coat hanging agape  passersby flowing around her  her mouth torn suddenly open as though in a scream  silently though  as though only in her brain or breast had it erupted. A cry so pure  practiced  detached  it had no need of a voice  or could no longer bear one. These invisible links that allure  these transfigurations  even of anguish  that hold us. The girl  my old love  the last lost time I saw her when she came to find me at a party  her drunkenly stumbling  falling  sprawling  skirt hiked  eyes veined red  swollen with tears  her shame  her dishonor. My ignorant  arrogant coarseness  my secret pride  my turning away. Still life on a rooftop  dead trees in barrels  a bench broken  dogs  excrement  sky. What pathways through pain  what junctures of vulnerability  what crossings and counterings  Too many lives in our lives already  too many chances for sorrow  too many unaccounted for pasts.  Behold me   the god of frenzied  inexhaustible love says  rising in bloody splendor   Behold me.  Her making her way down the littered vestibule stairs  one agonized step at a time. My holding the door. Her crossing the fragmented tiles  faltering at the step to the street  droning  not looking at me   Can you help me   Taking my arm  leaning lightly against me. Her wavering step into the world. Her whispering   Thanks love.  Lightly  lightly against me. I think I'll lighten up a little. Another  different kind of poem of youth and age. It's called  Gas.  Wouldn't it be nice  I think  when the blue haired lady in the doctor's waiting room bends over the magazine table and farts  just a little  and violently blushes. Wouldn't it be nice if intestinal gas came embodied in visible clouds  so she could see that her really quite inoffensive pop had only barely grazed my face before it drifted away. Besides  for this to have happened now is a nice coincidence. Because not an hour ago  while we were on our walk  my dog was startled by a backfire and jumped straight up like a horse bucking. And that brought back to me the stable I worked on weekends when I was     and a splendid piebald stallion  who whenever he was mounted would buck just like that  though more hugely of course  enormous  gleaming  resplendent. And the woman  her face abashedly buried in her  Elle  now  reminded me    I'd forgotten that not the least part of my awe consisted of the fact that with every jump he took the horse would powerfully fart. Phwap  Phwap  Phwap  Something never mentioned in the dozens of books about horses and their riders I devoured in those days. All that savage grandeur  the steely glinting hooves  the eruptions driven from the creature's mighty innards  breath stopped  heart stopped  nostrils madly flared  I didn't know if I wanted to break him  or be him. This is called  Thirst.  Many    most of my poems actually are urban poems. I happen to be reading a bunch that aren't.  Thirst.  Here was my relation with the woman who lived all last autumn and winter  day and night  on a bench in the    rd Street subway station  until finally one day she vanished. We regarded each other  scrutinized one another. Me shyly  obliquely  trying not to be furtive. She boldly  unblinkingly  even pugnaciously  wrathfully even  when her bottle was empty. I was frightened of her. I felt like a child. I was afraid some repressed part of myself would go out of control  and I'd be forever entrapped in the shocking seethe of her stench. Not excrement merely  not merely surface and orifice going unwashed  rediffusion of rum  there was will in it  and intention  power and purpose    a social  ethical rage and rebellion    despair too  though  grief  loss. Sometimes I'd think I should take her home with me  bathe her  comfort her  dress her. She wouldn't have wanted me to  I would think. Instead  I'd step into my train. How rich I would think  is the lexicon of our self absolving. How enduring  our bland fatal assurance that reflection is righteousness being accomplished. The dance of our glances  the clash  pulling each other through our perceptual punctures  then holocaust  holocaust  host on host of ill  injured presences  squandered  consumed. Her vigil somewhere I know continues. Her occupancy  her absolute  faithful attendance. The dance of our glances  challenge  abdication  effacement  the perfume of our consternation. This is a newer poem  a brand new poem. The title is  This Happened.  A student  a young woman in a fourth floor hallway of her lycee  perched on the ledge of an open window chatting with friends between classes  a teacher passes and chides her   Be careful  you might fall   almost banteringly chides her   You might fall   and the young woman      a girl really  though she wouldn't think that  as brilliant as she is  first in her class  and  Beautiful  too   she's often told  smiles back  and leans into the open window  which wouldn't even be open if it were winter    if it were winter someone would have closed it   Close it       leans into the window  farther  still smiling  farther and farther  though it takes less time than this  really an instant  and lets herself fall. Herself fall. A casual impulse  a fancy  never thought of until now  hardly thought of even now ... No  more than impulse or fancy  the girl knows what she's doing  the girl means something  the girl means to mean  because it occurs to her in that instant  that beautiful or not  bright yes or no  she's not who she is  she's not the person she is  and the reason  she suddenly knows  is that there's been so much premeditation where she is  so much plotting and planning  there's hardly a person where she is  or if there is  it's not her  or not wholly her  it's a self inhabited  lived in by her  and seemingly even as she thinks it she knows what's been missing  grace  not premeditation but grace  a kind of being in the world spontaneously  with grace. Weightfully upon me was the world. Weightfully this self which graced the world yet never wholly itself. Weightfully this self which weighed upon me  the release from which is what I desire and what I achieve. And the girl remembers  in this infinite instant already now so many times divided  the sadness she felt once  hardly knowing she felt it  to merely inhabit herself. Yes  the girl falls  absurd to fall  even the earth with its compulsion to take unto itself all that falls must know that falling is absurd  yet the girl falling isn't myself  or she is myself  but a self I took of my own volition unto myself. Forever. With grace. This happened. I'll read just one more. I don't usually say that. I like to just end. But I'm afraid that Ricky will come out here and shake his fist at me. This is called  Old Man   appropriately enough.  Special  big tits   Says the advertisement for a soft core magazine on our neighborhood newsstand. But forget her breasts. A lush  fresh lipped blond  skin glowing gold  sprawls there  resplendent.    nearly  yet these hardly tangible  hardly better than harlots  can still stir me. Maybe a coming of age in the American sensual darkness  never seeing an unsmudged nipple  an uncensored vagina  has left me forever infected with an unquenchable lust of the eye. Always that erotic murmur  I'm hardly myself if I'm not in a state of incipient desire. God knows though  there are worse twists your obsessions can take. Last year in Israel  a young ultra orthodox Rabbi guiding some teenage girls through the Shrine of the Shoah forbade them to look in one room. Because there were images in it he said were licentious. The display was a photo. Men and women stripped naked  some trying to cover their genitals  others too frightened to bother  lined up in snow waiting to be shot and thrown into a ditch. The girls  to my horror  averted their gaze. What carnal mistrust had their teacher taught them. Even that though. Another confession  Once in a book on pre war Poland  a studio portrait  an absolute angel  an absolute angel with tormented  tormenting eyes. I kept finding myself at her page. That she died in the camps made her    I didn't dare wonder why    more present  more precious. Died in the camps  that too people    or Jews anyway    kept from their children back then. But it was like sex  you didn't have to be told. Sex and death  how close they can seem. So constantly conscious now of death moving towards me  sometimes I think I confound them. My wife's loveliness almost consumes me. My passion for her goes beyond reasonable bounds. When we make love  her holding me everywhere all around me  I'm there and not there. My mind teems  jumbles of faces  voices  impressions  I live my life over  as though I were drowning. Then I am drowning  in despair at having to leave her  this  everything  all  unbearable  awful. Still  to be able to die with no special contrition  not having been slaughtered  or enslaved. And not having to know history's next mad rage or regression  it might be a relief. No. Again  no. I don't mean that for a moment. What I mean is the world holds me so tightly    the good and the bad    my own follies and weakness that even this counterfeit Venus with her sham heat  and her bosom probably plumped with gel  so moves me my breath catches. Vamp. Siren. Seductress. How much more she reveals in her glare of ink than she knows. How she incarnates our desperate human need for regard  our passion to live in beauty  to be beauty  to be cherished by glances  if by no more  of something like love  or love. Thank you. Newspapers are dying for a few reasons. Readers don't want to pay for yesterday's news  and advertisers follow them. Your iPhone  your laptop  is much more handy than New York Times on Sunday. And we should save trees in the end. So it's enough to bury any industry. So  should we rather ask   Can anything save newspapers   There are several scenarios for the future newspaper. Some people say it should be free  it should be tabloid  or even smaller  A   it should be local  run by communities  or niche  for some smaller groups like business    but then it's not free  it's very expensive. It should be opinion driven  less news  more views. And we'd rather read it during breakfast  because later we listen to radio in a car  check your mail at work and in the evening you watch TV. Sounds nice  but this can only buy time. Because in the long run  I think there is no reason  no practical reason for newspapers to survive. So what can we do  Let me tell you my story.    years ago  Bonnier  Swedish publisher  started to set newspapers in the former Soviet Bloc. After a few years  they had several newspapers in central and eastern Europe. They were run by an inexperienced staff  with no visual culture  no budgets for visuals    in many places there were not even art directors. I decided to be    to work for them as an art director. Before  I was an architect  and my grandmother asked me once   What are you doing for a living   I said   I'm designing newspapers.   What  There's nothing to design there. It's just boring letters  And she was right. I was very frustrated  until one day. I came to London  and I've seen performance by Cirque du Soleil. And I had a revelation. I thought   These guys took some creepy  run down entertainment  and put it to the highest possible level of performance art.  I thought  Oh my God  maybe I can do the same with these boring newspapers.  And I did. We started to redesign them  one by one. The front page became our signature. It was my personal intimate channel to talk to the readers. I'm not going to tell you stories about teamwork or cooperation. My approach was very egotistic. I wanted my artistic statement  my interpretation of reality. I wanted to make posters  not newspapers. Not even magazines  posters. We were experimenting with type  with illustration  with photos. And we had fun. Soon it started to bring results. In Poland  our pages were named  Covers of the Year  three times in a row. Other examples you can see here are from Latvia  Lithuania  Estonia    the central European countries. But it's not only about the front page. The secret is that we were treating the whole newspaper as one piece  as one composition    like music. And music has a rhythm  has ups and downs. And design is responsible for this experience. Flipping through pages is readers experience  and I'm responsible for this experience. We treated two pages  both spreads  as a one page  because that's how readers perceive it. You can see some Russian pages here which got many awards on biggest infographic competition in Spain. But the real award came from Society for Newspaper Design. Just a year after redesigning this newspaper in Poland  they name it the World's Best Designed Newspaper. And two years later  the same award came to Estonia. Isn't amazing  What really makes it amazing  that the circulation of these newspapers were growing too. Just some examples  in Russia  plus    after one year  plus    after three years of the redesign. Same in Poland  plus     up to    percent raise of circulation after three years. You can see on a graph  after years of stagnation  the paper started to grow  just after redesign. But the real hit was in Bulgaria. And that is really amazing. Did design do this  Design was just a part of the process. And the process we made was not about changing the look  it was about improving the product completely. I took an architectural rule about function and form and translated it into newspaper content and design. And I put strategy at the top of it. So first you ask a big question  why we do it  What is the goal  Then we adjust the content accordingly. And then  usually after two months  we start designing. My bosses  in the beginning  were very surprised. Why am I asking all of these business questions  instead of just showing them pages  But soon they realized that this is the new role of designer  to be in this process from the very beginning to the very end. So what is the lesson behind it  The first lesson is about that design can change not just your product. It can change your workflow    actually  it can change everything in your company  it can turn your company upside down. It can even change you. And who's responsible  Designers. Give power to designers. But the second is even more important. You can live in a small poor country  like me. You can work for a small company  in a boring branch. You can have no budgets  no people    but still can put your work to the highest possible level. And everybody can do it. You just need inspiration  vision and determination. And you need to remember that to be good is not enough. Thank you. I started with paragliding. Paragliding is taking off from mountains with a paraglider  with the possibility to fly cross country  distance  just with the use of thermals to soar. Also different aerobatic maneuvers are possible with a paraglider. From there I started with skydiving. In this picture you can see there is a four way skydive  four people flying together  and on the left hand side it's the camera flier with the camera mounted to his helmet so he can film the whole jump  for the film itself and also for the judging. From regular  relative skydiving I went on to freeflying. Freeflying is more the three dimensional skydiving. You can see the skydiver with the red suit  he's in a stand up position. The one with the yellow green suit  he's flying head down. And that's me in the background  carving around the whole formation in freefall also  with the helmet cam to film this jump. From freeflying I went on to skysurfing. Skysurfing is skydiving with a board on the feet. You can imagine with this big surface of a skysurfing board  there is a lot of force  a lot of power. Of course I can use this power for example for nice spinning    we call it  helicopter moves.  From there I went on to wingsuit flying. Wingsuit flying is a suit  that I can make fly  just only with my body. If I put some tension on my body  tension on my suit  I can make it fly. And as you see the fall rate is much much slower because of the bigger surface. With a proper body position I'm able to really move forward to gain quite some distance. This is a jump I did in Rio de Janeiro. You can see the Copacabana on the left hand side. From there with all the skills and knowledge from paragliding and all the different disciplines in skydiving  I went on to BASE jumping. BASE jumping is skydiving from fixed objects  like buildings  antennae  bridges and earth    meaning mountains  cliffs. It's for sure    for me    it's the ultimate feeling of being in free fall  with all the visual references. So my goal soon was to discover new places that nobody had jumped before. So in summer      I was the first to BASE jump the Eiger North Face in Switzerland. Two years after this  I was the first to BASE jump from Matterhorn  a very famous mountain that probably everybody knows in here.      I did a BASE jump from the Eiger  from the Monk and from the Jungfrau  three very famous mountains in Switzerland. The special thing on these three jumps were  I hiked them all and climbed them all in only one day. In      I jumped the Eiffel Tower in Paris. So with all this knowledge  I also wanted to get into stunts. So with some friends we started to do different tricks  like for example this jump here  I jumped from a paraglider. Or here    everybody was freezing  pretty much  except me  because it was very cold in Austria where we did this filming. Everybody sitting in a basket  and I was on top of the balloon  ready to slide down with my skysurf board. Or this jump  from a moving truck on the highway. Extreme sports on top level like this is only possible if you practice step by step  if you really work hard on your skills and on your knowledge. Of course you need to be in physical  very good  condition  so I'm training a lot. You need to have the best possible equipment. And probably the most important is you have to work on your mental skills  mental preparation. And all this to come as close as possible to the human dream of being able to fly. So for       I'm training hard for my two new projects. The first one  I want to set a world record in flying from a cliff with my wingsuit. And I want to set a new record  with the longest distance ever flown. For my second project  I have a sensational idea of a jump that never has been done before. So now  on the following movie you will see that I'm much better in flying a wingsuit than speaking in English. Enjoy  and thank you very much. June Cohen  I have some questions. I think we all might have some questions. Question one  so does that actually feel the way the flying dream does  Because it looks like it might. Ueli Gegenschatz  Pretty much. I believe this is probably the closest possibility to come to the dream of being able to fly. JC  I know the answer to this  but how do you land  UE  Parachute. We have to open a parachute just seconds before  I would say  impact. It's not possible to land a wingsuit yet. JC  Yet. But people are trying. Are you among those    you're not going to commit    are you among those trying to do it  UE  It's a dream. It's a dream. Yeah. We're still working on it and we're developing the wingsuits to get better performance  to get more knowledge. And I believe soon. JC  All right. Well we will watch this space. But I have two more questions. What is the    there was exhaust coming out of the back of the wingsuit. Was that a propelled wingsuit that you were wearing  UE  Nope. It's just smoke. JC  Coming off of you  UE  Hopefully not. JC  That seems dangerous. UE  No  smoke is for two reasons  you can see the speed  you can see the way where I was flying. That's reason number one. And reason number two  it's much easier for the camera guy to film If I'm using smoke. JC  Ah  I see. So the wingsuit is set up to deliberately release smoke so that you can be tracked. One more question. What do you do to to cover your face  Because I just keep thinking of going that fast and having your whole face smushed backwards. Are you in a helmet  Are you in goggles  UE  The purest and the best feeling would be with only goggles. JC  And is that how you usually fly  UE  Usually I'm wearing a helmet. In the mountains I'm always wearing a helmet because of landings    usually it's difficult    it's not like regular skydiving where you have like the big landings. So you have to be prepared. JC  Right. Now is there anything you don't do  Do people come to you with projects and say   We want you to do this   and do you ever say   No  no I'm not going to.  UE  Oh of course  of course. Some people have crazy ideas and    JC  ...a round of applause... UE  Thank you very much. I was asked by Wilsonart International  a plastic laminate company  which is the largest plastic laminate company in the world    they asked me to design a trade show booth for exhibition at the International Contemporary Furniture Fair in New York  in     . So looking at their three main markets for their product which were basically transportation design  interiors and furniture  we came up with the solution of taking an old Airstream trailer and gutting it  and trying to portray laminate  and a trailer  in kind of a fresh  new contemporary look. When this trailer showed up at my shop in Berkeley  I'd actually never stepped foot in an Airstream trailer  or any other trailer. So I can be somebody that can look at this in a totally fresh perspective and see if I can optimize it in its most idealistic fashion. I decided I had to do some research and really figure out what had gone wrong somewhere along the history of Airstream. What I discovered in these interiors is that there was a disconnect between the exterior shell and the interior architecture of the pieces. In that the shell was originally conceived as a lightweight  modern  futuristic  high tech pod for hurtling down the freeway  and the interiors were completely out of sync with that. In fact it appeared like they referenced a mountain cabin. That seemed really like a crisis to me  that they had never been able to develop a vocabulary about escape  and about travel  and modernity in this trailer that was consistent with the shell. We really needed to do some archeology in the trailer itself to figure out what's authentic in an Airstream trailer  and what feels like it has true purpose and utility. We stripped out all the vinyl and zolatone paint that was covering up this just fantastic aluminum shell. We took off all the visible hardware and trim that was kind of doing the country cabin thing. I literally drew on the walls of the trailer  mocked it up in cardboard  we'd come in and cut  decide things were wrong  pull it out  put it back in. The main goal was to smooth out the interior  and begin to speak about motion  and mobility  and independence. The biggest difficulty on one of these trailers is that when you're designing there's actually no logical place to stop and start materials because of the continuous form of the trailer. There's no such things as two walls and a ceiling coming together  where you can change materials and shapes. So that became a challenge. Compounding that  the material of choice  laminate  that I was trying to highlight  only bends in two dimensions. It's a compound curve interior. What I had to devise was a way of fooling the eye into believing that all these panels are curved with the shell. What I came up with was a series of second skins that basically float over the aluminum shell. And what I was trying to do there was direct your eye in the space  so that you would perceive the geometry in a different way  and that the casework wouldn't break up the space. They also gave us a way to run power and rewire the trailer without tearing out the skin  so they function as an electrical chase. That's the trailer  pretty much finished. That trailer led to another commission  to participate in whats called Tokyo Designers Block. Its a week of furniture design events in Tokyo  in October. Teruo Kurosaki  who owns a furniture company called Idee  he asked me to ship him two trailers to Tokyo. He said one he would like to make a real trailer  functioning  and we would sell that one. Trailer number two  you have a blank slate  you can to anything you want. We came up with a fantasy scenario of a DJ traveling around the States  that would collect records and go on tours. This trailer housed two turntables  mixer  wet bar  fridge  integrated sound system. It's got a huge couch  fits quite a few people  and basically we'd had a great time with this. And so in this trailer I took it upon myself to think about travel  and escape  in an idiosyncratic sense. A lot of these ideas migrated into the production trailers for Airstream. This brings us up to the time that I started consulting to Airstream. They came to me and said   Well  what can we do to freshen this thing up  And do you think kids  you know  skateboarders  surfers  rock climbers  would use these things   And I said   Well  not in that interior.  Anyway  I went out to Airstream about six times during the process of building this prototype  and it's called the Bambi prototype. I thought   Finally  oh yeah great  big company  I'm gonna work with somebody with money for tooling and molding.  And I walked in their prototype facility  and it's exactly like my shop  only bigger    same tools  same things. So the problem became    and they set this dilemma to me    that you have to design the interior using only our existing technology  and there's no money for tooling or molding. The trailers themselves are actually hand built. All the casework is hand scribed in  uniquely  so you can't just cut     parts for     trailers  you have to cut them big  and every single one is hand fit. They didn't want to go to a componentized system. And there it is  that's the Bambi   . I thought I'd begin with a scene of war. There was little to warn of the danger ahead. The Iraqi insurgent had placed the IED  an Improvised Explosive Device  along the side of the road with great care. By       there were more than       of these attacks every single month  and they were the leading cause of casualties among American soldiers and Iraqi civilians. The team that was hunting for this IED is called an EOD team  Explosives Ordinance Disposal and they're the pointy end of the spear in the American effort to suppress these roadside bombs. Each EOD team goes out on about     of these bomb calls every year  defusing about two bombs a day. Perhaps the best sign of how valuable they are to the war effort  is that the Iraqi insurgents put a         bounty on the head of a single EOD soldier. Unfortunately  this particular call would not end well. By the time the soldier advanced close enough to see the telltale wires of the bomb  it exploded in a wave of flame. Now  depending how close you are and how much explosive has been packed into that bomb  it can cause death or injury. You have to be as far as    yards away to escape that. The blast is so strong it can even break your limbs  even if you're not hit. That soldier had been on top of the bomb. And so when the rest of the team advanced they found little left. And that night the unit's commander did a sad duty  and he wrote a condolence letter back to the United States  and he talked about how hard the loss had been on his unit  about the fact that they had lost their bravest soldier  a soldier who had saved their lives many a time. And he apologized for not being able to bring them home. But then he talked up the silver lining that he took away from the loss.  At least   as he wrote   when a robot dies  you don't have to write a letter to its mother.  That scene sounds like science fiction  but is battlefield reality already. The soldier in that case was a    pound robot called a PackBot. The chief's letter went  not to some farmhouse in Iowa like you see in the old war movies  but went to the iRobot Company  which is named after the Asimov novel and the not so great Will Smith movie  and... um...  Laughter ... if you remember that in that fictional world  robots started out carrying out mundane chores  and then they started taking on life and death decisions. That's a reality we face today. What we're going to do is actually just flash a series of photos behind me that show you the reality of robots used in war right now or already at the prototype stage. It's just to give you a taste. Another way of putting it is you're not going to see anything that's powered by Vulcan technology  or teenage wizard hormones or anything like that. This is all real. So why don't we go ahead and start those pictures. Something big is going on in war today  and maybe even the history of humanity itself. The U.S. military went into Iraq with a handful of drones in the air. We now have      . We went in with zero unmanned ground systems. We now have       . And the tech term  killer application  takes on new meaning in this space. And we need to remember that we're talking about the Model T Fords  the Wright Flyers  compared to what's coming soon. That's where we're at right now. One of the people that I recently met with was an Air Force three star general  and he said basically  where we're headed very soon is tens of thousands of robots operating in our conflicts  and these numbers matter  because we're not just talking about tens of thousands of today's robots  but tens of thousands of these prototypes and tomorrow's robots  because of course  one of the things that's operating in technology is Moore's Law  that you can pack in more and more computing power into those robots  and so flash forward around    years  if Moore's Law holds true  those robots will be close to a billion times more powerful in their computing than today. And so what that means is the kind of things that we used to only talk about at science fiction conventions like Comic Con have to be talked about in the halls of power and places like the Pentagon. A robots revolution is upon us. Now  I need to be clear here. I'm not talking about a revolution where you have to worry about the Governor of California showing up at your door  a la the Terminator.  Laughter  When historians look at this period  they're going to conclude that we're in a different type of revolution  a revolution in war  like the invention of the atomic bomb. But it may be even bigger than that  because our unmanned systems don't just affect the  how  of war fighting  they affect the  who  of fighting at its most fundamental level. That is  every previous revolution in war  be it the machine gun  be it the atomic bomb  was about a system that either shot faster  went further  had a bigger boom. That's certainly the case with robotics  but they also change the experience of the warrior and even the very identity of the warrior. Another way of putting this is that mankind's       year old monopoly on the fighting of war is breaking down in our very lifetime. I've spent the last several years going around meeting with all the players in this field  from the robot scientists to the science fiction authors who inspired them to the    year old drone pilots who are fighting from Nevada  to the four star generals who command them  to even the Iraqi insurgents who they are targeting and what they think about our systems  and what I found interesting is not just their stories  but how their experiences point to these ripple effects that are going outwards in our society  in our law and our ethics  etc. And so what I'd like to do with my remaining time is basically flesh out a couple of these. So the first is that the future of war  even a robotics one  is not going to be purely an American one. The U.S. is currently ahead in military robotics right now  but we know that in technology there's no such thing as a permanent first move or advantage. In a quick show of hands  how many people in this room still use Wang Computers   Laughter  It's the same thing in war. The British and the French invented the tank. The Germans figured out how to use it right  and so what we have to think about for the U.S. is that we are ahead right now  but you have    other countries out there working on military robotics  and they include all the interesting countries like Russia  China  Pakistan  Iran. And this raises a bigger worry for me. How do we move forward in this revolution given the state of our manufacturing and the state of our science and mathematics training in our schools  Or another way of thinking about this is  what does it mean to go to war increasingly with soldiers whose hardware is made in China and software is written in India  But just as software has gone open source  so has warfare. Unlike an aircraft carrier or an atomic bomb  you don't need a massive manufacturing system to build robotics. A lot of it is off the shelf. A lot of it's even do it yourself. One of those things you just saw flashed before you was a raven drone  the handheld tossed one. For about a thousand dollars  you can build one yourself  equivalent to what the soldiers use in Iraq. That raises another wrinkle when it comes to war and conflict. Good guys might play around and work on these as hobby kits  but so might bad guys. This cross between robotics and things like terrorism is going to be fascinating and even disturbing  and we've already seen it start. During the war between Israel  a state  and Hezbollah  a non state actor  the non state actor flew four different drones against Israel. There's already a jihadi website that you can go on and remotely detonate an IED in Iraq while sitting at your home computer. And so I think what we're going to see is two trends take place with this. First is  you're going to reinforce the power of individuals against governments  but then the second is that we are going to see an expansion in the realm of terrorism. The future of it may be a cross between al Qaeda  .  and the next generation of the Unabomber. And another way of thinking about this is the fact that  remember  you don't have to convince a robot that they're gonna receive    virgins after they die to convince them to blow themselves up. But the ripple effects of this are going to go out into our politics. One of the people that I met with was a former Assistant Secretary of Defense for Ronald Reagan  and he put it this way   I like these systems because they save American lives  but I worry about more marketization of wars  more shock and awe talk  to defray discussion of the costs. People are more likely to support the use of force if they view it as costless.  Robots for me take certain trends that are already in play in our body politic  and maybe take them to their logical ending point. We don't have a draft. We don't have declarations of war anymore. We don't buy war bonds anymore. And now we have the fact that we're converting more and more of our American soldiers that we would send into harm's way into machines  and so we may take those already lowering bars to war and drop them to the ground. But the future of war is also going to be a YouTube war. That is  our new technologies don't merely remove humans from risk. They also record everything that they see. So they don't just delink the public  they reshape its relationship with war. There's already several thousand video clips of combat footage from Iraq on YouTube right now  most of it gathered by drones. Now  this could be a good thing. It could be building connections between the home front and the war front as never before. But remember  this is taking place in our strange  weird world  and so inevitably the ability to download these video clips to  you know  your iPod or your Zune gives you the ability to turn it into entertainment. Soldiers have a name for these clips. They call it war porn. The typical one that I was sent was an email that had an attachment of video of a Predator strike taking out an enemy site. Missile hits  bodies burst into the air with the explosion. It was set to music. It was set to the pop song  I Just Want To Fly  by Sugar Ray. This ability to watch more but experience less creates a wrinkle in the public's relationship with war. I think about this with a sports parallel. It's like the difference between watching an NBA game  a professional basketball game on TV  where the athletes are tiny figures on the screen  and being at that basketball game in person and realizing what someone seven feet really does look like. But we have to remember  these are just the clips. These are just the ESPN SportsCenter version of the game. They lose the context. They lose the strategy. They lose the humanity. War just becomes slam dunks and smart bombs. Now the irony of all this is that while the future of war may involve more and more machines  it's our human psychology that's driving all of this  it's our human failings that are leading to these wars. So one example of this that has big resonance in the policy realm is how this plays out on our very real war of ideas that we're fighting against radical groups. What is the message that we think we are sending with these machines versus what is being received in terms of the message. So one of the people that I met was a senior Bush Administration official  who had this to say about our unmanning of war   It plays to our strength. The thing that scares people is our technology.  But when you go out and meet with people  for example in Lebanon  it's a very different story. One of the people I met with there was a news editor  and we're talking as a drone is flying above him  and this is what he had to say.  This is just another sign of the coldhearted cruel Israelis and Americans  who are cowards because they send out machines to fight us. They don't want to fight us like real men  but they're afraid to fight  so we just have to kill a few of their soldiers to defeat them.  The future of war also is featuring a new type of warrior  and it's actually redefining the experience of going to war. You can call this a cubicle warrior. This is what one Predator drone pilot described of his experience fighting in the Iraq War while never leaving Nevada.  You're going to war for    hours  shooting weapons at targets  directing kills on enemy combatants  and then you get in the car and you drive home and within    minutes  you're sitting at the dinner table talking to your kids about their homework.  Now  the psychological balancing of those experiences is incredibly tough  and in fact those drone pilots have higher rates of PTSD than many of the units physically in Iraq. But some have worries that this disconnection will lead to something else  that it might make the contemplation of war crimes a lot easier when you have this distance.  It's like a video game   is what one young pilot described to me of taking out enemy troops from afar. As anyone who's played Grand Theft Auto knows  we do things in the video world that we wouldn't do face to face. So much of what you're hearing from me is that there's another side to technologic revolutions  and that it's shaping our present and maybe will shape our future of war. Moore's Law is operative  but so's Murphy's Law. The fog of war isn't being lifted. The enemy has a vote. We're gaining incredible new capabilities  but we're also seeing and experiencing new human dilemmas. Now  sometimes these are just  oops  moments  which is what the head of a robotics company described it  you just have  oops  moments. Well  what are  oops  moments with robots in war  Well  sometimes they're funny. Sometimes  they're like that scene from the Eddie Murphy movie  Best Defense   playing out in reality  where they tested out a machine gun armed robot  and during the demonstration it started spinning in a circle and pointed its machine gun at the reviewing stand of VIPs. Fortunately the weapon wasn't loaded and no one was hurt  but other times  oops  moments are tragic  such as last year in South Africa  where an anti aircraft cannon had a  software glitch   and actually did turn on and fired  and nine soldiers were killed. We have new wrinkles in the laws of war and accountability. What do we do with things like unmanned slaughter  What is unmanned slaughter  We've already had three instances of Predator drone strikes where we thought we got bin Laden  and it turned out not to be the case. And this is where we're at right now. This is not even talking about armed  autonomous systems with full authority to use force. And do not believe that that isn't coming. During my research I came across four different Pentagon projects on different aspects of that. And so you have this question  what does this lead to issues like war crimes  Robots are emotionless  so they don't get upset if their buddy is killed. They don't commit crimes of rage and revenge. But robots are emotionless. They see an    year old grandmother in a wheelchair the same way they see a T    tank  they're both just a series of zeroes and ones. And so we have this question to figure out  How do we catch up our   th century laws of war  that are so old right now that they could qualify for Medicare  to these   st century technologies  And so  in conclusion  I've talked about what seems the future of war  but notice that I've only used real world examples and you've only seen real world pictures and videos. And so this sets a great challenge for all of us that we have to worry about well before you have to worry about your Roomba sucking the life away from you. Are we going to let the fact that what's unveiling itself right now in war sounds like science fiction and therefore keeps us in denial  Are we going to face the reality of   st century war  Is our generation going to make the same mistake that a past generation did with atomic weaponry  and not deal with the issues that surround it until Pandora's box is already opened up  Now  I could be wrong on this  and one Pentagon robot scientist told me that I was. He said   There's no real social  ethical  moral issues when it comes to robots. That is   he added   unless the machine kills the wrong people repeatedly. Then it's just a product recall issue.  And so the ending point for this is that actually  we can turn to Hollywood. A few years ago  Hollywood gathered all the top characters and created a list of the top     heroes and top     villains of all of Hollywood history  the characters that represented the best and worst of humanity. Only one character made it onto both lists  The Terminator  a robot killing machine. And so that points to the fact that our machines can be used for both good and evil  but for me it points to the fact that there's a duality of humans as well. This week is a celebration of our creativity. Our creativity has taken our species to the stars. Our creativity has created works of arts and literature to express our love. And now  we're using our creativity in a certain direction  to build fantastic machines with incredible capabilities  maybe even one day an entirely new species. But one of the main reasons that we're doing that is because of our drive to destroy each other  and so the question we all should ask  is it our machines  or is it us that's wired for war  Thank you.  Applause  One thing I wanted to say about film making is    about this film    in thinking about some of the wonderful talks we've heard here  Michael Moschen  and some of the talks about music  this idea that there is a narrative line  and that music exists in time. A film also exists in time  it's an experience that you should go through emotionally. And in making this film I felt that so many of the documentaries I've seen were all about learning something  or knowledge  or driven by talking heads  and driven by ideas. And I wanted this film to be driven by emotions  and really to follow my journey. So instead of doing the talking head thing  instead it's composed of scenes  and we meet people along the way. We only meet them once. They don't come back several times  so it really chronicles a journey. It's something like life  that once you get in it you can't get out. There are two clips I want to show you  the first one is a kind of hodgepodge  its just three little moments  four little moments with three of the people who are here tonight. It's not the way they occur in the film  because they are part of much larger scenes. They play off each other in a wonderful way. And that ends with a little clip of my father  of Lou  talking about something that is very dear to him  which is the accidents of life. I think he felt that the greatest things in life were accidental  and perhaps not planned at all. And those three clips will be followed by a scene of perhaps what  to me  is really his greatest building which is a building in Dhaka  Bangladesh. He built the capital over there. And I think you'll enjoy this building  it's never been seen    it's been still photographed  but never photographed by a film crew. We were the first film crew in there. So you'll see images of this remarkable building. A couple of things to keep in mind when you see it  it was built entirely by hand  I think they got a crane the last year. It was built entirely by hand off bamboo scaffolding  people carrying these baskets of concrete on their heads  dumping them in the forms. It is the capital of the country  and it took    years to build  which is something they seem to be very proud of over there. It took as long as the Taj Mahal. Unfortunately it took so long that Lou never saw it finished. He died in     . The building was finished in     . So it continued on for many years after he died. Think about that when you see that building  that sometimes the things we strive for so hard in life we never get to see finished. And that really struck me about my father  in the sense that he had such belief that somehow  doing these things giving in the way that he gave  that something good would come out of it  even in the middle of a war  there was a war with Pakistan at one point  and the construction stopped totally and he kept working  because he felt   Well when the war is done they'll need this building.  So  those are the two clips I'm going to show. Roll that tape. Richard Saul Wurman  I remember hearing him talk at Penn. And I came home and I said to my father and mother   I just met this man  doesn't have much work  and he's sort of ugly  funny voice  and he's a teacher at school. I know you've never heard of him  but just mark this day that someday you will hear of him  because he's really an amazing man.  Frank Gehry  I heard he had some kind of a fling with Ingrid Bergman. Is that true  Nathaniel Kahn  If he did he was a very lucky man. NK  Did you hear that  really  FG  Yeah  when he was in Rome. Moshe Safdie  He was a real nomad. And you know  when I knew him when I was in the office  he would come in from a trip  and he would be in the office for two or three days intensely  and he would pack up and go. You know he'd be in the office till three in the morning working with us and there was this kind of sense of the nomad in him. I mean as tragic as his death was in a railway station  it was so consistent with his life  you know  I mean I often think I'm going to die in a plane  or I'm going to die in an airport  or die jogging without an identification on me. I don't know why I sort of carry that from that memory of the way he died. But he was a sort of a nomad at heart. Louis Kahn  How accidental our existences are really and how full of influence by circumstance. Man  We are the morning workers who come  all the time  here and enjoy the walking  city's beauty and the atmosphere and this is the nicest place of Bangladesh. We are proud of it. NK  You're proud of it  Man  Yes  it is the national image of Bangladesh. NK  Do you know anything about the architect  Man  Architect  I've heard about him  he's a top ranking architect. NK  Well actually I'm here because I'm the architect's son  he was my father. Man  Oh  Dad is Louis Farrakhan  NK  Yeah. No not Louis Farrakhan  Louis Kahn. Man  Louis Kahn  yes  Man  Your father  is he alive  NK  No  he's been dead for    years. Man  Very pleased to welcome you back. NK  Thank you. NK  He never saw it finished  Pop. No  he never saw this. Shamsul Wares  It was almost impossible  building for a country like ours. In        years back  it was nothing  only paddy fields  and since we invited him here  he felt that he has got a responsibility. He wanted to be a Moses here  he gave us democracy. He is not a political man  but in this guise he has given us the institution for democracy  from where we can rise. In that way it is so relevant. He didn't care for how much money this country has  or whether he would be able to ever finish this building  but somehow he has been able to do it  build it  here. And this is the largest project he has got in here  the poorest country in the world. NK  It cost him his life. SW  Yeah  he paid. He paid his life for this  and that is why he is great and we'll remember him. But he was also human. Now his failure to satisfy the family life  is an inevitable association of great people. But I think his son will understand this  and will have no sense of grudge  or sense of being neglected  I think. He cared in a very different manner  but it takes a lot of time to understand that. In social aspect of his life he was just like a child  he was not at all matured. He could not say no to anything  and that is why  that he cannot say no to things  we got this building today. You see  only that way you can be able to understand him. There is no other shortcut  no other way to really understand him. But I think he has given us this building and we feel all the time for him  that's why  he has given love for us. He could not probably give the right kind of love for you  but for us  he has given the people the right kind of love  that is important. You have to understand that. He had an enormous amount of love  he loved everybody. To love everybody  he sometimes did not see the very closest ones  and that is inevitable for men of his stature. What I'm going to try to do is explain to you quickly how to predict  and illustrate it with some predictions about what Iran is going to do in the next couple of years. In order to predict effectively  we need to use science. And the reason that we need to use science is because then we can reproduce what we're doing  it's not just wisdom or guesswork. And if we can predict  then we can engineer the future. So if you are concerned to influence energy policy  or you are concerned to influence national security policy  or health policy  or education  science    and a particular branch of science    is a way to do it  not the way we've been doing it  which is seat of the pants wisdom. Now before I get into how to do it let me give you a little truth in advertising  because I'm not engaged in the business of magic. There are lots of thing that the approach I take can predict  and there are some that it can't. It can predict complex negotiations or situations involving coercion    that is in essence everything that has to do with politics  much of what has to do with business  but sorry  if you're looking to speculate in the stock market  I don't predict stock markets    OK  it's not going up any time really soon. But I'm not engaged in doing that. I'm not engaged in predicting random number generators. I actually get phone calls from people who want to know what lottery numbers are going to win. I don't have a clue. I engage in the use of game theory  game theory is a branch of mathematics and that means  sorry  that even in the study of politics  math has come into the picture. We can no longer pretend that we just speculate about politics  we need to look at this in a rigorous way. Now  what is game theory about  It assumes that people are looking out for what's good for them. That doesn't seem terribly shocking    although it's controversial for a lot of people    that we are self interested. In order to look out for what's best for them or what they think is best for them  people have values    they identify what they want  and what they don't want. And they have beliefs about what other people want  and what other people don't want  how much power other people have  how much those people could get in the way of whatever it is that you want. And they face limitations  constraints  they may be weak  they may be located in the wrong part of the world  they may be Einstein  stuck away farming someplace in a rural village in India not being noticed  as was the case for Ramanujan for a long time  a great mathematician but nobody noticed. Now who is rational  A lot of people are worried about what is rationality about  You know  what if people are rational  Mother Theresa  she was rational. Terrorists  they're rational. Pretty much everybody is rational. I think there are only two exceptions that I'm aware of    two year olds  they are not rational  they have very fickle preferences  they switch what they think all the time  and schizophrenics are probably not rational  but pretty much everybody else is rational. That is  they are just trying to do what they think is in their own best interest. Now in order to work out what people are going to do to pursue their interests  we have to think about who has influence in the world. If you're trying to influence corporations to change their behavior  with regard to producing pollutants  one approach  the common approach  is to exhort them to be better  to explain to them what damage they're doing to the planet. And many of you may have noticed that doesn't have as big an effect  as perhaps you would like it to have. But if you show them that it's in their interest  then they're responsive. So  we have to work out who influences problems. If we're looking at Iran  the president of the United States we would like to think  may have some influence    certainly the president in Iran has some influence    but we make a mistake if we just pay attention to the person at the top of the power ladder because that person doesn't know much about Iran  or about energy policy  or about health care  or about any particular policy. That person surrounds himself or herself with advisers. If we're talking about national security problems  maybe it's the Secretary of State  maybe it's the Secretary of Defense  the Director of National Intelligence  maybe the ambassador to the United Nations  or somebody else who they think is going to know more about the particular problem. But let's face it  the Secretary of State doesn't know much about Iran. The secretary of defense doesn't know much about Iran. Each of those people in turn has advisers who advise them  so they can advise the president. There are lots of people shaping decisions and so if we want to predict correctly we have to pay attention to everybody who is trying to shape the outcome  not just the people at the pinnacle of the decision making pyramid. Unfortunately  a lot of times we don't do that. There's a good reason that we don't do that  and there's a good reason that using game theory and computers  we can overcome the limitation of just looking at a few people. Imagine a problem with just five decision makers. Imagine for example that Sally over here  wants to know what Harry  and Jane  and George and Frank are thinking  and sends messages to those people. Sally's giving her opinion to them  and they're giving their opinion to Sally. But Sally also wants to know what Harry is saying to these three  and what they're saying to Harry. And Harry wants to know what each of those people are saying to each other  and so on  and Sally would like to know what Harry thinks those people are saying. That's a complicated problem  that's a lot to know. With five decision makers there are a lot of linkages         as a matter of fact  if you remember your factorials. Five factorial is    . Now you may be surprised to know that smart people can keep     things straight in their head. Suppose we double the number of influencers from five to   . Does that mean we've doubled the number of pieces of information we need to know  from     to      No. How about    times  To        No. We've increased it to  .  million. Nobody can keep that straight in their head. But computers  they can. They don't need coffee breaks  they don't need vacations  they don't need to go to sleep at night  they don't ask for raises either. They can keep this information straight and that means that we can process the information. So I'm going to talk to you about how to process it  and I'm going to give you some examples out of Iran  and you're going to be wondering   Why should we listen to this guy  Why should we believe what he's saying   So I'm going to show you a factoid. This is an assessment by the Central Intelligence Agency of the percentage of time that the model I'm talking about is right in predicting things whose outcome is not yet known  when the experts who provided the data inputs got it wrong. That's not my claim  that's a CIA claim    you can read it  it was declassified a while ago. You can read it in a volume edited by H. Bradford Westerfield  Yale University Press. So  what do we need to know in order to predict  You may be surprised to find out we don't need to know very much. We do need to know who has a stake in trying to shape the outcome of a decision. We need to know what they say they want  not what they want in their heart of hearts  not what they think they can get  but what they say they want  because that is a strategically chosen position  and we can work backwards from that to draw inferences about important features of their decision making. We need to know how focused they are on the problem at hand. That is  how willing are they to drop what they're doing when the issue comes up  and attend to it instead of something else that's on their plate    how big a deal is it to them  And how much clout could they bring to bear if they chose to engage on the issue  If we know those things we can predict their behavior by assuming that everybody cares about two things on any decision. They care about the outcome. They'd like an outcome as close to what they are interested in as possible. They're careerists  they also care about getting credit    there's ego involvement  they want to be seen as important in shaping the outcome  or as important  if it's their druthers  to block an outcome. And so we have to figure out how they balance those two things. Different people trade off between standing by their outcome  faithfully holding to it  going down in a blaze of glory  or giving it up  putting their finger in the wind  and doing whatever they think is going to be a winning position. Most people fall in between  and if we can work out where they fall we can work out how to negotiate with them to change their behavior. So with just that little bit of input we can work out what the choices are that people have  what the chances are that they're willing to take  what they're after  what they value  what they want  and what they believe about other people. You might notice what we don't need to know  there's no history in here. How they got to where they are may be important in shaping the input information  but once we know where they are we're worried about where they're going to be headed in the future. How they got there turns out not to be terribly critical in predicting. I remind you of that    percent accuracy rate. So where are we going to get this information  We can get this information from the Internet  from The Economist  The Financial Times  The New York Times  U.S. News and World Report  lots of sources like that  or we can get it from asking experts who spend their lives studying places and problems  because those experts know this information. If they don't know  who are the people trying to influence the decision  how much clout do they have  how much they care about this issue  and what do they say they want  are they experts  That's what it means to be an expert  that's the basic stuff an expert needs to know. Alright  lets turn to Iran. Let me make three important predictions    you can check this out  time will tell. What is Iran going to do about its nuclear weapons program  How secure is the theocratic regime in Iran  What's its future  And everybody's best friend  Ahmadinejad. How are things going for him  How are things going to be working out for him in the next year or two  You take a look at this  this is not based on statistics. I want to be very clear here. I'm not projecting some past data into the future. I've taken inputs on positions and so forth  run it through a computer model that had simulated the dynamics of interaction  and these are the simulated dynamics  the predictions about the path of policy. So you can see here on the vertical axis  I haven't shown it all the way down to zero  there are lots of other options  but here I'm just showing you the prediction  so I've narrowed the scale. Up at the top of the axis   Build the Bomb.  At      we start somewhere above      between building a bomb  and making enough weapons grade fuel so that you could build a bomb. That's where  according to my analyses  the Iranians were at the beginning of this year. And then the model makes predictions down the road. At     they would only produce enough weapons grade fuel to show that they know how  but they wouldn't build a weapon  they would build a research quantity. It would achieve some national pride  but not go ahead and build a weapon. And down at     they would build civilian nuclear energy  which is what they say is their objective. The yellow line shows us the most likely path. The yellow line includes an analysis of    decision makers in Iran  and a vast number of outside influencers trying to pressure Iran into changing its behavior  various players in the United States  and Egypt  and Saudi Arabia  and Russia  European Union  Japan  so on and so forth. The white line reproduces the analysis if the international environment just left Iran to make its own internal decisions  under its own domestic political pressures. That's not going to be happening  but you can see that the line comes down faster if they're not put under international pressure  if they're allowed to pursue their own devices. But in any event  by the end of this year  beginning of next year  we get to a stable equilibrium outcome. And that equilibrium is not what the United States would like  but it's probably an equilibrium that the United States can live with  and that a lot of others can live with. And that is that Iran will achieve that nationalist pride by making enough weapons grade fuel  through research  so that they could show that they know how to make weapons grade fuel  but not enough to actually build a bomb. How is this happening  Over here you can see this is the distribution of power in favor of civilian nuclear energy today  this is what that power block is predicted to be like by the late parts of       early parts of     . Just about nobody supports research on weapons grade fuel today  but by      that gets to be a big block  and you put these two together  that's the controlling influence in Iran. Out here today  there are a bunch of people    Ahmadinejad for example    who would like not only to build a bomb  but test a bomb. That power disappears completely  nobody supports that by     . These guys are all shrinking  the power is all drifting out here  so the outcome is going to be the weapons grade fuel. Who are the winners and who are the losers in Iran  Take a look at these guys  they're growing in power  and by the way  this was done a while ago before the current economic crisis  and that's probably going to get steeper. These folks are the moneyed interests in Iran  the bankers  the oil people  the bazaaries. They are growing in political clout  as the mullahs are isolating themselves    with the exception of one group of mullahs  who are not well known to Americans. That's this line here  growing in power  these are what the Iranians call the quietists. These are the Ayatollahs  mostly based in Qom  who have great clout in the religious community  have been quiet on politics and are going to be getting louder  because they see Iran going in an unhealthy direction  a direction contrary to what Khomeini had in mind. Here is Mr. Ahmadinejad. Two things to notice  he's getting weaker  and while he gets a lot of attention in the United States  he is not a major player in Iran. He is on the way down. OK  so I'd like you to take a little away from this. Everything is not predictable  the stock market is  at least for me  not predictable  but most complicated negotiations are predictable. Again  whether we're talking health policy  education  environment  energy  litigation  mergers  all of these are complicated problems that are predictable  that this sort of technology can be applied to. And the reason that being able to predict those things is important  is not just because you might run a hedge fund and make money off of it  but because if you can predict what people will do  you can engineer what they will do. And if you engineer what they do you can change the world  you can get a better result. I would like to leave you with one thought  which is for me  the dominant theme of this gathering  and is the dominant theme of this way of thinking about the world. When people say to you   That's impossible   you say back to them   When you say 'That's impossible ' you're confused with  'I don't know how to do it.'  Thank you. Chris Anderson  One question for you. That was fascinating. I love that you put it out there. I got very nervous halfway through the talk though  just panicking whether you'd included in your model  the possibility that putting this prediction out there might change the result. We've got     people in Tehran who watch TEDTalks. Bruce Bueno de Mesquita  I've thought about that  and since I've done a lot of work for the intelligence community  they've also pondered that. It would be a good thing if people paid more attention  took seriously  and engaged in the same sorts of calculations  because it would change things. But it would change things in two beneficial ways. It would hasten how quickly people arrive at an agreement  and so it would save everybody a lot of grief and time. And  it would arrive at an agreement that everybody was happy with  without having to manipulate them so much    which is basically what I do  I manipulate them. So it would be a good thing. CA  So you're kind of trying to say   People of Iran  this is your destiny  lets go there.  BBM  Well  people of Iran  this is what many of you are going to evolve to want  and we could get there a lot sooner  and you would suffer a lot less trouble from economic sanctions  and we would suffer a lot less fear of the use of military force on our end  and the world would be a better place. CA  Here's hoping they hear it that way. Thank you very much Bruce. BBM  Thank you. Bacteria are the oldest living organisms on the earth. They've been here for billions of years  and what they are are single celled microscopic organisms. So they are one cell and they have this special property that they only have one piece of DNA. They have very few genes  and genetic information to encode all of the traits that they carry out. And the way bacteria make a living is that they consume nutrients from the environment  they grow to twice their size  they cut themselves down in the middle  and one cell becomes two  and so on and so on. They just grow and divide  and grow and divide    so a kind of boring life  except that what I would argue is that you have an amazing interaction with these critters. I know you guys think of yourself as humans  and this is sort of how I think of you. This man is supposed to represent a generic human being  and all of the circles in that man are all of the cells that make up your body. There is about a trillion human cells that make each one of us who we are and able to do all the things that we do  but you have    trillion bacterial cells in you or on you at any moment in your life. So     times more bacterial cells than human cells on a human being. And of course it's the DNA that counts  so here's all the A  T  Gs and Cs that make up your genetic code  and give you all your charming characteristics. You have about        genes. Well it turns out you have     times more bacterial genes playing a role in you or on you all of your life. At the best  you're    percent human  but more likely about one percent human  depending on which of these metrics you like. I know you think of yourself as human beings  but I think of you as    or    percent bacterial. These bacteria are not passive riders  these are incredibly important  they keep us alive. They cover us in an invisible body armor that keeps environmental insults out so that we stay healthy. They digest our food  they make our vitamins  they actually educate your immune system to keep bad microbes out. So they do all these amazing things that help us and are vital for keeping us alive  and they never get any press for that. But they get a lot of press because they do a lot of terrible things as well. So  there's all kinds of bacteria on the Earth that have no business being in you or on you at any time  and if they are  they make you incredibly sick. And so  the question for my lab is whether you want to think about all the good things that bacteria do  or all the bad things that bacteria do. The question we had is how could they do anything at all  I mean they're incredibly small  you have to have a microscope to see one. They live this sort of boring life where they grow and divide  and they've always been considered to be these asocial reclusive organisms. And so it seemed to us that they are just too small to have an impact on the environment if they simply act as individuals. And so we wanted to think if there couldn't be a different way that bacteria live. The clue to this came from another marine bacterium  and it's a bacterium called Vibrio fischeri. What you're looking at on this slide is just a person from my lab holding a flask of a liquid culture of a bacterium  a harmless beautiful bacterium that comes from the ocean  named Vibrio fischeri. This bacterium has the special property that it makes light  so it makes bioluminescence  like fireflies make light. We're not doing anything to the cells here. We just took the picture by turning the lights off in the room  and this is what we see. What was actually interesting to us was not that the bacteria made light  but when the bacteria made light. What we noticed is when the bacteria were alone  so when they were in dilute suspension  they made no light. But when they grew to a certain cell number all the bacteria turned on light simultaneously. The question that we had is how can bacteria  these primitive organisms  tell the difference from times when they're alone  and times when they're in a community  and then all do something together. What we've figured out is that the way that they do that is that they talk to each other  and they talk with a chemical language. This is now supposed to be my bacterial cell. When it's alone it doesn't make any light. But what it does do is to make and secrete small molecules that you can think of like hormones  and these are the red triangles  and when the bacteria is alone the molecules just float away and so no light. But when the bacteria grow and double and they're all participating in making these molecules  the molecule    the extracellular amount of that molecule increases in proportion to cell number. And when the molecule hits a certain amount that tells the bacteria how many neighbors there are  they recognize that molecule and all of the bacteria turn on light in synchrony. That's how bioluminescence works    they're talking with these chemical words. The reason that Vibrio fischeri is doing that comes from the biology. Again  another plug for the animals in the ocean  Vibrio fischeri lives in this squid. What you are looking at is the Hawaiian Bobtail Squid  and it's been turned on its back  and what I hope you can see are these two glowing lobes and these house the Vibrio fischeri cells  they live in there  at high cell number that molecule is there  and they're making light. The reason the squid is willing to put up with these shenanigans is because it wants that light. The way that this symbiosis works is that this little squid lives just off the coast of Hawaii  just in sort of shallow knee deep water. The squid is nocturnal  so during the day it buries itself in the sand and sleeps  but then at night it has to come out to hunt. On bright nights when there is lots of starlight or moonlight that light can penetrate the depth of the water the squid lives in  since it's just in those couple feet of water. What the squid has developed is a shutter that can open and close over this specialized light organ housing the bacteria. Then it has detectors on its back so it can sense how much starlight or moonlight is hitting its back. And it opens and closes the shutter so the amount of light coming out of the bottom    which is made by the bacterium    exactly matches how much light hits the squid's back  so the squid doesn't make a shadow. It actually uses the light from the bacteria to counter illuminate itself in an anti predation device so predators can't see its shadow  calculate its trajectory  and eat it. This is like the stealth bomber of the ocean. But then if you think about it  the squid has this terrible problem because it's got this dying  thick culture of bacteria and it can't sustain that. And so what happens is every morning when the sun comes up the squid goes back to sleep  it buries itself in the sand  and it's got a pump that's attached to its circadian rhythm  and when the sun comes up it pumps out like    percent of the bacteria. Now the bacteria are dilute  that little hormone molecule is gone  so they're not making light    but of course the squid doesn't care. It's asleep in the sand. And as the day goes by the bacteria double  they release the molecule  and then light comes on at night  exactly when the squid wants it. First we figured out how this bacterium does this  but then we brought the tools of molecular biology to this to figure out really what's the mechanism. And what we found    so this is now supposed to be  again  my bacterial cell    is that Vibrio fischeri has a protein    that's the red box    it's an enzyme that makes that little hormone molecule  the red triangle. And then as the cells grow  they're all releasing that molecule into the environment  so there's lots of molecule there. And the bacteria also have a receptor on their cell surface that fits like a lock and key with that molecule. These are just like the receptors on the surfaces of your cells. When the molecule increases to a certain amount    which says something about the number of cells    it locks down into that receptor and information comes into the cells that tells the cells to turn on this collective behavior of making light. Why this is interesting is because in the past decade we have found that this is not just some anomaly of this ridiculous  glow in the dark bacterium that lives in the ocean    all bacteria have systems like this. So now what we understand is that all bacteria can talk to each other. They make chemical words  they recognize those words  and they turn on group behaviors that are only successful when all of the cells participate in unison. We have a fancy name for this  we call it quorum sensing. They vote with these chemical votes  the vote gets counted  and then everybody responds to the vote. What's important for today's talk is that we know that there are hundreds of behaviors that bacteria carry out in these collective fashions. But the one that's probably the most important to you is virulence. It's not like a couple bacteria get in you and they start secreting some toxins    you're enormous  that would have no effect on you. You're huge. What they do  we now understand  is they get in you  they wait  they start growing  they count themselves with these little molecules  and they recognize when they have the right cell number that if all of the bacteria launch their virulence attack together  they are going to be successful at overcoming an enormous host. Bacteria always control pathogenicity with quorum sensing. That's how it works. We also then went to look at what are these molecules    these were the red triangles on my slides before. This is the Vibrio fischeri molecule. This is the word that it talks with. So then we started to look at other bacteria  and these are just a smattering of the molecules that we've discovered. What I hope you can see is that the molecules are related. The left hand part of the molecule is identical in every single species of bacteria. But the right hand part of the molecule is a little bit different in every single species. What that does is to confer exquisite species specificities to these languages. Each molecule fits into its partner receptor and no other. So these are private  secret conversations. These conversations are for intraspecies communication. Each bacteria uses a particular molecule that's its language that allows it to count its own siblings. Once we got that far we thought we were starting to understand that bacteria have these social behaviors. But what we were really thinking about is that most of the time bacteria don't live by themselves  they live in incredible mixtures  with hundreds or thousands of other species of bacteria. And that's depicted on this slide. This is your skin. So this is just a picture    a micrograph of your skin. Anywhere on your body  it looks pretty much like this  and what I hope you can see is that there's all kinds of bacteria there. And so we started to think if this really is about communication in bacteria  and it's about counting your neighbors  it's not enough to be able to only talk within your species. There has to be a way to take a census of the rest of the bacteria in the population. So we went back to molecular biology and started studying different bacteria  and what we've found now is that in fact  bacteria are multilingual. They all have a species specific system    they have a molecule that says  me.  But then  running in parallel to that is a second system that we've discovered  that's generic. So  they have a second enzyme that makes a second signal and it has its own receptor  and this molecule is the trade language of bacteria. It's used by all different bacteria and it's the language of interspecies communication. What happens is that bacteria are able to count how many of me and how many of you. They take that information inside  and they decide what tasks to carry out depending on who's in the minority and who's in the majority of any given population. Then again we turn to chemistry  and we figured out what this generic molecule is    that was the pink ovals on my last slide  this is it. It's a very small  five carbon molecule. What the important thing is that we learned is that every bacterium has exactly the same enzyme and makes exactly the same molecule. So they're all using this molecule for interspecies communication. This is the bacterial Esperanto. Once we got that far  we started to learn that bacteria can talk to each other with this chemical language. But what we started to think is that maybe there is something practical that we can do here as well. I've told you that bacteria do have all these social behaviors  they communicate with these molecules. Of course  I've also told you that one of the important things they do is to initiate pathogenicity using quorum sensing. We thought  what if we made these bacteria so they can't talk or they can't hear  Couldn't these be new kinds of antibiotics  Of course  you've just heard and you already know that we're running out of antibiotics. Bacteria are incredibly multi drug resistant right now  and that's because all of the antibiotics that we use kill bacteria. They either pop the bacterial membrane  they make the bacterium so it can't replicate its DNA. We kill bacteria with traditional antibiotics and that selects for resistant mutants. And so now of course we have this global problem in infectious diseases. We thought  well what if we could sort of do behavior modifications  just make these bacteria so they can't talk  they can't count  and they don't know to launch virulence. And so that's exactly what we've done  and we've sort of taken two strategies. The first one is we've targeted the intraspecies communication system. So we made molecules that look kind of like the real molecules    which you saw    but they're a little bit different. And so they lock into those receptors  and they jam recognition of the real thing. By targeting the red system  what we are able to do is to make species specific  or disease specific  anti quorum sensing molecules. We've also done the same thing with the pink system. We've taken that universal molecule and turned it around a little bit so that we've made antagonists of the interspecies communication system. The hope is that these will be used as broad spectrum antibiotics that work against all bacteria. To finish I'll just show you the strategy. In this one I'm just using the interspecies molecule  but the logic is exactly the same. What you know is that when that bacterium gets into the animal  in this case  a mouse  it doesn't initiate virulence right away. It gets in  it starts growing  it starts secreting its quorum sensing molecules. It recognizes when it has enough bacteria that now they're going to launch their attack  and the animal dies. What we've been able to do is to give these virulent infections  but we give them in conjunction with our anti quorum sensing molecules    so these are molecules that look kind of like the real thing  but they're a little bit different which I've depicted on this slide. What we now know is that if we treat the animal with a pathogenic bacterium    a multi drug resistant pathogenic bacterium    in the same time we give our anti quorum sensing molecule  in fact  the animal lives. We think that this is the next generation of antibiotics and it's going to get us around  at least initially  this big problem of resistance. What I hope you think  is that bacteria can talk to each other  they use chemicals as their words  they have an incredibly complicated chemical lexicon that we're just now starting to learn about. Of course what that allows bacteria to do is to be multicellular. So in the spirit of TED they're doing things together because it makes a difference. What happens is that bacteria have these collective behaviors  and they can carry out tasks that they could never accomplish if they simply acted as individuals. What I would hope that I could further argue to you is that this is the invention of multicellularity. Bacteria have been on the Earth for billions of years  humans  couple hundred thousand. We think bacteria made the rules for how multicellular organization works. We think  by studying bacteria  we're going to be able to have insight about multicellularity in the human body. We know that the principles and the rules  if we can figure them out in these sort of primitive organisms  the hope is that they will be applied to other human diseases and human behaviors as well. I hope that what you've learned is that bacteria can distinguish self from other. By using these two molecules they can say  me  and they can say  you.  Again of course that's what we do  both in a molecular way  and also in an outward way  but I think about the molecular stuff. This is exactly what happens in your body. It's not like your heart cells and your kidney cells get all mixed up every day  and that's because there's all of this chemistry going on  these molecules that say who each of these groups of cells is  and what their tasks should be. Again  we think that bacteria invented that  and you've just evolved a few more bells and whistles  but all of the ideas are in these simple systems that we can study. The final thing is  again just to reiterate that there's this practical part  and so we've made these anti quorum sensing molecules that are being developed as new kinds of therapeutics. But then  to finish with a plug for all the good and miraculous bacteria that live on the Earth  we've also made pro quorum sensing molecules. So  we've targeted those systems to make the molecules work better. Remember you have these    times or more bacterial cells in you or on you  keeping you healthy. What we're also trying to do is to beef up the conversation of the bacteria that live as mutualists with you  in the hopes of making you more healthy  making those conversations better  so bacteria can do things that we want them to do better than they would be on their own. Finally  I wanted to show you this is my gang at Princeton  New Jersey. Everything I told you about was discovered by someone in that picture. I hope when you learn things  like about how the natural world works    I just want to say that whenever you read something in the newspaper or you get to hear some talk about something ridiculous in the natural world it was done by a child. Science is done by that demographic. All of those people are between    and    years old  and they are the engine that drives scientific discovery in this country. It's a really lucky demographic to work with. I keep getting older and older and they're always the same age  and it's just a crazy delightful job. I want to thank you for inviting me here. It's a big treat for me to get to come to this conference. Thanks. I am going to talk about myself  which I rarely do  because I    well for one thing  I prefer to talk about things I know nothing about. And secondly  I'm a recovering narcissist. I didn't know I was a narcissist actually. I thought narcissism meant you loved yourself. And then someone told me there is a flip side to it. So it's actually drearier than self love  it's unrequited self love. I don't feel I can afford a relapse. But I want to  though  explain how I came to design my own particular brand of comedy because I've been through so many different forms of it. I started with improvisation  in a particular form of improvisation called theater games  which had one rule  which I always thought was a great rule for an ethic for a society. And the rule was  you couldn't deny the other person's reality  you could only build on it. And of course we live in a society that's all about contradicting other peoples' reality. It's all about contradiction  which I think is why I'm so sensitive to contradiction in general. I see it everywhere. Like polls. You know  it's always curious to me that in public opinion polls the percentage of Americans who don't know the answer to any given question is always two percent.    percent of Americans think Alaska is part of Canada. But only two percent don't know the effect that the debacle in Argentina will have on the IMF's monetary policy    seems a contradiction. Or this ad that I read in the New York Times   Wearing a fine watch speaks loudly of your rank in society. Buying it from us screams good taste.  Or this that I found in a magazine called California Lawyer  in an article that is surely meant for the lawyers at Enron.  Surviving the Slammer  Do's and Don'ts.   Don't use big words.   Learn the lingua franca.  Yeah.  Lingua this  Frankie.  And I suppose it's a contradiction that I talk about science when I don't know math. You know  because    and by the way to I was so grateful to Dean Kamen for pointing out that one of the reasons  that there are cultural reasons that women and minorities don't enter the fields of science and technology    because for instance  the reason I don't do math is  I was taught to do math and read at the same time. So you're six years old  you're reading Snow White and the Seven Dwarves  and it becomes rapidly obvious that there are only two kinds of men in the world  dwarves and Prince Charmings. And the odds are seven to one against your finding the prince. That's why little girls don't do math. It's too depressing. Of course  by talking about science I also may  as I did the other night  incur the violent wrath of some scientists who were very upset with me. I used the word postmodern as if it were OK. And they got very upset. One of them  to his credit  I think really just wanted to engage me in a serious argument. But I don't engage in serious arguments. I don't approve of them because arguments  of course  are all about contradiction  and they're shaped by the values that I have questions with. I have questions with the values of Newtonian science  like rationality. You're supposed to be rational in an argument. Well rationality is constructed by what Christie Hefner was talking about today  that mind body split  you know  The head is good  body bad. Head is ego  body id. When we say  I      as when Rene Descartes said   I think therefore I am      we mean the head. And as David Lee Roth sang in  Just a Gigolo    I ain't got no body.  That's how you get rationality. And that's why so much of humor is the body asserting itself against the head. That's why you have toilet humor and sexual humor. That's why you have the Raspyni Brothers whacking Richard in the genital area. And we're laughing doubly then because he's the body  but it's also    Voice offstage  Richard. Emily Levine  Richard. What did I say  Richard. Yes but it's also the head  the head of the conference. That's the other way that humor    like Art Buchwald takes shots at the heads of state. It doesn't make quite as much money as body humor I'm sure    but nevertheless  what makes us treasure you and adore you. There's also a contradiction in rationality in this country though  which is  as much as we revere the head  we are very anti intellectual. I know this because I read in the New York Times  the Ayn Rand foundation took out a full page ad after September     in which they said   The problem is not Iraq or Iran  the problem in this country  facing this country is the university professors and their spawn.  So I went back and re read  The Fountainhead.  I don't know how many of you have read it. And I'm not an expert on sadomasochism. But let me just read you a couple of random passages from page    .  The act of a master taking painful contemptuous possession of her  was the kind of rapture she wanted. When they lay together in bed it was  as it had to be  as the nature of the act demanded  an act of violence. It was an act of clenched teeth and hatred. It was the unendurable. Not a caress  but a wave of pain. The agony as an act of passion.  So you can imagine my surprise on reading in The New Yorker that Alan Greenspan  Chairman of the Federal Reserve  claims Ayn Rand as his intellectual mentor. It's like finding out your nanny is a dominatrix. Bad enough we had to see J. Edgar Hoover in a dress. Now we have to picture Alan Greenspan in a black leather corset  with a butt tattoo that says   Whip inflation now.  And Ayn Rand of course  Ayn Rand is famous for a philosophy called Objectivism  which reflects another value of Newtonian physics  which is objectivity. Objectivity basically is constructed in that same S M way. It's the subject subjugating the object. That's how you assert yourself. You make yourself the active voice. And the object is the passive no voice. I was so fascinated by that Oxygen commercial. I don't know if you know this but    maybe it's different now  or maybe you were making a statement    but in many hospital nurseries across the country  until very recently anyway  according to a book by Jessica Benjamin  the signs over the little boys cribs read   I'm a boy   and the signs over the little girls cribs read   It's a girl.  Yeah. So the passivity was culturally projected onto the little girls. And this still goes on as I think I told you last year. There's a poll that proves    there was a poll that was given by Time magazine  in which only men were asked   Have you ever had sex with a woman you actively disliked   And well  yeah. Well     percent said yes  which I think is overinflated though because so many men if you just say   Have you ever had sex ...    Yes   They don't even wait for the rest of it. And of course two percent did not know whether they'd had    That's the first callback  of my attempted quadruple. So this subject object thing  is part of something I'm very interested in because this is why  frankly  I believe in political correctness. I do. I think it can go too far. I think Ringling Brothers may have gone too far with an ad they took out in the New York Times Magazine.  We have a lifelong emotional and financial commitment to our Asian Elephant partners.  Maybe too far. But you know    I don't think that a person of color making fun of white people is the same thing as a white person making fun of people of color. Or women making fun of men is the same as men making fun of women. Or poor people making fun of rich people  the same as rich people. I think you can make fun of the have but not the have nots  which is why you don't see me making fun of Kenneth Lay and his charming wife. What's funny about being down to four houses  And I really learned this lesson during the sex scandals of the Clinton administration or  Or as I call them  the good ol' days. When people I knew  you know  people who considered themselves liberal  and everything else  were making fun of Jennifer Flowers and Paula Jones. Basically  they were making fun of them for being trailer trash or white trash. It seems  I suppose  a harmless prejudice and that you're not really hurting anybody. Until you read  as I did  an ad in the Los Angeles Times.  For sale  White trash compactor.  So this whole subject object thing has relevance to humor in this way. I read a book by a woman named Amy Richlin  who is the chair of the Classics department at USC. And the book is called  The Garden of Priapus.  And she says that Roman humor mirrors the construction of Roman society. So that Roman society was very top bottom  as ours is to some degree. And so was humor. There always had to be the butt of a joke. So it was always the satirist  like Juvenal or Martial  represented the audience  and he was going to make fun of the outsider  the person who didn't share that subject status. And in stand up of course  the stand up comedian is supposed to dominate the audience. A lot of heckling is the tension of trying to make sure that the comedian is going to be able to dominate  and overcome the heckler. And I got good at that when I was in stand up. But I always hated it because they were dictating the terms of the interaction  in the same way that engaging in a serious argument determines the content  to some degree  of what you're talking about. And I was looking for a form that didn't have that. And so I wanted something that was more interactive. I know that word is so debased now by the use of it by Internet marketers. I really miss the old telemarketers now  I'll tell you that. I do  because at least there you stood a chance. You know  I used to actually hang up on them. But then I read in  Dear Abby  that that was rude. So the next time that one called I let him get halfway through his spiel and then I said   You sound sexy.  He hung up on me  But the interactivity allows the audience to shape what you're going to do as much as you shape their experience of the world. And that's really what I'm looking for. And I was sort of  as I was starting to analyze what exactly it is that I do  I read a book called  Trickster Makes This World   by Lewis Hyde. And it was like being psychoanalyzed. I mean he had laid it all out. And then coming to this conference  I realized that most everybody here shared those same qualities because really what trickster is is an agent of change. Trickster is a change agent. And the qualities that I'm about to describe are the qualities that make it possible to make change happen. And one of these is boundary crossing. I think this is what so  in fact  infuriated the scientists. But I like to cross boundaries. I like to  as I said  talk about things I know nothing about. I hope that's my agent  because you aren't paying me anything. And I think it's good to talk about things I know nothing about because I bring a fresh viewpoint to it  you know  I'm able to see the contradiction that you may not be able to see. Like for instance a mime once    or a meme as he called himself. He was a very selfish meme. And he said that I had to show more respect because it took up to    years to learn how to do mime properly. And I said   Well  that's how you know only stupid people go into it.  It only takes two years to learn how to talk. And you know people  this is the problem with quote  objectivity  unquote. When you're only surrounded by people who speak the same vocabulary as you  or share the same set of assumptions as you  you start to think that that's reality. Like economists  you know  their definition of rational  that we all act out of our own economic self interest. Well  look at Michael Hawley  or look at Dean Kamen  or look at my grandmother. My grandmother always acted in other people's interests  whether they wanted her to or not. If they had had an Olympics in martyrdom  my grandmother would have lost on purpose.  No  you take the prize. You're young. I'm old. Who's going to see it  Where am I going  I'm going to die soon.  So that's one    this boundary crossing  this go between which    Fritz Lanting  is that his name  actually said that he was a go between. That's an actual quality of the trickster. And another is  non oppositional strategies. And this is instead of contradiction. Where you deny the other person's reality  you have paradox where you allow more than one reality to coexist  I think there's another philosophical construction. I'm not sure what it's called. But my example of it is a sign that I saw in a jewelry store. It said   Ears pierced while you wait.  There the alternative just boggles the imagination.  Oh no. Thanks though  I'll leave them here. Thanks very much. I have some errands to run. So I'll be back to pick them up around five  if that's OK with you. Huh  Huh  What  Can't hear you.  And another attribute of the trickster is smart luck. That accidents  that Louis Kahn  who talked about accidents  this is another quality of the trickster. The trickster has a mind that is prepared for the unprepared. That  and I will say this to the scientists  that the trickster has the ability to hold his ideas lightly so that he can let room in for new ideas or to see the contradictions or the hidden problems with his ideas. I had no joke for that. I just wanted to put the scientists in their place. But here's how I think I like to make change  and that is in making connections. This is what I tend to see almost more than contradictions. Like the  what do you call those toes of the gecko  You know  the toes of the gecko  curling and uncurling like the fingers of Michael Moschen. I love connections. Like I'll read that one of the two attributes of matter in the Newtonian universe    there are two attributes of matter in the Newtonian universe    one is space occupancy. Matter takes up space. I guess the more you matter the more space you take up  which explains the whole SUV phenomenon. And the other one though is impenetrability. Well  in ancient Rome  impenetrability was the criterion of masculinity. Masculinity depended on you being the active penetrator. And then  in economics  there's an active producer and a passive consumer  which explains why business always has to penetrate new markets. Well yeah  I mean why we forced China to open her markets. And didn't that feel good  And now we're being penetrated. You know the biotech companies are actually going inside us and planting their little flags on our genes. You know we're being penetrated. And I suspect  by someone who actively dislikes us. That's the second of the quadruple. Yes of course you got that. Thank you very much. I still have a way to go. And what I hope to do  when I make these connections  is short circuit people's thinking. You know  make you not follow your usual train of association  but make you rewire. It literally    when people say about the shock of recognition  it's literally re cognition  rewiring how you think    I had a joke to go with this and I forgot it. I'm so sorry. I'm getting like the woman in that joke about    have you heard this joke about the woman driving with her mother  And the mother is elderly. And the mother goes right through a red light. And the daughter doesn't want to say anything. She doesn't want to be like   You're too old to drive.  And the mother goes through a second red light. And the daughter says  as tactfully as possible   Mom  are you aware that you just went through two red lights   And the mother says   Oh  Am I driving   And that's the shock of recognition at the shock of recognition. That completes the quadruple. I just want to say two more things. One is  another characteristic of trickster is that the trickster has to walk this fine line. He has to have poise. And you know the biggest hurdle for me  in doing what I do  is constructing my performance so that it's prepared and unprepared. Finding the balance between those things is always dangerous because you might tip off too much in the direction of unprepared. But being too prepared doesn't leave room for the accidents to happen. I was thinking about what Moshe Safdie said yesterday about beauty because in his book  Hyde says that sometimes trickster can tip over into beauty. But to do that you have to lose all the other qualities because once you're into beauty you're into a finished thing. You're into something that occupies space and inhabits time. It's an actual thing. And it is always extraordinary to see a thing of beauty. But if you don't do that  if you allow for the accident to keep on happening  you have the possibility of getting on a wavelength. I like to think of what I do as a probability wave. When you go into beauty the probability wave collapses into one possibility. And I like to explore all the possibilities in the hope that you'll be on the wavelength of your audience. And the one final quality I want to say about trickster is that he doesn't have a home. He's always on the road. I want to say to you Richard  in closing  that in TED you've created a home. And thank you for inviting me into it. Thank you very much. What I wanted to talk to you about today is two things  one  the rise of a culture of availability  and two  a request. So we're seeing a rise of this availability being driven by mobile device proliferation  globally  across all social strata. We're seeing  along with that proliferation of mobile devices  an expectation of availability. And  with that  comes the third point  which is obligation    and an obligation to that availability. And the problem is  we're still working through  from a societal standpoint  how we allow people to be available. There's a significant delta  in fact  between what we're willing to accept. Apologies to Hans Rosling    he said anything that's not using real stats is a lie    but the big delta there is how we deal with this from a public standpoint. So we've developed certain tactics and strategies to cover up. This first one's called  the lean.  And if you've ever been in a meeting where you play sort of meeting  chicken   you're sitting there  looking at the person  waiting for them to look away  and then quickly checking the device. Although you can see the gentleman up on the right is busting him.  The stretch.  OK  the gentleman on the left is saying   Screw you  I'm going to check my device.  But the guy  here  on the right  he's doing the stretch. It's that reeeee e e each out  the physical contortion to get that device just below the tabletop. Or  my favorite  the  Love you  mean it.  Nothing says  I love you  like  Let me find somebody else I give a damn about.  Or  this one  coming to us from India. You can find this on YouTube  the gentleman who's recumbent on a motorcycle while text messaging. Or what we call the  sweet gravy  stop me before I kill again   That is actually the device. What this is doing is  we find a    a direct collision    we find a direct collision between availability    and what's possible through availability    and a fundamental human need    which we've been hearing about a lot  actually    the need to create shared narratives. We're very good at creating personal narratives  but it's the shared narratives that make us a culture. And when you're standing with someone  and you're on your mobile device  effectively what you're saying to them is   You are not as important as  literally  almost anything that could come to me through this device.  Look around you. There might be somebody on one right now  participating in multi dimensional engagement. Our reality right now is less interesting than the story we're going to tell about it later. This one I love. This poor kid  clearly a prop    don't get me wrong  a willing prop    but the kiss that's being documented kind of looks like it sucks. This is the sound of one hand clapping. So  as we lose the context of our identity  it becomes incredibly important that what you share becomes the context of shared narrative  becomes the context in which we live. The stories that we tell    what we push out    becomes who we are. People aren't simply projecting identity  they're creating it. And so that's the request I have for everybody in this room. We are creating the technology that is going to create the new shared experience  which will create the new world. And so my request is  please  let's make technologies that make people more human  and not less. Thank you. So how would you run a whole country without oil  That's the question that sort of hit me in the middle of a Davos afternoon about four years ago. It never left my brain. And I started playing with it more like a puzzle. The original thought I had  this must be ethanol. So I went out and researched ethanol  and found out you need the Amazon in your backyard in every country. About six months later I figured out it must be hydrogen  until some scientist told me the unfortunate truth  which is  you actually use more clean electrons than the ones you get inside a car  if you use hydrogen. So that is not going to be the path to go. And then sort of through a process of wandering around  I got to the thought that actually if you could convert an entire country to electric cars  in a way that is convenient and affordable  you could get to a solution. Now I started this from a point of view that it has to be something that scales en masse. Not how do you build one car  but how do you scale this so that it can become something that is used by    percent of the population  The thought that came to mind is that it needs to be as good as any car that you would have today. So one  it has to be more convenient than a car. And two  it has be more affordable than today's cars. Affordable is not a        dollar sedan  right  Alright  That's not something that we can finance or buy today. And convenient is not something that you drive for an hour and charge for eight. So we're bound with the laws of physics and the laws of economics. And so the thought that I started with was how do you do this  still within the boundary of the science we know today    no time for science fair  no time for playing around with things or waiting for the magic battery to show up. How do you do it within the economics that we have today  How do you do it from the power of the consumer up  And not from the power of an edict down. On a random visit to Tesla on some afternoon  I actually found out that the answer comes from separating between the car ownership and the battery ownership. In a sense if you want to think about it this is the classic  batteries not included.  Now if you separate between the two  you could actually answer the need for a convenient car by creating a network  by creating a network before the cars show up. The network has two components in them. First component is you charge the car whenever you stop    ends up that cars are these strange beasts that drive for about two hours and park for about    hours. If you drive a car in the morning and drive it back in the afternoon the ratio of charge to drive is about a minute for a minute. And so the first thought that came to mind is  everywhere we park we have electric power. Now it sounds crazy. But in some places around the world  like Scandinavia  you already have that. If you park your car and didn't plug in the heater  when you come back you don't have a car. It just doesn't work. Now that last mile  last foot  in a sense  is the first step of the infrastructure. The second step of the infrastructure needs to take care of the range extension. See we're bound by today's technology on batteries  which is about     miles if you want to stay within reasonable space and weight limitations.     miles is a good enough range for a lot of people. But you never want to get stuck. So what we added is a second element to our network  which is a battery swap system. You drive. You take your depleted battery out. A full battery comes on. And you drive on. You don't do it as a human being. You do it as a machine. It looks like a car wash. You come into your car wash. And a plate comes up  holds your battery  takes it out  puts it back in  and within two minutes you're back on the road and you can go again. If you had charge spots everywhere  and you had battery swap stations everywhere  how often would you do it  And it ends up that you'd do swapping less times than you stop at a gas station. As a matter of fact  we added to the contract. We said that if you stop to swap your battery more than    times a year we start paying you money because it's an inconvenience. Then we looked at the question of the affordability. We looked at the question  what happens when the battery is disconnected from the car. What is the cost of that battery  Everybody tells us batteries are so expensive. What we found out  when you move from molecules to electrons  something interesting happens. We can go back to the original economics of the car and look at it again. The battery is not the gas tank  in a sense. Remember in your car you have a gas tank. You have the crude oil. And you have refining and delivery of that crude oil as what we call petrol or gasoline. The battery in this sense  is the crude oil. We have a battery bay. It costs the same hundred dollars as the gas tank. But the crude oil is replaced with a battery. Just it doesn't burn. It consumes itself step after step after step. It has       life cycles these days. And so it's sort of a mini well. We were asked in the past when we bought an electric car to pay for the entire well  for the life of the car. Nobody wants to buy a mini well when they buy a car. In a sense what we've done is we've created a new consumable. You  today  buy gasoline miles. And we created electric miles. And the price of electric miles ends up being a very interesting number. Today       in volume  when we come to market  it is eight cents a mile. Those of you who have a hard time calculating what that means    in the average consumer environment we're in in the U.S.    miles per gallon that's a buck     a buck    a gallon. That's cheaper than today's gasoline  even in the U.S. In Europe where taxes are in place  that's the equivalent to a minus    dollar barrel. But e miles follow Moore's Law. They go from eight cents a mile in       to four cents a mile in       to two cents a mile by     . Why  Because batteries life cycle improve    a bit of improvement on energy density  which reduces the price. And these prices are actually with clean electrons. We do not use any electrons that come from coal. So in a sense this is an absolute zero carbon  zero fossil fuel electric mile at two cents a mile by     . Now even if we get to    miles per gallon by       which is our desire. Imagine only    miles per gallon cars would be on the road. That is an    cent gallon. An    cent gallon means  if the entire Pacific would convert to crude oil  and we'd let any oil company bring it out and refine it  they still can't compete with two cents a mile. That's a new economic factor  which is fascinating to most people. Now this would have been a wonderful paper. That's how I solved it in my head. It was a white paper I handed out to governments. And some governments told me that it's fascinating that the younger generation actually thinks about these things. Until I got to the true young global leader  Shimon Peres  President of Israel  and he ran a beautiful manipulation on me. First he let me go to the prime minister of the country  who told me  if you can find the money you need for this network      million dollars  and if you can find a car company that will build that car in mass volume  in two million cars    that's what we needed in Israel    I'll give you country to invest the     million into. Peres thought that was a great idea. So we went out  and we looked at all the car companies. We sent letters to all the car companies. Three of them never showed up. One of them asked us if we would stay with hybrids and they would give us a discount. But one of them Carlos Ghosn  CEO of Renault and Nissan  when asked about hybrids said something very fascinating. He said hybrids are like mermaids. When you want a fish you get a woman and when you need a woman you get a fish. And Ghosn came up and said   I have the car  Mr. Peres  I will build you the cars.  And actually true to form  Renault has put a billion and a half dollars in building nine different types of cars that fit this kind of model that will come into the market in mass volume    mass volume being the first year      thousand cars. It's the first mass volume electric car  zero emission electric car in the market. I was running  as Chris said  to be the CEO of a large software company called SAP And then Peres said   Well won't you run this project   And I said   I'm ready for CEO  And he said   Oh no no no no no. You've got to explain to me  what is more important than saving your country and saving the world  that you would go and do   And I had to quit and come and do this thing called A Better Place. We then decided to scale it up. We went to other countries. As I said we went to Denmark. And Denmark set this beautiful policy  it's called the IQ test. It's inversely proportional to taxes. They put     percent tax on gasoline cars and zero tax on zero emission cars. So if you want to buy a gasoline car in Denmark  it costs you about        Euros. If you buy our car it's about        Euros. If you fail the IQ test they ask you to leave the country. We then were sort of coined as the guys who run only in small islands. I know most people don't think of Israel as a small island  but Israel is an island    it's a transportation island. If your car is driving outside Israel it's been stolen. If you're thinking about it in terms of islands  we decided to go to the biggest island that we could find  and that was Australia. The third country we announced was Australia. It's got three centers    in Brisbane  in Melbourne  in Sydney    and one freeway  one electric freeway that connects them. The next island was not too hard to find  and that was Hawaii. We decided to come into the U.S. and pick the two best places    the one where you didn't need any range extension. Hawaii you can drive around the island on one battery. And if you really have a long day you can switch  and keep on driving around the island. The second one was the San Francisco Bay Area where Gavin Newsom created a beautiful policy across all the mayors. He decided that he's going to take over the state  unofficially  and then officially  and then created this beautiful Region One policy. In the San Francisco Bay Area not only do you have the highest concentration of Priuses  but you also have the perfect range extender. It's called the other car. As we stared scaling it up we looked at what is the problem to come up to the U.S.  Why is this a big issue  And the most fascinating thing we've learned is that  when you have small problems on the individual level  like the price of gasoline to drive every morning. You don't notice it  but when the aggregate comes up you're dead. Alright  So the price of oil  much like lots of other curves that we've seen  goes along a depletion curve. The foundation of this curve is that we keep losing the wells that are close to the ground. And we keep getting wells that are farther away from the ground. It becomes more and more and more expensive to dig them out. You think  well it's been up  it's been down  its been up  it's going to keep on going up and down. Here is the problem  at     dollars a barrel  which we were in six months ago  the U.S. spent a ton of money to get oil. Then we lost our economy and we went back down to       sometimes it's     sometimes it's   . Now we're running a stimulus package. It's called the trillion dollar stimulus package. We're going to revive the economy. Hopefully it happens between now and       somewhere in that space. What happens when the economy recovers  By      we would have had at least     million new cars even at the pace we're going at right now. That's another    percent demand on oil. That is another    million barrels a day. That's all the U.S. usage today. In other words at some point when we've recovered we go up to the peak. And then we do the OPEC stimulus package also known as     dollars a barrel. We take our money and we give it away. You know what happens at that point  We go back down. It's going to go up and down. And the downs are going to be much longer and the ups are going to be much shorter. And that's the difference between problems that are additive  like CO   which we go slowly up and then we tip  and problems that are depletive  in which we lose what we have  which oscillate  and they oscillate until we lose everything we've got. Now we actually looked at what the answer would be. Right  Remember in the campaign  one million hybrid cars by     . That is  .  percent of the U.S. oil consumption. That is oh point oh well percent of the rest of the world. That won't do much difference. We looked at an MIT study  ten million electric cars on the global roads. Ten million out of     million we will add between now and then. That is the most pessimistic number you can have. It's also the most optimistic number because it means we will scale this industry from     thousand cars is       to    million cars by             x growth in less than five years. You have to remember that the world today is bringing in so many cars. We have    million cars by region. That's an enormous amount of cars. China is adding those cars    India  Russia  Brazil. We have all these regions. Europe has solved it. They just put a tax on gasoline. They'll be the first in line to get off because their prices are high. China solves it by an edict. At some point they'll just declare that no gasoline car will come into a city  and that will be it. The Indians don't even understand why we think of it as a problem because most people in India fill two or three gallons every time. For them to get a battery that goes     miles is an extension on range  not a reduction in range. We're the only ones who don't have the price set right. We don't have the industry set right. We don't have any incentive to go and resolve it across the U.S. Now where is the car industry on that  Very interesting. The car industry has been focused just on themselves. They basically looked at it and said   Car  .  we'll solve everything within the car itself.  No infrastructure  no problem. We forgot about the entire chain around us. All this stuff that happens around. We are looking at the emergence of a car  .     a whole new market  a whole new business model. The business model in which the money that is actually coming in  to drive the car    the minutes  the miles if you want  that you are all familiar with    subsidize the price of the car  just like cellphones. You'll pay for the miles. And some of it will go back to the car maker. Some of it will go back to your own pocket. But our cars are actually going to be cheaper than gasoline cars. You're looking at a world where cars are matched with windmills. In Denmark  we will drive all the cars in Denmark from windmills  not from oil. In Israel  we've asked to put a solar farm in the south of Israel. And people said   Oh that's a very very large space that you're asking for.  And we said   What if we had proven that in the same space we found oil for the country for the next hundred years   And they said   We tried. There isn't any.  We said   No no  but what if we prove it   And they said   Well you can dig.  And we decided to dig up  instead of digging down. These are perfect matches to one another. Now all you need is about    percent of the electricity generated. Think of it as a project that spans over about    years. That's one percent a year. Now when we're looking at solving big problems  we need to start thinking in two numbers. And those are not    percent by     . The two numbers are zero    as in zero footprint or zero oil    and scale it infinity. And when we go to COP   at the end of this year we can't stop thinking of padding CO . We have to start thinking about giving kickers to countries that are willing to go to this kind of scale. One car emits four tons. And actually     and change million cars today emit  .  billion tons of CO . That's  in the additive  about    percent of our problem. Cars and trucks add up to about    percent of the world's CO  emissions. We have to come and attack this problem with a focus  with an effort that actually says  we're going to go to zero before the world ends. I actually shared that with some legislators here in the U.S. I shared it with a gentleman called Bobby Kennedy Jr.  who is one of my idols. I told him one of the reasons that his uncle was remembered is because he said we're going to send a man to the moon  and we'll do it by the end of the decade. We didn't say we're going to send a man    percent to the moon. And there will be about a    percent chance we'll recover him. He actually shared with me another story  which is from about     years ago.     years ago  in Parliament  in Great Britain  there was a long argument over economy versus morality.    percent    just like    percent emissions today comes from cars       percent of their energy for the entire industrial world in the U.K. came from a source of energy that was immoral  human slaves. And there was an argument. Should we stop using slaves  And what would it do to our economy  And people said   Well we need to take time to do it. Let's not do it immediately. Maybe we free the kids and keep the slaves. And after a month of arguments they decided to stop slavery  and the industrial revolution started within less than one year. And the U.K. had     years of economic growth. We have to make the right moral decision. We have to make it immediately. We need to have presidential leadership just like we had in Israel that said we will end oil. And we need to do it not within    years or    years  but within this presidential term because if we don't  we will lose our economy  right after we'd lost our morality. Thank you all very much. The future of life  where the unraveling of our biology    and bring up the lights a little bit. I don't have any slides. I'm just going to talk    about where that's likely to carry us. And you know  I saw all the visions of the first couple of sessions. It almost made me feel a little bit guilty about having an uplifting talk about the future. It felt wrong to do that in some way. And yet  I don't really think it is because when it comes down to it  it's this larger trajectory that is really what is going to remain    what people in the future are going to remember about this period. I want to talk to you a little bit about why the visions of Jeremy Rivkins  who would like to ban these sorts of technologies  or of the Bill Joys who would like to relinquish them  are actually    to follow those paths would be such a tragedy for us. I'm focusing on biology  the biological sciences. The reason I'm doing that is because those are going to be the areas that are the most significant to us. The reason for that is really very simple. It's because we're flesh and blood. We're biological creatures. And what we can do with our biology is going to shape our future and that of our children and that of their children    whether we gain control over aging  whether we learn to protect ourselves from Alzheimer's  and heart disease  and cancer. I think that Shakespeare really put it very nicely. And I'm actually going to use his words in the same order that he did. He said   And so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe. And then from hour to hour we rot and rot. And thereby hangs a tale.  Life is short  you know. And we need to think about planning a little bit. We're all going to eventually  even in the developed world  going to have to lose everything that we love. When you're beginning to rot a little bit  all of the videos crammed into your head  all of the extensions that extend your various powers  are going to being to seem a little secondary. And you know  I'm getting a little bit gray    so is Ray Kurzweil  so is Eric Drexler. This is where it's really central to our lives. Now I know there's been a whole lot of hype about our power to control biology. You just have to look at the Human Genome Project. It wasn't two years ago that everybody was talking about    we've found the Holy Grail of biology. We're deciphering the code of codes. We're reading the book of life. It's a little bit reminiscent of      when Neil Armstrong walked on the moon  and everybody was about to race out toward the stars. And we've all seen        A Space Odyssey.  You know it's       and there is no HAL. And there is no odyssey to our own moon  much less the moons of Jupiter. And we're still picking up pieces of the Challenger. So it's not surprising that some people would wonder whether maybe    or    years from now  we'll look back at this instant in time  and all of the sort of talk about the Human Genome Project  and what all this is going to mean to us    well  it will really mean precious little. And I just want to say that that is absolutely not going to be the case. Because when we talk about our genetics and our biology  and modifying and altering and adjusting these things  we're talking about changing ourselves. And this is very critical stuff. If you have any doubts about how technology affects our lives  you just have to go to any major city. This is not the stomping ground of our Pleistocene ancestors. What's happening is we're taking this technology    it's becoming more precise  more potent    and we're turning it back upon ourselves. Before it's all done we are going to alter ourselves every bit as much as we have changed the world around us. It's going to happen a lot sooner than people imagine. On the way there it's going to completely revolutionize medicine and health care  that's obvious. It's going to change the way we have children. It's going to change the way we manage and alter our emotions. It's going to probably change the human lifespan. It will really make us question what it is to be a human being. The larger context of this is that are two unprecedented revolutions that are going on today. The first of them is the obvious one  the silicon revolution  which you all are very  very familiar with. It's changing our lives in so many ways  and it will continue to do that. What the essence of that is  is that we're taking the sand at our feet  the inert silicon at our feet  and we're breathing a level of complexity into it that rivals that of life itself  and may even surpass it. As an outgrowth of that  as a child of that revolution  is the revolution in biology. The genomics revolution  proteomics  metabolomics  all of these  omics  that sound so terrific on grants and on business plans. What we're doing is we are seizing control of our evolutionary future. I mean we're essentially using technology to just jam evolution into fast forward. It's not at all clear where it's going to take us. But in five to ten years we're going to start see some very profound changes. The most immediate changes that we'll see are things like in medicine. There is going to be a big shift towards preventative medicine as we start to be able to identify all of the risk factors that we have as individuals. But who is going to pay for all this  And how are we going to understand all this complex information  That is going to be the IT challenge of the next generation  is communicating all this information. There's pharmacogenomics  the combination of pharmacology and genetics  tailoring drugs to our individual constitutions that Juan talked about a little bit earlier. That's going to have amazing impacts. And it's going to be used for diet as well  and nutritional supplements and such. But it's going to have a big impact because we're going to have niche drugs. And we aren't going to be able to support the kinds of expenses that we have to create blockbuster drugs today. The approval process is going to fall apart  actually. It's too slow. It's too risk averse. And it is really not suited for the future that we're moving into. Another thing is that we're just going to have to deal with this knowledge. It's really wonderful when we hear   Oh    .  percent of the letters in the code are the same. We're all identical to each other. Isn't it wonderful   And look around you and know that what we really care about is that little bit of difference. We look the same to a visitor from another planet  maybe  but not to each other because we compete with each other all time. And we're going to have to come to grips with the fact that there are differences between us as individuals that we will know about  and between subpopulations of humans as well. To deny that that's the case is not a very good start on that. A generation or so away there are going to be even more profound things that are going to happen. That's when we're going to begin to use this knowledge to modify ourselves. Now I don't mean extra gills or something    something we care about  like aging. What if we could unravel aging and understand it    begin to retard the process or even reverse it  It would change absolutely everything. And it's obvious to anyone  that if we can do this  we absolutely will do this  whatever the consequences are. The second is modifying our emotions. I mean Ritalin  Viagra  things of that sort  Prozac. You know  this is just clumsy little baby steps. What if you could take a little concoction of pharmaceuticals that would make you feel really contented  just happy to be you. Are you going to be able to resist that if it doesn't have any overt side effects  Probably not. And if you don't  who are you going to be  Why do you do what you do  We're sort of circumventing evolutionary programs that guide our behavior. It's going to be very challenging to deal with. The third area is reproduction. The idea that we're going to chose our children's genes  as we begin to understand what genes say about who we are. That's the focus of my book  Redesigning Humans   where I talk about the kinds of choices we'll make  and the challenges it's going to present to society. There are three obvious ways of doing this. The first is cloning. It didn't happen. It's a total media circus. It will happen in five to    years. And when it does it's not going to be that big a deal. The birth of a delayed identical twin is not going to shake western civilization. But there are more important things that are already occurring  embryo screening. You take a six to eight cell embryo  you tease out one of the cells  you run a genetic test on that cell  and depending on the results of that test you either implant that embryo or you discard it. It's already done to avoid rare diseases today. And pretty soon it's going to be possible to avoid virtually all genetic diseases in that way. As that becomes possible this is going to move from something that is used by those who have infertility problems and are already doing in vitro fertilization  to the wealthy who want to protect their children  to just about everybody else. And in that process that's going to morph from being just for diseases  to being for lesser vulnerabilities  like risk of manic depression or something  to picking personalities  temperaments  traits  these sorts of things. Of course there is going to be genetic engineering. Directly going in    it's a little bit further away  but not that far away    going in and altering the genes in the first cell in an embryo. The way I suspect it will happen is using artificial chromosomes and extra chromosomes  so we go from    to    or   . And one that is not heritable because who would want to pass on to their children the archaic enhancement modules that they got    years earlier from their parents  It's a joke  of course they wouldn't want to do that. They'll want the new release. Those kinds of loose analogies with computers  and with programming  are actually much deeper than that. They are really going to come to operate in this realm. Now not everything that can be done should be done. And it won't be done. But when something is feasible in thousands of laboratories all over the world  which is going to be the case with these technologies  when there are large numbers of people who see them as beneficial  which is already the case  and when they're almost impossible to police  it's not a question of if this is going to happen  it's when and where and how it's going to happen. Humanity is going to go down this path. And it's going to do so for two reasons. The first is that all these technologies are just a spin off of mainstream medical research that everybody wants to see happen. It is being funded very very    in a big way. The second is  we're human. That's what we do. We try and use our technology to improve our lives in one way or another. To imagine that we're not going to use these technologies when they become available  is as much a denial of who we are as to imagine that we'll use these technologies and not fret and worry about it a great deal. The lines are going to blur. And they already are between therapy and enhancement  between treatment and prevention  between need and desire. That's really the central one  I believe. People can try and ban these things. They undoubtedly will. They have. But ultimately all this is going to do is just shift development elsewhere. It's going to drive these things from view. It's going to reserve the technology for the wealthy because they are in the best position to circumvent any of these sorts of laws. And it's going to deny us the information that we need to make wise decisions about how to use these technologies. So  sure  we need to debate these things. And I think it's wonderful that we do. But we shouldn't kid ourselves and think that we're going to reach a consensus about these things. That is simply not going to happen. They touch us too deeply. And they depend too much upon history  upon philosophy  upon religion  upon culture  upon politics. Some people are going to see this as an abomination  as the worst thing  as just awful. Other people are going to say   This is great. This is the flowering of human endeavor.  The one thing though that is really dangerous about these sorts of technologies  is that it's easy to become seduced by them. And to focus too much on all the high technology possibilities that exist. And to lose touch with the basic rhythms of our biology and our health. There are too many people that think that high technology medicine is going to keep them  save them  from overeating  from eating a lot of fast foods  from not getting any exercise. It's not going to happen. In the midst of all this amazing technology  and all these things that are occurring  it's really interesting because there is sort of a counter revolution that is going on  a resurgence of interest in remedies from the past  in nutraceuticals  in all of these sorts of things that some people  in the pharmaceutical industry particularly  like to brand as non science. But this whole effort is generated  is driven  by IT as well because that is how we're gathering all this information  and linking it  and integrating it together. There is a lot in this rich biota that is going to serve us well. And that's where about half of our drugs come. So we shouldn't dismiss this because it's an enormous opportunity to use these sorts of results  or these random loose trials from the last thousand years about what has impacts on our health. And to use our advanced technologies to pull out what is beneficial from this sea of noise  basically. In fact this isn't just abstract. I just formed a biotechnology company that is using this sort of an approach to develop therapeutics for Alzheimer's and other diseases of aging  and we're making some real progress. So here we are. It's the beginning of a new millennium. If you look forward  I mean future humans  far before the end of this millennium  in a few hundred years  they are going to look back at this moment. And from the beginning of today's sessions you'd think that they're going to see this as this horrible difficult  painful period that we struggled through. And I don't think that's what's going to happen. They're going to do like everybody does. They are going to forget about all that stuff. And they are actually going to romanticize this moment in time. They are going to think about it as this glorious instant when we laid down the very foundations of their lives  of their society  of their future. You know it's a little bit like a birth. Where there is this bloody  awful mess happens. And then what comes out of it  New life. Actually as was pointed out earlier  we forget about all the struggle there was in getting there. So to me  it's clear that one of the foundations of that future is going to be the reworking of our biology. It's going to come gradually at first. It's going to pick up speed. We're going to make lots of errors. That's the way these things work. To me it's an incredible privilege to be alive now and to be able to witness this thing. It is something that is a unique instant in the history of all of life. It will always be remembered. And what's extraordinary is that we're not just observing this  we are the architects of this. I think that we should be proud of it. What is so difficult and challenging is that we are also the objects of these changes. It's our health  it's our lives  it's our future  it's our children. And that is why they are so very troubling to so many people who would pull back in fear. I think that our choice in the choice of life  is not whether we're going to go down this path. We are  definitely. It's how we hold it in our hearts. It's how we look at it. I think Thucydides really spoke to us very clearly in     B.C. He put it nicely. Again  I'll use the words in the same order he did.  The bravest are surely those who have the clearest vision of what is before them  both glory and danger alike. And yet notwithstanding  they go out and they meet it.  Thank you. The AlloSphere  it's a three story metal sphere in an echo free chamber. Think of the AlloSphere as a large  dynamically varying digital microscope that's connected to a supercomputer.    researchers can stand on a bridge suspended inside of the sphere  and be completely immersed in their data. Imagine if a team of physicists could stand inside of an atom and watch and hear electrons spin. Imagine if a group of sculptors could be inside of a lattice of atoms and sculpt with their material. Imagine if a team of surgeons could fly into the brain  as though it was a world  and see tissues as landscapes  and hear blood density levels as music. This is some of the research that you're going to see that we're undertaking at the AlloSphere. But first a little bit about this group of artists  scientists  and engineers that are working together. I'm a composer  orchestrally trained  and the inventor of the AlloSphere. With my visual artist colleagues  we map complex mathematical algorithms that unfold in time and space  visually and sonically. Our scientist colleagues are finding new patterns in the information. And our engineering colleagues are making one of the largest dynamically varying computers in the world for this kind of data exploration. I'm going to fly you into five research projects in the AlloSphere that are going to take you from biological macroscopic data all the way down to electron spin. This first project is called the AlloBrain. And it's our attempt to quantify beauty by finding which regions of the brain are interactive while witnessing something beautiful. You're flying through the cortex of my colleague's brain. Our narrative here is real fMRI data that's mapped visually and sonically. The brain now a world that we can fly through and interact with. You see    intelligent computer agents  the little rectangles that are flying in the brain with you. They're mining blood density levels. And they're reporting them back to you sonically. Higher density levels mean more activity in that point of the brain. They're actually singing these densities to you with higher pitches mapped to higher densities. We're now going to move from real biological data to biogenerative algorithms that create artificial nature in our next artistic and scientific installation. In this artistic and scientific installation  biogenerative algorithms are helping us to understand self generation and growth  very important for simulation in the nanoscaled sciences. For artists  we're making new worlds that we can uncover and explore. These generative algorithms grow over time  and they interact and communicate as a swarm of insects. Our researchers are interacting with this data by injecting bacterial code  which are computer programs  that allow these creatures to grow over time. We're going to move now from the biological and the macroscopic world  down into the atomic world  as we fly into a lattice of atoms. This is real AFM    Atomic Force Microscope    data from my colleagues in the Solid State Lighting and Energy Center. They've discovered a new bond  a new material for transparent solar cells. We're flying through       lattice of atoms    oxygen  hydrogen and zinc. You view the bond in the triangle. It's four blue zinc atoms bonding with one white hydrogen atom. You see the electron flow with the streamlines we as artists have generated for the scientists. This is allowing them to find the bonding nodes in any lattice of atoms. We think it makes a beautiful structural art. The sound that you're hearing are the actual emission spectrums of these atoms. We've mapped them into the audio domain  so they're singing to you. Oxygen  hydrogen and zinc have their own signature. We're going to actually move even further down as we go from this lattice of atoms to one single hydrogen atom. We're working with our physicist colleagues that have given us the mathematical calculations of the n dimensional Schr dinger equation in time. What you're seeing here right now is a superposition of an electron in the lower three orbitals of a hydrogen atom. You're actually hearing and seeing the electron flow with the lines. The white dots are the probability wave that will show you where the electron is in any given point of time and space in this particular three orbital configuration. In a minute we're going to move to a two orbital configuration  and you're going to notice a pulsing. And you're going to hear an undulation between the sound. This is actually a light emitter. As the sound starts to pulse and contract  our physicists can tell when a photon is going to be emitted. They're starting to find new mathematical structures in these calculations. And they're understanding more about quantum mathematics. We're going to move even further down  and go to one single electron spin. This will be the final project that I show you. Our colleagues in the Center for Quantum Computation and Spintronics are actually measuring with their lasers decoherence in a single electron spin. We've taken this information and we've made a mathematical model out of it. You're actually seeing and hearing quantum information flow. This is very important for the next step in simulating quantum computers and information technology. So these brief examples that I've shown you give you an idea of the kind of work that we're doing at the University of California  Santa Barbara  to bring together  arts  science and engineering into a new age of math  science and art. We hope that all of you will come to see the AlloSphere. Inspire us to think of new ways that we can use this unique instrument that we've created at Santa Barbara. Thank you very much. This is Tim Ferriss circa      A.D. Age two. You can tell by the power squat  I was a very confident boy    and not without reason. I had a very charming routine at the time  which was to wait until late in the evening when my parents were decompressing from a hard day's work  doing their crossword puzzles  watching television. I would run into the living room  jump up on the couch  rip the cushions off  throw them on the floor  scream at the top of my lungs and run out because I was the Incredible Hulk. Obviously  you see the resemblance. And this routine went on for some time. When I was seven I went to summer camp. My parents found it necessary for peace of mind. And at noon each day the campers would go to a pond  where they had floating docks. You could jump off the end into the deep end. I was born premature. I was always very small. My left lung had collapsed when I was born. And I've always had buoyancy problems. So water was something that scared me to begin with. But I would go in on occasion. And on one particular day  the campers were jumping through inner tubes  They were diving through inner tubes. And I thought this would be great fun. So I dove through the inner tube  and the bully of the camp grabbed my ankles. And I tried to come up for air  and my lower back hit the bottom of the inner tube. And I went wild eyed and thought I was going to die. A camp counselor fortunately came over and separated us. From that point onward I was terrified of swimming. That is something that I did not get over. My inability to swim has been one of my greatest humiliations and embarrassments. That is when I realized that I was not the Incredible Hulk. But there is a happy ending to this story. At age       that's my age now    in August I took two weeks to re examine swimming  and question all the of the obvious aspects of swimming. And went from swimming one lap    so    yards    like a drowning monkey  at about     beats per minute heart rate    I measured it    to going to Montauk on Long Island  close to where I grew up  and jumping into the ocean and swimming one kilometer in open water  getting out and feeling better than when I went in. And I came out  in my Speedos  European style  feeling like the Incredible Hulk. And that's what I want everyone in here to feel like  the Incredible Hulk  at the end of this presentation. More specifically  I want you to feel like you're capable of becoming an excellent long distance swimmer  a world class language learner  and a tango champion. And I would like to share my art. If I have an art  it's deconstructing things that really scare the living hell out of me. So  moving onward. Swimming  first principles. First principles  this is very important. I find that the best results in life are often held back by false constructs and untested assumptions. And the turnaround in swimming came when a friend of mine said   I will go a year without any stimulants     this is a six double espresso per day type of guy     if you can complete a one kilometer open water race.  So the clock started ticking. I started seeking out triathletes because I found that lifelong swimmers often couldn't teach what they did. I tried kickboards. My feet would slice through the water like razors  I wouldn't even move. I would leave demoralized  staring at my feet. Hand paddles  everything. Even did lessons with Olympians    nothing helped. And then Chris Sacca  who is now a dear friend mine  had completed an Iron Man with     degree temperature  said   I have the answer to your prayers.  And he introduced me to the work of a man named Terry Laughlin who is the founder of Total Immersion Swimming. That set me on the road to examining biomechanics. So here are the new rules of swimming  if any of you are afraid of swimming  or not good at it. The first is  forget about kicking. Very counterintuitive. So it turns out that propulsion isn't really the problem. Kicking harder doesn't solve the problem because the average swimmer only transfers about three percent of their energy expenditure into forward motion. The problem is hydrodynamics. So what you want to focus on instead is allowing your lower body to draft behind your upper body  much like a small car behind a big car on the highway. And you do that by maintaining a horizontal body position. The only way you can do that is to not swim on top of the water. The body is denser than water.    percent of it would be  at least  submerged naturally. So you end up  number three  not swimming  in the case of freestyle  on your stomach  as many people think  reaching on top of the water. But actually rotating from streamlined right to streamlined left  maintaining that fuselage position as long as possible. So let's look at some examples. This is Terry. And you can see that he's extending his right arm below his head and far in front. And so his entire body really is underwater. The arm is extended below the head. The head is held in line with the spine  so that you use strategic water pressure to raise your legs up    very important  especially for people with lower body fat. Here is an example of the stroke. So you don't kick. But you do use a small flick. You can see this is the left extension. Then you see his left leg. Small flick  and the only purpose of that is to rotate his hips so he can get to the opposite side. And the entry point for his right hand    notice this  he's not reaching in front and catching the water. Rather  he is entering the water at a    degree angle with his forearm  and then propelling himself by streamlining    very important. Incorrect  above  which is what almost every swimming coach will teach you. Not their fault  honestly. And I'll get to implicit versus explicit in a moment. Below is what most swimmers will find enables them to do what I did  which is going from    strokes per    yard length to    strokes in two workouts with no coach  no video monitoring. And now I love swimming. I can't wait to go swimming. I'll be doing a swimming lesson later  for myself  if anyone wants to join me. Last thing  breathing. A problem a lot of us have  certainly  when you're swimming. In freestyle  easiest way to remedy this is to turn with body roll  and just to look at your recovery hand as it enters the water. And that will get you very far. That's it. That's really all you need to know. Languages. Material versus method. I  like many people  came to the conclusion that I was terrible at languages. I suffered through Spanish for junior high  first year of high school  and the sum total of my knowledge was pretty much   Donde esta el bano   And I wouldn't even catch the response. A sad state of affairs. Then I transferred to a different school sophomore year  and I had a choice of other languages. Most of my friends were taking Japanese. So I thought why not punish myself  I'll do Japanese. Six months later I had the chance to go to Japan. My teachers assured me  they said   Don't worry. You'll have Japanese language classes every day to help you cope. It will be an amazing experience.  My first overseas experience in fact. So my parents encouraged me to do it. I left. I arrived in Tokyo. Amazing. I couldn't believe I was on the other side of the world. I met my host family. Things went quite well I think  all things considered. My first evening  before my first day of school  I said to my mother  very politely   Please wake me up at eight a.m.  So   Japanese  But I didn't say  Japanese . I said   Japanese . Pretty close. But I said   Please rape me at eight a.m.  You've never seen a more confused Japanese woman. I walked in to school. And a teacher came up to me and handed me a piece of paper. I couldn't read any of it    hieroglyphics  it could have been    because it was Kanji  Chinese characters adapted into the Japanese language. Asked him what this said. And he goes   Ahh  okay okay  eehto  World History  ehh  Calculus  Traditional Japanese.  And so on. And so it came to me in waves. There had been something lost in translation. The Japanese classes were not Japanese instruction classes  per se. They were the normal high school curriculum for Japanese students    the other       students in the school  who were Japanese  besides the American. And that's pretty much my response. And that set me on this panic driven search for the perfect language method. I tried everything. I went to Kinokuniya. I tried every possible book  every possible CD. Nothing worked until I found this. This is the Joyo Kanji. This is a Tablet rather  or a poster of the       common use characters as determined by the Ministry of Education in     . Many of the publications in Japan limit themselves to these characters  to facilitate literacy    some are required to. And this became my Holy Grail  my Rosetta Stone. As soon as I focused on this material  I took off. I ended up being able to read Asahi Shinbu  Asahi newspaper  about six months later    so a total of    months later    and went from Japanese I to Japanese VI. Ended up doing translation work at age    when I returned to the U.S.  and have continued to apply this material over method approach to close to a dozen languages now. Someone who was terrible at languages  and at any given time  speak  read and write five or six. This brings us to the point  which is  it's oftentimes what you do  not how you do it  that is the determining factor. This is the difference between being effective    doing the right things    and being efficient    doing things well whether or not they're important. You can also do this with grammar. I came up with these six sentences after much experimentation. Having a native speaker allow you to deconstruct their grammar  by translating these sentences into past  present  future  will show you subject  object  verb  placement of indirect  direct objects  gender and so forth. From that point  you can then  if you want to  acquire multiple languages  alternate them so there is no interference. We can talk about that if anyone in interested. And now I love languages. So ballroom dancing  implicit versus explicit    very important. You might look at me and say   That guy must be a ballroom dancer.  But no  you'd be wrong because my body is very poorly designed for most things    pretty well designed for lifting heavy rocks perhaps. I used to be much bigger  much more muscular. And so I ended up walking like this. I looked a lot like an orangutan  our close cousins  or the Incredible Hulk. Not very good for ballroom dancing. I found myself in Argentina in       decided to watch a tango class    had no intention of participating. Went in  paid my ten pesos  walked up       women two guys  usually a good ratio. The instructor says   You are participating.  Immediately  death sweat. Fight or flight fear sweat  because I tried ballroom dancing in college    stepped on the girl's foot with my heel. She screamed. I was so concerned with her perception of what I was doing  that it exploded in my face  never to return to the ballroom dancing club. She comes up  and this was her approach  the teacher.  Okay  come on  grab me.  Gorgeous assistant instructor. She was very pissed off that I had pulled her from her advanced practice. So I did my best. I didn't know where to put my hands. And she pulled back  threw down her arms  put them on her hips  turned around and yelled across the room   This guy is built like a god damned mountain of muscle  and he's grabbing me like a fucking Frenchman   which I found encouraging. Everyone burst into laughter. I was humiliated. She came back. She goes   Come on. I don't have all day.  As someone who wrestled since age eight  I proceeded to crush her   Of Mice and Men  style. And she looked up and said   Now that's better.  So I bought a month's worth of classes. And proceeded to look at    I wanted to set competition so I'd have a deadline    Parkinson's Law  the perceived complexity of a task will expand to fill the time you allot it. So I had a very short deadline for a competition. I got a female instructor first  to teach me the female role  the follow  because I wanted to understand the sensitivities and abilities that the follow needed to develop  so I wouldn't have a repeat of college. And then I took an inventory of the characteristics  along with her  of the of the capabilities and elements of different dancers who'd won championships. I interviewed these people because they all taught in Buenos Aires. I compared the two lists  and what you find is that there is explicitly  expertise they recommended  certain training methods. Then there were implicit commonalities that none of them seemed to be practicing. Now the protectionism of Argentine dance teachers aside  I found this very interesting. So I decided to focus on three of those commonalities. Long steps. So a lot of milongueros    the tango dancers will use very short steps. I found that longer steps were much more elegant. So you can have    and you can do it in a very small space in fact. Secondly  different types of pivots. Thirdly  variation in tempo. These seemed to be the three areas that I could exploit to compete if I wanted to comptete against people who'd been practicing for    to    years. That photo is of the semi finals of the Buenos Aires championships  four months later. Then one month later  went to the world championships  made it to the semi final. And then set a world record  following that  two weeks later. I want you to see part of what I practiced. I'm going to jump forward here. This is the instructor that Alicia and I chose for the male lead. His name is Gabriel Misse. One of the most elegant dancers of his generation  known for his long steps  and his tempo changes and his pivots. Alicia  in her own right  very famous. So I think you'll agree  they look quite good together. Now what I like about this video is it's actually a video of the first time they ever danced together because of his lead. He had a strong lead. He didn't lead with his chest  which requires you lean forward. I couldn't develop the attributes in my toes  the strength in my feet  to do that. So he uses a lead that focuses on his shoulder girdle and his arm. So he can lift the woman to break her  for example. That's just one benefit of that. So then we broke it down. This would be an example of one pivot. This is a back step pivot. There are many different types. I have hundreds of hours of footage    all categorized  much like George Carlin categorized his comedy. So using my arch nemesis  Spanish  no less  to learn tango. So fear is your friend. Fear is an indicator. Sometimes it shows you what you shouldn't do. More often than not it shows you exactly what you should do. And the best results that I've had in life  the most enjoyable times  have all been from asking a simple question  what's the worst that can happen  Especially with fears you gained when you were a child. Take the analytical frameworks  the capabilities you have  apply them to old fears. Apply them to very big dreams. And when I think of what I fear now  it's very simple. When I imagine my life  what my life would have been like without the educational opportunities that I had  it makes me wonder. I've spent the last two years trying to deconstruct the American public school system  to either fix it or replace it. And have done experiments with about        students thus far    built  I'd say  about a half dozen schools  my readers  at this point. And if any of you are interested in that  I would love to speak with you. I know nothing. I'm a beginner. But I ask a lot of questions  and I would love your advice. Thank you very much. It's pretty simple. There are nine  sort of  rules that I discovered after    years of rock climbing. Most of them are pretty basic. Number one  don't let go    very sure success method. But really  truly    often you think about letting go way before your body does. So hang in there  and you come up with some pretty peculiar solutions. Number two  hesitation is bad. This is a friction climb  up in Tuolumne Meadows  in the Yosemite high country. Friction climbing doesn't have any sort of hard positive edges. You're climbing on little dimples and nubbins in the rock. The most friction you have is when you first put your hand or your foot on the rock. And then from that point on  you're basically falling. So momentum is good. Don't stop. Rule number three  have a plan. This is a climb called the Naked Edge  in El Dorado Canyon  outside of Boulder. This climber is on the last pitch of it. He's actually right about where I fell. There is about       feet of air below him. And all the hard pitches are actually below him. Often what happens is you're planning so hard for like   How do I get through the hardest part  How do I get through the hardest part   And then what happens  You get to the last pitch. It's easy. And you're completely flamed out. Don't do it. You have to plan ahead to get to the top. But you also can't forget that each individual move you have to be able to complete. This is a climb called the Dike Route  on Pywjack Dome  up in the Yosemite high country. The interesting thing about this climb is it's not that hard. But if you're the leader on it  at the hardest move  you're looking at about     foot fall  onto some low angle slabs. So you've got to focus. You don't want to stop in the middle like Coleridge's Kubla Kahn. You've got to keep going. Rule number five  know how to rest. It's amazing. The best climbers are the ones that in the most extreme situations can get their bodies into some position where they can rest  regroup  calm themselves  focus  and keep going. This is a climb in the Needles  again in California. Fear really sucks because what it means is you're not focusing on what you're doing. You're focusing on the consequences of failing at what you're doing because any given move should require all your concentration and thought processes to execute it effectively. One of the things in climbing is  most people sort of take it straight on. And they follow the most obvious solution. This is the Devils Tower in Wyoming  which is a columnar basalt formation that most of you probably know from  Close Encounters.  With this  typically crack climbers would put their hands in and their toes in and just start climbing. The cracks are too small to get your toes into so the only way to climb is using your fingertips in the cracks  and using opposing pressure and forcing yourself up. Rule number eight  strength doesn't always equal success. In the    years I've been a climbing guide and taught on indoor walls  and stuff like that  the most important thing I've learned was  guys will always try to do pull ups. Beginning guys  it's like  they thrash  they thrash  they get    feet up    and they can do about    pull ups right    And then they just flame out. Women are much more in balance because they don't have that idea that they're going to be able to do     pull ups. They think about how to get the weight over their feet because it's sort of natural    they carry you all day long. So balance is really critical  and keeping your weight on your feet  which is your strongest muscle. And of course there is rule number nine. I came up with rule number nine after I actually didn't plan for a fall  and went about    feet and cracked a rib. Once you get to that point where you know it's going to happen  you need to start thinking about how you're going to let go because that is the critical piece of not getting hurt    how you're going to fall onto the rope  or if you're climbing without a rope  fall to a place where you can actually control the fall. So don't hang on till the bitter end. Thank you very much. I'm here today  as June said  to talk about a project that my twin sister and I have been doing for the past three and half years. We're crocheting a coral reef. And it's a project that we've actually been now joined by hundreds of people around the world  who are doing it with us. Indeed thousands of people have actually been involved in this project  in many of its different aspects. It's a project that now reaches across three continents  and its roots go into the fields of mathematics  marine biology  feminine handicraft and environmental activism. It's true. It's also a project that in a very beautiful way  the development of this has actually paralleled the evolution of life on earth  which is a particularly lovely thing to be saying right here in February         which  as one of our previous speakers told us  is the    th anniversary of the birth of Charles Darwin. All of this I'm going to get to in the next    minutes  I hope. But let me first begin by showing you some pictures of what this thing looks like. Just to give you an idea of scale  that installation there is about six feet across  and the tallest models are about two or three feet high. This is some more images of it. That one on the right is about five feet high. The work involves hundreds of different crochet models. And indeed there are now thousands and thousands of models that people have contributed all over the world as part of this. The totality of this project involves tens of thousands of hours of human labor       percent of it done by women. On the right hand side  that bit there is part of an installation that is about    feet long. My sister and I started this project in      because in that year  at least in the science press  there was a lot of talk about global warming  and the effect that global warming was having on coral reefs. Corals are very delicate organisms  and they are devastated by any rise in sea temperatures. It causes these vast bleaching events that are the first signs of corals of being sick. And if the bleaching doesn't go away    if the temperatures don't go down    reefs start to die. A great deal of this has been happening in the Great Barrier Reef  particularly in coral reefs all over the world. This is our invocation in crochet of a bleached reef. We have a new organization together called The Institute for Figuring  which is a little organization we started to promote  to do projects about the aesthetic and poetic dimensions of science and mathematics. And I went and put a little announcement up on our site  asking for people to join us in this enterprise. To our surprise  one of the first people who called was the Andy Warhol Museum. And they said they were having an exhibition about artists' response to global warming  and they'd like our coral reef to be part of it. I laughed and said   Well we've only just started it  you can have a little bit of it.  So in      we had an exhibition  a small exhibition of this crochet reef. And then some people in Chicago came along and they said   In late       the theme of the Chicago Humanities Festival is global warming. And we've got this       square foot gallery and we want you to fill it with your reef.  And I  naively by this stage  said   Oh  yes  sure.  Now I say  naively  because actually my profession is as a science writer. What I do is I write books about the cultural history of physics. I've written books about the history of space  the history of physics and religion  and I write articles for people like the New York Times and the L.A. Times. So I had no idea what it meant to fill a       square foot gallery. So I said yes to this proposition. And I went home  and I told my sister Christine. And she nearly had a fit because Christine is a professor at one of L.A.'s major art colleges  CalArts  and she knew exactly what it meant to fill a       square foot gallery. She thought I'd gone off my head. But she went into crochet overdrive. And to cut a long story short  eight months later we did fill the Chicago Cultural Center's       square foot gallery. By this stage the project had taken on a viral dimension of its own  which got completely beyond us. The people in Chicago decided that as well as exhibiting our reefs  what they wanted to do was have the local people there make a reef. So we went and taught the techniques. We did workshops and lectures. And the people in Chicago made a reef of their own. And it was exhibited alongside ours. There were hundreds of people involved in that. We got invited to do the whole thing in New York  and in London  and in Los Angeles. In each of these cities  the local citizens  hundreds and hundreds of them  have made a reef. And more and more people get involved in this  most of whom we've never met. So the whole thing has sort of morphed into this organic  ever evolving creature  that's actually gone way beyond Christine and I. Now some of you are sitting here thinking   What planet are these people on  Why on earth are you crocheting a reef  Woolenness and wetness aren't exactly two concepts that go together. Why not chisel a coral reef out of marble  Cast it in bronze.  But it turns out there is a very good reason why we are crocheting it because many organisms in coral reefs have a very particular kind of structure. The frilly crenulated forms that you see in corals  and kelps  and sponges and nudibranchs  is a form of geometry known as hyperbolic geometry. And the only way that mathematicians know how to model this structure is with crochet. It happens to be a fact. It's almost impossible to model this structure any other way  and it's almost impossible to do it on computers. So what is this hyperbolic geometry that corals and sea slugs embody  The next few minutes is  we're all going to get raised up to the level of a sea slug. This sort of geometry revolutionized mathematics when it was first discovered in the   th century. But not until      did mathematicians actually understand how they could model it. In      a mathematician at Cornell  Daina Taimina  made the discovery that this structure could actually be done in knitting and crochet. The first one she did was knitting. But you get too many stitches on the needle. So she quickly realized crochet was the better thing. But what she was doing was actually making a model of a mathematical structure  that many mathematicians had thought it was actually impossible to model. And indeed they thought that anything like this structure was impossible per se. Some of the best mathematicians spent hundreds of years trying to prove that this structure was impossible. So what is this impossible hyperbolic structure  Before hyperbolic geometry  mathematicians knew about two kinds of space  Euclidean space  and spherical space. And they have different properties. Mathematicians like to characterize things by being formalist. You all have a sense of what a flat space is  Euclidean space is. But mathematicians formalize this in a particular way. And what they do is  they do it through the concept of parallel lines. So here we have a line and a point outside the line. And Euclid said   How can I define parallel lines  I ask the question  how many lines can I draw through the point but never meet the original line   And you all know the answer. Does someone want to shout it out  One. Great. Okay. That's our definition of a parallel line. It's a definition really of Euclidean space. But there is another possibility that you all know of  spherical space. Think of the surface of a sphere    just like a beach ball  the surface of the Earth. I have a straight line on my spherical surface. And I have a point outside the line. How many straight lines can I draw through the point but never meet the original line  What do we mean to talk about a straight line on a curved surface  Now mathematicians have answered that question. They've understood there is a generalized concept of straightness  it's called a geodesic. And on the surface of a sphere  a straight line is the biggest possible circle you can draw. So it's like the equator or the lines of longitude. So we ask the question again   How many straight lines can I draw through the point  but never meet the original line   Does someone want to guess  Zero. Very good. Now mathematicians thought that was the only alternative. It's a bit suspicious isn't it  There is two answers to the question so far  Zero and one. Two answers  There may possibly be a third alternative. To a mathematician if there are two answers  and the first two are zero and one  there is another number that immediately suggests itself as the third alternative. Does anyone want to guess what it is  Infinity. You all got it right. Exactly. There is  there's a third alternative. This is what it looks like. There's a straight line  and there is an infinite number of lines that go through the point and never meet the original line. This is the drawing. This nearly drove mathematicians bonkers because  like you  they're sitting there feeling bamboozled. Thinking  how can that be  You're cheating. The lines are curved. But that's only because I'm projecting it onto a flat surface. Mathematicians for several hundred years had to really struggle with this. How could they see this  What did it mean to actually have a physical model that looked like this  It's a bit like this  imagine that we'd only ever encountered Euclidean space. Then our mathematicians come along and said   There's this thing called a sphere  and the lines come together at the north and south pole.  But you don't know what a sphere looks like. And someone that comes along and says   Look here's a ball.  And you go   Ah  I can see it. I can feel it. I can touch it. I can play with it.  And that's exactly what happened when Daina Taimina in       showed that you could crochet models in hyperbolic space. Here is this diagram in crochetness. I've stitched Euclid's parallel postulate on to the surface. And the lines look curved. But look  I can prove to you that they're straight because I can take any one of these lines  and I can fold along it. And it's a straight line. So here  in wool  through a domestic feminine art  is the proof that the most famous postulate in mathematics is wrong. And you can stitch all sorts of mathematical theorems onto these surfaces. The discovery of hyperbolic space ushered in the field of mathematics that is called non Euclidean geometry. And this is actually the field of mathematics that underlies general relativity and is actually ultimately going to show us about the shape of the universe. So there is this direct line between feminine handicraft  Euclid and general relativity. Now  I said that mathematicians thought that this was impossible. Here's two creatures who've never heard of Euclid's parallel postulate    didn't know it was impossible to violate  and they're simply getting on with it. They've been doing it for hundreds of millions of years. I once asked the mathematicians why it was that mathematicians thought this structure was impossible when sea slugs have been doing it since the Silurian age. Their answer was interesting. They said   Well I guess there aren't that many mathematicians sitting around looking at sea slugs.  And that's true. But it also goes deeper than that. It also says a whole lot of things about what mathematicians thought mathematics was  what they thought it could and couldn't do  what they thought it could and couldn't represent. Even mathematicians  who in some sense are the freest of all thinkers  literally couldn't see not only the sea slugs around them  but the lettuce on their plate    because lettuces  and all those curly vegetables  they also are embodiments of hyperbolic geometry. And so in some sense they literally  they had such a symbolic view of mathematics  they couldn't actually see what was going on on the lettuce in front of them. It turns out that the natural world is full of hyperbolic wonders. And so  too  we've discovered that there is an infinite taxonomy of crochet hyperbolic creatures. We started out  Chrissy and I and our contributors  doing the simple mathematically perfect models. But we found that when we deviated from the specific setness of the mathematical code that underlies it    the simple algorithm crochet three  increase one    when we deviated from that and made embellishments to the code  the models immediately started to look more natural. And all of our contributors  who are an amazing collection of people around the world  do their own embellishments. As it were  we have this ever evolving  crochet taxonomic tree of life. Just as the morphology and the complexity of life on earth is never ending  little embellishments and complexifications in the DNA code lead to new things like giraffes  or orchids    so too  do little embellishments in the crochet code lead to new and wondrous creatures in the evolutionary tree of crochet life. So this project really has taken on this inner organic life of its own. There is the totality of all the people who have come to it. And their individual visions  and their engagement with this mathematical mode. We have these technologies. We use them. But why  What's at stake here  What does it matter  For Chrissy and I  one of the things that's important here is that these things suggest the importance and value of embodied knowledge. We live in a society that completely tends to valorize symbolic forms of representation    algebraic representations  equations  codes. We live in a society that's obsessed with presenting information in this way  teaching information in this way. But through this sort of modality  crochet  other plastic forms of play    people can be engaged with the most abstract  high powered  theoretical ideas  the kinds of ideas that normally you have to go to university departments to study in higher mathematics  which is where I first learned about hyperbolic space. But you can do it through playing with material objects. One of the ways that we've come to think about this is that what we're trying to do with the Institute for Figuring and projects like this  we're trying to have kindergarten for grown ups. And kindergarten was actually a very formalized system of education  established by a man named Friedrich Froebel  who was a crystallographer in the   th century. He believed that the crystal was the model for all kinds of representation. He developed a radical alternative system of engaging the smallest children with the most abstract ideas through physical forms of play. And he is worthy of an entire talk on his own right. The value of education is something that Froebel championed  through plastic modes of play. We live in a society now where we have lots of think tanks  where great minds go to think about the world. They write these great symbolic treatises called books  and papers  and op ed articles. We want to propose  Chrissy and I  through The Institute for Figuring  another alternative way of doing things  which is the play tank. And the play tank  like the think tank  is a place where people can go and engage with great ideas. But what we want to propose  is that the highest levels of abstraction  things like mathematics  computing  logic  etc.    all of this can be engaged with  not just through purely cerebral algebraic symbolic methods  but by literally  physically playing with ideas. Thank you very much. When I was five years old I fell in love with airplanes. Now I'm talking about the '  s. In the '  s an airplane had two wings and a round motor  and was always flown by a guy who looked like Cary Grant. He had high leather boots  jodhpurs  an old leather jacket  a wonderful helmet and those marvelous goggles    and  inevitably  a white scarf  to flow in the wind. He'd always walk up to his airplane in a kind of saunter  devil may care saunter  flick the cigarette away  grab the girl waiting here  give her a kiss. And then mount his airplane  maybe for the last time. Of course I always wondered what would happen if he'd kissed the airplane first. But this was real romance to me. Everything about flying in those years  which was    you have to stop and think for a moment    was probably the most advanced technological thing going on at the time. So as a youngster  I tried to get close to this by drawing airplanes  constantly drawing airplanes. It's the way I got a part of this romance. And of course  in a way  when I say romance  I mean in part the aesthetics of that whole situation. I think the word is the holistic experience revolving around a product. The product was that airplane. But it built a romance. Even the parts of the airplane had French names. Ze fuselage  ze empanage  ze nessal. You know  from a romance language. So that it was something that just got into your spirit. It did mine. And I decided I had to get closer than just drawing fantasy airplanes. I wanted to build airplanes. So I built model airplanes. And I found that in doing the model airplanes the appearance drawings were not enough. You couldn't transfer those to the model itself. If you wanted it to fly you had to learn the discipline of flying. You had to learn about aeronautics. You had to learn what made an airplane stay in the air. And of course  as a model in those years  you couldn't control it. So it had to be self righting  and stay up without crashing. So I had to give up the approach of drawing the fantasy shapes and convert it to technical drawings    the shape of the wing  the shape of the fuselage and so on    and build an airplane over these drawings that I knew followed some of the principles of flying. And in so doing  I could produce a model that would fly  stay in the air. And it had  once it was in the air  some of this romance that I was in love with. Well the act of drawing airplanes led me to  when I had the opportunity to choose a course in school  led me to sign up for aeronautical engineering. And when I was sitting in classes    in which no one asked me to draw an airplane    to my surprise. I had to learn mathematics and mechanics and all this sort of thing. I'd wile away my time drawing airplanes in the class. One day a young man looked over my shoulder  he said   You draw very well. You should be in the art department.  And I said   Why   And he said   Well for one thing  there are more girls there.  So my romance was temporarily shifted. And I went into art because they appreciated drawing. Studied painting  didn't do very well at that. Went through design  some architecture. Eventually hired myself out as a designer. And for the following    years  living in Italy  living in America  I doled out a piece of this romance to anybody who'd pay for it    this sense  this aesthetic feeling  for the experience revolving around a designed object. And it exists. Any of you who rode the automobiles    was it yesterday     at the track  you know the romance revolving around those high performance cars. Well in    years I was mostly putting out pieces of this romance and not getting a lot back in because design on call doesn't always connect you with a circumstance in which you can produce things of this nature. So after    years I began to feel as though I was running dry. And I quit. And I started up a very small operation    went from    people to one  in an effort to rediscover my innocence. I wanted to get back where the romance was. And I couldn't choose airplanes because they had gotten sort of unromantic at that point  even though I'd done a lot of airplane work  on the interiors. So I chose furniture. And I chose chairs specifically because I knew something about them. I'd designed a lot of chairs  over the years for tractors and trucks and submarines    all kinds of things. But not office chairs. So I started doing that. And I found that there were ways to duplicate the same approach that I used to use on the airplane. Only this time  instead of the product being shaped by the wind  it was shaped by the human body. So the discipline was    as in the airplane you learn a lot about how to deal with the air  for a chair you have to learn a lot about how to deal with the body  and what the body needs  wants  indicates it needs. And that's the way  ultimately after some ups and downs  I ended up designing the chair I'm going to show you. I should say one more thing. When I was doing those model airplanes  I did everything. I conceived the kind of airplane. I basically engineered it. I built it. And I flew it. And that's the way I work now. When I started this chair it was not a preconceived notion. Design nowadays  if you mean it  you don't start with styling sketches. I started with a lot of loose ideas  roughly eight or nine years ago. And the loose ideas had something to do with what I knew happened with people in the office  at the work place    people who worked  and used task seating  a great many of them sitting in front of a computer all day long. And I felt  the one thing they don't need  is a chair that interferes with their main reason for sitting there. So I took the approach that the chair should do as much for them as humanly possible or as mechanistically possible so that they didn't have to fuss with it. So my idea was that  instead of sitting down and reaching for a lot of controls  that you would sit on the chair  and it would automatically balance your weight against the force required to recline. Now that may not mean a lot to some of you. But you know most good chairs do recline because it's beneficial to open up this joint between your legs and your upper body for better breathing and better flow. So that if you sit down on my chair  whether you're five feet tall or six foot six  it always deals with your weight and transfers the amount of force required to recline in a way that you don't have to look for something to adjust. I'll tell you right up front  this is a trade off. There are drawbacks to this. One is  you can't accommodate everybody. There are some very light people  some extremely heavy people  maybe people with a lot of bulk up top. They begin to fall off the end of your chart. But the compromise  I felt  was in my favor because most people don't adjust their chairs. They will sit in them forever. I had somebody on the bus out to the racetrack tell me about his sister calling him. He said she had one of the new  better chairs. She said   Oh I love it.  She said   But it's too high.  So he said   Well I'll come over and look at it.  He came over and looked at it. He reached down. He pulled a lever. And the chair sank down. She said   Oh it's wonderful. How did you do that   And he showed her the lever. Well  that's typical of a lot of us working in chairs. And why should you get a    page manual about how to run a chair  I had one for a wristwatch once.    pages. Anyway  I felt that it was important that you didn't have to make an adjustment in order to get this kind of action. The other thing I felt was that armrests had never really been properly approached from the standpoint of how much of an aid they could be to your work life. But I felt it was too much to ask to have to adjust each individual armrest in order to get it where you wanted. So I spent a long time. I said I worked eight or nine years on it. And each of these things went along sort of in parallel but incrementally were a problem of their own. I worked a long time on figuring out how to move the arms over a much greater arc    that is up and down    and make them a lot easier  so that you didn't have to use a button. And so after many trials  many failures  we came up with a very simple arrangement in which we could just move one arm or the other. And they go up easily. And stop where you want. You can put them down  essentially out of the way. No arms at all. Or you can pull them up where you want them. And this was another thing that I felt  while not nearly as romantic as Cary Grant  nevertheless begins to grab a little bit of aesthetic operation  aesthetic performance into a product. The next area that was of interest to me was the fact that reclining was a very important factor. And the more you can recline  in a way  the better it is. The more the angle between here and here opens up    and nowadays  with a screen in front of you  you don't want to have your eye drop too far in the recline  so we keep it at more or less the same level    but you transfer weight off your tailbones. Would everybody put their hand under their bottom and feel their tailbone  You feel that bone under there  Just your own. There's two of them  one on either side. All the weight of your upper torso    your arms  your head    goes right down through your back  your spine  into those bones when you sit. And that's a lot of load. Just relieving your arms with armrests takes    percent of that load off. Now that  if your spine is not held in a good position  will help bend your spine the wrong way  and so on. So to unload that great weight    if that indeed exists    you can recline. When you recline you take away a lot of that load off your bottom end  and transfer it to your back. At the same time  as I say  you open up this joint. And breathability is good. But to do that  if you have any amount of recline  it gets to the point where you need a headrest because nearly always  automatically hold your head in a vertical position  see  As I recline  my head says more or less vertical. Well if you're reclined a great deal  you have to use muscle force to hold your head there. So that's where a headrest comes in. Now headrest is a challenge because you want it to adjust enough so that it'll fit  you know  a tall guy and a short girl. So here we are. I've got five inches of adjustment here in order to get the headrest in the right place. But then I knew from experience and looking around in offices where there were chairs with headrests that nobody would ever bother to reach back and turn a knob and adjust the headrest to put it in position. And you need it in a different position when you're upright  then when you're reclined. So I knew that had to be solved  and had to be automatic. So if you watch this chair as I recline  the headrest comes up to meet my neck. Ideally you want to put the head support in the cranial area  right there. So that part of it took a long time to work out. And there is a variety of other things  the shape of the cushions  the gel we put. We stole the idea from bicycle seats  and put gel in the cushions and in the armrests to absorb point load    distributes the loading so you don't get hard spots. You cant hit your elbow on bottom. And I did want to demonstrate the fact that the chair can accommodate people. While you're sitting in it you can adjust it down for the five footer  or you can adjust it for the six foot six guy    all within the scope of a few simple adjustments. I want to talk about the election. For the first time in the United States  a predominantly white group of voters voted for an African American candidate for President. And in fact Barack Obama did quite well. He won     electoral votes. And he won about    million popular votes more than any other presidential candidate    of any race  of any party    in history. If you compare how Obama did against how John Kerry had done four years earlier    Democrats really like seeing this transition here  where almost every state becomes bluer  becomes more democratic    even states Obama lost  like out west  those states became more blue. In the south  in the northeast  almost everywhere but with a couple of exceptions here and there. One exception is in Massachusetts. That was John Kerry's home state. No big surprise  Obama couldn't do better than Kerry there. Or in Arizona  which is John McCain's home  Obama didn't have much improvement. But there is also this part of the country  kind of in the middle region here. This kind of Arkansas  Tennessee  Oklahoma  West Virginia region. Now if you look at '    Bill Clinton    the last Democrat to actually win    how he did in '    you see real big differences in this part of the country right here  the kind of Appalachians  Ozarks  highlands region  as I call it     or    point swings from how Bill Clinton did in '   to how Obama did in     . Yes Bill Clinton was from Arkansas  but these are very  very profound differences. So  when we think about parts of the country like Arkansas  you know. There is a book written called   What's the Matter with Kansas   But really the question here    Obama did relatively well in Kansas. He lost badly but every Democrat does. He lost no worse than most people do. But yeah  what's the matter with Arkansas  And when we think of Arkansas we tend to have pretty negative connotations. We think of a bunch of rednecks  quote  unquote  with guns. And we think people like this probably don't want to vote for people who look like this and are named Barack Obama. We think it's a matter of race. And is this fair  Are we kind of stigmatizing people from Arkansas  and this part of the country  And the answer is  it is at least partially fair. We know that race was a factor  and the reason why we know that is because we asked those people. Actually we didn't ask them  but when they conducted exit polls in every state  in    states  out of the     they asked a question  that was pretty direct  about race. They asked this question. In deciding your vote for President today  was the race of the candidate a factor  We're looking for people that said   Yes  race was a factor  moreover it was an important factor  in my decision   and people who voted for John McCain as a result of that factor  maybe in combination with other factors  and maybe alone. We're looking for this behavior among white voters or  really  non black voters. So you see big differences in different parts of the country on this question. In Louisiana  about one in five white voters said   Yes  one of the big reasons why I voted against Barack Obama is because he was an African American.  If those people had voted for Obama  even half of them  Obama would have won Louisiana safely. Same is true with  I think  all of these states you see on the top of the list. Meanwhile  California  New York  we can say   Oh we're enlightened  but you know  certainly a much lower incidence of this admitted  I suppose  manifestation of racially based voting. Here is the same data on a map. You kind of see the relationship between the redder states of where more people responded and said   Yes  Barack Obama's race was a problem for me.  You see  comparing the map to '    you see an overlap here. This really seems to explain why Barack Obama did worse in this one part of the country. So we have to ask why. Is racism predictable in some way  Is there something driving this  Is it just about some weird stuff that goes on in Arkansas that we don't understand  and Kentucky  Or are there more systematic factors at work  And so we can look at a bunch of different variables. These are things that economists and political scientists look at all the time    things like income  and religion  education. Which of these seem to drive this manifestation of racism in this big national experiment we had on November  th  And there are a couple of these that have strong predictive relationships  one of which is education  where you see the states with the fewest years of schooling per adult are in red  and you see this part of the country  the kind of Appalachians region  is less educated. It's just a fact. And you see the relationship there with the racially based voting patterns. The other variable that's important is the type of neighborhood that you live in. States that are more rural    even to some extent of the states like New Hampshire and Maine    they exhibit a little bit of this racially based voting against Barack Obama. So it's the combination of these two things  it's education and the type of neighbors that you have  which we'll talk about more in a moment. And the thing about states like Arkansas and Tennessee is that they're both very rural  and they are educationally impoverished. So yes  racism is predictable. These things  among maybe other variables  but these things seem to predict it. We're going to drill down a little bit more now  into something called the General Social Survey. This is conducted by the University of Chicago every other year. And they ask a series of really interesting questions. In      they had particularly interesting questions about racial attitudes. One simple question they asked is   Does anyone of the opposite race live in your neighborhood   We can see in different types of communities that the results are quite different. In cites  about    percent of people have someone whom they consider a neighbor of another race  but in rural communities  only about    percent. Probably because if you live on a farm  you might not have a lot of neighbors  period. But nevertheless  you're not having a lot of interaction with people who are unlike you. So what we're going to do now is take the white people in the survey and split them between those who have black neighbors    or  really  some neighbor of another race    and people who have only white neighbors. And we see in some variables in terms of political attitudes  not a lot of difference. This was eight years ago  some people were more Republican back then. But you see Democrats versus Republican  not a big difference based on who your neighbors are. And even some questions about race    for example affirmative action  which is kind of a political question  a policy question about race  if you will    not much difference here. Affirmative action is not very popular frankly  with white voters  period. But people with black neighbors and people with mono racial neighborhoods feel no differently about it really. But if you probe a bit deeper and get a bit more personal if you will   Do you favor a law banning interracial marriage   There is a big difference. People who don't have neighbors of a different race are about twice as likely to oppose interracial marriage as people who do. Just based on who lives in your immediate neighborhood around you. And likewise they asked  not in       but in the same survey in        Would you not vote for a qualified black president   You see people without neighbors who are African American who were much more likely to say   That would give me a problem.  So it's really not even about urban versus rural. It's about who you live with. Racism is predictable. And it's predicted by interaction or lack thereof with people unlike you  people of other races. So if you want to address it  the goal is to facilitate interaction with people of other races. I have a couple of very obvious  I suppose  ideas for maybe how to do that. I'm a big fan of cities. Especially if we have cites that are diverse and sustainable  and can support people of different ethnicities and different income groups. I think cities facilitate more of the kind of networking  the kind of casual interaction than you might have on a daily basis. But also not everyone wants to live in a city  certainly not a city like New York. So we can think more about things like street grids. This is the neighborhood where I grew up in East Lansing  Michigan. It's a traditional Midwestern community  which means you have real grid. You have real neighborhoods and real trees  and real streets you can walk on. And you interact a lot with your neighbors    people you like  people you might not know. And as a result it's a very tolerant community  which is different  I think  than something like this  which is in Schaumburg  Illinois  where every little set of houses has their own cul de sac and drive through Starbucks and stuff like that. I think that actually this type of urban design  which became more prevalent in the     s and     s    I think there is a relationship between that and the country becoming more conservative under Ronald Reagan. But also here is another idea we have    is an intercollegiate exchange program where you have students going from New York abroad. But frankly there are enough differences within the country now where maybe you can take a bunch of kids from NYU  have them go study for a semester at the University of Arkansas  and vice versa. Do it at the high school level. Literally there are people who might be in school in Arkansas or Tennessee and might never interact in a positive affirmative way with someone from another part of the country  or of another racial group. I think part of the education variable we talked about before is the networking experience you get when you go to college where you do get a mix of people that you might not interact with otherwise. But the point is  this is all good news  because when something is predictable  it is what I call designable. You can start thinking about solutions to solving that problem  even if the problem is pernicious and as intractable as racism. If we understand the root causes of the behavior and where it manifests itself and where it doesn't  we can start to design solutions to it. So that's all I have to say. Thank you very much. So I'm here to tell you a story of success from Africa. A year and a half ago  four of the five people who are full time members at Ushahidi  which means  testimony  in Swahili  were TED Fellows. A year ago in Kenya we had post election violence. And in that time we prototyped and built  in about three days  a system that would allow anybody with a mobile phone to send in information and reports on what was happening around them. We took what we knew about Africa  the default device  the mobile phone  as our common denominator  and went from there. We got reports like this. This is just a couple of them from January   th  last year. And our system was rudimentary. It was very basic. It was a mash up that used data that we collected from people  and we put it on our map. But then we decided we needed to do something more. We needed to take what we had built and create a platform out of it so that it could be used elsewhere in the world. And so there is a team of developers from all over Africa  who are part of this team now    from Ghana  from Malawi  from Kenya. There is even some from the U.S. We're building for smartphones  so that it can be used in the developed world  as well as the developing world. We are realizing that this is true. If it works in Africa then it will work anywhere. And so we build for it in Africa first and then we move to the edges. It's now been deployed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It's being used by NGOs all over East Africa  small NGOs doing their own little projects. Just this last month it was deployed by Al Jazeera in Gaza. But that's actually not what I'm here to talk about. I'm here to talk about the next big thing  because what we're finding out is that we have this capacity to report eyewitness accounts of what's going on in real time. We're seeing this in events like Mumbai recently  where it's so much easier to report now than it is to consume it. There is so much information  what do you do  This is the Twitter reports for over three days just covering Mumbai. How do you decide what is important  What is the veracity level of what you're looking at  So what we find is that there is this great deal of wasted crisis information because there is just too much information for us to actually do anything with right now. And what we're actually really concerned with is this first three hours. What we are looking at is the first three hours. How do we deal with that information that is coming in  You can't understand what is actually happening. On the ground and around the world people are still curious  and trying to figure out what is going on. But they don't know. So what we built of course  Ushahidi  is crowdsourcing this information. You see this with Twitter  too. You get this information overload. So you've got a lot of information. That's great. But now what  So we think that there is something interesting we can do here. And we have a small team who is working on this. We think that we can actually create a crowdsourced filter. Take the crowd and apply them to the information. And by rating it and by rating the different people who submit information  we can get refined results and weighted results. So that we have a better understanding of the probability of something being true or not. This is the kind of innovation that is  quite frankly    it's interesting that it's coming from Africa. It's coming from places that you wouldn't expect. From young  smart developers. And it's a community around it that has decided to build this. So  thank you very much. And we are very happy to be part of the TED family. I'm going to read a few strips. These are  most of these are from a monthly page I do in and architecture and design magazine called Metropolis. And the first story is called  The Faulty Switch.  Another beautifully designed new building ruined by the sound of a common wall light switch. It's fine during the day when the main rooms are flooded with sunlight. But at dusk everything changes. The architect spent hundreds of hours designing the burnished brass switchplates for his new office tower. And then left it to a contractor to install these    cent switches behind them. We know instinctively where to reach when we enter a dark room. We automatically throw the little nub of plastic upward. But the sound we are greeted with  as the room is bathed in the simulated glow of late afternoon light  recalls to mind a dirty men's room in the rear of a Greek coffee shop. This sound colors our first impression of any room  it can't be helped. But where does this sound  commonly described as a click  come from  Is it simply the byproduct of a crude mechanical action  Or is it an imitation of one half the set of sounds we make to express disappointment  The often dental consonant of no Indo European language. Or is it the amplified sound of a synapse firing in the brain of a cockroach  In the     s they tried their best to muffle this sound with mercury switches and silent knob controls. But today these improvements seem somehow inauthentic. The click is the modern triumphal clarion proceeding us through life  announcing our entry into every lightless room. The sound made flicking a wall switch off is of a completely different nature. It has a deep melancholy ring. Children don't like it. It's why they leave lights on around the house.  Laughter  Adults find it comforting. But wouldn't it be an easy matter to wire a wall switch so that it triggers the muted horn of a steam ship  Or the recorded crowing of a rooster  Or the distant peel of thunder  Thomas Edison went through thousands of unlikely substances before he came upon the right one for the filament of his electric light bulb. Why have we settled so quickly for the sound of its switch  That's the end of that. The next story is called  In Praise of the Taxpayer.  That so many of the city's most venerable taxpayers have survived yet another commercial building boom  is cause for celebration. These one or two story structures  designed to yield only enough income to cover the taxes on the land on which they stand  were not meant to be permanent buildings. Yet for one reason or another they have confounded the efforts of developers to be combined into lots suitable for high rise construction. Although they make no claim to architectural beauty  they are  in their perfect temporariness  a delightful alternative to the large scale structures that might someday take their place. The most perfect examples occupy corner lots. They offer a pleasant respite from the high density development around them. A break of light and air  an architectural biding of time. So buried in signage are these structures  that it often takes a moment to distinguish the modern specially constructed taxpayer from its neighbor  the small commercial building from an earlier century  whose upper floors have been sealed  and whose groundfloor space now functions as a taxpayer. The few surfaces not covered by signs are often clad in a distinctive  dark green gray  striated aluminum siding. Take out sandwich shops  film processing drop offs  peep shows and necktie stores. Now these provisional structures have  in some cases  remained standing for the better part of a human lifetime. The temporary building is a triumph of modern industrial organization  a healthy sublimation of the urge to build  and proof that not every architectural idea need be set in stone. That's the end. And the next story is called   On the Human Lap.  For the ancient Egyptians the lap was a platform upon which to place the earthly possessions of the dead       cubits from foot to knee. It was not until the   th century that an Italian painter recognized the lap as a Grecian temple  upholstered in flesh and cloth. Over the next     years we see the infant Christ go from a sitting to a standing position on the Virgin's lap  and then back again. Every child recapitulates this ascension  straddling one or both legs  sitting sideways  or leaning against the body. From there  to the modern ventriloquist's dummy  is but a brief moment in history. You were late for school again this morning. The ventriloquist must first make us believe that a small boy is sitting on his lap. The illusion of speech follows incidentally. What have you got to say for yourself  Jimmy  As adults we admire the lap from a nostalgic distance. We have fading memories of that provisional temple  erected each time an adult sat down. On a crowded bus there was always a lap to sit on. It is children and teenage girls who are most keenly aware of its architectural beauty. They understand the structural integrity of a deep avuncular lap  as compared to the shaky arrangement of a neurotic niece in high heels. The relationship between the lap and its owner is direct and intimate. I envision a    story      unit residential high rise    a reason to consider the mental health of any architect before granting an important commission. The bathrooms and kitchens will  of course  have no windows. The lap of luxury is an architectural construct of childhood  which we seek  in vain  as adults  to employ. That's the end. The next story is called  The Haverpiece Collection  A nondescript warehouse  visible for a moment from the northbound lanes of the Prykushko Expressway  serves as the temporary resting place for the Haverpiece collection of European dried fruit. The profound convolutions on the surface of a dried cherry. The foreboding sheen of an extra large date. Do you remember wandering as a child through those dark wooden storefront galleries  Where everything was displayed in poorly labeled roach proof bins. Pears dried in the form of genital organs. Apricot halves like the ears of cherubim. In      the unsold stock was purchased by Maurice Haverpiece  a wealthy prune juice bottler  and consolidated to form the core collection. As an art form it lies somewhere between still life painting and plumbing. Upon his death in       a quarter of the items were sold off for compote to a high class hotel restaurant. Unsuspecting guests were served stewed turn of the century Turkish figs for breakfast. The rest of the collection remains here  stored in plain brown paper bags until funds can be raised to build a permanent museum and study center. A shoe made of apricot leather for the daughter of a czar. That's the end. Thank you. The first half of the   th century was an absolute disaster in human affairs  a cataclysm. We had the First World War  the Great Depression  the Second World War and the rise of the communist nations. And each one of these forces split the world  tore the world apart  divided the world. And they threw up walls    political walls  trade walls  transportation walls  communication walls  iron curtains    which divided peoples and nations. It was only in the second half of the   th century that we slowly began to pull ourselves out of this abyss. Trade walls began to come tumbling down. Here are some data on tariffs  starting at    percent  coming down to less than   percent. We globalized the world. And what does that mean  It means that we extended cooperation across national boundaries  we made the world more cooperative. Transportation walls came tumbling down. You know in      the typical ship carried       to        tons worth of goods. Today a container ship can carry         tons  it can be manned with a smaller crew  and unloaded faster than ever before. Communication walls  I don't have to tell you    the Internet    have come tumbling down. And of course the iron curtains  political walls have come tumbling down. Now all of this has been tremendous for the world. Trade has increased. Here is just a little bit of data. In       exports from China to the United States     billion dollars. By       over     billion dollars. And perhaps most remarkably  at the beginning of the   st century  really for the first time in modern history  growth extended to almost all parts of the world. So China  I've already mentioned  beginning around       around the time of the death of Mao  growth    ten percent a year. Year after year after year  absolutely incredible. Never before in human history have so many people been raised out of such great poverty as happened in China. China is the world's greatest anti poverty program over the last three decades. India  starting a little bit later  but in       begetting tremendous growth. Incomes at that time less than        per year. And over the next    years have almost tripled. Growth of six percent a year. Absolutely incredible. Now Africa  Sub Saharan Africa    Sub Saharan Africa has been the area of the world most resistant to growth. And we can see the tragedy of Africa in the first few bars here. Growth was negative. People were actually getting poorer than their parents  and sometimes even poorer than their grandparents had been. But at the end of the   th century  the beginning of the   st century  we saw growth in Africa. And I think  as you'll see  there's reasons for optimism  because I believe that the best is yet to come. Now why. On the cutting edge today it's new ideas which are driving growth. And by that I mean it's products for which the research and development costs are really high  and the manufacturing costs are low. More than ever before it is these types of ideas which are driving growth on the cutting edge. Now ideas have this amazing property. Thomas Jefferson  I think  really expressed this quite well. He said   He who receives an idea from me receives instruction himself  without lessening mine. As he who lights his candle at mine receives light without darkening me.  Or to put it slightly differently  one apple feeds one man  but an idea can feed the world. Now this is not new. This is practically not new to TEDsters. This is practically the model of TED. But what is new is that the greater function of ideas is going to drive growth even more than ever before. This provides a reason why trade and globalization are even more important  more powerful than ever before  and are going to increase growth more than ever before. And to explain why this is so  I have a question. Suppose that there are two diseases  one of them is rare  the other one is common  but if they are not treated they are equally severe. If you had to choose  which would you rather have  the common disease or the rare disease  Common  the common    I think that's absolutely right  and why  Because there are more drugs to treat common diseases than there are to treat rare diseases. The reason for this is incentives. It costs about the same to produce a new drug whether that drug treats       people          people  or a million people. But the revenues are much greater if the drug treats a million people. So the incentives are much larger to produce drugs which treat more people. To put this differently  larger markets save lives. In this case misery truly does love company. Now think about the following  if China and India were as rich as the United States is today  the market for cancer drugs would be eight times larger than it is now. Now we are not there yet  but it is happening. As other countries become richer the demand for these pharmaceuticals is going to increase tremendously. And that means an increase incentive to do research and development  which benefits everyone in the world. Larger markets increase the incentive to produce all kinds of ideas  whether it's software  whether it's a computer chip  whether it's a new design. For the Hollywood people in the audience  this even explains why action movies have larger budgets than comedies  it's because action movies translate easier into other languages and other cultures  so the market for those movies is larger. People are willing to invest more  and the budgets are larger. Alright. Well if larger markets increase the incentive to produce new ideas  how do we maximize that incentive  It's by having one world market  by globalizing the world. The way I like to put this is  one idea. Ideas are meant to be shared  so one idea can serve one world  one market. One idea  one world  one market. Well how else can we create new ideas  That's one reason. Globalize trade. How else can we create new ideas  Well  more idea creators. Now idea creators  they come from all walks of life. Artists and innovators    many of the people you've seen on this stage. I'm going to focus on scientists and engineers because I have some data on that  and I'm a data person. Now  today  less than one tenth of one percent of the world's population are scientists and engineers. The United States has been an idea leader. A large fraction of those people are in the United States. But the U.S. is losing its idea leadership. And for that I am very grateful. That is a good thing. It is fortunate that we are becoming less of an idea leader because for too long the United States  and a handful of other developed countries  have shouldered the entire burden of research and development. But consider the following  if the world as a whole were as wealthy as the United States is now there would be more than five times as many scientists and engineers contributing to ideas which benefit everyone  which are shared by everyone. I think of the great Indian mathematician  Ramanujan. How many Ramanujans are there in India today toiling in the fields  barely able to feed themselves  when they could be feeding the world  Now we're not there yet. But it is going to happen in this century. The real tragedy of the last century is this  if you think about the world's population as a giant computer  a massively parallel processor  then the great tragedy has been that billions of our processors have been off line. But in this century China is coming on line. India is coming on line. Africa is coming on line. We will see an Einstein in Africa in this century. Here is just some data. This is China.       less than one million new university students in China per year        over five million. Now think what this means. This means we all benefit when another country gets rich. We should not fear other countries becoming wealthy. That is something that we should embrace    a wealthy China  a wealthy India  a wealthy Africa. We need a greater demand for ideas    those larger markets I was talking about earlier    and a greater supply of ideas for the world. Now you can see some of the reasons why I'm optimistic. Globalization is increasing the demand for ideas  the incentive to create new ideas. Investments in education are increasing the supply of new ideas. In fact if you look at world history you can see some reasons for optimism. From about the beginnings of humanity to       zero economic growth  nothing.      to       maybe a little bit of economic growth  but less in a century than you expect to see in a year today.     s  maybe one percent. Twentieth century  a little bit over two percent. Twenty first century could easily be  .   even higher percent. Even at that rate  by      average GDP per capita in the world will be         . That's not U.S. GDP per capita  which will be over a million  but world GDP per capita            . That's not that far. We won't make it. But some of our grandchildren probably will. And I should say  I think this is a rather modest prediction. In Kurzweilian terms this is gloomy. In Kurzweilian terms I'm like the Eeyore of economic growth. Alright what about problems  What about a great depression  Well let's take a look. Let's take a look at the Great Depression. Here is GDP per capita from      to     . Now let's imagine that you were an economist in       trying to forecast future growth for the United States  not knowing that the economy was about to go off a cliff  not knowing that we were about to enter the greatest economic disaster certainly in the   th century. What would you have predicted  not knowing this  If you had based your prediction  your forecast on      to      you'd have predicted something like this. If you'd been a little more optimistic    say  based upon the Roaring Twenties    you'd have said this. So what actually happened  We went off a cliff but we recovered. In fact in the second half of the   th century growth was even higher than anything you would have predicted based upon the first half of the   th century. So growth can wash away even what appears to be a great depression. Alright. What else  Oil. Oil. This was a big topic. When I was writing up my notes oil was      per barrel. So people were asking a question. They were saying   Is China drinking our milkshake   And there is some truth to this  in the sense that we have something of a finite resource  and increased growth is going to push up demand for that. But I think I don't have to tell this audience that a higher price of oil is not necessarily a bad thing. Moreover  as everyone knows  look    it's energy  not oil  which counts. And higher oil prices mean a greater incentive to invest in energy R D. You can see this in the data. As oil prices go up  energy patents go up. The world is much better equipped to overcome an increase in the price of oil today  than ever in the past  because of what I'm talking about. One idea  one world  one market. So I'm optimistic so long as we hew to these two ideas  to keep globalizing world markets  keep extending cooperation across national boundaries  and keep investing in education. Now the United States has a particularly important role to play in this  to keep our education system globalized  to keep our education system open to students from all over the world  because our education system is the candle that other students come to light their own candles. Now remember here what Jefferson said. Jefferson said   When they come and light their candles at ours  they gain light  and we are not darkened.  But Jefferson wasn't quite right  was he  Because the truth is  when they light their candles at ours  there is twice as much light available for everyone. So my view is  Be optimistic. Spread the ideas. Spread the light. Thank you. This machine  which we all have residing in our skulls  reminds me of an aphorism  of a comment of Woody Allen to ask about what is the very best thing to have within your skull. And it's this machine. And it's constructed for change. It's all about change. It confers on us the ability to do things tomorrow that we can't do today  things today that we couldn't do yesterday. And of course it's born stupid. The last time you were in the presence of a baby    this happens to be my granddaughter  Mitra. Isn't she fabulous  But nonetheless when she popped out despite the fact that her brain had actually been progressing in its development for several months before on the basis of her experiences in the womb    nonetheless she had very limited abilities  as does every infant at the time of normal  natural full term birth. If we were to assay her perceptual abilities  they would be crude. There is no real indication that there is any real thinking going on. In fact there is little evidence that there is any cognitive ability in a very young infant. Infants don't respond to much. There is not really much of an indication in fact that there is a person on board. And they can only in a very primitive way  and in a very limited way control their movements. It would be several months before this infant could do something as simple as reach out and grasp under voluntary control an object and retrieve it  usually to the mouth. And it will be some months beforeward  and we see a long steady progression of the evolution from the first wiggles  to rolling over  and sitting up  and crawling  standing  walking  before we get to that magical point in which we can motate in the world. And yet  when we look forward in the brain we see really remarkable advance. By this age the brain can actually store. It has stored  recorded  can fastly retrieve the meanings of thousands  tens of thousands of objects  actions  and their relationships in the world. And those relationships can in fact be constructed in hundreds of thousands  potentially millions of ways. By this age the brain controls very refined perceptual abilities. And it actually has a growing repertoire of cognitive skills. This brain is very much a thinking machine. And by this age there is absolutely no question that this brain  it has a person on board. And in fact at this age it is substantially controlling its own self development. And by this age we see a remarkable evolution in its capacity to control movement. Now movement has advanced to the point where it can actually control movement simultaneously  in a complex sequence  in complex ways as would be required for example for playing a complicated game  like soccer. Now this boy can bounce a soccer ball on his head. And where this boy comes from  Sao Paulo  Brazil  about    percent of boys of his age have this ability. You could go out into the community in Monterey  and you'd have difficulty finding a boy that has this ability. And if you did he'd probably be from Sao Paulo. That's all another way of saying that our individual skills and abilities are very much shaped by our environments. That environment extends into our contemporary culture  the thing our brain is challenged with. Because what we've done in our personal evolutions is build up a large repertoire of specific skills and abilities that are specific to our own individual histories. And in fact they result in a wonderful differentiation in humankind  in the way that  in fact  no two of us are quite alike. Every one of us has a different set of acquired skills and abilities that all derive out of the plasticity  the adaptability of this really remarkable adaptive machine. In an adult brain of course we've built up a large repertoire of mastered skills and abilities that we can perform more or less automatically from memory  and that define us as acting  moving  thinking creatures. Now we study this  as the nerdy  laboratory  university based scientists that we are  by engaging the brains of animals like rats  or monkeys  or of this particularly curious creature    one of the more bizarre forms of life on earth    to engage them in learning new skills and abilities. And we try to track the changes that occur as the new skill or ability is acquired. In fact we do this in individuals of any age  in these different species    that is to say from infancies  infancy up to adulthood and old age. So we might engage a rat  for example  to acquire a new skill or ability that might involve the rat using its paw to master particular manual grasp behaviors just like we might examine a child and their ability to acquire the sub skills  or the general overall skill of accomplishing something like mastering the ability to read. Or you might look in an older individual who has mastered a complex set of abilities that might relate to reading musical notation or performing the mechanical acts of performance that apply to musical performance. From these studies we defined two great epochs of the plastic history of the brain. The first great epoch is commonly called the  Critical Period.  And that is the period in which the brain is setting up in its initial form its basic processing machinery. This is actually a period of dramatic change in which it doesn't take learning  per se  to drive the initial differentiation of the machinery of the brain. All it takes for example in the sound domain  is exposure to sound. And the brain actually is at the mercy of the sound environment in which it is reared. So for example I can rear an animal in an environment in which there is meaningless dumb sound  a repertoire of sound that I make up  that I make  just by exposure  artificially important to the animal and its young brain. And what I see is that the animal's brain sets up its initial processing of that sound in a form that's idealized  within the limits of its processing achievements to represent it in an organized and orderly way. The sound doesn't have to be valuable to the animal  I could raise the animal in something that could be hypothetically valuable  like the sounds that simulate the sounds of a native language of a child. And I see the brain actually develop a processor that is specialized    specialized for that complex array  a repertoire of sounds. It actually exaggerates their separateness of representation  in multi dimensional neuronal representational terms. Or I can expose the animal to a completely meaningless and destructive sound. I can raise an animal under conditions that would be equivalent to raising a baby under a moderately loud ceiling fan  in the presence of continuous noise. And when I do that I actually specialize the brain to be a master processor for that meaningless sound. And I frustrate its ability to represent any meaningful sound as a consequence. Such things in the early history of babies occur in real babies. And they account for  for example the beautiful evolution of a language specific processor in every normally developing baby. And so they also account for development of defective processing in a substantial population of children who are more limited  as a consequence  in their language abilities at an older age. Now in this early period of plasticity the brain actually changes outside of a learning context. I don't have to be paying attention to what I hear. The input doesn't really have to be meaningful. I don't have to be in a behavioral context. This is required so the brain sets up it's processing so that it can act differentially  so that it can act selectively  so that the creature that wears it  that carries it  can begin to operate on it in a selective way. In the next great epoch of life  which applies for most of life  the brain is actually refining its machinery as it masters a wide repertoire of skills and abilities. And in this epoch  which extends from late in the first year of life to death  it's actually doing this under behavioral control. And that's another way of saying the brain has strategies that define the significance of the input to the brain. And it's focusing on skill after skill  or ability after ability  under specific attentional control. It's a function of whether a goal in a behavior is achieved or whether the individual is rewarded in the behavior. This is actually very powerful. This lifelong capacity for plasticity  for brain change  is powerfully expressed. It is the basis of our real differentiation  one individual from another. You can look down in the brain of an animal that's engaged in a specific skill  and you can witness or document this change on a variety of levels. So here is a very simple experiment. It was actually conducted about five years ago in collaboration with scientists from the University of Provence in Marseilles. It's a very simple experiment where a monkey has been trained in a task that involves it manipulating a tool that's equivalent in its difficulty to a child learning to manipulate or handle a spoon. The monkey actually mastered the task in about     practice tries. So in the beginning the monkey could not perform this task at all. It had a success rate of about one in eight tries. Those tries were elaborate. Each attempt was substantially different from the other. But the monkey gradually developed a strategy. And     or so tries later the monkey is performing it flawlessly    never fails. He's successful in his retrieval of food with this tool every time. At this point the task is being performed in a beautifully stereotyped way  very beautifully regulated and highly repeated  trial to trial. We can look down in the brain of the monkey. And we see that it's distorted. We can track these changes  and have tracked these changes in many such behaviors across time. And here we see the distortion reflected in the map of the skin surfaces of the hand of the monkey. Now this is a map  down in the surface of the brain  in which  in a very elaborate experiment we've reconstructed the responses  location by location  in a highly detailed response mapping of the responses of its neurons. We see here a reconstruction of how the hand is represented in the brain. We've actually distorted the map by the exercise. And that is indicated in the pink. We have a couple fingertip surfaces that are larger. These are the surfaces the monkey is using to manipulate the tool. If we look at the selectivity of responses in the cortex of the monkey  we see that the monkey has actually changed the filter characteristics which represents input from the skin of the fingertips that are engaged. In other words there is still a single  simple representation of the fingertips in this most organized of cortical areas of the surface of the skin of the body. Monkey has like you have. And yet now it's represented in substantially finer grain. The monkey is getting more detailed information from these surfaces. And that is an unknown    unsuspected  maybe  by you    part of acquiring the skill or ability. Now actually we've looked in several different cortical areas in the monkey learning this task. And each one of them changes in ways that are specific to the skill or ability. So for example we can look to the cortical area that represents input that's controlling the posture of the monkey. We look in cortical areas that control specific movements  and the sequences of movements that are required in the behavior  and so forth. They are all remodeled. They all become specialized for the task at hand. There are    or    cortical areas that are changed specifically when you learn a simple skill like this. And that represents in your brain  really massive change. It represents the change in a reliable way of the responses of tens of millions  possibly hundreds of millions of neurons in your brain. It represents changes of hundreds of millions  possibly billions of synaptic connections in your brain. This is constructed by physical change. And the level of construction that occurs is massive. Think about the changes that occur in the brain of a child through the course of acquiring their movement behavior abilities in general. Or acquiring their native language abilities. The changes are massive. What it's all about is the selective representations of things that are important to the brain. Because in most of the life of the brain this is under control of behavioral context. It's what you pay attention to. It's what's rewarding to you. It's what the brain regards  itself  as positive and important to you. It's all about cortical processing and forebrain specialization. And that underlies your specialization. That is why you  in your many skills and abilities  are a unique specialist  a specialist that's vastly different in your physical brain in detail than the brain of an individual     years ago  enormously different in the details from the brain of the average individual       years ago. Now  one of the characteristics of this change process is that information is always related to other inputs or information that is occurring in immediate time  in context. And that's because the brain is constructing representations of things that are correlated in little moments of time and that relate to one another in little moments of successive time. The brain is recording all information and driving all change in temporal context. Now overwhelmingly the most powerful context that's occurred in your brain is you. Billions of events have occurred in your history that are related in time to yourself as the receiver  or yourself as the actor  yourself as the thinker  yourself as the mover. Billions of times little pieces of sensation have come in from the surface of your body that are always associated with you as the receiver  and that result in the embodiment of you. You are constructed  your self is constructed from these billions of events. It's constructed. It's created in your brain. And it's created in the brain via physical change. This is a marvelously constructed thing that results in individual form because each one of us has vastly different histories  and vastly different experiences  that drive in to us this marvelous differentiation of self  of personhood. Now we've used this research to try to understand not just how a normal person develops  and elaborates their skills and abilities  but also try to understand the origins of impairment  and the origins of differences or variations that might limit the capacities of a child  or an adult. I'm going to talk about using these strategies to actually design brain plasticity based approach to drive corrections in the machinery of a child that increases the competence of the child as a language receiver and user and  thereafter  as a reader. And I'm going to talk about experiments that involve actually using this brain science  first of all to understand how it contributes to the loss of function as we age. And then  by using it in a targeted approach we're going to try to differentiate the machinery to recover function in old age. So the first example I'm going to talk about relates to children with learning impairments. We now have a large body of literature that demonstrates that the fundamental problem that occurs in the majority of children that have early language impairments  and that are going to struggle to learn to read  is that their language processor is created in a defective form. And the reason that it rises in a defective form is because early in the baby's brain's life the machine process is noisy. It's that simple. It's a signal to noise problem. Okay  And there are a lot of things that contribute to that. There are numerous inherited faults that could make the machine process noisier. Now I might say the noise problem could also occur on the basis of information provided in the world from the ears. If any    those of you who are older in the audience know that when I was a child we understood that a child born with a cleft palate was born with what we called mental retardation. We knew that they were going to be slow cognitively  we knew they were going to struggle to learn to develop normal language abilities  and we knew that they were going to struggle to learn to read. Most of them would be intellectual and academic failures. That's disappeared. That no longer applies. That inherited weakness  that inherited condition has evaporated. We don't hear about that anymore. Where did it go  Well  it was understood by a Dutch surgeon  about    years ago  that if you simply fix the problem early enough  when the brain is still in this initial plastic period so it can set up this machinery adequately  in this initial set up time in the critical period  none of that happens. What are you doing by operating on the cleft palate to correct it  You're basically opening up the tubes that drain fluid from the middle ears  which have had them reliably full. Every sound the child hears uncorrected is muffled. It's degraded. The child's native language is such a case is not English. It's not Japanese. It's muffled English. It's degraded Japanese. It's crap. And the brain specializes for it. It creates a representation of language crap. And then the child is stuck with it. Now the crap doesn't just happen in the ear. It can also happen in the brain. The brain itself can be noisy. It's commonly noisy. There are many inherited faults that can make it noisier. And the native language for a child with such a brain is degraded. It's not English. It's noisy English. And that results in defective representations of sounds of words    not normal    a different strategy  by a machine that has different time constants and different space constants. And you can look in the brain of such a child and record those time constants. They are about an order of magnitude longer  about    times longer in duration on average  than in a normal child. Space constants are about three times greater. Such a child will have memory and cognitive deficits in this domain. Of course they will. Because as a receiver of language  they are receiving it and representing it  and in information it's representing crap. And they are going to have poor reading skills. Because reading is dependent upon the translation of word sounds into this orthographic or visual representational form. If you don't have a brain representation of word sounds that translation makes no sense. And you are going to have corresponding abnormal neurology. Then these children increasingly in evaluation after evaluation  in their operations in language  and their operations in reading    we document that abnormal neurology. The point is is that you can train the brain out of this. A way to think about this is you can actually re refine the processing capacity of the machinery by changing it. Changing it in detail. It takes about    hours on the average. And we've accomplished that in about         kids today. Actually  probably about        children are being trained as we speak. And actually when you look at the impacts  the impacts are substantial. So here we're looking at the normal distribution. What we're most interested in is these kids on the left side of the distribution. This is from about       children. You can see that most of the children on the left side of the distribution are moving into the middle or the right. This is in a broad assessment of their language abilities. This is like an IQ test for language. The impact in the distribution  if you trained every child in the United States  would be to shift the whole distribution to the right and narrow the distribution. This is a substantially large impact. Think of a classroom of children in the language arts. Think of the children on the slow side of the class. We have the potential to move most of those children to the middle or to the right side. In addition to accurate language training it also fixes memory and cognition speech fluency and speech production. And an important language dependent skill is enabled by this training    that is to say reading. And to a large extent it fixes the brain. You can look down in the brain of a child in a variety of tasks that scientists have at Stanford  and MIT  and UCSF  and UCLA  and a number of other institutions. And children operating in various language behaviors  or in various reading behaviors  you see for the most extent  for most children  their neuronal responses  complexly abnormal before you start  are normalized by the training. Now you can also take the same approach to address problems in aging. Where again the machinery is deteriorating now from competent machinery  it's going south. Noise is increasing in the brain. And learning modulation and control is deteriorating. And you can actually look down on the brain of such an individual and witness a change in the time constants and space constants with which  for example  the brain is representing language again. Just as the brain came out of chaos at the beginning  it's going back into chaos in the end. This results in declines in memory in cognition  and in postural ability and agility. It turns out you can train the brain of such an individual    this is a small population of such individuals    train equally intensively for about    hours. These are     to    year olds. And what you see are substantial improvements of their immediate memory  of their ability to remember things after a delay  of their ability to control their attention  their language abilities and visual spatial abilities. The overall neuropsychological index of these trained individuals in this population is about two standard deviations. That means that if you sit at the left side of the distribution  and I'm looking at your neuropyschological abilities  the average person has moved to the middle or the right side of the distribution. It means that most people who are at risk for senility  more or less immediately  are now in a protected position. My issues are to try to get to rescuing older citizens more completely and in larger numbers  because I think this can be done in this arena on a vast scale    and the same for kids. My main interest is how to elaborate this science to address other maladies. I'm specifically interested in things like autism  and cerebral palsy  these great childhood catastrophes. And in older age conditions like Parkinsonism  and in other acquired impairments like schizophrenia. Your issues as it relates to this science  is how to maintain your own high functioning learning machine. And of course  a well ordered life in which learning is a continuous part of it  is key. But also in your future is brain aerobics. Get ready for it. It's going to be a part of every life not too far in the future  just like physical exercise is a part of every well organized life in the contemporary period. The other way that we will ultimately come to consider this literature and the science that is important to you is in a consideration of how to nurture yourself. Now that you know  now that science is telling us that you are in charge  that it's under your control  that your happiness  your well being  your abilities  your capacities  are capable of continuous modification  continuous improvement  and you're the responsible agent and party. Of course a lot of people will ignore this advice. It will be a long time before they really understand it. Now that's another issue and not my fault. Okay. Thank you. I should tell you that when I was asked to be here  I thought to myself that well  it's TED. And these TEDsters are    you know  as innocent as that name sounds    these are the philanthropists and artists and scientists who sort of shape our world. And what could I possibly have to say that would be distinguished enough to justify my participation in something like that  And so I thought perhaps a really civilized sounding British accent might help things a bit. And then I thought no  no. I should just get up there and be myself and just talk the way I really talk because  after all  this is the great unveiling. And so I thought I'd come up here and unveil my real voice to you. Although many of you already know that I do speak the Queen's English because I am from Queens  New York. But the theme of this session  of course  is invention. And while I don't have any patents that I'm aware of  you will be meeting a few of my inventions today. I suppose it's fair to say that I am interested in the invention of self or selves. We're all born into certain circumstances with particular physical traits  unique developmental experiences  geographical and historical contexts. But then what  To what extent do we self construct  do we self invent  How do we self identify and how mutable is that identity  Like  what if one could be anyone at any time  Well my characters  like the ones in my shows  allow me to play with the spaces between those questions. And so I've brought a couple of them with me. And well  they're very excited. What I should tell you    what I should tell you is that they've each prepared their own little TED talks. So feel free to think of this as Sarah University. Okay. Okay. Oh  well. Oh  wonderful. Good evening everybody. Thank you so very much for having me here today. Ah  thank you very much. My name is Lorraine Levine. Oh my  There's so many of you. Hi sweetheart. Okay. Anyway  I am here because of a young girl  Sarah Jones. She's a very nice  young black girl. Well you know  she calls herself black    she's really more like a caramel color if you look at her. But anyway. She has me here because she puts me in her show  what she calls her one woman show. And you know what that means  of course. That means she takes the credit and then makes us come out here and do all the work. But I don't mind. Frankly  I'm kvelling just to be here with all the luminaries you have attending something like this  you know. Really  it's amazing. Not only  of course  the scientists and all the wonderful giants of the industries but the celebrities. There are so many celebrities running around here. I saw    Glenn Close I saw earlier. I love her. And she was getting a yogurt in the Google cafe. Isn't that adorable  So many others you see  they're just wonderful. It's lovely to know they're concerned  you know. And    oh  I saw Goldie Hawn. Oh  Goldie Hawn. I love her  too  she's wonderful. Yeah. You know  she's only half Jewish. Did you know that about her  Yeah. But even so  a wonderful talent.  Laughter  And I    you know  when I saw her  such a wonderful feeling. Yeah  she's lovely. But anyway  I should have started by saying just how lucky I feel. It's such an eye opening experience to be here. You're all so responsible for this world that we live in today. You know  I couldn't have dreamed of such a thing as a young girl. And you've all made these advancements happen in such a short time    you're all so young. You know  your parents must be very proud. But I    I also appreciate the diversity that you have here. I noticed it's very multicultural. You know  when you're standing up here  you can see all the different people. It's like a rainbow. It's okay to say rainbow. Yeah. I just    I can't keep up with whether you can say  you know  the different things. What are you allowed to say or not say  I just    I don't want to offend anybody. You know. But anyway  you know  I just think that to be here with all of you accomplished young people    literally  some of you  the architects building our brighter future. You know  it's heartening to me. Even though  quite frankly  some of your presentations are horrifying  absolutely horrifying. It's true. It's true. You know  between the environmental degradation and the crashing of the world markets you're talking about. And of course  we know it's all because of the    all the ... Well  I don't know how else to say it to you  so I'll just say it my way  the ganeyvish schticklich coming from the governments and the  you know  the bankers and the Wall Street. You know it. Anyway. The point is  I'm happy somebody has practical ideas to get us out of this mess. So I salute each of you and your stellar achievements. Thank you for all that you do. And congratulations on being such big makhers that you've become TED meisters. So  happy continued success. Congratulations. Mazel tov. Hi. Hi. Thank you everybody. Sorry  this is such a wonderful opportunity and everything  to be here right now. My name is Noraida. And I'm just    I'm so thrilled to be part of like your TED conference that you're doing and everything like that. I am Dominican American. Actually  you could say I grew up in the capital of Dominican Republic  otherwise known as Washington Heights in New York City. But I don't know if there's any other Dominican people here  but I know that Juan Enriquez  he was here yesterday. And I think he's Mexican  so that's    honestly  that's close enough for me right now. So    I just    I'm sorry. I'm just trying not to be nervous because this is a very wonderful experience for me and everything. And I just    you know I'm not used to doing the public speaking. And whenever I get nervous I start to talk really fast. Nobody can understand nothing I'm saying  which is very frustrating for me  as you can imagine. I usually have to just like try to calm down and take a deep breath. But then on top of that  you know  Sarah Jones told me we only have    minutes. So then I'm like  should I be nervous  you know  because maybe it's better. And I'm just trying not to panic and freak out. So I like  take a deep breath. Okay. Sorry. So anyway  what I was trying to say is that I really love TED. Like  I love everything about this. It's amazing. Like  it's    I can't get over this right now. And  like  people would not believe  seriously  where I'm from  that this even exists. You know  like even  I mean I love like the name  the    TED. I mean I know it's a real person and everything  but I'm just saying that like  you know  I think it's very cool how it's also an acronym  you know  which is like  you know  is like very high concept and everything like that. I like that. And actually  I can relate to the whole like acronym thing and everything. Because  actually  I'm a sophomore at college right now. At my school    actually I was part of co founding an organization  which is like a leadership thing  you know  like you guys  you would really like it and everything. And the organization is called DA BOMB  A and DA BOMB    not like what you guys can build and everything    it's like  DA BOMB  it means like Dominican    it's an acronym    Dominican American Benevolent Organization for Mothers and Babies. So  I know  see  like the name is like a little bit long  but with the war on terror and everything  the Dean of Student Activities has asked us to stop saying DA BOMB and use the whole thing so nobody would get the wrong idea  whatever. So  basically like DA BOMB    what Dominican American Benevolent Organization for Mothers and Babies does is  basically  we try to advocate for students who show a lot of academic promise and who also happen to be mothers like me. I am a working mother  and I also go to school full time. And  you know  it's like    it's so important to have like role models out there. I mean  I know sometimes our lifestyles are very different  whatever. But like even at my job    like  I just got promoted. Right now it's very exciting actually for me because I'm the Junior Assistant to the Associate Director under the Senior Vice President for Business Development    that's my new title. So  but I think whether you own your own company or you're just starting out like me  like something like this is so vital for people to just continue expanding their minds and learning. And if everybody  like all people really had access to that  it would be a very different world out there  as I know you know. So  I think all people  we need that  but especially  I look at people like me  you know like  I mean  Latinos    we're about to be the majority  in like two weeks. So  we deserve just as much to be part of the exchange of ideas as everybody else. So  I'm very happy that you're  you know  doing this kind of thing  making the talks available online. That's very good. I love that. And I just    I love you guys. I love TED. And if you don't mind  privately now  in the future  I'm going to think of TED as an acronym for Technology  Entertainment and Dominicans. Thank you very much. So  that was Noraida  and just like Lorraine and everybody else you're meeting today  these are folks who are based on real people from my real life  friends  neighbors  family members. I come from a multicultural family. In fact  the older lady you just met  very  very loosely based on a great aunt on my mother's side. It's a long story  believe me. But on top of my family background  my parents also sent me to the United Nations school  where I encountered a plethora of new characters  including Alexandre  my French teacher  okay. Well  you know  it was beginner French  that I am taking with her  you know. And it was Madame Bousson  you know  she was very  French . It was like  you know  she was there in the class  you know  she was kind of typically French. You know  she was very chic  but she was very filled with ennui  you know. And she would be there  you know  kind of talking with the class  you know  talking about the  you know  the existential futility of life  you know. And we were only    years old  so it was not appropriate.  Laughter  But  German . Yes  I took German for three years   German   and it was quite the experience because I was the only black girl in the class  even in the UN school. Although  you know  it was wonderful. The teacher  Herr Schtopf  he never discriminated. Never. He always  always treated each of us  you know  equally unbearably during the class. So  there were the teachers and then there were my friends  classmates from everywhere  many of whom are still dear friends to this day. And they've inspired many characters as well. For example  a friend of mine. Well  I just wanted to quickly say good evening. My name is Praveen Manvi and thank you very much for this opportunity. Of course  TED  the reputation precedes itself all over the world. But  you know  I am originally from India  and I wanted to start by telling you that once Sarah Jones told me that we will be having the opportunity to come here to TED in California  originally  I was very pleased and  frankly  relieved because  you know  I am a human rights advocate. And usually my work  it takes me to Washington D.C. And there  I must attend these meetings  mingling with some tiresome politicians  trying to make me feel comfortable by telling how often they are eating the curry in Georgetown.  Laughter  So  you can just imagine    right. So  but I'm thrilled to be joining all of you here. I wish we had more time together  but that's for another time. Okay  Great. And  sadly  I don't think we'll have time for you to meet everybody I brought  but    I'm trying to behave myself  it's my first time here. But I do want to introduce you to a couple of folks you may recognize  if you saw  Bridge and Tunnel.  Uh  well  thank you. Good evening. My name is Pauline Ning  and first I want to tell you that I'm    of course I am a member of the Chinese community in New York. But when Sarah Jones asked me to please come to TED  I said  well  you know  first  I don't know that  you know    before two years ago  you would not find me in front of an audience of people  much less like this because I did not like to give speeches because I feel that  as an immigrant  I do not have good English skills for speaking. But then  I decided  just like Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger  I try anyway. My daughter    my daughter wrote that  she told me   Always start your speech with humor.  But my background    I want to tell you story only briefly. My husband and I  we brought our son and daughter here in     s to have the freedom we cannot have in China at that time. And we tried to teach our kids to be proud of their tradition  but it's very hard. You know  as immigrant  I would speak Chinese to them  and they would always answer me back in English. They love rock music  pop culture  American culture. But when they got older  when the time comes for them to start think about getting married  that's when we expect them to realize  a little bit more  their own culture. But that's where we had some problems. My son  he says he is not ready to get married. And he has a sweetheart  but she is American woman  not Chinese. It's not that it's bad  but I told him   What's wrong with a Chinese woman   But I think he will change his mind soon. So  then I decide instead  I will concentrate on my daughter. The daughter's marriage is very special to the mom. But first  she said she's not interested. She only wants to spend time with her friends. And then at college  it's like she never came home. And she doesn't want me to come and visit. So I said   What's wrong in this picture   So  I accused my daughter to have like a secret boyfriend. But she told me   Mom  you don't have to worry about boys because I don't like them.  And I said   Yes  men can be difficult  but all women have to get used to that.  She said   No Mom. I mean  I don't like boys. I like girls. I am lesbian.  So  I always teach my kids to respect American ideas  but I told my daughter that this is one exception    that she is not gay  she is just confused by this American problem. But she told me   Mom  it's not American.  She said she is in love    in love with a nice Chinese girl. So  these are the words I am waiting to hear  but from my son  not my daughter. But at first I did not know what to do. But then  over time  I have come to understand that this is who she is. So  even though sometimes it's still hard  I will share with you that it helps me to realize society is more tolerant  usually because of places like this  because of ideas like this  and people like you  with an open mind. So I think maybe TED  you impact people's lives in the ways maybe even you don't realize. So  for my daughter's sake  I thank you for your ideas worth spreading. Thank you. Xie xie. Good evening. My name is Habbi Belahal. And I would like to first of all thank Sarah Jones for putting all of the pressure on the only Arab who she brought with her to be last today. I am originally from Jordan. And I teach comparative literature at Queens College. It is not Harvard. But I feel a bit like a fish out of water. But I am very proud of my students. And I see that a few of them did make it here to the conference. So you will get the extra credit I promised you. But  while I know that I may not look like the typical TED izen  as you would say  I do like to make the point that we in global society  we are never as different as the appearances may suggest. So  if you will indulge me  I will share quickly with you a bit of verse  which I memorized as a young girl at    years of age. So  back in the ancient times.  Arabic  And this roughly translates   Please  let me hold your hand. I want to hold your hand. I want to hold your hand. And when I touch you  I feel happy inside. It's such a feeling that my love  I can't hide  I can't hide  I can't hide.  Well  so okay  but please  please  but please. If it is sounding familiar  it is because I was at the same time in my life listening to the Beatles. On the radio  unclear   they were very popular. So  all of that is to say that I like to believe that for every word intended as to render us deaf to one another  there is always a lyric connecting ears and hearts across the continents in rhyme. And I pray that this is the way that we will self invent  in time. That's all  shukran. Thank you very much for the opportunity. Okay  Great. Thank you all very much. It was lovely. Thank you for having me. Thank you very  very much. I love you. Well  you have to let me say this. I just    thank you. I want to thank Chris and Jacqueline  and just everyone for having me here. It's been a long time coming  and I feel like I'm home. And I know I've performed for some of your companies or some of you have seen me elsewhere  but this is honestly one of the best audiences I've ever experienced. The whole thing is amazing  and so don't you all go reinventing yourselves any time soon. So the first question is  why do we need to even worry about a pandemic threat  What is it that we're concerned about  When I say  we   I'm at the Council on Foreign Relations. We're concerned in the national security community  and of course in the biology community and the public health community. While globalization has increased travel  it's made it necessary that everybody be everywhere  all the time  all over the world. And that means that your microbial hitchhikers are moving with you. So a plague outbreak in Surat  India becomes not an obscure event  but a globalized event    a globalized concern that has changed the risk equation. Katrina showed us that we cannot completely depend on government to have readiness in hand  to be capable of handling things. Indeed  an outbreak would be multiple Katrinas at once. Our big concern at the moment is a virus called H N  flu    some of you call it bird flu    which first emerged in southern China  in the mid     s  but we didn't know about it until     . At the end of last Christmas only    countries had seen H N . But we're now up to    countries in the world  have had this virus emerge  in either birds  or people or both. In the bird outbreaks we now can see that pretty much the whole world has seen this virus except the Americas. And I'll get into why we've so far been spared in a moment. In domestic birds  especially chickens  it's     percent lethal. It's one of the most lethal things we've seen in circulation in the world in any recent centuries. And we've dealt with it by killing off lots and lots and lots of chickens  and unfortunately often not reimbursing the peasant farmers with the result that there's cover up. It's also carried on migration patterns of wild migratory aquatic birds. There has been this centralized event in a place called Lake Chenghai  China. Two years ago the migrating birds had a multiple event where thousands died because of a mutation occurring in the virus  which made the species range broaden dramatically. So that birds going to Siberia  to Europe  and to Africa carried the virus  which had not previously been possible. We're now seeing outbreaks in human populations    so far  fortunately  small events  tiny outbreaks  occasional clusters. The virus has mutated dramatically in the last two years to form two distinct families  if you will  of the H N  viral tree with branches in them  and with different attributes that are worrying. So what's concerning us  Well  first of all  at no time in history have we succeeded in making in a timely fashion  a specific vaccine for more than     million people. It's not going to do us very much good in a global pandemic. You've heard about the vaccine we're stockpiling. But nobody believes it will actually be particularly effective if we have a real outbreak. So one thought is  after       when the airports closed  our flu season was delayed by two weeks. So the thought is  hey  maybe what we should do is just immediately    we hear there is H N  spreading from human to human  the virus has mutated to be a human to human transmitter    let's shut down the airports. However  huge supercomputer analyses  done of the likely effectiveness of this  show that it won't buy us much time at all. And of course it will be hugely disruptive in preparation plans. For example  all masks are made in China. How do you get them mobilized around the world if you've shut all the airports down  How do you get the vaccines moved around the world and the drugs moved  and whatever may or not be available that would work. So it turns out that shutting down the airports is counterproductive. We're worried because this virus  unlike any other flu we've ever studied  can be transmitted by eating raw meat of the infected animals. We've seen transmission to wild cats and domestic cats  and now also domestic pet dogs. And in experimental feedings to rodents and ferrets  we found that the animals exhibit symptoms never seen with flu  seizures  central nervous system disorders  partial paralysis. This is not your normal garden variety flu. It mimics what we now understand about reconstructing the      flu virus  the last great pandemic  in that it also jumped directly from birds to people. We had evolution over time  and this unbelievable mortality rate in human beings     percent of people who have become infected with H N  have  in fact  succumbed. And we don't have a huge number of people who got infected and never developed disease. In experimental feeding in monkeys you can see that it actually downregulates a specific immune system modulator. The result is that what kills you is not the virus directly  but your own immune system overreacting  saying   Whatever this is so foreign I'm going berserk.  The result  most of the deaths have been in people under    years of age  robustly healthy young adults. We have seen human to human transmission in at least three clusters    fortunately involving very intimate contact  still not putting the world at large at any kind of risk. Alright  so I've got you nervous. Now you probably assume  well the governments are going to do something. And we have spent a lot of money. Most of the spending in the Bush administration has actually been more related to the anthrax results and bio terrorism threat. But a lot of money has been thrown out at the local level and at the federal level to look at infectious diseases. End result  only    states have been certified to be able to do mass distribution of vaccine and drugs in a pandemic. Half the states would run out of hospital beds in the first week  maybe two weeks. And    states already have an acute nursing shortage. Add on pandemic threat  you're in big trouble. So what have people been doing with this money  Exercises  drills  all over the world. Let's pretend there's a pandemic. Let's everybody run around and play your role. Main result is that there is tremendous confusion. Most of these people don't actually know what their job will be. And the bottom line  major thing that has come through in every single drill  nobody knows who's in charge. Nobody knows the chain of command. If it were Los Angeles  is it the mayor  the governor  the President of the United States  the head of Homeland Security  In fact  the federal government says it's a guy called the Principle Federal Officer  who happens to be with TSA. The government says the federal responsibility will basically be about trying to keep the virus out  which we all know is impossible  and then to mitigate the impact primarily on our economy. The rest is up to your local community. Everything is about your town  where you live. Well how good a city council you have  how good a mayor you have    that's who's going to be in charge. Most local facilities would all be competing to try and get their hands on their piece of the federal stockpile of a drug called Tamiflu  which may or may not be helpful    I'll get into that    of available vaccines  and any other treatments  and masks  and anything that's been stockpiled. And you'll have massive competition. Now we did purchase a vaccine  you've probably all heard about it  made by Sanofi Aventis. Unfortunately it's made against the current form of H N . We know the virus will mutate. It will be a different virus. The vaccine will probably be useless. So here's where the decisions come in. You're the mayor of your local town. Let's see  should we order that all pets be kept indoors  Germany did that when H N  appeared in Germany last year  in order to minimize the spread between households by household cats  dogs and so on. What do we do when we don't have any containment rooms with reverse air that will allow the healthcare workers to take care of patients  These are in Hong Kong  we have nothing like that here. What about quarantine  During the SARS epidemic in Beijing quarantine did seem to help. We have no uniform policies regarding quarantine across the United States. And some states have differential policies  county by county. But what about the no brainer things  Should we close all the schools  Well then what about all the workers  They won't go to work if their kids aren't in school. Encouraging telecommuting  What works  Well the British government did a model of telecommuting. Six weeks they had all people in the banking industry pretend a pandemic was underway. What they found was  the core functions    you know you still sort of had banks  but you couldn't get people to put money in the ATM machines. Nobody was processing the credit cards. Your insurance payments didn't go through. And basically the economy would be in a disaster state of affairs. And that's just office workers  bankers. We don't know how important hand washing is for flu    shocking. One assumes it's a good idea to wash your hands a lot. But actually in scientific community there is great debate about what percentage of flu transmission between people is from sneezing and coughing and what percentage is on your hands. The Institute of Medicine tried to look at the masking question. Can we figure out a way  since we know we won't have enough masks because we don't make them in America anymore  they're all made in China    do we need N    A state of the art  top of the line  must be fitted to your face mask  Or can we get away with some different kinds of masks  In the SARS epidemic  we learned in Hong Kong that most of transmission was because people were removing their masks improperly. And their hand got contaminated with the outside of the mask  and then they rubbed their nose. Bingo  They got SARS. It wasn't flying microbes. If you go online right now  you'll get so much phony baloney information. You'll end up buying    this is called an N   mask. Ridiculous. We don't actually have a standard for what should be the protective gear for the first responders  the people who will actually be there on the front lines. And Tamiflu. You've probably heard of this drug  made by Hoffmann La Roche  patented drug. There is some indication that it may buy you some time in the midst of an outbreak. Should you take Tamiflu for a long period of time  well  one of the side effects is suicidal ideations. A public health survey analyzed the effect that large scale Tamiflu use would have  actually shows it counteractive to public health measures  making matters worse. And here is the other interesting thing  when a human being ingests Tamiflu  only    percent is metabolized appropriately to be an active compound in the human being. The rest turns into a stable compound  which survives filtration into the water systems  thereby exposing the very aquatic birds that would carry flu and providing them a chance to breed resistant strains. And we now have seen Tamiflu resistant strains in both Vietnam in person to person transmission  and in Egypt in person to person transmission. So I personally think that our life expectancy for Tamiflu as an effective drug is very limited    very limited indeed. Nevertheless most of the governments have based their whole flu policies on building stockpiles of Tamiflu. Russia has actually stockpiled enough for    percent of all Russians. We've stockpiled enough for    percent. When I say enough  that's two weeks worth. And then you're on your own because the pandemic is going to last for    to    months. Some of the poorer countries that have had the most experience with H N  have built up stockpiles  they're already expired. They are already out of date. What do we know from       the last great pandemic  The federal government abdicated most responsibility. And so we ended up with this wild patchwork of regulations all over America. Every city  county  state did their own thing. And the rules and the belief systems were wildly disparate. In some cases all schools  all churches  all public venues were closed. The pandemic circulated three times in    months in the absence of commercial air travel. The second wave was the mutated  super killer wave. And in the first wave we had enough healthcare workers. But by the time the second wave hit it took such a toll among the healthcare workers that we lost most of our doctors and nurses that were on the front lines. Overall we lost         people. The virus was     percent lethal to pregnant women and we don't actually know why. Most of the death toll was    to    year olds    robustly healthy young adults. It was likened to the plague. We don't actually know how many people died. The low ball estimate is    million. This was based on European and North American data. A new study by Chris Murray at Harvard shows that if you look at the databases that were kept by the Brits in India  there was a    fold greater death rate among the Indians. So there is a strong belief that in places of poverty the death toll was far higher. And that a more likely toll is somewhere in the neighborhood of    to     million people before we had commercial air travel. So are we ready  As a nation  no we're not. And I think even those in the leadership would say that is the case  that we still have a long ways to go. So what does that mean for you  Well the first thing is  I wouldn't start building up personal stockpiles of anything    for yourself  your family  or your employees    unless you've really done your homework. What mask works  what mask doesn't work. How many masks do you need  The Institute of Medicine study felt that you could not recycle masks. Well if you think it's going to last    months  are you going to buy    months worth of masks for every single person in your family  We don't know    again with Tamiflu  the number one side effect of Tamiflu is flu like symptoms. So then how can you tell who in your family has the flu if everybody is taking Tamiflu  If you expand that out to think of a whole community  or all your employees in your company  you begin to realize how limited the Tamiflu option might be. Everybody has come up to me and said  well I'll stockpile water or  I'll stockpile food  or what have you. But really  Do you really have a place to stockpile    months worth of food  Twenty four months worth of food  Do you want to view the pandemic threat the way back in the     s people viewed the civil defense issue  and build your own little bomb shelter for pandemic flu  I don't think that's rational. I think it's about having to be prepared as communities  not as individuals    being prepared as nation  being prepared as state  being prepared as town. And right now most of the preparedness is deeply flawed. And I hope I've convinced you of that  which means that the real job is go out and say to your local leaders  and your national leaders   Why haven't you solved these problems  Why are you still thinking that the lessons of Katrina do not apply to flu   And put the pressure where the pressure needs to be put. But I guess the other thing to add is  if you do have employees  and you do have a company  I think you have certain responsibilities to demonstrate that you are thinking ahead for them  and you are trying to plan. At a minimum the British banking plan showed that telecommuting can be helpful. It probably does reduce exposure because people are not coming into the office and coughing on each other  or touching common objects and sharing things via their hands. But can you sustain your company that way  Well if you have a dot com  maybe you can. Otherwise you're in trouble. Happy to take your questions. Audience member  What factors determine the duration of a pandemic  Laurie Garret  What factors determine the duration of a pandemic  we don't really know. I could give you a bunch of flip  this  that  and the other. But I would say that honestly we don't know. Clearly the bottom line is the virus eventually attenuates  and ceases to be a lethal virus to humanity  and finds other hosts. But we don't really know how and why that happens. It's a very complicated ecology. Audience member  What kind of triggers are you looking for  You know way more than any of us. To say ahh  if this happens then we are going to have a pandemic  LG  The moment that you see any evidence of serious human to human to transmission. Not just intimately between family members who took care of an ailing sister or brother  but a community infected    spread within a school  spread within a dormitory  something of that nature. Then I think that there is universal agreement now  at WHO all the way down  Send out the alert. Audience member  Some research has indicated that statins can be helpful. Can you talk about that  LG  Yeah. There is some evidence that taking Lipitor and other common statins for cholesterol control may decrease your vulnerability to influenza. But we do not completely understand why. The mechanism isn't clear. And I don't know that there is any way responsibly for someone to start medicating their children with their personal supply of Lipitor or something of that nature. We have absolutely no idea what that would do. You might be causing some very dangerous outcomes in your children  doing such a thing. Audience member  How far along are we in being able to determine whether someone is actually carrying  whether somebody has this before the symptoms are full blown  LG  Right. So I have for a long time said that what we really needed was a rapid diagnostic. And our Centers for Disease Control has labeled a test they developed a rapid diagnostic. It takes    hours in a very highly developed laboratory  in highly skilled hands. I'm thinking dipstick. You could do it to your own kid. It changes color. It tells you if you have H N . In terms of where we are in science with DNA identification capacities and so on  it's not that far off. But we're not there. And there hasn't been the kind of investment to get us there. Audience member  In the      flu I understand that they theorized that there was some attenuation of the virus when it made the leap into humans. Is that likely  do you think  here  I mean     percent death rate is pretty severe. LG  Um yeah. So we don't actually know what the lethality was of the      strain to wild birds before it jumped from birds to humans. It's curious that there is no evidence of mass die offs of chickens or household birds across America before the human pandemic happened. That may be because those events were occurring on the other side of the world where nobody was paying attention. But the virus clearly went through one round around the world in a mild enough form that the British army in World War I actually certified that it was not a threat and would not affect the outcome of the war. And after circulating around the world came back in a form that was tremendously lethal. What percentage of infected people were killed by it  Again we don't really know for sure. It's clear that if you were malnourished to begin with  you had a weakened immune system  you lived in poverty in India or Africa  your likelihood of dying was far greater. But we don't really know. Audience member  One of the things I've heard is that the real death cause when you get a flu is the associated pneumonia  and that a pneumonia vaccine may offer you    percent better chance of survival. LG  For a long time  researchers in emerging diseases were kind of dismissive of the pandemic flu threat on the grounds that back in      they didn't have antibiotics. And that most people who die of regular flu    which in regular flu years is about         people worldwide  most of them senior citizens    and they die not of the flu but because the flu gives an assault to their immune system. And along comes pneumococcus or another bacteria  streptococcus and boom  they get a bacterial pneumonia. But it turns out that in      that was not the case at all. And so far in the H N  cases in people  similarly bacterial infection has not been an issue at all. It's this absolutely phenomenal disruption of the immune system that is the key to why people die of this virus. And I would just add we saw the same thing with SARS. So what's going on here is your body says  your immune system sends out all its sentinels and says   I don't know what the heck this is. We've never seen anything even remotely like this before.  It won't do any good to bring in the sharpshooters because those antibodies aren't here. And it won't do any good to bring in the tanks and the artillery because those T cells don't recognize it either. So we're going to have to go all out thermonuclear response  stimulate the total cytokine cascade. The whole immune system swarms into the lungs. And yes they die  drowning in their own fluids  of pneumonia. But it's not bacterial pneumonia. And it's not a pneumonia that would respond to a vaccine. And I think my time is up. I thank you all for your attention. Last year at TED I gave an introduction to the LHC. And I promised to come back and give you an update on how that machine worked. So this is it. And for those of you that weren't there  the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever attempted       kilometers in circumference. Its job is to recreate the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began  up to     million times a second. It's nothing if not ambitious. This is the machine below Geneva. We take the pictures of those mini Big Bangs inside detectors. This is the one I work on. It's called the ATLAS detector       meters wide     meters in diameter. Spectacular picture here of ATLAS under construction so you can see the scale. On the   th of September last year we turned the machine on for the first time. And this picture was taken by ATLAS. It caused immense celebration in the control room. It's a picture of the first beam particle going all the way around the LHC  colliding with a piece of the LHC deliberately  and showering particles into the detector. In other words  when we saw that picture on September   th we knew the machine worked  which is a great triumph. I don't know whether this got the biggest cheer  or this  when someone went onto Google and saw the front page was like that. It means we made cultural impact as well as scientific impact. About a week later we had a problem with the machine  related actually to these bits of wire here    these gold wires. Those wires carry    thousand amps when the machine is working in full power. Now the engineers amongst you will look at them and say   No they don't. They're small wires.  They can do that because when they are very cold they are what's called superconducting wire. So at minus     degrees  colder than the space between the stars  those wires can take that current. In one of the joints between over       magnets in LHC  there was a manufacturing defect. So the wire heated up slightly  and its        amps suddenly encountered electrical resistance. This was the result. Now that's more impressive when you consider those magnets weigh over    tons  and they moved about a foot. So we damaged about    of the magnets. We had to take them out  which we did. We reconditioned them all  fixed them. They're all on their way back underground now. By the end of March the LHC will be intact again. We will switch it on  and we expect to take data in June or July  and continue with our quest to find out what the building blocks of the universe are. Now of course  in a way those accidents reignite the debate about the value of science and engineering at the edge. It's easy to refute. I think that the fact that it's so difficult  the fact that we're overreaching  is the value of things like the LHC. I will leave the final word to an English scientist  Humphrey Davy  who  I suspect  when defending his protege's useless experiments    his protege was Michael Faraday    said this   Nothing is so dangerous to the progress of the human mind than to assume that our views of science are ultimate  that there are no mysteries in nature  that our triumphs are complete  and that there are no new worlds to conquer.  Thank you. We look around the media  as we see on the news from Iraq  Afghanistan  Sierra Leone  and the conflict seems incomprehensible to us. And that's certainly how it seemed to me when I started this project. But as a physicist  I thought  well if you give me some data  I could maybe understand this. You know  give us a go. So as a naive New Zealander I thought  well I'll go to the Pentagon. Can you get me some information  No. So I had to think a little harder. And I was watching the news one night in Oxford. And I looked down at the chattering heads on my channel of choice. And I saw that there was information there. There was data within the streams of news that we consume. All this noise around us actually has information. So what I started thinking was  perhaps there is something like open source intelligence here. If we can get enough of these streams of information together  we can perhaps start to understand the war. So this is exactly what I did. We started bringing a team together  an interdisciplinary team of scientists  of economists  mathematicians. We brought these guys together and we started to try and solve this. We did it in three steps. The first step we did was to collect. We did     different sources of information    from NGO reports to newspapers and cable news. We brought this raw data in and we filtered it. We extracted the key bits on information to build the database. That database contained the timing of attacks  the location  the size and the weapons used. It's all in the streams of information we consume daily  we just have to know how to pull it out. And once we had this we could start doing some cool stuff. What if we were to look at the distribution of the sizes of attacks  What would that tell us  So we started doing this. And you can see here on the horizontal axis you've got the number of people killed in an attack or the size of the attack. And on the vertical axis you've got the number of attacks. So we plot data for sample on this. You see some sort of random distribution    perhaps    attacks  one person was killed  or    attacks where seven people were killed. We did this exact same thing for Iraq. And we didn't know  for Iraq what we were going to find. It turns out what we found was pretty surprising. You take all of the conflict  all of the chaos  all of the noise  and out of that comes this precise mathematical distribution of the way attacks are ordered in this conflict. This blew our mind. Why should a conflict like Iraq have this as its fundamental signature  Why should there be order in war  We didn't really understand that. We thought maybe there is something special about Iraq. So we looked at a few more conflicts. We looked at Colombia  we looked at Afghanistan  and we looked at Senegal. And the same pattern emerged in each conflict. This wasn't supposed to happen. These are different wars  with different religious factions  different political factions  and different socioeconomic problems. And yet the fundamental patterns underlying them are the same. So we went a little wider. We looked around the world at all the data we could get our hands on. From Peru to Indonesia  we studied this same pattern again. And we found that not only were the distributions these straight lines  but the slope of these lines  they clustered around this value of alpha equals  . . And we could generate an equation that could predict the likelihood of an attack. What we're saying here is the probability of an attack killing X number of people in a country like Iraq is equal to a constant  times the size of that attack  raised to the power of negative alpha. And negative alpha is the slope of that line I showed you before. So what  This is data  statistics. What does it tell us about these conflicts  That was a challenge we had to face as physicists. How do we explain this  And what we really found was that alpha  if we think about it  is the organizational structure of the insurgency. Alpha is the distribution of the sizes of attacks  which is really the distribution of the group strength carrying out the attacks. So we look at a process of group dynamics  coalescence and fragmentation  groups coming together  groups breaking apart. And we start running the numbers on this. Can we simulate it  Can we create the kind of patterns that we're seeing in places like Iraq  Turns out we kind of do a reasonable job. We can run these simulations. We can recreate this using a process of group dynamics to explain the patterns that we see all around the conflicts around the world. So what's going on  Why should these different    seemingly different conflicts have the same patterns  Now what I believe is going on is that the insurgent forces  they evolve over time. They adapt. And it turns out there is only one solution to fight a much stronger enemy. And if you don't find that solution as an insurgent force  you don't exist. So every insurgent force that is ongoing  every conflict that is ongoing  it's going to look something like this. And that is what we think is happening. Taking it forward  how do we change it  How do we end a war like Iraq  What does it look like  Alpha is the structure. It's got a stable state at  . . This is what wars look like when they continue. We've got to change that. We can push it up  the forces become more fragmented  there is more of them  but they are weaker. Or we push it down  they're more robust  there is less groups  but perhaps you can sit and talk to them. So this graph here  I'm going to show you now. No one has seen this before. This is literally stuff that we've come through last week. And we see the evolution of Alpha through time. We see it start. And we see it grow up to the stable state the wars around the world look like. And it stays there through the invasion of Fallujah until the Samarra bombings in the Iraqi elections of '  . And the system gets perturbed. It moves upwards to a fragmented state. This is when the surge happens. And depending on who you ask  the surge was supposed to push it up even further. The opposite happened. The groups became stronger. They became more robust. And so I'm thinking  right  great  it's going to keep going down. We can talk to them. We can get a solution. The opposite happened. It's moved up again. The groups are more fragmented. And this tells me one of two things. Either we're back where we started and the surge has had no effect  or finally the groups have been fragmented to the extent that we can start to think about maybe moving out. I don't know what the answer is to that. But I know that we should be looking at the structure of the insurgency to answer that question. Thank you. What I want to do today is to spend some time talking about some stuff that's sort of giving me a little bit of existential angst  for lack of a better word  over the past couple of years  and basically  these three quotes tell what's going on.  When God made the color purple  God was just showing off   Alice Walker wrote in  The Color Purple   and Zora Neale Hurston wrote in  Dust Tracks On A Road    Research is a formalized curiosity. It's poking and prying with a purpose.  And then finally  when I think about the near future  you know  we have this attitude  well  whatever happens  happens. Right  So that goes along with the Chesire Cat saying   If you don't care much where you want to get to  it doesn't much matter which way you go.  But I think it does matter which way we go  and what road we take  because when I think about design in the near future  what I think are the most important issues  what's really crucial and vital is that we need to revitalize the arts and sciences right now in     . If we describe the near future as            years from now  that means that what we do today is going to be critically important  because in the year       and the year             the world our society is going to be building on  the basic knowledge and abstract ideas  the discoveries that we came up with today  just as all these wonderful things we're hearing about here at the TED conference that we take for granted in the world right now  were really knowledge and ideas that came up in the '  s  the '  s  and the '  s. That's the substrate that we're exploiting today  whether it's the internet  genetic engineering  laser scanners  guided missiles  fiber optics  high definition television  sensing  remote sensing from space and the wonderful remote sensing photos that we see in  D weaving  TV programs like Tracker  and Enterprise  CD rewrite drives  flatscreen  Alvin Ailey's Suite Otis  or Sarah Jones'  Your Revolution Will Not Be Between These Thighs   which by the way was banned by the FCC  or ska  all of these things without question  almost without exception  are really based on ideas and abstract and creativity from years before  so we have to ask ourselves  what are we contributing to that legacy right now  And when I think about it  I'm really worried. To be quite frank  I'm concerned. I'm skeptical that we're doing very much of anything. We're  in a sense  failing to act in the future. We're purposefully  consciously being laggards. We're lagging behind. Frantz Fanon  who was a psychiatrist from Martinique  said   Each generation must  out of relative obscurity  discover its mission  and fulfill or betray it.  What is our mission  What do we have to do  I think our mission is to reconcile  to reintegrate science and the arts  because right now there's a schism that exists in popular culture. You know  people have this idea that science and the arts are really separate. We think of them as separate and different things  and this idea was probably introduced centuries ago  but it's really becoming critical now  because we're making decisions about our society every day that  if we keep thinking that the arts are separate from the sciences  and we keep thinking it's cute to say   I don't understand anything about this one  I don't understand anything about the other one   then we're going to have problems. Now I know no one here at TED thinks this. All of us  we already know that they're very connected  but I'm going to let you know that some folks in the outside world  believe it or not  they think it's neat when they say   You know  scientists and science is not creative. Maybe scientists are ingenious  but they're not creative. And then we have this tendency  the career counselors and various people say things like   Artists are not analytical. They're ingenious  perhaps  but not analytical   and when these concepts underly our teaching and what we think about the world  then we have a problem  because we stymie support for everything. By accepting this dichotomy  whether it's tongue in cheek  when we attempt to accommodate it in our world  and we try to build our foundation for the world  we're messing up the future  because  who wants to be uncreative  Who wants to be illogical  Talent would run from either of these fields if you said you had to choose either. Then they're going to go to something where they think   Well  I can be creative and logical at the same time.  Now I grew up in the '  s and I'll admit it  actually  my childhood spanned the '  s  and I was a wannabe hippie and I always resented the fact that I wasn't really old enough to be a hippie. And I know there are people here  the younger generation who want to be hippies  but people talk about the '  s all the time  and they talk about the anarchy that was there  but when I think about the '  s  what I took away from it was that there was hope for the future. We thought everyone could participate. There were wonderful  incredible ideas that were always percolating  and so much of what's cool or hot today is really based on some of those concepts  whether it's  you know  people trying to use the prime directive from Star Trek being involved in things  or again that three dimensional weaving and fax machines that I read about in my weekly readers that the technology and engineering was just getting started. But the '  s left me with a problem. You see  I always assumed I would go into space  because I followed all of this  but I also loved the arts and sciences. You see  when I was growing up as a little girl and as a teenager  I loved designing and making dogs' clothes and wanting to be a fashion designer. I took art and ceramics. I loved dance. Lola Falana. Alvin Ailey. Jerome Robbins. And I also avidly followed the Gemini and the Apollo programs. I had science projects and tons of astronomy books. I took calculus and philosophy. I wondered about the infinity and the Big Bang theory. And when I was at Stanford  I found myself  my senior year  chemical engineering major  half the folks thought I was a political science and performing arts major  which was sort of true because I was Black Student Union President and I did major in some other things  and I found myself the last quarter juggling chemical engineering separation processes  logic classes  nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy  and also producing and choreographing a dance production  and I had to do the lighting and the design work  and I was trying to figure out  do I go to New York City to try to become a professional dancer  or do I go to medical school  Now  my mother helped me figure that one out.  Laughter  But when I went into space  when I went into space I carried a number of things up with me. I carried a poster by Alvin Ailey  which you can figure out now  I love the dance company. An Alvin Ailey poster of Judith Jamison performing the dance  Cry   dedicated to all black women everywhere. A Bundu statue  which was from the Women's Society in Sierra Leone  and a certificate for the Chicago Public School students to work to improve their science and math  and folks asked me   Why did you take up what you took up   And I had to say   Because it represents human creativity  the creativity that allowed us  that we were required to have to conceive and build and launch the space shuttle  springs from the same source as the imagination and analysis it took to carve a Bundu statue  or the ingenuity it took to design  choreograph  and stage  Cry.  Each one of them are different manifestations  incarnations  of creativity  avatars of human creativity  and that's what we have to reconcile in our minds  how these things fit together. The difference between arts and sciences is not analytical versus intuitive  right  E MC squared required an intuitive leap  and then you had to do the analysis afterwards. Einstein said  in fact   The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science.  Dance requires us to express and want to express the jubilation in life  but then you have to figure out  exactly what movement do I do to make sure that it comes across correctly  The difference between arts and sciences is also not constructive versus deconstructive  right  A lot of people think of the sciences as deconstructive. You have to pull things apart. And yeah  sub atomic physics is deconstructive. You literally try to tear atoms apart to understand what's inside of them. But sculpture  from what I understand from great sculptors  is deconstructive  because you see a piece and you remove what doesn't need to be there. Biotechnology is constructive. Orchestral arranging is constructive. So in fact we use constructive and deconstructive techniques in everything. The difference between science and the arts is not that they are different sides of the same coin  even  or even different parts of the same continuum  but rather they're manifestations of the same thing. Different quantum states of an atom  Or maybe if I want to be more   st century I could say that they are different harmonic resonances of a superstring. But we'll leave that alone.  Laughter  They spring from the same source. The arts and sciences are avatars of human creativity. It's our attempt as humans to build an understanding of the universe  the world around us. It's our attempt to influence things  the universe internal to ourselves and external to us. The sciences  to me  are manifestations of our attempt to express or share our understanding  our experience  to influence the universe external to ourselves. It doesn't rely on us as individuals. It's the universe  as experienced by everyone  and the arts manifest our desire  our attempt to share or influence others through experiences that are peculiar to us as individuals. Let me say it again another way  science provides an understanding of a universal experience  and arts provides a universal understanding of a personal experience. That's what we have to think about  that they're all part of us  they're all part of a continuum. It's not just the tools  it's not just the sciences  you know  the mathematics and the numerical stuff and the statistics  because we heard  very much on this stage  people talked about music being mathematical. Right  Arts don't just use clay  aren't the only ones that use clay  light and sound and movement. They use analysis as well. So people might say  well  I still like that intuitive versus analytical thing  because everybody wants to do the right brain  left brain thing  right  We've all been accused of being right brained or left brained at some point in time  depending on who we disagreed with.  Laughter  You know  people say intuitive  you know that's like you're in touch with nature  in touch with yourself and relationships. Analytical  you put your mind to work  and I'm going to tell you a little secret. You all know this though  but sometimes people use this analysis idea  that things are outside of ourselves  to be  say  that this is what we're going to elevate as the true  most important sciences  right  And then you have artists  and you all know this is true as well  artists will say things about scientists because they say they're too concrete  they're disconnected with the world. But  we've even had that here on stage  so don't act like you don't know what I'm talking about.  Laughter  We had folks talking about the Flat Earth Society and flower arrangers  so there's this whole dichotomy that we continue to carry along  even when we know better. And folks say we need to choose either or. But it would really be foolish to choose either one  right  Intuitive versus analytical  That's a foolish choice. It's foolish  just like trying to choose between being realistic or idealistic. You need both in life. Why do people do this  I'm just gonna quote a molecular biologist  Sydney Brenner  who's    years old so he can say this. He said   It's always important to distinguish between chastity and impotence.  Now...  Laughter  I want to share with you a little equation  okay  How do understanding science and the arts fit into our lives and what's going on and the things that we're talking about here at the design conference  and this is a little thing I came up with  understanding and our resources and our will cause us to have outcomes. Our understanding is our science  our arts  our religion  how we see the universe around us  our resources  our money  our labor  our minerals  those things that are out there in the world we have to work with. But more importantly  there's our will. This is our vision  our aspirations of the future  our hopes  our dreams  our struggles and our fears. Our successes and our failures influence what we do with all of those  and to me  design and engineering  craftsmanship and skilled labor  are all the things that work on this to have our outcome  which is our human quality of life. Where do we want the world to be  And guess what  Regardless of how we look at this  whether we look at arts and sciences are separate or different  they're both being influenced now and they're both having problems. I did a project called S.E.E.ing the Future  Science  Engineering and Education  and it was looking at how to shed light on most effective use of government funding. We got a bunch of scientists in all stages of their careers. They came to Dartmouth College  where I was teaching  and they talked about with theologians and financiers  what are some of the issues of public funding for science and engineering research  What's most important about it  There are some ideas that emerged that I think have really powerful parallels to the arts. The first thing they said was that the circumstances that we find ourselves in today in the sciences and engineering that made us world leaders is very different than the '  s  the '  s  and the '  s and the '  s when we emerged as world leaders  because we're no longer in competition with fascism  with Soviet style communism  and by the way that competition wasn't just military  it included social competition and political competition as well  that allowed us to look at space as one of those platforms to prove that our social system was better. Another thing they talked about was the infrastructure that supports the sciences is becoming obsolete. We look at universities and colleges  small  mid sized community colleges across the country  their laboratories are becoming obsolete  and this is where we train most of our science workers and our researchers  and our teachers  by the way  and then that there's a media that doesn't support the dissemination of any more than the most mundane and inane of information. There's pseudo science  crop circles  alien autopsy  haunted houses  or disasters. And that's what we see. And this isn't really the information you need to operate in everyday life and figure out how to participate in this democracy and determine what's going on. They also said that there's a change in the corporate mentality. Whereas government money had always been there for basic science and engineering research  we also counted on some companies to do some basic research  but what's happened now is companies put more energy into short term product development than they do in basic engineering and science research. And education is not keeping up. In K through     people are taking out wet labs. They think if we put a computer in the room it's going to take the place of actually  we're mixing the acids  we're growing the potatoes. And government funding is decreasing in spending and then they're saying  let's have corporations take over  and that's not true. Government funding should at least do things like recognize cost benefits of basic science and engineering research. We have to know that we have a responsibility as global citizens in this world. We have to look at the education of humans. We need to build our resources today to make sure that they're trained so that they understand the importance of these things  and we have to support the vitality of science  and that doesn't mean that everything has to have one thing that's going to go on  or we know exactly what's going to be the outcome of it  but that we support the vitality and the intellectual curiosity that goes along  and if you think about those parallels to the arts  the competition with the Bolshoi Ballet spurred the Joffrey and the New York City Ballet to become better. Infrastructure museums  theaters  movie houses across the country are disappearing. We have more television stations with less to watch  we have more money spent on rewrites to get old television programs in the movies. We have corporate funding now that  when it goes to some company  when it goes to support the arts  it almost requires that the product be part of the picture that the artist draws  and we have stadiums that are named over and over again by corporations. In Houston  we're trying to figure out what to do with that Enron Stadium thing. in the schools is disappearing  and we have a government that seems like it's gutting the NEA and other programs  so we have to really stop and think  what are we trying to do with the sciences and the arts  There's a need to revitalize them. We have to pay attention to it. I just want to tell you really quickly what I'm doing. I want to tell you what I've been doing a little bit since... I feel this need to sort of integrate some of the ideas that I've had and run across over time. One of the things that I found out is that there's a need to repair the dichotomy between the mind and body as well. My mother always told me  you have to be observant  know what's going on in your mind and your body  and as a dancer I had this tremendous faith in my ability to know my body  just as I knew how to sense colors. Then I went to medical school  and I was supposed to just go on what the machine said about bodies. You know  you would ask patients questions and some people would tell you   Don't  don't  don't listen to what the patients said.  We know that patients know and understand their bodies better  but these days we're trying to divorce them from that idea. We have to reconcile the patient's knowledge of their body with physician's measurements. We had someone talk about measuring emotions and getting machines to figure out what  to keep us from acting crazy. Right  No  we shouldn't measure  we shouldn't use machines to measure road rage and then do something to keep us from engaging in it. Maybe we can have machines help us to recognize that we have road rage and then we need to know how to control that without the machines. We even need to be able to recognize that without the machines. What I'm very concerned about is how do we bolster our self awareness as humans  as biological organisms  Michael Moschen spoke of having to teach and learn how to feel with my eyes  to see with my hands. We have all kinds of possibilities to use our senses by  and that's what we have to do. That's what I want to do  is to try to use bioinstrumentation  those kind of things to help our senses in what we do  and that's the work I've been doing now as a company called BioSentient Corporation. I figured I'd have to do that ad  because I'm an entrepreneur  because entrepreneur says that that's somebody who does what they want to do because they're not broke enough that they have to get a real job. with BioSentient Corporation trying to figure out how do we integrate these things  Let me finish by saying that my personal design issue for the future is really about integrating  to think about that intuitive and that analytical. The arts and sciences are not separate. High school physics lesson before you leave. High school physics teacher used to hold up a ball. She would say this ball has potential energy  but nothing will happen to it  it can't do any work until I drop it and it changes states. I like to think of ideas as potential energy. They're really wonderful  but nothing will happen until we risk putting them into action. This conference is filled with wonderful ideas. We're going to share lots of things with people  but nothing's going to happen until we risk putting those ideas into action. We need to revitalize the arts and sciences of today  we need to take responsibility for the future. We can't hide behind saying it's just for company profits  or it's just a business  or I'm an artist or an academician. Here's how you judge what you're doing. I talked about that balance between intuitive  analytical. Fran Lebowitz  my favorite cynic  she said the three questions of greatest concern  now I'm going to add on to design  is   Is it attractive   That's the intuitive.  Is it amusing   The analytical.  And does it know its place   The balance. Thank you very much. This is a sculpture I made  which is a way of  kind of  freeing a form into an object that has different degrees of freedom. So  it can balance on a point. This is a bronze ball  an aluminum arm here  and then this wooden disk. And the wooden disk was really thought about as something that you'd want to hold on to  and that would glide easily through your hands. The aluminum is because it's very light. The bronze is nice hard  durable material that could roll on the ground. Inside of the bronze ball there's a lead weight that is free swinging on an axle that's on two bearings that pass in between  across it  like this  that counterbalance this weight. So it allows it to roll. And the sphere has that balance property that it always sort of stays still and looks the same from every direction. But if you put something on top of it  it disbalances it. And so it would tip over. But in this case because the interior is free swinging in relation to the sphere  it can stand up on one point. And then there was a second level to this object  which is that it    I wanted it to convey some proportions that I was interested in  which is the diameter of the Moon and the diameter of the Earth in proportion to each other. I was exploring  really early on  wanting to make things float in the air. And I thought up a lot of ideas. This is sculpture that I made that    it's magnetically levitated. The thing is  is that it's slightly dangerous. Normally it's sort of cordoned off when it's in a museum. But it's uh    let's see if I can manipulate it a little bit without  um    oops. So this is just floating  floating on a permanent magnetic field  which stabilizes it in all directions. Except there is a slight tether here  which keeps it from going over the top of its field. It's sort of surfing on a magnetic field at the crest of a wave. And that's what supports the object and keeps it stable. I think we could roll the tape  admin. I have a sort of a collection of videos that I took of different installations  which I could narrate. This is a sculpture of the Sun and the Earth  in proportion. Representing that eight and a half minutes that it takes light and gravity to connect the two. So here is the Earth. It's a little less than a millimeter that was turned of solid bronze. And here is a similar sculpture. That's the Sun at that end. And then in a series of    balls  it reduces  proportionately    each ball and the spaces between them reduce proportionately  until they get down to this little Earth. This is in a sculpture park in Taejon. This one is about the Moon and then the distance to the Earth  in proportion also. This is a little stone ball  floating. As you can see the little tether  that it's also magnetically levitated. And then this is the first part of    this is     spheres  since the Sun is     times the diameter of the Earth. And so this is the size of the Sun. And then each of these little spheres is the size of the Earth in proportion to the Sun. It's made up of    concentric shells. Each one has    spheres. This is in the courtyard of a twelfth century alchemist. I was thinking that the Sun is kind of the ultimate alchemist.  Laughter  So this  again  is on the subject    a slice from the equator of the Earth. And then the Moon in the center  and it's floating. And this is in France. This is in Sapporo. It's balancing on a shaft and a ball  right at the center of gravity  or just slightly above the center of gravity  which means that the lower half of the object is just a little bit more weighty. So you can see it rotating here. It weighs about a ton or over a ton. It's made of stainless steel  quite thick. But it's being balanced like that in equilibrium. It's susceptible to motion by the air currents. This is another species of work that I do. These are these arrays. These spheres are all suspended  but they have magnets horizontally in them that make them all like compasses. So all the red sides  for example  face one direction  south. And the blue side  the compliment  faces the other way. So as you turn around you're seeing different colors. This is based on the structure of a diamond. It was a diamond cell structure was the point of departure. And then there were kind of large spaces in the hollows between the atoms. And so I placed one more element of each one of them. These were white spheres. Then I had video projectors that were projecting intermittently onto the spheres. So they would catch parts of the images  and make sort of three dimensional color volumes  as you walk through it  through the object. This is something I did of a tactile communication system. It was the idea of isolating the tactile component of sculpture  and then putting it into a communication system. This is an idea of moving a sculpture  a ball  that would be directed around the room by a computer. This is a clock I designed. It has Buckminster Fuller's Dymaxion Map edited here. It turns once per day in synchrony with the Earth. And then  this is like projects that are harder to build. This has a diamond bottomed lake. So it's a floating island with water  fresh water  that can fly from place to place. This would be grown  I suppose  with nanotechnology in the future sometime. In the course of doing my work I sort of have a broad range of interests. And some of it is just the idea of creating media    media as a sculpture  something that would keep the sculpture fresh and ever changing  by just creating the media that the sculpture is made of. And I had a lot of    always interested in the concept of a crystal ball. And the idea that you could see things inside of a crystal ball and predict the future    or a television set  where it's sort of like a magic box where anything can appear. I had thought about  a long time ago  in the late '  s    when I was just starting out  I was under the influence of thinking about Buckminster Fuller's grand project for an electric globe across from the United Nations    and other things that were happening  the space program at that time  and Whole Earth Catalog  things like that. I was thinking about mass produced spherical television sets that could be linked to orbiting camera satellites. So if we could roll the next film here. This has evolved over the years in a lot of different iterations. But this the current version of it  is a flying airship that is about    meters in diameter  about     feet in diameter. The whole surface of it is covered with    million diodes  red  blue  and green  that allow you to have a high resolution picture  visible in daylight. I came with a plan. I brought it to Paul MacCready's company AeroVironment to do a feasibility study  and they analyzed it  and came up with a lot of innovative ideas about how to propel it. So we have a physical plan of how to make this actually happen. This is the control room inside of the ship. The idea of this air genie is  it's something that can just transform and become anything. It's like a traveling show. It has speakers on it. And it has cameras over the surface of it. So it can see its environment  and then it can mimic its environment and disappear. Here the legs are retracting. The cabin is open or closed  as you like. It weighs about    tons. It has on board generators. It can generate about a million kilowatts  in order to be bright enough to be visible in daylight. The idea of it is to make a kind of a traveling show. It really would be dedicated to the arts and to interacting. There would be on board a crew of artists  musicians  that would allow the thing to become actually kind of a conscious object that would respond to the moment  and to interact as an entity that was aware  that could communicate. It's completely silent and nonpolluting. It has electric motors with a novel propulsion system. It could be interacted with large crowds in different ways. Primarily I would be interested in how it would interact with  say  going to a college campus  and then being used as a way of talking about the earth sciences  the world  the situation of the globe. The default image on the object would probably be a high resolution Earth image. But then one could interact with that and show plate tectonics or global warming issues  or migrations    all of the things that we're concerned with today. And then at night the idea is that it would be used as kind of a rave situation  where the people could cut loose  and the music and the lights  and everything. So it could land in a park  for example. Or this could represent a college green. And then it would have a corresponding website that would show the itinerary of this. And so interacting with the same kind of imagery. It would also be able to be an open code  so people could interact with it. It would be forum for people's ideas about what they would like to see on a giant screen of this type. So that's pretty much it. Okay. Thank you. Last year I showed these two slides so that demonstrate that the arctic ice cap  which for most of the last three million years has been the size of the lower    states  has shrunk by    percent. But this understates the seriousness of this particular problem because it doesn't show the thickness of the ice. The arctic ice cap is  in a sense  the beating heart of the global climate system. It expands in winter and contracts in summer. The next slide I show you will be a rapid fast forward of what's happened over the last    years. The permanent ice is marked in red. As you see  it expands to the dark blue    that's the annual ice in winter  and it contracts in summer. The so called permanent ice  five years old or older  you can see is almost like blood  spilling out of the body here. In    years it's gone from this  to this. This is a problem because the warming heats up the frozen ground around the Arctic Ocean  where there is a massive amount of frozen carbon which  when it thaws  is turned into methane by microbes. Compared to the total amount of global warming pollution in the atmosphere  that amount could double if we cross this tipping point. Already in some shallow lakes in Alaska  methane is actively bubbling up out of the water. Professor Katey Walter from the University of Alaska went out with another team to another shallow lake last winter. Video  Whoa   Laughter  Al Gore  She's okay. The question is whether we will be. And one reason is  this enormous heat sink heats up Greenland from the north. This is an annual melting river. But the volumes are much larger than ever. This is the Kangerlussuaq River in southwest Greenland. If you want to know how sea level rises from land base ice melting this is where it reaches the sea. These flows are increasing very rapidly. At the other end of the planet  Antarctica the largest mass of ice on the planet. Last month scientists reported the entire continent is now in negative ice balance. And west Antarctica cropped up on top some under sea islands  is particularly rapid in its melting. That's equal to    feet of sea level  as is Greenland. In the Himalayas  the third largest mass of ice  at the top you see new lakes  which a few years ago were glaciers.    percent of all the people in the world get half of their drinking water from that melting flow. In the Andes  this glacier is the source of drinking water for this city. The flows have increased. But when they go away  so does much of the drinking water. In California there has been a    percent decline in the Sierra snowpack. This is hitting the reservoirs. And the predictions  as you've read  are serious. This drying around the world has lead to a dramatic increase in fires. And the disasters around the world have been increasing at an absolutely extraordinary and unprecedented rate. Four times as many in the last    years as in the previous   . This is a completely unsustainable pattern. If you look at in the context of history you can see what this is doing. In the last five years we've added    million tons of CO  every    hours       million tons every day to the oceans. Look carefully at the area of the eastern Pacific  from the Americas  extending westward  and on either side of the Indian subcontinent  where there is a radical depletion of oxygen in the oceans. The biggest single cause of global warming  along with deforestation  which is    percent of it  is the burning of fossil fuels. Oil is a problem  and coal is the most serious problem. The United States is one of the two largest emitters  along with China. And the proposal has been to build a lot more coal plants. But we're beginning to see a sea change. Here are the ones that have been cancelled in the last few years with some green alternatives proposed. However there is a political battle in our country. And the coal industries and the oil industries spent a quarter of a billion dollars in the last calendar year promoting clean coal  which is an oxymoron. That image reminded me of something. Around Christmas  in my home in Tennessee  a billion gallons of coal sludge was spilled. You probably saw it on the news. This  all over the country  is the second largest waste stream in America. This happened around Christmas. One of the coal industry's ads around Christmas was this one. Video     Frosty the coal man is a jolly  happy soul. He's abundant here in America  and he helps our economy grow. Frosty the coal man is getting cleaner everyday. He's affordable and adorable  and workers keep their pay. Al Gore  This is the source of much of the coal in West Virginia. The largest mountaintop miner is the head of Massey Coal. Video  Don Blankenship  Let me be clear about it. Al Gore  Nancy Pelosi  Harry Reid  they don't know what they're talking about. Al Gore  So the Alliance for Climate Protection has launched two campaigns. This is one of them  part of one of them. Video  Actor  At COALergy we view climate change as a very serious threat to our business. That's why we've made it our primary goal to spend a large sum of money on an advertising effort to help bring out and complicate the truth about coal. The fact is  coal isn't dirty. We think it's clean    smells good  too. So don't worry about climate change. Leave that up to us. Video  Actor  Clean coal    you've heard a lot about it. So let's take a tour of this state of the art clean coal facility. Amazing  The machinery is kind of loud. But that's the sound of clean coal technology. And while burning coal is one of the leading causes of global warming  the remarkable clean coal technology you see here changes everything. Take a good long look  this is today's clean coal technology. Al Gore  Finally  the positive alternative meshes with our economic challenge and our national security challenge. Video  Narrator  America is in crisis    the economy  national security  the climate crisis. The thread that links them all  our addiction to carbon based fuels  like dirty coal and foreign oil. But now there is a bold new solution to get us out of this mess. Repower America with     percent clean electricity within    years. A plan to put America back to work  make us more secure  and help stop global warming. Finally  a solution that's big enough to solve our problems. Repower America. Find out more. Al Gore  This is the last one. Video  Narrator  It's about repowering America. One of the fastest ways to cut our dependence on old dirty fuels that are killing our planet. Man  Future's over here. Wind  sun  a new energy grid. Man     New investments to create high paying jobs. Narrator  Repower America. It's time to get real. Al Gore  There is an old African proverb that says   If you want to go quickly  go alone. If you want to go far  go together.  We need to go far  quickly. Thank you very much. I'm not at all a cook. So don't fear  this is not going to be a cooking demonstration. But I do want to talk to you about something that I think is dear to all of us. And that is bread    something which is as simple as our basic  most fundamental human staple. And I think few of us spend the day without eating bread in some form. Unless you're on one of these Californian low carb diets  bread is standard. Bread is not only standard in the Western diet. As I will show to you  it is actually the mainstay of modern life. So I'm going to bake bread for you. In the meantime I'm also talking to you  so my life is going to be complicated. Bear with me. First of all  a little bit of audience participation. I have two loaves of bread here. One is a supermarket standard  white bread  pre packaged  which I'm told is called a Wonderbread. I didn't know this word until I arrived. And this is more or less  a whole meal  handmade  small bakery loaf of bread. Here we go. I want to see a show of hands. Who prefers the whole meal bread  Okay let me do this differently. Is anybody preferring the Wonderbread at all  I have two tentative male hands. Okay  now the question is really  why is this so  And I think it is because we feel that this kind of bread really is about authenticity. It's about a traditional way of living. A way that is perhaps more real  more honest. This is an image from Tuscany  where we feel agriculture is still about beauty. And life is really  too. And this is about good taste  good traditions. Why do we have this image  Why do we feel that this is more true than this  Well I think it has a lot to do with our history. In the        years since agriculture evolved  most of our ancestors have actually been agriculturalists or they were closely related to food production. And we have this mythical image of how life was in rural areas in the past. Art has helped us to maintain that kind of image. It was a mythical past. Of course  the reality is quite different. These poor farmers working the land by hand or with their animals  had yield levels that are comparable to the poorest farmers today in West Africa. But we have  somehow  in the course of the last few centuries  or even decades  started to cultivate an image of a mythical  rural agricultural past. It was only     years ago that we had the advent of the Industrial Revolution. And while I'm starting to make some bread for you here  it's very important to understand what that revolution did to us. It brought us power. It brought us mechanization  fertilizers. And it actually drove up our yields. And even sort of horrible things  like picking beans by hand  can now be done automatically. All that is a real  great improvement  as we shall see. Of course we also  particularly in the last decade  managed to envelop the world in a dense chain of supermarkets  in a chain of global trade. And it means that you now eat products  which can come from all around the world. That is the reality of our modern life. Now you may prefer this loaf of bread. Excuse my hands but this is how it is. But actually the real relevant bread  historically  is this white Wonder loaf. And don't despise the white bread because it really  I think  symbolizes the fact that bread and food have become plentiful and affordable to all. And that is a feat that we are not really conscious of that much. But it has changed the world. This tiny bread that is tasteless in some ways and has a lot of problems has changed the world. So what is happening  Well the best way to look at that is to do a tiny bit of simplistic statistics. With the advent of the Industrial Revolution with modernization of agriculture in the last few decades  since the     s  food availability  per head  in this world  has increased by    percent. And the world population in the meantime has doubled. That means that we have now more food available than ever before in human history. And that is the result  directly  of being so successful at increasing the scale and volume of our production. And this is true  as you can see  for all countries  including the so called developing countries. What happened to our bread in the meantime  As food became plentiful here  it also meant that we were able to decrease the number of people working in agriculture to something like  on average  in the high income countries  five percent or less of the population. In the U.S. only one percent of the people are actually farmers. And it frees us all up to do other things    to sit at TED meetings and not to worry about our food. That is  historically  a really unique situation. Never before has the responsibility to feed the world been in the hands of so few people. And never before have so many people been oblivious of that fact. So as food became more plentiful  bread became cheaper. And as it became cheaper  bread manufacturers decided to add in all kinds of things. We added in more sugar. We add in raisins and oil and milk and all kinds of things to make bread  from a simple food into kind of a support for calories. And today  bread now is associated with obesity  which is very strange. It is the basic  most fundamental food that we've had in the last ten thousand years. Wheat is the most important crop    the first crop we domesticated and the most important crop we still grow today. But this is now this strange concoction of high calories. And that's not only true in this country  it is true all over the world. Bread has migrated to tropical countries  where the middle classes now eat French rolls and hamburgers and where the commuters find bread much more handy to use than rice or cassava. So bread has become from a main staple  a source of calories associated with obesity and also a source of modernity  of modern life. And the whiter the bread  in many countries  the better it is. So this is the story of bread as we know it now. But of course the price of mass production has been that we moved large scale. And large scale has meant destruction of many of our landscapes  destruction of biodiversity    still a lonely emu here in the Brazilian cerrado soybean fields. The costs have been tremendous    water pollution  all the things you know about  destruction of our habitats. What we need to do is to go back to understanding what our food is about. And this is where I have to query all of you. How many of you can actually tell wheat apart from other cereals  How many of you actually can make a bread in this way  without starting with a bread machine or just some kind of packaged flavor  Can you actually bake bread  Do you know how much a loaf of bread actually costs  We have become very removed from what our bread really is  which  again  evolutionarily speaking  is very strange. In fact not many of you know that our bread  of course  was not a European invention. It was invented by farmers in Iraq and Syria in particular. The tiny spike on the left to the center is actually the forefather of wheat. This is where it all comes from  and where these farmers who actually  ten thousand years ago  put us on the road of bread. Now it is not surprising that with this massification and large scale production  there is a counter movement that emerged    very much also here in California. The counter movement says   Let's go back to this. Let's go back to traditional farming. Let's go back to small scale  to farmers' markets  small bakeries and all that.  Wonderful. Don't we all agree  I certainly agree. I would love to go back to Tuscany to this kind of traditional setting  gastronomy  good food. But this is a fallacy. And the fallacy comes from idealizing a past that we have forgotten about. If we do this  if we want to stay with traditional small scale farming we are going  actually  to relegate these poor farmers and their husbands    among whom I have lived for many years  working without electricity and water  to try to improve their food production    we relegate them to poverty. What they want are implements to increase their production  something to fertilize the soil  something to protect their crop and to bring it to a market. We cannot just think that small scale is the solution to the world food problem. It's a luxury solution for us who can afford it  if you want to afford it. In fact we do not want this poor woman to work the land like this. If we say just small scale production  as is the tendency here  to go back to local food means that a poor man like Hans Rosling cannot even eat oranges anymore because in Scandinavia we don't have oranges. So local food production is out. But also we do not want to relegate to poverty in the rural areas. And we do not want to relegate the urban poor to starvation. So we must find other solutions. One of our problems is that world food production needs to increase very rapidly    doubling by about     . The main driver of that is actually meat. And meat consumption in Southeast Asia and China in particular is what drives the prices of cereals. That need for animal protein is going to continue. We can discuss alternatives in another talk  perhaps one day  but this is our driving force. So what can we do  Can we find a solution to produce more  Yes. But we need mechanization. And I'm making a real plea here. I feel so strongly that you cannot ask a small farmer to work the land and bend over to grow a hectare of rice          times  just to plant a crop and weed it. You cannot ask people to work under these conditions. We need clever low key mechanization that avoids the problems of the large scale mechanization that we've had. So what can we do  We must feed three billion people in cities. We will not do that through small farmers' markets because these people have no small farmers' markets at their disposal. They have low incomes. And they benefit from cheap  affordable  safe and diverse food. That's what we must aim for in the next    to    years. But yes there are some solutions. And let me just do one simple conceptual thing  if I plot science as a proxy for control of the production process and scale. What you see is that we've started in the left hand corner with traditional agriculture  which was sort of small scale and low control. We've moved towards large scale and very high control. What I want us to do is to keep up the science and even get more science in there but go to a kind of regional scale    not just in terms of the scale of the fields  but in terms of the entire food network. That's where we should move. And the ultimate may be  but it doesn't apply to cereals  that we have entirely closed ecosystems    the horticultural systems right at the top left hand corner. So we need to think differently about agriculture science. Agriculture science for most people    and there are not many farmers among you here    has this name of being bad  of being about pollution  about large scale  about the destruction of the environment. That is not necessary. We need more science and not less. And we need good science. So what kind of science can we have  Well first of all I think we can do much better on the existing technologies. Use biotechnology where useful  particularly in pest and disease resistance. There are also robots  for example  who can recognize weeds with a resolution of half an inch. We have much cleverer irrigation. We do not need to spill the water if we don't want to. And we need to think very dispassionately about the comparative advantages of small scale and large scale. We need to think that land is multi functional. It has different functions. There are different ways in which we must use it    for residential  for nature  for agriculture purposes. And we also need to re examine livestock. Go regional and go to urban food systems. I want to see fish ponds in parking lots and basements. I want to have horticulture and greenhouses on top of residential areas. And I want to use the energy that comes from those greenhouses and from the fermentation of crops to heat our residential areas. There are all kinds of ways we can do it. We cannot solve the world food problem by using biological agriculture. But we can do a lot more. And the main thing that I would really ask all of you as you go back to your countries  or as you stay here  ask your government for an integrated food policy. Food is as important as energy  as security  as the environment. Everything is linked together. So we can do that. In fact in a densely populated country like the River Delta  where I live in the Netherlands  we have combined these functions. So this is not science fiction. We can combine things even in a social sense of making the rural areas more accessible to people    to house  for example  the chronically sick. There is all kinds of things we can do. But there is something you must do. It's not enough for me to say   Let's get more bold science into agriculture.  You must go back and think about your own food chain. Talk to farmers. When was the last time you went to a farm and talked to a farmer  Talk to people in restaurants. Understand where you are in the food chain  where your food comes from. Understand that you are part of this enormous chain of events. And that frees you up to do other things. And above all  to me  food is about respect. It's about understanding  when you eat  that there are also many people who are still in this situation  who are still struggling for their daily food. And the kind of simplistic solutions that we sometimes have  to think that doing everything by hand is going to be the solution  is really not morally justified. We need to help to lift them out of poverty. We need to make them proud of being a farmer because they allow us to survive. Never before  as I said  has the responsibility for food been in the hands of so few. And never before have we had the luxury of taking it for granted because it is now so cheap. And I think there is nobody else who has expressed better  to me  the idea that food  in the end  in our own tradition  is something holy. It's not about nutrients and calories. It's about sharing. It's about honesty. It's about identity. Who said this so beautifully was Mahatma Gandhi     years ago  when he spoke about bread. He did not speak about rice  in India. He said   To those who have to go without two meals a day  God can only appear as bread.  And so as I'm finishing my bread here    and I've been baking it  and I'll try not to burn my hands. Let me share with those of you here in the first row. Let me share some of the food with you. Take some of my bread. And as you eat it  and as you try it    please come and stand up. Have some of it. I want you to think that every bite connects you to the past and the future  to these anonymous farmers  that first bred the first wheat varieties  and to the farmers of today  who've been making this. And you don't even know who they are. Every meal you eat contains ingredients from all across the world. Everything makes us so privileged  that we can eat this food  that we don't struggle every day. And that  I think  evolutionarily speaking is unique. We've never had that before. So enjoy your bread. Eat it  and feel privileged. Thank you very much. So sometimes I get invited to give weird talks. I got invited to speak to the people who dress up in big stuffed animal costumes to perform at sporting events. Unfortunately I couldn't go. But it got me thinking about the fact that these guys  at least most of them  know what it is that they do for a living. What they do is they dress up as stuffed animals and entertain people at sporting events. Shortly after that I got invited to speak at the convention of the people who make balloon animals. And again  I couldn't go. But it's a fascinating group. They make balloon animals. There is a big schism between the ones who make gospel animals and porn animals  but    they do a lot of really cool stuff with balloons. Sometimes they get in trouble  but not often. And the other thing about these guys is  they also know what they do for a living. They make balloon animals. But what do we do for a living  What exactly to the people watching this do every day  And I want to argue that what we do is we try to change everything. That we try to find a piece of the status quo    something that bothers us  something that needs to be improved  something that is itching to be changed    and we change it. We try to make big  permanent  important change. But we don't think about it that way. And we haven't spent a lot of time talking about what that process is like. And I've been studying it for a couple years. And I want to share a couple stories with you today. First  about a guy named Nathan Winograd. Nathan was the number two person at the San Francisco SPCA. And what you may not know about the history of the SPCA is  it was founded to kill dogs and cats. Cities gave them a charter to get rid of the stray animals on the street and destroy them. In a typical year four million dogs and cats were killed  most of them within    hours of being scooped off of the street. Nathan and his boss saw this  and they could not tolerate it. So they set out to make San Francisco a no kill city  create an entire city where every dog and cat  unless it was ill or dangerous  would be adopted  not killed. And everyone said it was impossible. Nathan and his boss went to the city council to get a change in the ordinance. And people from SPCAs and humane shelters around the country flew to San Francisco to testify against them    to say it would hurt the movement and it was inhumane. They persisted. And Nathan went directly to the community. He connected with people who cared about this  nonprofessionals  people with passion. And within just a couple years  San Francisco became the first no kill city  running no deficit  completely supported by the community. Nathan left and went to Tompkins County  New York    a place as different from San Francisco as you can be and still be in the United States. And he did it again. He went from being a glorified dogcatcher to completely transforming the community. And then he went to North Carolina and did it again. And he went to Reno and he did it again. And when I think about what Nathan did  and when I think about what people here do  I think about ideas. And I think about the idea that creating an idea  spreading an idea has a lot behind it. I don't know if you've ever been to a Jewish wedding  but what they do is  they take a light bulb and they smash it. Now there is a bunch of reasons for that  and stories about it. But one reason is because it indicates a change  from before to after. It is a moment in time. And I want to argue that we are living through and are right at the key moment of a change in the way ideas are created and spread and implemented. We started with the factory idea  that you could change the whole world if you had an efficient factory that could churn out change. We then went to the TV idea  that said if you had a big enough mouthpiece  if you could get on TV enough times  if you could buy enough ads  you could win. And now we're in this new model of leadership  where the way we make change is not by using money or power to lever a system  but by leading. So let me tell you about the three cycles. The first one is the factory cycle. Henry Ford comes up with a really cool idea. It enables him to hire men who used to get paid    cents a day and pay them five dollars a day. Because he's got an efficient enough factory. Well with that sort of advantage you can churn out a lot of cars. You can make a lot of change. You can get roads built. You can change the fabric of an entire country. That the essence of what you're doing is you need ever cheaper labor  and ever faster machines. And the problem we've run into is  we're running out of both. Ever cheaper labor and ever faster machines. So we shift gears for a minute  and say   I know  television  advertising. Push push. Take a good idea and push it on the world. I have a better mousetrap. And if I can just get enough money to tell enough people  I'll sell enough.  And you can build an entire industry on that. If necessary you can put babies in your ads. If necessary you can use babies to sell other stuff. And if babies don't work  you can use doctors. But be careful. Because you don't want to get an unfortunate juxtaposition  where you're talking about one thing instead of the other. This model requires you to act like the king  like the person in the front of the room throwing things to the peons in the back. That you are in charge  and you're going to tell people what to do next. The quick little diagram of it is  you're up here  and you are pushing it out to the world. This method    mass marketing    requires average ideas  because you're going to the masses  and plenty of ads. What we've done as spammers is tried to hypnotize everyone into buying our idea  hypnotize everyone into donating to our cause  hypnotize everyone into voting for our candidate. And  unfortunately  it doesn't work so well anymore either. But there is good news around the corner    really good news. I call it the idea of tribes. What tribes are  is a very simple concept that goes back        years. It's about leading and connecting people and ideas. And it's something that people have wanted forever. Lots of people are used to having a spiritual tribe  or a church tribe  having a work tribe  having a community tribe. But now  thanks to the internet  thanks to the explosion of mass media  thanks to a lot of other things that are bubbling through our society around the world  tribes are everywhere. The Internet was supposed to homogenize everyone by connecting us all. Instead what it's allowed is silos of interest. So you've got the red hat ladies over here. You've got the red hat triathletes over there. You've got the organized armies over here. You've got the disorganized rebels over here. You've got people in white hats making food. And people in white hats sailing boats. The point is that you can find Ukrainian folk dancers and connect with them  because you want to be connected. That people on the fringes can find each other  connect and go somewhere. Every town that has a volunteer fire department understands this way of thinking. Now it turns out this is a legitimate non photoshopped photo. People I know who are firemen told me that this is not uncommon. And that what firemen do to train sometimes is they take a house that is going to be torn down  and they burn it down instead  and practice putting it out. But they always stop and take a picture. You know the pirate tribe is a fascinating one. They've got their own flag. They've got the eye patches. You can tell when you're running into someone in a tribe. And it turns out that it's tribes    not money  not factories    that can change our world  that can change politics  that can align large numbers of people. Not because you force them to do something against their will  but because they wanted to connect. That what we do for a living now  all of us  I think  is find something worth changing  and then assemble tribes that assemble tribes that spread the idea and spread the idea. And it becomes something far bigger than ourselves  it becomes a movement. So when Al Gore set out to change the world again  he didn't do it by himself. And he didn't do it by buying a lot of ads. He did it by creating a movement. Thousands of people around the country who could give his presentation for him  because he can't be in     or     or     cities in each night. You don't need everyone. What Kevin Kelley has taught us is you just need  I don't know  a thousand true fans    a thousand people who care enough that they will get you the next round and the next round and the next round. And that means that the idea you create  the product you create  the movement you create isn't for everyone  it's not a mass thing. That's not what this is about. What it's about instead is finding the true believers. It's easy to look at what I've said so far  and say   Wait a minute  I don't have what it takes to be that kind of leader.  So here are two leaders. They don't have a lot in common. They're about the same age. But that's about it. What they did  though  is each in their own way  created a different way of navigating your way through technology. So some people will go out and get people to be on one team. And some people will get people to be on the other team. It also informs the decisions you make when you make products or services. You know  this is one of my favorite devices. But what a shame that it's not organized to help authors create movements. What would happen if  when you're using your Kindle  you could see the comments and quotes and notes from all the other people reading the same book as you in that moment. Or from your book group. Or from your friends  or from the circle you want. What would happen if authors  or people with ideas could use version two  which comes out on Monday  and use it to organize people who want to talk about something. Now there is a million things I could share with you about the mechanics here. But let me just try a couple. The Beatles did not invent teenagers. They merely decided to lead them. That most movements  most leadership that we're doing is about finding a group that's disconnected but already has a yearning    not persuading people to want something they don't have yet. When Diane Hatz worked on  The Meatrix   her video that spread all across the internet about the way farm animals are treated  she didn't invent the idea of being a vegan. She didn't invent the idea of caring about this issue. But she helped organize people  and helped turn it into a movement. Hugo Chavez did not invent the disaffected middle and lower class of Venezuela. He merely led them. Bob Marley did not invent Rastafarians. He just stepped up and said   Follow me.  Derek Sivers invented CD Baby  which allowed independent musicians to have a place to sell their music without selling out to the man    to have place to take the mission they already wanted to go to  and connect with each other. What all these people have in common is that they are heretics. That heretics look at the status quo and say   This will not stand. I can't abide this status quo. I am willing to stand up and be counted and move things forward. I see what the status quo is  I don't like it.  That instead of looking at all the little rules and following each one of them  that instead of being what I call a sheepwalker    somebody who's half asleep  following instructions  keeping their head down  fitting in    every once in a while someone stands up and says   Not me.  Someone stands up and says   This one is important. We need to organize around it.  And not everyone will. But you don't need everyone. You just need a few people    who will look at the rules  realize they make no sense  and realize how much they want to be connected. So Tony Hsieh does not run a shoe store. Zappos isn't a shoe store. Zappos is the one  the only  the best there ever was place for people who are into shoes to find each other  to talk about their passion  to connect with people who care more about customer service than making a nickel tomorrow. It can be something as prosaic as shoes  and something as complicated as overthrowing a government. It's exactly the same behavior though. What it requires  as Geraldine Carter has discovered  is to be able to say   I can't do this by myself. But if I can get other people to join my Climb and Ride  then together we can get something that we all want. We're just waiting for someone to lead us.  Michelle Kaufman has pioneered new ways of thinking about environmental architecture. She doesn't do it by quietly building one house at a time. She does it by telling a story to people who want to hear it. By connecting a tribe of people who are desperate to be connected to each other. By leading a movement and making change. And around and around and around it goes. So three questions I'd offer you. The first one is  who exactly are you upsetting  Because if you're not upsetting anyone  you're not changing the status quo. The second question is  who are you connecting  Because for a lot of people  that's what they're in it for  the connections that are being made  one to the other. And the third one is  who are you leading  Because focusing on that part of it    not the mechanics of what you're building  but the who  and the leading part    is where change comes. So Blake  at Tom's Shoes  had a very simple idea.  What would happen if every time someone bought a pair of these shoes I gave exactly the same pair to someone who doesn't even own a pair of shoes   This is not the story of how you get shelf space at Neiman Marcus. It's a story of a product that tells a story. And as you walk around with this remarkable pair of shoes and someone says   What are those   You get to tell the story on Blake's behalf  on behalf of the people who got the shoes. And suddenly it's not one pair of shoes or     pairs of shoes. It's tens of thousands of pairs of shoes. My friend Red Maxwell has spent the last    years fighting against juvenile diabetes. Not fighting the organization that's fighting it    fighting with them  leading them  connecting them  challenging the status quo because it's important to him. And the people he surrounds himself with need the connection. They need the leadership. It makes a difference. You don't need permission from people to lead them. But in case you do  here it is  they're waiting  we're waiting for you to show us where to go next. So here is what leaders have in common. The first thing is  they challenge the status quo. They challenge what's currently there. The second thing is  they build a culture. A secret language  a seven second handshake  a way of knowing that you're in or out. They have curiosity. Curiosity about people in the tribe  curiosity about outsiders. They're asking questions. They connect people to one another. Do you know what people want more than anything  They want to be missed. They want to be missed the day they don't show up. They want to be missed when they're gone. And tribe leaders can do that. It's fascinating  because all tribe leaders have charisma  but you don't need charisma to become a leader. Being a leader gives you charisma. If you look and study the leaders who have succeeded  that's where charisma comes from    from the leading. Finally  they commit. They commit to the cause. They commit to the tribe. They commit to the people who are there. So I'd like you to do something for me. And I hope you'll think about it before you reject it out of hand. What I want you to do  it only takes    hours  is  create a movement. Something that matters. Start. Do it. We need it. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. AIDS was discovered       the virus      . These Gapminder bubbles show you how the spread of the virus was in      in the world  or how we estimate that it was. What we are showing here is    on this axis here  I'm showing percent of infected adults. And on this axis  I'm showing dollars per person in income. And the size of these bubbles  the size of the bubbles here  that shows how many are infected in each country  and the color is the continent. Now  you can see United States  in       had a very low percentage infected  but due to the big population  still a sizable bubble. There were quite many people infected in the United States. And  up there  you see Uganda. They had almost five percent infected  and quite a big bubble in spite of being a small country  then. And they were probably the most infected country in the world. Now  what has happened  Now you have understood the graph and now  in the next    seconds  we will play the HIV epidemic in the world. But first  I have a new invention here. I have solidified the beam of the laser pointer. So  ready  steady  go  First  we have the fast rise in Uganda and Zimbabwe. They went upwards like this. In Asia  the first country to be heavily infected was Thailand    they reached one to two percent. Then  Uganda started to turn back  whereas Zimbabwe skyrocketed  and some years later South Africa had a terrible rise of HIV frequency. Look  India got many infected  but had a low level. And almost the same happens here. See  Uganda coming down  Zimbabwe coming down  Russia went to one percent. In the last two to three years  we have reached a steady state of HIV epidemic in the world.    years it took. But  steady state doesn't mean that things are getting better  it's just that they have stopped getting worse. And it has    the steady state is  more or less  one percent of the adult world population is HIV infected. It means    to    million people  the whole of California    every person  that's more or less what we have today in the world. Now  let me make a fast replay of Botswana. Botswana    upper middle income country in southern Africa  democratic government  good economy  and this is what happened there. They started low  they skyrocketed  they peaked up there in       and now they are down. But they are falling only slowly  because in Botswana  with good economy and governance  they can manage to treat people. And if people who are infected are treated  they don't die of AIDS. These percentages won't come down because people can survive    to    years. So there's some problem with these metrics now. But the poorer countries in Africa  the low income countries down here  there the rates fall faster  of the percentage infected  because people still die. In spite of PEPFAR  the generous PEPFAR  all people are not reached by treatment  and of those who are reached by treatment in the poor countries  only    percent are left on treatment after two years. It's not realistic with lifelong treatment for everyone in the poorest countries. But it's very good that what is done is being done. But focus now is back on prevention. It is only by stopping the transmission that the world will be able to deal with it. Drugs is too costly    had we had the vaccine  or when we will get the vaccine  that's something more effective    but the drugs are very costly for the poor. Not the drug in itself  but the treatment and the care which is needed around it. So  when we look at the pattern  one thing comes out very clearly  you see the blue bubbles and people say HIV is very high in Africa. I would say  HIV is very different in Africa. You'll find the highest HIV rate in the world in African countries  and yet you'll find Senegal  down here    the same rate as United States. And you'll find Madagascar  and you'll find a lot of African countries about as low as the rest of the world. It's this terrible simplification that there's one Africa and things go on in one way in Africa. We have to stop that. It's not respectful  and it's not very clever to think that way. I had the fortune to live and work for a time in the United States. I found out that Salt Lake City and San Francisco were different. And so it is in Africa    it's a lot of difference. So  why is it so high  Is it war  No  it's not. Look here. War torn Congo is down there    two  three  four percent. And this is peaceful Zambia  neighboring country       percent. And there's good studies of the refugees coming out of Congo    they have two  three percent infected  and peaceful Zambia    much higher. There are now studies clearly showing that the wars are terrible  that rapes are terrible  but this is not the driving force for the high levels in Africa. So  is it poverty  Well if you look at the macro level  it seems more money  more HIV. But that's very simplistic  so let's go down and look at Tanzania. I will split Tanzania in five income groups  from the highest income to the lowest income  and here we go. The ones with the highest income  the better off    I wouldn't say rich    they have higher HIV. The difference goes from    percent down to four percent  and it is even bigger among women. There's a lot of things that we thought  that now  good research  done by African institutions and researchers together with the international researchers  show that that's not the case. So  this is the difference within Tanzania. And  I can't avoid showing Kenya. Look here at Kenya. I've split Kenya in its provinces. Here it goes. See the difference within one African country    it goes from very low level to very high level  and most of the provinces in Kenya is quite modest. So  what is it then  Why do we see this extremely high levels in some countries  Well  it is more common with multiple partners  there is less condom use  and there is age disparate sex    that is  older men tend to have sex with younger women. We see higher rates in younger women than younger men in many of these highly affected countries. But where are they situated  I will swap the bubbles to a map. Look  the highly infected are four percent of all population and they hold    percent of the HIV infected. HIV exists all over the world. Look  you have bubbles all over the world here. Brazil has many HIV infected. Arab countries not so much  but Iran is quite high. They have heroin addiction and also prostitution in Iran. India has many because they are many. Southeast Asia  and so on. But  there is one part of Africa    and the difficult thing is  at the same time  not to make a uniform statement about Africa  not to come to simple ideas of why it is like this  on one hand. On the other hand  try to say that this is not the case  because there is a scientific consensus about this pattern now. UNAIDS have done good data available  finally  about the spread of HIV. It could be concurrency. It could be some virus types. It could be that there is other things which makes transmission occur in a higher frequency. After all  if you are completely healthy and you have heterosexual sex  the risk of infection in one intercourse is one in      . Don't jump to conclusions now on how to behave tonight and so on. But    and if you are in an unfavorable situation  more sexually transmitted diseases  it can be one in    . But what we think is that it could be concurrency. And what is concurrency  In Sweden  we have no concurrency. We have serial monogamy. Vodka  New Year's Eve    new partner for the spring. Vodka  Midsummer's Eve    new partner for the fall. Vodka    and it goes on like this  you know  And you collect a big number of exes. And we have a terrible chlamydia epidemic    terrible chlamydia epidemic which sticks around for many years. HIV has a peak three to six weeks after infection and therefore  having more than one partner in the same month is much more dangerous for HIV than others. Probably  it's a combination of this. And what makes me so happy is that we are moving now towards fact when we look at this. You can get this chart  free. We have uploaded UNAIDS data on the Gapminder site. And we hope that when we act on global problems in the future we will not only have the heart  we will not only have the money  but we will also use the brain. Thank you very much. Let me talk about India through the evolution of ideas. Now I believe this is an interesting way of looking at it because in every society  especially an open democratic society  it's only when ideas take root that things change. Slowly ideas lead to ideology  lead to policies that lead to actions. In      this country went through a Great Depression  which led to all the ideas of the state and social security  and all the other things that happened in Roosevelt's time. In the     s we had the Reagan revolution  which lead to deregulation. And today  after the global economic crisis  there was a whole new set of rules about how the state should intervene. So ideas change states. And I looked at India and said  really there are four kinds of ideas which really make an impact on India. The first  to my mind  is what I call as  the ideas that have arrived.  These ideas have brought together something which has made India happen the way it is today. The second set of ideas I call  ideas in progress.  Those are ideas which have been accepted but not implemented yet. The third set of ideas are what I call as  ideas that we argue about     those are ideas where we have a fight  an ideological battle about how to do things. And the fourth thing  which I believe is most important  is  the ideas that we need to anticipate.  Because when you are a developing country in the world where you can see the problems that other countries are having  you can actually anticipate what that did and do things very differently. Now in India's case I believe there are six ideas which are responsible for where it has come today. The first is really the notion of people. In the '  s and '  s we thought of people as a burden. We thought of people as a liability. Today we talk of people as an asset. We talk of people as human capital. And I believe this change in the mindset  of looking at people as something of a burden to human capital  has been one of the fundamental changes in the Indian mindset. And this change in thinking of human capital is linked to the fact that India is going through a demographic dividend. As healthcare improves  as infant mortality goes down  fertility rates start dropping. And India is experiencing that. India is going to have a lot of young people with a demographic dividend for the next    years. What is unique about this demographic dividend is that India will be the only country in the world to have this demographic dividend. In other words  it will be the only young country in an aging world. And this is very important. At the same time if you peel away the demographic dividend in India  there are actually two demographic curves. One is in the south and in the west of India  which is already going to be fully expensed by       because in that part of the country  the fertility rate is almost equal to that of a West European country. Then there is the whole northern India  which is going to be the bulk of the future demographic dividend. But a demographic dividend is only as good as the investment in your human capital. Only if the people have education  they have good health  they have infrastructure  they have roads to go to work  they have lights to study at night    only in those cases can you really get the benefit of a demographic dividend. In other words  if you don't really invest in the human capital  the same demographic dividend can be a demographic disaster. Therefore India is at a critical point where either it can leverage its demographic dividend or it can lead to a demographic disaster. The second thing in India has been the change in the role of entrepreneurs. When India got independence entrepreneurs were seen as a bad lot  as people who would exploit. But today  after    years  because of the rise of entrepreneurship  entrepreneurs have become role models  and they are contributing hugely to the society. This change has contributed to the vitality and the whole economy. The third big thing I believe that has changed India is our attitude towards the English language. English language was seen as a language of the imperialists. But today  with globalization  with outsourcing  English has become a language of aspiration. This has made it something that everybody wants to learn. And the fact that we have English is now becoming a huge strategic asset. The next thing is technology. Forty years back  computers were seen as something which was forbidding  something which was intimidating  something that reduced jobs. Today we live in a country which sells eight million mobile phones a month  of which    percent of those mobile phones are prepaid phones because people don't have credit history. Forty percent of those prepaid phones are recharged at less than    cents at each recharge. That is the scale at which technology has liberated and made it accessible. And therefore technology has gone from being seen as something forbidding and intimidating to something that is empowering. Twenty years back  when there was a report on bank computerization  they didn't name the report as a report on computers  they call them as  ledger posting machines.  They didn't want the unions to believe that they were actually computers. And when they wanted to have more advanced  more powerful computers they called them  advanced ledger posting machines.  So we have come a long way from those days where the telephone has become an instrument of empowerment  and really has changed the way Indians think of technology. And then I think the other point is that Indians today are far more comfortable with globalization. Again  after having lived for more than     years under the East India Company and under imperial rule  Indians had a very natural reaction towards globalization believing it was a form of imperialism. But today  as Indian companies go abroad  as Indians come and work all over the world  Indians have gained a lot more confidence and have realized that globalization is something they can participate in. And the fact that the demographics are in our favor  because we are the only young country in an aging world  makes globalization all the more attractive to Indians. And finally  India has had the deepening of its democracy. When democracy came to India    years back it was an elite concept. It was a bunch of people who wanted to bring in democracy because they wanted to bring in the idea of universal voting and parliament and constitution and so forth. But today democracy has become a bottom up process where everybody has realized the benefits of having a voice  the benefits of being in an open society. And therefore democracy has become embedded. I believe these six factors    the rise of the notion of population as human capital  the rise of Indian entrepreneurs  the rise of English as a language of aspiration  technology as something empowering  globalization as a positive factor  and the deepening of democracy    has contributed to why India is today growing at rates it has never seen before. But having said that  then we come to what I call as ideas in progress. Those are the ideas where there is no argument in a society  but you are not able to implement those things. And really there are four things here. One is the question of education. For some reason  whatever reason    lack of money  lack of priorities  because of religion having an older culture    primary education was never given the focus it required. But now I believe it's reached a point where it has become very important. Unfortunately the government schools don't function  so children are going to private schools today. Even in the slums of India more than    percent of urban kids are going into private schools. So there is a big challenge in getting the schools to work. But having said that  there is an enormous desire among everybody  including the poor  to educate their children. So I believe primary education is an idea which is arrived but not yet implemented. Similarly  infrastructure    for a long time  infrastructure was not a priority. Those of you who have been to India have seen that. It's certainly not like China. But today I believe finally infrastructure is something which is agreed upon and which people want to implement. It is reflected in the political statements.    years back the political slogan was   Roti  kapada  makaan   which meant   Food  clothing and shelter.  And today's political slogan is   Bijli  sadak  pani   which means  Electricity  water and roads.  And that is a change in the mindset where infrastructure is now accepted. So I do believe this is an idea which has arrived  but simply not implemented. The third thing is again cities. It's because Gandhi believed in villages and because the British ruled from the cities  therefore Nehru thought of New Delhi as an un Indian city. For a long time we have neglected our cities. And that is reflected in the kinds of situations that you see. But today  finally  after economic reforms  and economic growth  I think the notion that cities are engines of economic growth  cities are engines of creativity  cities are engines of innovation  have finally been accepted. And I think now you're seeing the move towards improving our cities. Again  an idea which is arrived  but not yet implemented. The final thing is the notion of India as a single market    because when you didn't think of India as a market  you didn't really bother about a single market  because it didn't really matter. And therefore you had a situation where every state had its own market for products. Every province had its own market for agriculture. Increasingly now the policies of taxation and infrastructure and all that  are moving towards creating India as a single market. So there is a form of internal globalization which is happening  which is as important as external globalization. These four factors I believe    the ones of primary education  infrastructure  urbanization  and single market    in my view are ideas in India which have been accepted  but not implemented. Then we have what I believe are the ideas in conflict. The ideas that we argue about. These are the arguments we have which cause gridlock. What are those ideas  One is  I think  are ideological issues. Because of the historical Indian background  in the caste system  and because of the fact that there have been many people who have been left out in the cold  a lot of the politics is about how to make sure that we'll address that. And it leads to reservations and other techniques. It's also related to the way that we subsidize our people  and all the left and right arguments that we have. A lot of the Indian problems are related to the ideology of caste and other things. This policy is causing gridlock. This is one of the factors which needs to be resolved. The second one is the labor policies that we have  which make it so difficult for entrepreneurs to create standardized jobs in companies  that    percent of Indian labor is in the unorganized sector. They have no benefits  they don't have social security  they don't have pension  they don't have healthcare  none of those things. This needs to be fixed because unless you can bring these people into the formal workforce  you will end up creating a whole lot of people who are completely disenfranchised. Therefore we need to create a new set of labor laws  which are not as onerous as they are today. At the same time give a policy for a lot more people to be in the formal sector  and create the jobs for the millions of people that we need to create jobs for. The third thing is our higher education. Indian higher education is completely regulated. It's very difficult to start a private university. It's very difficult for a foreign university to come to India. As a result of that our higher education is simply not keeping pace with India's demands. That is leading to a lot of problems which we need to address. But most important I believe are the ideas we need to anticipate. Here India can look at what is happening in the west and elsewhere  and look at what needs to be done. The first thing is  we're very fortunate that technology is at a point where it is much more advanced than when other countries had the development. So we can use technology for governance. We can use technology for direct benefits. We can use technology for transparency  and many other things. The second thing is  the health issue. India has equally horrible health problems of the higher state of cardiac issue  the higher state of diabetes  the higher state of obesity. So there is no point in replacing a set of poor country diseases with a set of rich country diseases. Therefore we're to rethink the whole way we look at health. We really need to put in place a strategy so that we don't go to the other extreme of health. Similarly today in the West you're seeing the problem of entitlement    the cost of social security  the cost of Medicare  the cost of Medicaid. Therefore when you are a young country  again you have a chance to put in place a modern pension system so that you don't create entitlement problems as you grow old. And then again  India does not have the luxury of making its environment dirty  because it has to marry environment and development. Just to give an idea  the world has to stabilize at something like    gigatons per year. On a population of nine billion our average carbon emission will have to be about two tons per year. India is already at two tons per year. But if India grows at something like eight percent  income per year per person will go to    times by     . So we're saying  income growing at    times and no growth in carbon. Therefore we will fundamentally rethink the way we look at the environment  the way we look at energy  the way we create whole new paradigms of development. Now why does this matter to you  Why does what's happening    thousand miles away matter to all of you  Number one  this matters because this represents more than a billion people. A billion people     th of the world population. It matters because this is a democracy. And it is important to prove that growth and democracy are not incompatible  that you can have a democracy  that you can have an open society  and you can have growth. It's important because if you solve these problems  you can solve the problems of poverty in the world. It's important because you need it to solve the world's environment problems. If we really want to come to a point  we really want to put a cap on our carbon emission  we want to really lower the use of energy    it has to be solved in countries like India. You know if you look at the development in the West over     years  the average growth may have been about two percent. Here we are talking about countries growing at eight to nine percent. And that makes a huge difference. When India was growing at about three   .  percent and the population was growing at two percent  its per capita income was doubling every    years. When the economic growth goes to eight percent and population growth drops to  .  percent  then per capita income is doubling every nine years. In other words  you're certainly fast forwarding this whole process of a billion people going to prosperity. And you must have a clear strategy which is important for India and important for the world. That is why I think all of you should be equally concerned with it as I am. Thank you very much.   I think I'm ready to do my thing     I think I'm ready to take my chances     I've been dining out and all stressed out     Due to the circumstances. See      I gotta get up  get up  get up  get up     Wake up  wake up  wake up  wake up     I see what you're saying     We sent a demo to the world  they said it sounds like Take       I said  Hold on  wait a minute  I'll be back with the remix      They looking at us funny  we can't make any money     It took us years to figure out that we was dealing with dummies     They didn't understand the sound from the Bronx  that's the boogie down     to Huntsville  Alabama  there's no circles in my planner  so     It was time to make the product  so we hooked up with Townsend     Made a deal with John Neal  on the road sold ten thousand     WBA  that means a trip to Nashville     Festplatte showed up and said them boys are naturals     Can you hear what they were hearing  See what they were seeing      From Bronx to Berlin  we took the tour European     All vocal yeah  we widit  call the album  What is it       With Sarah Connor  set the goal for number one and we hit it     But now it's Kev  Sim  Drew  Stew  time for a new day     Ring the alarm  hit 'em on Skype or a two way     Sung by the words  we ready to fly      Fly baby  Time to leave that nest     Fly baby  This ain't no time to rest     Come on fly baby  we got work to do     Here we go  spread my wings and ...

Believe me or not  I come offering a solution to a very important part of this larger problem  with the requisite focus on climate. And the solution I offer is to the biggest culprit in this massive mistreatment of the earth by humankind  and the resulting decline of the biosphere. That culprit is business and industry  which happens to be where I have spent the last    years since my graduation from Georgia Tech in     . As an industrial engineer  cum aspiring and then successful entrepreneur. After founding my company  Interface  from scratch in          years ago  to produce carpet tiles in America for the business and institution markets  and shepherding it through start up and survival to prosperity and global dominance in its field  I read Paul Hawken's book   The Ecology of Commerce   the summer of     . In his book  Paul charges business and industry as  one  the major culprit in causing the decline of the biosphere  and  two  the only institution that is large enough  and pervasive enough  and powerful enough  to really lead humankind out of this mess. And by the way he convicted me as a plunderer of the earth. And I then challenged the people of Interface  my company  to lead our company and the entire industrial world to sustainability  which we defined as eventually operating our petroleum intensive company in such a way as to take from the earth only what can be renewed by the earth  naturally and rapidly    not another fresh drop of oil    and to do no harm to the biosphere. Take nothing  do no harm. I simply said   If Hawken is right and business and industry must lead  who will lead business and industry  Unless somebody leads  nobody will.  It's axiomatic. Why not us  And thanks to the people of Interface  I have become a recovering plunderer. I once told a Fortune Magazine writer that someday people like me would go to jail. And that became the headline of a Fortune article. They went on to describe me as America's greenest CEO. From plunderer to recovering plunderer  to America's greenest CEO in five years    that  frankly  was a pretty sad commentary on American CEOs in     . Asked later in the Canadian documentary   The Corporation   what I meant by the  go to jail  remark  I offered that theft is a crime. And theft of our children's future would someday be a crime. But I realized  for that to be true    for theft of our children's future to be a crime    there must be a clear  demonstrable alternative to the take make waste industrial system that so dominates our civilization  and is the major culprit  stealing our children's future  by digging up the earth and converting it to products that quickly become waste in a landfill or an incinerator    in short  digging up the earth and converting it to pollution. According to Paul and Anne Ehrlich and a well known environmental impact equation  impact    a bad thing    is the product of population  affluence and technology. That is  impact is generated by people  what they consume in their affluence  and how it is produced. And though the equation is largely subjective  you can perhaps quantify people  and perhaps quantify affluence  but technology is abusive in too many ways to quantify. So the equation is conceptual. Still it works to help us understand the problem. So we set out at Interface  in       to create an example  to transform the way we made carpet  a petroleum intensive product for materials as well as energy  and to transform our technologies so they diminished environmental impact  rather than multiplied it. Paul and Anne Ehrlich's environmental impact equation  I is equal to P times A times T  population  affluence and technology. I wanted Interface to rewrite that equation so that it read I equals P times A divided by T. Now  the mathematically minded will see immediately that T in the numerator increases impact    a bad thing    but T in the denominator decreases impact. So I ask   What would move T  technology  from the numerator    call it T     where it increases impact  to the denominator    call it T     where it reduces impact  I thought about the characteristics of first industrial revolution  T   as we practiced it at Interface  and it had the following characteristics. Extractive  taking raw materials from the earth. Linear  take  make  waste. Powered by fossil fuel derived energy. Wasteful  abusive and focused on labor productivity. More carpet per man hour. Thinking it through  I realized that all those attributes must be changed to move T to the denominator. In the new industrial revolution extractive must be replaced by renewable  linear by cyclical  fossil fuel energy by renewable energy  sunlight  wasteful by waste free  and abusive by benign  and labor productivity by resource productivity. And I reasoned that if we could make those transformative changes  and get rid of T  altogether  we could reduce our impact to zero  including our impact on the climate. And that became the Interface plan in       and has been the plan ever since. We have measured our progress very rigorously. So I can tell you how far we have come in the ensuing    years. Net greenhouse gas emissions down    percent in absolute tonnage. Over the same span of time sales have increased by two thirds and profits have doubled. So an    percent absolute reduction translates into a    percent reduction in greenhouse gas intensity relative to sales. This is the magnitude of the reduction the entire global technosphere must realize by      to avoid catastrophic climate disruption    so the scientists are telling us. Fossil fuel usage is down    percent per unit of production  due to efficiencies in renewables. The cheapest  most secure barrel of oil there is is the one not used through efficiencies. Water usage is down    percent in our worldwide carpet tile business. Down    percent in our broadloom carpet business  which we acquired in      right here in California  City of Industry  where water is so precious. Renewable or recyclable materials are    percent of the total  and growing rapidly. Renewable energy is    percent of our total  going for     percent. We have diverted     million pounds    that's        tons    of used carpet from landfills  closing the loop on material flows through reverse logistics and post consumer recycling technologies that did not exist when we started    years ago. Those new cyclical technologies have contributed mightily to the fact that we have produced and sold    million square yards of climate neutral carpet since       meaning no net contribution to global climate disruption in producing the carpet throughout the supply chain  from mine and well head clear to end of life reclamation    independent third party certified. We call it Cool Carpet. And it has been a powerful marketplace differentiator  increasing sales and profits. Three years ago we launched carpet tile for the home  under the brand Flor  misspelled F L O R. You can point and click today at Flor.com and have Cool Carpet delivered to your front door in five days. It is practical  and pretty too. We reckon that we are a bit over halfway to our goal  zero impact  zero footprint. We've set      as our target year for zero  for reaching the top  the summit of Mount Sustainability. We call this Mission Zero. And this is perhaps the most important facet  we have found Mission Zero to be incredibly good for business. A better business model  a better way to bigger profits. Here is the business case for sustainability. From real life experience  costs are down  not up  reflecting some     million dollars of avoided costs in pursuit of zero waste    the first face of Mount Sustainability. This has paid all the costs for the transformation of Interface. And this dispels a myth too  this false choice between the environment and the economy. Our products are the best they've ever been  inspired by design for sustainability  an unexpected wellspring of innovation. Our people are galvanized around this shared higher purpose. You cannot beat it for attracting the best people and bringing them together. And the goodwill of the marketplace is astonishing. No amount of advertising  no clever marketing campaign  at any price  could have produced or created this much goodwill. Costs  products  people  marketplaces    what else is there  It is a better business model. And here is our    year record of sales and profits. There is a dip there  from      to       a dip when our sales  over a three year period  were down    percent. But the marketplace was down    percent. We literally gained market share. We might not have survived that recession but for the advantages of sustainability. If every business were pursuing Interface plans  would that solve all our problems  I don't think so. I remain troubled by the revised Ehrlich equation  I equals P times A divided by T . That A is a capital A  suggesting that affluence is an end in itself. But what if we reframed Ehrlich further  And what if we made A a lowercase 'a ' suggesting that it is a means to an end  and that end is happiness    more happiness with less stuff. You know that would reframe civilization itself    and our whole system of economics  if not for our species  then perhaps for the one that succeeds us  the sustainable species  living on a finite earth  ethically  happily and ecologically in balance with nature and all her natural systems for a thousand generations  or        generations    that is to say  into the indefinite future. But does the earth have to wait for our extinction as a species  Well maybe so. But I don't think so. At Interface we really intend to bring this prototypical sustainable  zero footprint industrial company fully into existence by     . We can see our way now  clear to the top of that mountain. And now the challenge is in execution. And as my good friend and adviser Amory Lovins says   If something exists  it must be possible.  If we can actually do it  it must be possible. If we  a petro intensive company can do it  anybody can. And if anybody can  it follows that everybody can. Hawken fulfilled business and industry  leading humankind away from the abyss because  with continued unchecked decline of the biosphere  a very dear person is at risk here    frankly  an unacceptable risk. Who is that person  Not you. Not I. But let me introduce you to the one who is most at risk here. And I myself met this person in the early days of this mountain climb. On a Tuesday morning in March of       I was talking to people  as I did at every opportunity back then  bringing them along and often not knowing whether I was connecting. But about five days later back in Atlanta  I received an email from Glenn Thomas  one of my people in the California meeting. He was sending me an original poem that he had composed after our Tuesday morning together. And when I read it it was one of the most uplifting moments of my life. Because it told me  by God  one person got it. Here is what Glenn wrote. And here is that person  most at risk. Please meet  Tomorrow's Child.   Without a name  an unseen face  and knowing not your time or place  Tomorrow's child  though yet unborn  I met you first last Tuesday morn. A wise friend introduced us two. And through his sobering point of view I saw a day that you would see  a day for you but not for me. Knowing you has changed my thinking. For I never had an inkling that perhaps the things I do might someday  somehow threaten you. Tomorrow's child  my daughter  son  I'm afraid I've just begun to think of you and of your good  though always having known I should. Begin  I will. The way the cost of what I squander  what is lost  if ever I forget that you will someday come and live here too.  Well  every day of my life since   Tomorrow's Child  has spoken to me with one simple but profound message  which I presume to share with you. We are  each and every one  a part of the web of life. The continuum of humanity  sure  but in a larger sense  the web of life itself. And we have a choice to make during our brief  brief visit to this beautiful blue and green living planet  to hurt it or to help it. For you  it's your call. Thank you. I'll tell you a little bit about irrational behavior. Not yours  of course    other people's. So after being at MIT for a few years  I realized that writing academic papers is not that exciting. You know  I don't know how many of those you read  but it's not fun to read and often not fun to write    even worse to write. So I decided to try and write something more fun. And I came up with an idea that I would write a cookbook. And the title for my cookbook was going to be   Dining Without Crumbs  The Art of Eating Over the Sink.  And it was going to be a look at life through the kitchen. I was quite excited about this. I was going to talk a little bit about research  a little bit about the kitchen. We do so much in the kitchen  I thought this would be interesting. I wrote a couple of chapters  and took it to MIT Press and they said   Cute  but not for us. Go and find somebody else.  I tried other people  and everybody said the same thing   Cute. Not for us.  Until somebody said   Look  if you're serious about this  you have to write about your research first  you have to publish something  then you'll get the opportunity to write something else. If you really want to do it  you have to do it.  I said   I don't want to write about my research. I do it all day long  I want to write something a bit more free  less constrained.  And this person was very forceful and said   Look  that's the only way you'll ever do it.  So I said   Okay  if I have to do it     I had a sabbatical. I said   I'll write about my research  if there's no other way. And then I'll get to do my cookbook.  So  I wrote a book on my research. And it turned out to be quite fun in two ways. First of all  I enjoyed writing. But the more interesting thing was that I started learning from people. It's a fantastic time to write  because there's so much feedback you can get from people. People write to me about their personal experience  and about their examples  and where they disagree  and their nuances. And even being here    I mean  the last few days  I've known heights of obsessive behavior I never thought about. Which I think is just fascinating. I will tell you a little bit about irrational behavior  and I want to start by giving you some examples of visual illusion as a metaphor for rationality. So think about these two tables. And you must have seen this illusion. If I asked you what's longer  the vertical line on the table on the left  or the horizontal line on the table on the right  which one seems longer  Can anybody see anything but the left one being longer  No  right  It's impossible. But the nice thing about visual illusion is we can easily demonstrate mistakes. So I can put some lines on  it doesn't help. I can animate the lines. And to the extent you believe I didn't shrink the lines  which I didn't  I've proven to you that your eyes were deceiving you. Now  the interesting thing about this is when I take the lines away  it's as if you haven't learned anything in the last minute. You can't look at this and say   Now I see reality as it is.  Right  It's impossible to overcome this sense that this is indeed longer. Our intuition is really fooling us in a repeatable  predictable  consistent way. and there is almost nothing we can do about it  aside from taking a ruler and starting to measure it. Here's another one. It's one of my favorite illusions. What color is the top arrow pointing to  Audience  Brown. Dan Ariely  Brown. Thank you. The bottom one  Yellow. Turns out they're identical. Can anybody see them as identical  Very  very hard. I can cover the rest of the cube up. If I cover the rest of the cube  you can see that they are identical. If you don't believe me  you can get the slide later and do some arts and crafts and see that they're identical. But again  it's the same story  that if we take the background away  the illusion comes back. There is no way for us not to see this illusion. I guess maybe if you're colorblind  I don't think you can see that. I want you to think about illusion as a metaphor. Vision is one of the best things we do. We have a huge part of our brain dedicated to vision    bigger than dedicated to anything else. We use our vision more hours of the day than anything else. We're evolutionarily designed to use vision. And if we have these predictable repeatable mistakes in vision  which we're so good at  what are the chances we won't make even more mistakes in something we're not as good at  for example  financial decision making. Something we don't have an evolutionary reason to do  we don't have a specialized part of the brain for  and we don't do that many hours of the day. The argument is in those cases  it might be that we actually make many more mistakes. And worse    not having an easy way to see them  because in visual illusions  we can easily demonstrate the mistakes  in cognitive illusion it's much  much harder to demonstrate the mistakes to people. So I want to show you some cognitive illusions  or decision making illusions  in the same way. And this is one of my favorite plots in social sciences. It's from a paper by Johnson and Goldstein. It basically shows the percentage of people who indicated they would be interested in donating their organs. These are different countries in Europe. You basically see two types of countries  countries on the right  that seem to be giving a lot  and countries on the left that seem to giving very little  or much less. The question is  why  Why do some countries give a lot and some countries give a little  When you ask people this question  they usually think that it has to be about culture. How much do you care about people  Giving organs to somebody else is probably about how much you care about society  how linked you are. Or maybe it's about religion. But if you look at this plot  you can see that countries that we think about as very similar  actually exhibit very different behavior. For example  Sweden is all the way on the right  and Denmark  which we think is culturally very similar  is all the way on the left. Germany is on the left  and Austria is on the right. The Netherlands is on the left  and Belgium is on the right. And finally  depending on your particular version of European similarity  you can think about the U.K. and France as either similar culturally or not  but it turns out that with organ donation  they are very different. By the way  the Netherlands is an interesting story. You see  the Netherlands is kind of the biggest of the small group. It turns out that they got to    percent after mailing every household in the country a letter  begging people to join this organ donation program. You know the expression   Begging only gets you so far.  It's    percent in organ donation. But whatever the countries on the right are doing  they're doing a much better job than begging. So what are they doing  Turns out the secret has to do with a form at the DMV. And here is the story. The countries on the left have a form at the DMV that looks something like this.  Check the box below if you want to participate in the organ donor program.  And what happens  People don't check  and they don't join. The countries on the right  the ones that give a lot  have a slightly different form. It says   Check the box below if you don't want to participate ...  Interestingly enough  when people get this  they again don't check  but now they join. Now  think about what this means. You know  we wake up in the morning and we feel we make decisions. We wake up in the morning and we open the closet  we feel that we decide what to wear. we open the refrigerator and we feel that we decide what to eat. What this is actually saying  is that many of these decisions are not residing within us. They are residing in the person who is designing that form. When you walk into the DMV  the person who designed the form will have a huge influence on what you'll end up doing. Now  it's also very hard to intuit these results. Think about it for yourself. How many of you believe that if you went to renew your license tomorrow  and you went to the DMV  and you encountered one of these forms  that it would actually change your own behavior  Very hard to think that it would influence us. We can say   Oh  these funny Europeans  of course it would influence them.  But when it comes to us  we have such a feeling that we're in the driver's seat  such a feeling that we're in control and we are making the decision  that it's very hard to even accept the idea that we actually have an illusion of making a decision  rather than an actual decision. Now  you might say   These are decisions we don't care about.  In fact  by definition  these are decisions about something that will happen to us after we die. How could we care about something less than about something that happens after we die  So a standard economist  somebody who believes in rationality  would say   You know what  The cost of lifting the pencil and marking a  V  is higher than the possible benefit of the decision  so that's why we get this effect.  But  in fact  it's not because it's easy. It's not because it's trivial. It's not because we don't care. It's the opposite. It's because we care. It's difficult and it's complex. And it's so complex that we don't know what to do. And because we have no idea what to do  we just pick whatever it was that was chosen for us. I'll give you one more example. This is from a paper by Redelmeier and Shafir. And they said   Would this effect also happens to experts  People who are well paid  experts in their decisions  and who make a lot of them   And they took a group of physicians. They presented to them a case study of a patient. They said   Here is a patient. He is a    year old farmer. He's been suffering from right hip pain for a while.  And then  they said to the physicians   You decided a few weeks ago that nothing is working for this patient. All these medications  nothing seems to be working. So you refer the patient for hip replacement therapy. Hip replacement. Okay   So the patient is on a path to have his hip replaced. Then they said to half of the physicians   Yesterday  you reviewed the patient's case  and you realized that you forgot to try one medication. You did not try ibuprofen. What do you do  Do you pull the patient back and try ibuprofen  Or do you let him go and have hip replacement   Well  the good news is that most physicians in this case decided to pull the patient and try ibuprofen. Very good for the physicians. To the other group of physicians  they said   Yesterday when you reviewed the case  you discovered there were two medications you didn't try out yet    ibuprofen and piroxicam.  You have two medications you didn't try out yet. What do you do  You let him go  or you pull him back  And if you pull him back  do you try ibuprofen or piroxicam  Which one   Now  think of it  This decision makes it as easy to let the patient continue with hip replacement  but pulling him back  all of the sudden it becomes more complex. There is one more decision. What happens now  The majority of the physicians now choose to let the patient go for a hip replacement. I hope this worries you  by the way    when you go to see your physician. The thing is that no physician would ever say   Piroxicam  ibuprofen  hip replacement. Let's go for hip replacement.  But the moment you set this as the default  it has a huge power over whatever people end up doing. I'll give you a couple of more examples on irrational decision making. Imagine I give you a choice  Do you want to go for a weekend to Rome  all expenses paid    hotel  transportation  food  a continental breakfast  everything    or a weekend in Paris  Now  weekend in Paris  weekend in Rome    these are different things. They have different food  different culture  different art. Imagine I added a choice to the set that nobody wanted. Imagine I said   A weekend in Rome  a weekend in Paris  or having your car stolen   It's a funny idea  because why would having your car stolen  in this set  influence anything  But what if the option to have your car stolen was not exactly like this  What if it was a trip to Rome  all expenses paid  transportation  breakfast  but it doesn't include coffee in the morning  If you want coffee  you have to pay for it yourself  it's two euros   . Now in some ways  given that you can have Rome with coffee  why would you possibly want Rome without coffee  It's like having your car stolen. It's an inferior option. But guess what happened  The moment you add Rome without coffee  Rome with coffee becomes more popular  and people choose it. The fact that you have Rome without coffee makes Rome with coffee look superior  and not just to Rome without coffee    even superior to Paris. Here are two examples of this principle. This was an ad in The Economist a few years ago that gave us three choices  an online subscription for    dollars  a print subscription for     dollars  or you could get both for    . Now I looked at this  and I called up The Economist  and I tried to figure out what they were thinking. And they passed me from one person to another to another  until eventually I got to the person who was in charge of the website  and I called them up  and they went to check what was going on. The next thing I know  the ad is gone  no explanation. So I decided to do the experiment that I would have loved The Economist to do with me. I took this and I gave it to     MIT students. I said   What would you choose   These are the market shares    most people wanted the combo deal. Thankfully  nobody wanted the dominant option. That means our students can read. But now  if you have an option that nobody wants  you can take it off  right  So I printed another version of this  where I eliminated the middle option. I gave it to another     students. Here is what happened  Now the most popular option became the least popular  and the least popular became the most popular. What was happening was the option that was useless  in the middle  was useless in the sense that nobody wanted it. But it wasn't useless in the sense that it helped people figure out what they wanted. In fact  relative to the option in the middle  which was get only the print for      the print and web for     looked like a fantastic deal. And as a consequence  people chose it. The general idea here  by the way  is that we actually don't know our preferences that well. And because we don't know our preferences that well  we're susceptible to all of these influences from the external forces  the defaults  the particular options that are presented to us  and so on. One more example of this. People believe that when we deal with physical attraction  we see somebody  and we know immediately whether we like them or not  if we're attracted or not. This is why we have these four minute dates. So I decided to do this experiment with people. I'll show you images here  no real people  but the experiment was with people. I showed some people a picture of Tom  and a picture of Jerry. and I said   Who do you want to date  Tom or Jerry   But for half the people  I added an ugly version of Jerry. I took Photoshop and I made Jerry slightly less attractive. For the other people  I added an ugly version of Tom. And the question was  will ugly Jerry and ugly Tom help their respective  more attractive brothers  The answer was absolutely yes. When ugly Jerry was around  Jerry was popular. When ugly Tom was around  Tom was popular. This of course has two very clear implications for life in general. If you ever go bar hopping  who do you want to take with you  You want a slightly uglier version of yourself. Similar  but slightly uglier. The second point  or course  is that if somebody invites you to bar hop  you know what they think about you. Now you get it. What is the general point  The general point is that  when we think about economics  we have this beautiful view of human nature.  What a piece of work is a man  How noble in reason   We have this view of ourselves  of others. The behavioral economics perspective is slightly less  generous  to people  in fact  in medical terms  that's our view. But there is a silver lining. The silver lining is  I think  kind of the reason that behavioral economics is interesting and exciting. Are we Superman  or are we Homer Simpson  When it comes to building the physical world  we kind of understand our limitations. We build steps. And we build these things that not everybody can use  obviously. We understand our limitations  and we build around them. But for some reason  when it comes to the mental world  when we design things like healthcare and retirement and stock markets  we somehow forget the idea that we are limited. I think that if we understood our cognitive limitations in the same way we understand our physical limitations  even though they don't stare us in the face the same way  we could design a better world  and that  I think  is the hope of this thing. Thank you very much. Alright. I'm going to show you a couple of images from a very diverting paper in The Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine. I'm going to go way out on a limb and say that it is the most diverting paper ever published in The Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine. The title is  Observations of In Utero Masturbation.  Okay. Now on the left you can see the hand    that's the big arrow    and the penis on the right. The hand hovering. And over here we have  in the words of radiologist Israel Meisner   The hand grasping the penis in a fashion resembling masturbation movements.  Bear in mind this was an ultrasound  so it would have been moving images. Orgasm is a reflex of the autonomic nervous system. Now  this is the part of the nervous system that deals with the things that we don't consciously control  like digestion  heart rate and sexual arousal. And the orgasm reflex can be triggered by a surprisingly broad range of input. Genital stimulation. Duh. But also  Kinsey interviewed a woman who could be brought to orgasm by having someone stroke her eyebrow. People with spinal cord injuries  like paraplegias  quadriplegias  will often develop a very  very sensitive area right above the level of their injury  wherever that is. There is such a thing as a knee orgasm in the literature. I think the most curious one that I came across was a case report of a woman who had an orgasm every time she brushed her teeth. Something in the complex sensory motor action of brushing her teeth was triggering orgasm. And she went to a neurologist  who was fascinated. He checked to see if it was something in the toothpaste  but no    it happened with any brand. They stimulated her gums with a toothpick  to see if that was doing it. No. It was the whole  you know  motion. And the amazing thing to me is that you would think this woman would have excellent oral hygiene. Sadly    this is what it said in the journal paper     She believed that she was possessed by demons and switched to mouthwash for her oral care.  It's so sad. When I was working on the book  I interviewed a woman who can think herself to orgasm. She was part of a study at Rutgers University. You've got to love that. Rutgers. So I interviewed her in Oakland  in a sushi restaurant. And I said   So  could you do it right here   And she said   Yeah  but you know I'd rather finish my meal if you don't mind.  But afterwards  she was kind enough to demonstrate on a bench outside. It was remarkable. It took about one minute. And I said to her   Are you just doing this all the time   She said   No. Honestly  when I get home  I'm usually too tired.  She said that the last time she had done it was on the Disneyland tram. The headquarters for orgasm  along the spinal nerve  is something called the sacral nerve root  which is back here. And if you trigger  if you stimulate with an electrode  the precise spot  you will trigger an orgasm. And it is a fact that you can trigger spinal reflexes in dead people    a certain kind of dead person  a beating heart cadaver. Now this is somebody who is brain dead  legally dead  definitely checked out  but is being kept alive on a respirator  so that their organs will be oxygenated for transplantation. Now in one of these brain dead people  if you trigger the right spot  you will see something every now and then. There is a reflex called the Lazarus reflex. And this is    I'll demonstrate as best I can  not being dead. It's like this. You trigger the spot. The dead guy  or gal  goes... like that. Very unsettling for people working in pathology labs. Now  if you can trigger the Lazarus reflex in a dead person  why not the orgasm reflex  I asked this question to a brain death expert  Stephanie Mann  who was foolish enough to return my emails. I said   So  could you conceivably trigger an orgasm in a dead person   She said   Yes  if the sacral nerve is being oxygenated  you conceivably could.  Obviously it wouldn't be as much fun for the person. But it would be an orgasm    nonetheless. There is a researcher at the University of Alabama who does orgasm research. I said to her   You should do an experiment. You know  You can get cadavers if you work at a university.  I said   You should actually do this.  She said   You get the human subjects review board approval for this one.  According to     s marriage manual author  Theodoor van De Velde  a slight seminal odor can be detected on the breath of a woman within about an hour after sexual intercourse. Theodoor van De Velde was something of a semen connoisseur. This is a guy writing a book   Ideal Marriage   you know. Very heavy hetero guy. But he wrote in this book   Ideal Marriage     he said that he could differentiate between the semen of a young man  which he said had a fresh  exhilarating smell  and the semen of mature men  whose semen smelled  quote   Remarkably like that of the flowers of the Spanish chestnut. Sometimes quite freshly floral  and then again sometimes extremely pungent.  Okay. In       in the state of Israel  a man began hiccupping. And this was one of those cases that went on and on. He tried everything his friends suggested. Nothing seemed to help. Days went by. At a certain point  the man  still hiccupping  had sex with his wife. And lo and behold  the hiccups went away. He told his doctor  who published a case report in a Canadian medical journal under the title   Sexual Intercourse as a Potential Treatment for Intractable Hiccups.  I love this article because at a certain point they suggested that unattached hiccuppers could try masturbation. I love that because there is like a whole demographic  unattached hiccuppers. Married  single  unattached hiccupper. In the     s  early     s  a lot of gynecologists believed that when a woman has an orgasm  the contractions serve to suck the semen up through the cervix and sort of deliver it really quickly to the egg  thereby upping the odds of conception. It was called the  upsuck  theory. If you go all the way back to Hippocrates  physicians believed that orgasm in women was not just helpful for conception  but necessary. Doctors back then were routinely telling men the importance of pleasuring their wives. Marriage manual author and semen sniffer Theodoor van De Velde    has a line in his book. I loved this guy. I got a lot of mileage out of Theodoor van De Velde. He had this line in his book that supposedly comes from the Habsburg Monarchy  where there was an empress Maria Theresa  who was having trouble conceiving. And apparently the royal court physician said to her   I am of the opinion that the vulva of your most sacred majesty be titillated for some time prior to intercourse.  It's apparently  I don't know  on the record somewhere. Masters and Johnson  now we're moving forward to the     s. Masters and Johnson were upsuck skeptics  which is also really fun to say. They didn't buy it. And they decided  being Masters and Johnson  that they would get to the bottom of it. They brought women into the lab    I think it was five women    and outfitted them with cervical caps containing artificial semen. And in the artificial semen was a radio opaque substance  such that it would show up on an X ray. This is the     s. Anyway  these women sat in front of an X ray device. And they masturbated. And Masters and Johnson looked to see if the semen was being sucked up. Did not find any evidence of upsuck. You may be wondering   How do you make artificial semen   I have an answer for you. I have two answers. You can use flour and water  or cornstarch and water. I actually found three separate recipes in the literature. My favorite being the one that says    you know  they have the ingredients listed  and then in a recipe it will say  for example   Yield  two dozen cupcakes.  This one said   Yield  one ejaculate.  There's another way that orgasm might boost fertility. This one involves men. Sperm that sit around in the body for a week or more start to develop abnormalities that make them less effective at head banging their way into the egg. British sexologist Roy Levin has speculated that this is perhaps why men evolved to be such enthusiastic and frequent masturbators. He said   If I keep tossing myself off I get fresh sperm being made.  Which I thought was an interesting idea  theory. So now you have an evolutionary excuse. Okay. All righty. There is considerable evidence for upsuck in the animal kingdom    pigs  for instance. In Denmark  the Danish National Committee for Pig Production found out that if you sexually stimulate a sow while you artificially inseminate her  you will see a six percent increase in the farrowing rate  which is the number of piglets produced. So they came up with this five point stimulation plan for the sows. There is posters they put in the barn  and they have a DVD. And I got a copy of this DVD. This is my unveiling  because I am going to show you a clip. So  okay. Now  here we go  la la la  off to work. It all looks very innocent. He's going to be doing things with his hands that the boar would use his snout  lacking hands. Okay. This is it. The boar has a very odd courtship repertoire. This is to mimic the weight of the boar. You should know  the clitoris of the pig is inside the vagina. So this may be sort of titillating for her. Here we go. And the happy result. I love this video. There is a point in this video  towards the beginning  where they zoom in for a close up of his hand with his wedding ring  as if to say   It's okay  it's just his job. He really does like women.  Okay. When I was in Denmark  my host was named Anne Marie. And I said   So why don't you just stimulate the clitoris of the pig  Why don't you have the farmers do that  That's not one of your five steps.  I have to read you what she said  because I love it. She said   It was a big hurdle just to get farmers to touch underneath the vulva. So we thought  let's not mention the clitoris right now.  Shy but ambitious pig farmers  however  can purchase a    this is true    a sow vibrator  that hangs on the sperm feeder tube to vibrate. Because  as I mentioned  the clitoris is inside the vagina. So possibly  you know  a little more arousing than it looks. And I also said to her   Now  these sows. I mean  you may have noticed there. The sow doesn't look to be in the throes of ecstasy.  And she said  you can't make that conclusion  because animals don't register pain or pleasure on their faces in the same way that we do. Pigs  for example  are more like dogs. They use the upper half of the face  the ears are very expressive. So you're not really sure what's going on with the pig. Primates  on the other hand  we use our mouths more. This is the ejaculation face of the stump tailed macaque. And  interestingly  this has been observed in female macaques  but only when mounting another female. Masters and Johnson. In the     s  they decided  okay  we're going to figure out the entire human sexual response cycle  from arousal  all the way through orgasm  in men and women    everything that happens in the human body. Okay  with women  a lot of this is happening inside. This did not stop Masters and Johnson. They developed an artificial coition machine. This is basically a penis camera on a motor. There is a phallus  clear acrylic phallus  with a camera and a light source  attached to a motor that is kind of going like this. And the woman would have sex with it. That is what they would do. Pretty amazing. Sadly  this device has been dismantled. This just kills me  not because I wanted to use it    I wanted to see it. One fine day  Alfred Kinsey decided to calculate the average distance traveled by ejaculated semen. This was not idle curiosity. Doctor Kinsey had heard    and there was a theory going around at the time  this being the     s    that the force with which semen is thrown against the cervix was a factor in fertility. Kinsey thought it was bunk  so he got to work. He got together in his lab     men  a measuring tape  and a movie camera. And in fact  he found that in three quarters of the men the stuff just kind of slopped out. It wasn't spurted or thrown or ejected under great force. However  the record holder landed just shy of the eight foot mark  which is impressive. Yes. Exactly. Sadly  he's anonymous. His name is not mentioned. In his write up of this experiment in his book  Kinsey wrote   Two sheets were laid down to protect the oriental carpets.  Which is my second favorite line in the entire oeuvre of Alfred Kinsey. My favorite being   Cheese crumbs spread before a pair of copulating rats will distract the female  but not the male.  Thank you very much. Thanks  Two years ago here at TED I reported that we had discovered at Saturn  with the Cassini Spacecraft  an anomalously warm and geologically active region at the southern tip of the small Saturnine moon Enceladus  seen here. This region seen here for the first time in the Cassini image taken in     . This is the south polar region  with the famous tiger stripe fractures crossing the south pole. And seen just recently in late       here is that region again  now half in darkness because the southern hemisphere is experiencing the onset of August and eventually winter. And I also reported that we'd made this mind blowing discovery    this once in a lifetime discovery of towering jets erupting from those fractures at the south pole  consisting of tiny water ice crystals accompanied by water vapor and simple organic compounds like carbon dioxide and methane. And at that time two years ago I mentioned that we were speculating that these jets might in fact be geysers  and erupting from pockets or chambers of liquid water underneath the surface  but we weren't really sure. However  the implications of those results    of a possible environment within this moon that could support prebiotic chemistry  and perhaps life itself    were so exciting that  in the intervening two years  we have focused more on Enceladus. We've flown the Cassini Spacecraft by this moon now several times  flying closer and deeper into these jets  into the denser regions of these jets  so that now we have come away with some very precise compositional measurements. And we have found that the organic compounds coming from this moon are in fact more complex than we previously reported. While they're not amino acids  we're now finding things like propane and benzene  hydrogen cyanide  and formaldehyde. And the tiny water crystals here now look for all the world like they are frozen droplets of salty water  which is a discovery that suggests that not only do the jets come from pockets of liquid water  but that that liquid water is in contact with rock. And that is a circumstance that could supply the chemical energy and the chemical compounds needed to sustain life. So we are very encouraged by these results. And we are much more confident now than we were two years ago that we might indeed have on this moon  under the south pole  an environment or a zone that is hospitable to living organisms. Whether or not there are living organisms there  of course  is an entirely different matter. And that will have to await the arrival  back at Enceladus  of the spacecrafts  hopefully some time in the near future  specifically equipped to address that particular question. But in the meantime I invite you to imagine the day when we might journey to the Saturnine system  and visit the Enceladus interplanetary geyser park  just because we can. Thank you. I'm here because I have a very important message  I think we have found the most important factor for success. And it was found close to here  Stanford. Psychology professor took kids that were four years old and put them in a room all by themselves. And he would tell the child  a four year old kid   Johnny  I am going to leave you here with a marshmallow for    minutes. If  after I come back  this marshmallow is here  you will get another one. So you will have two.  To tell a four year old kid to wait    minutes for something that they like  is equivalent to telling us   We'll bring you coffee in two hours.  Exact equivalent. So what happened when the professor left the room  As soon as the door closed... two out of three ate the marshmallow. Five seconds     seconds     seconds     seconds  two minutes  four minutes  eight minutes. Some lasted    and a half minutes. Couldn't do it. Could not wait. What's interesting is that one out of three would look at the marshmallow and go like this ... Would look at it. Put it back. They would walk around. They would play with their skirts and pants. That child already  at four  understood the most important principle for success  which is the ability to delay gratification. Self discipline  the most important factor for success.    years later     or    years later  follow up study. What did they find  They went to look for these kids who were now    and   . And they found that     percent of the children that had not eaten the marshmallow were successful. They had good grades. They were doing wonderful. They were happy. They had their plans. They had good relationships with the teachers  students. They were doing fine. A great percentage of the kids that ate the marshmallow  they were in trouble. They did not make it to university. They had bad grades. Some of them dropped out. A few were still there with bad grades. A few had good grades. I had a question in my mind  Would Hispanic kids react the same way as the American kids  So I went to Colombia. And I reproduced the experiment. And it was very funny. I used four  five and six years old kids. And let me show you what happened. So what happened in Colombia  Hispanic kids  two out of three ate the marshmallow  one out of three did not. This little girl was interesting  she ate the inside of the marshmallow. In other words  she wanted us to think that she had not eaten it  so she would get two. But she ate it. So we know she'll be successful. But we have to watch her. She should not go into banking  for example  or work at a cash register. But she will be successful. And this applies for everything. Even in sales. The sales person that    the customer says   I want that.  And the person says   Okay  here you are.  That person ate the marshmallow. If the sales person says   Wait a second. Let me ask you a few questions to see if this is a good choice.  Then you sell a lot more. So this has applications in all walks of life. I end with    the Koreans did this. You know what  This is so good that we want a marshmallow book for children. We did one for children. And now it is all over Korea. They are teaching these kids exactly this principle. And we need to learn that principle here in the States  because we have a big debt. We are eating more marshmallows than we are producing. Thank you so much. Let's talk about manias. Let's start with Beatlemania. Hysterical teenagers  crying  screaming  pandemonium. Sports mania  deafening crowds  all for one idea    get the ball in the net. Okay  religious mania  there's rapture  there's weeping  there's visions. Manias can be good. Manias can be alarming. Or manias can be deadly. The world has a new mania. A mania for learning English. Listen as Chinese students practice their English  by screaming it  Teacher  ... change my life  Students  I want to change my life  T  I don't want to let my parents down  S  I don't want to let my parents down  T  I don't ever want to let my country down  S  I don't ever want to let my country down  T  Most importantly... S  Most importantly... T  I don't want to let myself down  S  I don't want to let myself down  How many people are trying to learn English worldwide  Two billion of them. Students  A t shirt. A dress. Jay Walker  In Latin America  in India  in Southeast Asia  and most of all  in China. If you're a Chinese student  you start learning English in the third grade  by law. That's why this year  China will become the world's largest English speaking country. Why English  In a single word  opportunity. Opportunity for a better life  a job  to be able to pay for school  or put better food on the table. Imagine a student taking a giant test for three full days. Her score on this one test literally determines her future. She studies    hours a day for three years to prepare. Twenty five percent of her grade is based on English. It's called the gaokao  and    million high school Chinese students have already taken this grueling test. The intensity to learn English is almost unimaginable  unless you witness it. Teacher  Perfect  Students  Perfect  T  Perfect  S  Perfect  T  I want to speak perfect English  S  I want to speak perfect English  T  I want to speak ... S  I want to speak ... T  ... perfect English  S  ... perfect English  T  yelling more loudly   I want to change my life  S  yelling more loudly   I want to change my life  JW  So is English mania good or bad  Is English a tsunami  washing away other languages  Not likely. English is the world's second language. Your native language is your life. But with English you can become part of a wider conversation    a global conversation about global problems  like climate change or poverty  or hunger or disease. The world has other universal languages. Mathematics is the language of science. Music is the language of emotions. And now English is becoming the language of problem solving. Not because America is pushing it  but because the world is pulling it. So English mania is a turning point. Like the harnessing of electricity in our cities  or the fall of the Berlin Wall  English represents hope for a better future    a future where the world has a common language to solve its common problems. Thank you very much. This is my first trip  my first foreign trip as a first lady. Can you believe that  And while this is not my first visit to the U.K.  I have to say that I am glad that this is my first official visit. The special relationship between the United States and the U.K. is based not only on the relationship between governments  but the common language and the values that we share  and I'm reminded of that by watching you all today. During my visit I've been especially honored to meet some of Britain's most extraordinary women    women who are paving the way for all of you. And I'm honored to meet you  the future leaders of Great Britain and this world. And although the circumstances of our lives may seem very distant  with me standing here as the First Lady of the United States of America  and you  just getting through school  I want you to know that we have very much in common. For nothing in my life's path would have predicted that I'd be standing here as the first African American First Lady of the United States of America. There is nothing in my story that would land me here. I wasn't raised with wealth or resources or any social standing to speak of. I was raised on the South Side of Chicago. That's the real part of Chicago. And I was the product of a working class community. My father was a city worker all of his life  and my mother was a stay at home mom. And she stayed at home to take care of me and my older brother. Neither of them attended university. My dad was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in the prime of his life. But even as it got harder for him to walk and get dressed in the morning    I saw him struggle more and more    my father never complained about his struggle. He was grateful for what he had. He just woke up a little earlier and worked a little harder. And my brother and I were raised with all that you really need  love  strong values and a belief that with a good education and a whole lot of hard work  that there was nothing that we could not do. I am an example of what's possible when girls from the very beginning of their lives are loved and nurtured by the people around them. I was surrounded by extraordinary women in my life  grandmothers  teachers  aunts  cousins  neighbors  who taught me about quiet strength and dignity. And my mother  the most important role model in my life  who lives with us at the White House and helps to care for our two little daughters  Malia and Sasha. She's an active presence in their lives  as well as mine  and is instilling in them the same values that she taught me and my brother  things like compassion  and integrity  and confidence  and perseverance    all of that wrapped up in an unconditional love that only a grandmother can give. I was also fortunate enough to be cherished and encouraged by some strong male role models as well  including my father  my brother  uncles and grandfathers. The men in my life taught me some important things  as well. They taught me about what a respectful relationship should look like between men and women. They taught me about what a strong marriage feels like  that it's built on faith and commitment and an admiration for each other's unique gifts. They taught me about what it means to be a father and to raise a family. And not only to invest in your own home but to reach out and help raise kids in the broader community. And these were the same qualities that I looked for in my own husband  Barack Obama. And when we first met  one of the things that I remember is that he took me out on a date. And his date was to go with him to a community meeting. I know  how romantic. But when we met  Barack was a community organizer. He worked  helping people to find jobs and to try to bring resources into struggling neighborhoods. As he talked to the residents in that community center  he talked about two concepts. He talked about  the world as it is  and  the world as it should be.  And I talked about this throughout the entire campaign. What he said  that all too often  is that we accept the distance between those two ideas. And sometimes we settle for the world as it is  even when it doesn't reflect our values and aspirations. But Barack reminded us on that day  all of us in that room  that we all know what our world should look like. We know what fairness and justice and opportunity look like. We all know. And he urged the people in that meeting  in that community  to devote themselves to closing the gap between those two ideas  to work together to try to make the world as it is and the world as it should be  one and the same. And I think about that today because I am reminded and convinced that all of you in this school are very important parts of closing that gap. You are the women who will build the world as it should be. You're going to write the next chapter in history. Not just for yourselves  but for your generation and generations to come. And that's why getting a good education is so important. That's why all of this that you're going through    the ups and the downs  the teachers that you love and the teachers that you don't    why it's so important. Because communities and countries and ultimately the world are only as strong as the health of their women. And that's important to keep in mind. Part of that health includes an outstanding education. The difference between a struggling family and a healthy one is often the presence of an empowered woman or women at the center of that family. The difference between a broken community and a thriving one is often the healthy respect between men and women who appreciate the contributions each other makes to society. The difference between a languishing nation and one that will flourish is the recognition that we need equal access to education for both boys and girls. And this school  named after the U.K.'s first female doctor  and the surrounding buildings named for Mexican artist Frida Kahlo  Mary Seacole  the Jamaican nurse known as the  black Florence Nightingale   and the English author  Emily Bronte  honor women who fought sexism  racism and ignorance  to pursue their passions to feed their own souls. They allowed for no obstacles. As the sign said back there   without limitations.  They knew no other way to live than to follow their dreams. And having done so  these women moved many obstacles. And they opened many new doors for millions of female doctors and nurses and artists and authors  all of whom have followed them. And by getting a good education  you too can control your own destiny. Please remember that. If you want to know the reason why I'm standing here  it's because of education. I never cut class. Sorry  I don't know if anybody is cutting class. I never did it. I loved getting As. I liked being smart. I liked being on time. I liked getting my work done. I thought being smart was cooler than anything in the world. And you too  with these same values  can control your own destiny. You too can pave the way. You too can realize your dreams  and then your job is to reach back and to help someone just like you do the same thing. History proves that it doesn't matter whether you come from a council estate or a country estate. Your success will be determined by your own fortitude  your own confidence  your own individual hard work. That is true. That is the reality of the world that we live in. You now have control over your own destiny. And it won't be easy    that's for sure. But you have everything you need. Everything you need to succeed  you already have  right here. My husband works in this big office. They call it the Oval Office. In the White House  there's the desk that he sits at    it's called the Resolute desk. It was built by the timber of Her Majesty's Ship Resolute and given by Queen Victoria. It's an enduring symbol of the friendship between our two nations. And its name  Resolute  is a reminder of the strength of character that's required not only to lead a country  but to live a life of purpose  as well. And I hope in pursuing your dreams  you all remain resolute  that you go forward without limits  and that you use your talents    because there are many  we've seen them  it's there    that you use them to create the world as it should be. Because we are counting on you. We are counting on every single one of you to be the very best that you can be. Because the world is big. And it's full of challenges. And we need strong  smart  confident young women to stand up and take the reins. We know you can do it. We love you. Thank you so much. All human life  all life  depends on plants. Let me try to convince you of that in a few seconds. Just think for a moment. It doesn't matter whether you live in a small African village  or you live in a big city  everything comes back to plants in the end  whether it's for the food  the medicine  the fuel  the construction  the clothing  all the obvious things  or whether it's for the spiritual and recreational things that matter to us so much  or whether it's soil formation  or the effect on the atmosphere  or primary production. Damn it  even the books here are made out of plants. All these things  they come back to plants. And without them we wouldn't be here. Now plants are under threat. They're under threat because of changing climate. And they are also under threat because they are sharing a planet with people like us. And people like us want to do things that destroy plants  and their habitats. And whether that's because of food production  or because of the introduction of alien plants into places that they really oughtn't be  or because of habitats being used for other purposes    all these things are meaning that plants have to adapt  or die  or move. And plants sometimes find it rather difficult to move because there might be cities and other things in the way. So if all human life depends on plants  doesn't it make sense that perhaps we should try to save them  I think it does. And I want to tell you about a project to save plants. And the way that you save plants is by storing seeds. Because seeds  in all their diverse glory  are plants' futures. All the genetic information for future generations of plants are held in seeds. So here is the building  it looks rather unassuming  really. But it goes down below ground many stories. And it's the largest seed bank in the world. It exists not only in southern England  but distributed around the world. I'll come to that. This is a nuclear proof facility. God forbid that it should have to withstand that. So if you're going to build a seed bank  you have to decide what you're going to store in it. Right  And we decided that what we want to store first of all  are the species that are most under threat. And those are the dry land species. So first of all we did deals with    different countries. It means negotiating with heads of state  and with secretaries of state in    countries to sign treaties. We have     partner institutions all over the world  in all those countries colored orange. People come from all over the world to learn  and then they go away and plan exactly how they're going to collect these seeds. They have thousands of people all over the world tagging places where those plants are said to exist. They search for them. They find them in flower. And they go back when their seeds have arrived. And they collect the seeds. All over the world. The seeds    some of if is very untechnical. You kind of shovel them all in to bags and dry them off. You label them. You do some high tech things here and there  some low tech things here and there. And the main thing is that you have to dry them very carefully  at low temperature. And then you have to store them at about minus    degrees C    that's about minus four Fahrenheit  I think    with a very critically low moisture content. And these seeds will be able to germinate  we believe  with many of the species  in thousands of years  and certainly in hundreds of years. It's no good storing the seeds if you don't know they're still viable. So every    years we do germination tests on every sample of seeds that we have. And this is a distributed network. So all around the world people are doing the same thing. And that enables us to develop germination protocols. That means that we know the right combination of heat and cold and the cycles that you have to get to make the seed germinate. And that is very useful information. And then we grow these things  and we tell people  back in the countries where these seeds have come from   Look  actually we're not just storing this to get the seeds later  but we can give you this information about how to germinate these difficult plants.  And that's already happening. So where have we got to  I am pleased to unveil that our three billionth seed    that's three thousand millionth seed    is now stored. Ten percent of all plant species on the planet         species are safe         species  if we get the funding  by next year. Twenty five percent of all the world's plants  by     . These are not just crop plants  as you might have seen stored in Svalbard in Norway    fantastic work there. This is at least     times bigger. We have thousands of collections that have been sent out all over the world  drought tolerant forest species sent to Pakistan and Egypt  especially photosynthetic efficient plants come here to the United States  salt tolerant pasture species sent to Australia  the list goes on and on. These seeds are used for restoration. So in habitats that have already been damaged  like the tall grass prairie here in the USA  or in mined land in various countries  restoration is already happening because of these species    and because of this collection. Some of these plants  like the ones on the bottom to the left of your screen  they are down to the last few remaining members. The one where the guy is collecting seeds there on the truck  that is down to about    last remaining trees. Fantastically useful plant  both for protein and for medicine. We have training going on in China  in the USA  and many other countries. How much does it cost        dollars per species is the average. I think that's cheap  at the price. And that gets you all the scientific data that goes with it. The future research is  How can we find the genetic and molecular markers for the viability of seeds  without having to plant them every    years   And we're almost there. Thank you very much. College presidents are not the first people who come to mind when the subject is the uses of the creative imagination. So I thought I'd start by telling you how I got here. The story begins in the late '  s. I was invited to meet with leading educators from the newly free Eastern Europe and Russia. They were trying to figure out how to rebuild their universities. Since education under the Soviet Union was essentially propaganda serving the purposes of a state ideology  they appreciated that it would take wholesale transformations if they were to provide an education worthy of free men and women. Given this rare opportunity to start fresh  they chose liberal arts as the most compelling model because of its historic commitment to furthering its students' broadest intellectual  and deepest ethical potential. Having made that decision they came to the United States  home of liberal arts education  to talk with some of us most closely identified with that kind of education. They spoke with a passion  an urgency  an intellectual conviction that  for me  was a voice I had not heard in decades  a dream long forgotten. For  in truth  we had moved light years from the passions that animated them. But for me  unlike them  in my world  the slate was not clean  and what was written on it was not encouraging. In truth  liberal arts education no longer exists    at least genuine liberal arts education    in this country. We have professionalized liberal arts to the point where they no longer provide the breadth of application and the enhanced capacity for civic engagement that is their signature. Over the past century the expert has dethroned the educated generalist to become the sole model of intellectual accomplishment.  Applause  Expertise has for sure had its moments. But the price of its dominance is enormous. Subject matters are broken up into smaller and smaller pieces  with increasing emphasis on the technical and the obscure. We have even managed to make the study of literature arcane. You may think you know what is going on in that Jane Austen novel    that is  until your first encounter with postmodern deconstructionism. The progression of today's college student is to jettison every interest except one. And within that one  to continually narrow the focus  learning more and more about less and less  this  despite the evidence all around us of the interconnectedness of things. Lest you think I exaggerate  here are the beginnings of the A B Cs of anthropology. As one moves up the ladder  values other than technical competence are viewed with increasing suspicion. Questions such as   What kind of a world are we making  What kind of a world should we be making  What kind of a world can we be making   are treated with more and more skepticism  and move off the table. In so doing  the guardians of secular democracy in effect yield the connection between education and values to fundamentalists  who  you can be sure  have no compunctions about using education to further their values  the absolutes of a theocracy. Meanwhile  the values and voices of democracy are silent. Either we have lost touch with those values or  no better  believe they need not or cannot be taught. This aversion to social values may seem at odds with the explosion of community service programs. But despite the attention paid to these efforts  they remain emphatically extracurricular. In effect  civic mindedness is treated as outside the realm of what purports to be serious thinking and adult purposes. Simply put  when the impulse is to change the world  the academy is more likely to engender a learned helplessness than to create a sense of empowerment. This brew    oversimplification of civic engagement  idealization of the expert  fragmentation of knowledge  emphasis on technical mastery  neutrality as a condition of academic integrity    is toxic when it comes to pursuing the vital connections between education and the public good  between intellectual integrity and human freedom  which were at the heart    my European colleagues. When the astronomical distance between the realities of the academy and the visionary intensity of this challenge were more than enough  I can assure you  to give one pause  what was happening outside higher education made backing off unthinkable. Whether it was threats to the environment  inequities in the distribution of wealth  lack of a sane policy or a sustainable policy with respect to the continuing uses of energy  we were in desperate straits. And that was only the beginning. The corrupting of our political life had become a living nightmare  nothing was exempt    separation of powers  civil liberties  the rule of law  the relationship of church and state. Accompanied by a squandering of the nation's material wealth that defied credulity. A harrowing predilection for the uses of force had become commonplace  with an equal distaste for the alternative forms of influence. At the same time  all of our firepower was impotent when it came to halting or even stemming the slaughter in Rwanda  Darfur  Myanmar. Our public education  once a model for the world  has become most noteworthy for its failures. Mastery of basic skills and a bare minimum of cultural literacy eludes vast numbers of our students. Despite having a research establishment that is the envy of the world  more than half of the American public don't believe in evolution. And don't press your luck about how much those who do believe in it actually understand it. Incredibly  this nation  with all its material  intellectual and spiritual resources  seems utterly helpless to reverse the freefall in any of these areas. Equally startling  from my point of view  is the fact that no one was drawing any connections between what is happening to the body politic  and what is happening in our leading educational institutions. We may be at the top of the list when it comes to influencing access to personal wealth. We are not even on the list when it comes to our responsibility for the health of this democracy. We are playing with fire. You can be sure Jefferson knew what he was talking about when he said   If a nation expects to be ignorant and free in a state of civilization  it expects what never was  and never will be.  On a more personal note  this betrayal of our principles  our decency  our hope  made it impossible for me to avoid the question   What will I say  years from now  when people ask  'Where were you '  As president of a leading liberal arts college  famous for its innovative history  there were no excuses. So the conversation began at Bennington. Knowing that if we were to regain the integrity of liberal education  it would take radical rethinking of basic assumptions  beginning with our priorities. Enhancing the public good becomes a primary objective. The accomplishment of civic virtue is tied to the uses of intellect and imagination at their most challenging. Our ways of approaching agency and authority turn inside out to reflect the reality that no one has the answers to the challenges facing citizens in this century  and everyone has the responsibility for trying and participating in finding them. Bennington would continue to teach the arts and sciences as areas of immersion that acknowledge differences in personal and professional objectives. But the balances redressed  our shared purposes assume an equal if not greater importance. When the design emerged it was surprisingly simple and straightforward. The idea is to make the political social challenges themselves    from health and education to the uses of force    the organizers of the curriculum. They would assume the commanding role of traditional disciplines. But structures designed to connect  rather than divide mutually dependent circles  rather than isolating triangles. And the point is not to treat these topics as topics of study  but as frameworks of action. The challenge  to figure out what it will take to actually do something that makes a significant and sustainable difference. Contrary to widely held assumptions  an emphasis on action provides a special urgency to thinking. The importance of coming to grips with values like justice  equity  truth  becomes increasingly evident as students discover that interest alone cannot tell them what they need to know when the issue is rethinking education  our approach to health  or strategies for achieving an economics of equity. The value of the past also comes alive  it provides a lot of company. You are not the first to try to figure this out  just as you are unlikely to be the last. Even more valuable  history provides a laboratory in which we see played out the actual  as well as the intended consequences of ideas. In the language of my students   Deep thought matters when you're contemplating what to do about things that matter.  A new liberal arts that can support this action oriented curriculum has begun to emerge. Rhetoric  the art of organizing the world of words to maximum effect. Design  the art of organizing the world of things. Mediation and improvisation also assume a special place in this new pantheon. Quantitative reasoning attains its proper position at the heart of what it takes to manage change where measurement is crucial. As is a capacity to discriminate systematically between what is at the core and what is at the periphery. And when making connections is of the essence  the power of technology emerges with special intensity. But so does the importance of content. The more powerful our reach  the more important the question  About what   When improvisation  resourcefulness  imagination are key  artists  at long last  take their place at the table  when strategies of action are in the process of being designed. In this dramatically expanded ideal of a liberal arts education where the continuum of thought and action is its life's blood  knowledge honed outside the academy becomes essential. Social activists  business leaders  lawyers  politicians  professionals will join the faculty as active and ongoing participants in this wedding of liberal education to the advancement of the public good. Students  in turn  continuously move outside the classroom to engage the world directly. And of course  this new wine needs new bottles if we are to capture the liveliness and dynamism of this idea. The most important discovery we made in our focus on public action was to appreciate that the hard choices are not between good and evil  but between competing goods. This discovery is transforming. It undercuts self righteousness  radically alters the tone and character of controversy  and enriches dramatically the possibilities for finding common ground. Ideology  zealotry  unsubstantiated opinions simply won't do. This is a political education  to be sure. But it is a politics of principle  not of partisanship. So the challenge for Bennington is to do it. On the cover of Bennington's      holiday card is the architect's sketch of a building opening in      that is to be a center for the advancement of public action. The center will embody and sustain this new educational commitment. Think of it as a kind of secular church. The words on the card describe what will happen inside. We intend to turn the intellectual and imaginative power  passion and boldness of our students  faculty and staff to developing strategies for acting on the critical challenges of our time. So we are doing our job. While these past weeks have been a time of national exhilaration in this country  it would be tragic if you thought this meant your job was done. The glacial silence we have experienced in the face of the shredding of the constitution  the unraveling of our public institutions  the deterioration of our infrastructure is not limited to the universities. We the people have become inured to our own irrelevance when it comes to doing anything significant about anything that matters concerning governance  beyond waiting another four years. We persist also in being sidelined by the idea of the expert as the only one capable of coming up with answers  despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary. The problem is there is no such thing as a viable democracy made up of experts  zealots  politicians and spectators. People will continue and should continue to learn everything there is to know about something or other. We actually do it all the time. And there will be and should be those who spend a lifetime pursuing a very highly defined area of inquiry. But this single mindedness will not yield the flexibilities of mind  the multiplicity of perspectives  the capacities for collaboration and innovation this country needs. That is where you come in. What is certain is that the individual talent exhibited in such abundance here  needs to turn its attention to that collaborative  messy  frustrating  contentious and impossible world of politics and public policy. President Obama and his team simply cannot do it alone. If the question of where to start seems overwhelming you are at the beginning  not the end of this adventure. Being overwhelmed is the first step if you are serious about trying to get at things that really matter  on a scale that makes a difference. So what do you do when you feel overwhelmed  Well  you have two things. You have a mind. And you have other people. Start with those  and change the world. Information technology grows in an exponential manner. It's not linear. And our intuition is linear. When we walked through the savanna a thousand years ago we made linear predictions where that animal would be  and that worked fine. It's hardwired in our brains. But the pace of exponential growth is really what describes information technologies. And it's not just computation. There is a big difference between linear and exponential growth. If I take    steps linearly    one  two  three  four  five    I get to   . If I take    steps exponentially    two  four  eight        I get to a billion. It makes a huge difference. And that really describes information technology. When I was a student at MIT  we all shared one computer that took up a whole building. The computer in your cellphone today is a million times cheaper  a million times smaller  a thousand times more powerful. That's a billion fold increase in capability per dollar that we've actually experienced since I was a student. And we're going to do it again in the next    years. Information technology progresses through a series of S curves where each one is a different paradigm. So people say   What's going to happen when Moore's Law comes to an end   Which will happen around     . We'll then go to the next paradigm. And Moore's Law was not the first paradigm to bring exponential growth to computing. The exponential growth of computing started decades before Gordon Moore was even born. And it doesn't just apply to computation. It's really any technology where we can measure the underlying information properties. Here we have    famous computers. I put them in a logarithmic graph. The logarithmic scale hides the scale of the increase  because this represents trillions fold increase since the      census. In     s they were shrinking vacuum tubes  making them smaller and smaller. They finally hit a wall  they couldn't shrink the vacuum tube any more and keep the vacuum. And that was the end of the shrinking of vacuum tubes  but it was not the end of the exponential growth of computing. We went to the fourth paradigm  transistors  and finally integrated circuits. When that comes to an end we'll go to the sixth paradigm  three dimensional self organizing molecular circuits. But what's even more amazing  really  than this fantastic scale of progress  is that    look at how predictable this is. I mean this went through thick and thin  through war and peace  through boom times and recessions. The Great Depression made not a dent in this exponential progression. We'll see the same thing in the economic recession we're having now. At least the exponential growth of information technology capability will continue unabated. And I just updated these graphs. Because I had them through      in my book   The Singularity is Near.  So we updated them  so I could present it here  to     . And I was asked   Well aren't you nervous  Maybe it kind of didn't stay on this exponential progression.  I was a little nervous because maybe the data wouldn't be right  but I've done this now for    years  and it has stayed on this exponential progression. Look at this graph here.You could buy one transistor for a dollar in     . You can buy half a billion today  and they are actually better  because they are faster. But look at how predictable this is. And I'd say this knowledge is over fitting to past data. I've been making these forward looking predictions for about    years. And the cost of a transistor cycle  which is a measure of the price performance of electronics  comes down about every year. That's a    percent deflation rate. And it's also true of other examples  like DNA data or brain data. But we more than make up for that. We actually ship more than twice as much of every form of information technology. We've had    percent growth in constant dollars in every form of information technology for the last half century  despite the fact that you can get twice as much of it each year. This is a completely different example. This is not Moore's Law. The amount of DNA data we've sequenced has doubled every year. The cost has come down by half every year. And this has been a smooth progression since the beginning of the genome project. And halfway through the project  skeptics said   Well  this is not working out. You're halfway through the genome project and you've finished one percent of the project.  But that was really right on schedule. Because if you double one percent seven more times  which is exactly what happened  you get     percent. And the project was finished on time. Communication technologies     different ways to measure this  the number of bits being moved around  the size of the Internet. But this has progressed at an exponential pace. This is deeply democratizing. I wrote  over    years ago in  The Age of Intelligent Machines   when the Soviet Union was going strong  that it would be swept away by this growth of decentralized communication. And we will have plenty of computation as we go through the   st century to do things like simulate regions of the human brain. But where will we get the software  Some critics say   Oh  well software is stuck in the mud.  But we are learning more and more about the human brain. Spatial resolution of brain scanning is doubling every year. The amount of data we're getting about the brain is doubling every year. And we're showing that we can actually turn this data into working models and simulations of brain regions. There is about    regions of the brain that have been modeled  simulated and tested  the auditory cortex  regions of the visual cortex  cerebellum  where we do our skill formation  slices of the cerebral cortex  where we do our rational thinking. And all of this has fueled an increase  very smooth and predictable  of productivity. We've gone from    dollars to     dollars in constant dollars in the value of an average hour of human labor  fueled by this information technology. And we're all concerned about energy and the environment. Well this is a logarithmic graph. This represents a smooth doubling  every two years  of the amount of solar energy we're creating  particularly as we're now applying nanotechnology  a form of information technology  to solar panels. And we're only eight doublings away from it meeting     percent of our energy needs. And there is    thousand times more sunlight than we need. We ultimately will merge with this technology. It's already very close to us. When I was a student it was across campus  now it's in our pockets. What used to take up a building now fits in our pockets. What now fits in our pockets would fit in a blood cell in    years. And we will begin to actually deeply influence our health and our intelligence  as we get closer and closer to this technology. Based on that we are announcing  here at TED  in true TED tradition  Singularity University. It's a new university that's founded by Peter Diamandis  who is here in the audience  and myself. It's backed by NASA and Google  and other leaders in the high tech and science community. And our goal was to assemble the leaders  both teachers and students  in these exponentially growing information technologies  and their application. But Larry Page made an impassioned speech at our organizing meeting  saying we should devote this study to actually addressing some of the major challenges facing humanity. And if we did that  then Google would back this. And so that's what we've done. The last third of the nine week intensive summer session will be devoted to a group project to address some major challenge of humanity. Like for example  applying the Internet  which is now ubiquitous  in the rural areas of China or in Africa  to bringing health information to developing areas of the world. And these projects will continue past these sessions  using collaborative interactive communication. All the intellectual property that is created and taught will be online and available  and developed online in a collaborative fashion. Here is our founding meeting. But this is being announced today. It will be permanently headquartered in Silicon Valley  at the NASA Ames research center. There are different programs for graduate students  for executives at different companies. The first six tracks here    artificial intelligence  advanced computing technologies  biotechnology  nanotechnology    are the different core areas of information technology. Then we are going to apply them to the other areas  like energy  ecology  policy law and ethics  entrepreneurship  so that people can bring these new technologies to the world. So we're very appreciative of the support we've gotten from both the intellectual leaders  the high tech leaders  particularly Google and NASA. This is an exciting new venture. And we invite you to participate. Thank you very much. I have a big impact on the planet to travel here by plane. I emitted  in the atmosphere  nine tons of CO   that is the weight of two elephants. I came here to speak about ecology  and I emitted as much CO  as a Frenchman in one year. So what do I have to do  I have to kill a Frenchman when I come back at home  I have to do my carbon offset in another way  like I do every time. In fact my work is to show our impact on our planet. I'm going to show you some examples of the last pictures I've done in the last year. Alberta sand oil  a lot of pollution. You know the problem  we don't want to believe what we know. In Alberta people work nonstop     hours by seven to extract as much oil as they can. We know about the end of oil. Oil sand is not a long term solution. But we use three times more oil than we find every year. We don't want to believe what we know. Deny. Coral reef in New Caledonia.     percent of the coral may be wiped out before      because of global warming. And you know how coral are very sensitive to temperature  and are very important for the biodiversity of the sea. North Pole. I've done this picture last summer. It was impossible to do this picture    years ago. Now there is a new way open between Atlantic and Pacific. The thickness of the Arctic decreased more than    percent since     . There is a new face of Kilimanjaro without ice. Sad picture. It lost    percent of its ice. According to scientists  in     years all the mountain glacier will be gone. Glaciers are very important for the life on earth. Like Al Gore told you  two billion people live on the water from the glacier of Himalaya. Return of fish men. One fifth of human kind depend on fish to live. Today now    percent of the fish stock are over exploited. According to FAO  if we don't change our system of fishing the main sea resources will be gone in     . We don't want to believe what we know. The beautiful picture  by  unclear  in Africa. One human of six have not enough to eat in the world. One billion people have not enough to eat. In Africa  corn is one of the main foods in many places. Here in America     percent of the corn cultivated is used to feed animals or to do oil. Palm tree plantation in Borneo. Every year we lose    thousand square miles in deforestation. Refugee camp in Darfur. Today we have    million refugees in the world. According to the U.N.  we speak about     million refugees in     . I always show my pictures in the street. We have done already     exhibitions in the cities. But how to understand the world without the voice of people  Landscape was not enough. It was obvious to me to do another work. I launched a project named Six Billion Others. I sent around the world six cameramen asking the same question  the same crucial question  about life. We have done five thousand interviews. I'm going to show you this. Man  The most beautiful thing that has happened to me in life  It's when my dad told me   Here  I give you this girl as your fiance.  Woman  Love  Love is nice if you can have it. Second Man  Romeo and Juliet  Sassi and Panno  Dodi and Diana  Heer and Ranjha  this is love  Third Man  My greatest fear is ... Woman  You're asking me a hard question. Fourth Man  I live happily because what else should I do  Fifth Man  The first thing I remember ...  Sixth Man  That's how I learned  by my mother   Fifth Man  ... from my childhood   Sixth Man  that you should respect humans.  Fifth Man  we were having fun  biking.  Sixth Man  I will never forget those words.  Seventh Man  We invented stories  we flew around the world  while remaining in our attic. Eighth Man  I had a big laugh today. Ninth Man  You see  family is ... it's awful.   th Man  In the word life  you have the life.   th Man  Who am I  Isn't that the biggest question    th Man  If I was to go back to Iraq and speak to the people  I'd have to bow down and kiss their feet. Just as that woman tried to kiss my feet when we were taking her sons. I feel ashamed. And I feel humbled by their strength. And I will forever feel a need to make reparations to Iraq. Second Woman  Dad  Mom  I grew up. You shouldn't worry about me. Dad doesn't need to go to work. My family ... What can I say  At the moment  my family is very poor  my life here in Shenzhen is just about showing myself that I can earn more and to let my parents stay and have something to live on. I don't want them to spend their whole lives in poverty. If someday I can achieve something  I would like to say thank you daddy and mommy. Thank you. Thank you for having fed me and raised me  and for making my life of today. Thank you.   th Man  After seven years now of being in a wheelchair  I've done more in life being in a chair than out of a chair. I still surf. I sail the world. I freedive. After many people said I couldn't do that. And I think that comes from connecting with nature  connecting with the energy of life  because we're all disabled in some way on the planet    spiritually  mentally or physically. I got the easy part.   th Man  Let's say that you and me like each other. You come from elsewhere. You don't know me. I don't know you. We talk without lying. If I do like you  I give you one cow and many other things and we become friends. How can we make it all by ourselves  YAB  You can also go to the website  answer    respond to the questions also. Forty crucial questions. Now I am going to speak to you about my movie. For the last three years  I was shooting the earth for the movie. The name of the movie is  Home      Maison.  It is about the state of the planet. It's a fantastic story of life on the earth. I'm very proud to show you the teaser. Video  This Earth is four and a half billion years old. These plants  several hundred million years old. And we humans have been walking upright for only     thousand years. We've managed to adapt  and have conquered the whole planet. For generations  we've been raising our children  not unlike millions of other species living beside us. For the past    years I've been closely watching the earth and its dwellers from high up in the sky. Our life is tied to the well being of our planet. We depend on water  forests  deserts  oceans. Fishing  breeding  farming are still the world's foremost human occupations. And what binds us together is far greater than what divides us. We all share the same need for the earth's gifts    the same wish to rise above ourselves  and become better. And yet we carry on raising walls to keep us apart. Today our greatest battle is to protect the natural offerings of our planet. In less than    years we've altered it more thoroughly than in the entire history of mankind. Half of the world's forests have vanished. Water resources are running low. Intensive farming is depleting soils. Our energy sources are not sustainable. The climate is changing. We are endangering ourselves. We're only trying to improve our lives. But the wealth gaps are growing wider. We haven't yet understood that we're going at a much faster pace than the planet can sustain. We know that solutions are available today. We all have the power to change this trend for the better. So what are we waiting for  YAB  Luc Besson is the producer of the movie. But it is not a normal movie. The film is going to be distributed free. This film has no copyright. On the five of June  the environment day  everybody can download the movie on Internet. The film is given for free to the distributor for TV and theater to show it the fifth of June. There is no business on this movie. It is also available for school  cities  NGOs and you. We have to believe what we know. Let me tell you something. It's too late to be pessimistic    really too late. We have all a part of the solutions. To finish  I would like to welcome the      th baby born since the beginning of this talk. Merci beaucoup. I love you.  The Better Man.  I was the better at getting and keeping. You were the better at spend and spend  I was the better at grubbing and heaping  But who was the better man in the end  Yes  who was the better man  my friend  You were the better with lords and ladies  I was the better at pillaging Troy  You were the better at kissing the babies  I was the better at search and destroy. But who was the better man  old boy  Who was the better man  I was the better at improvisation  You were the better at spinning the plates  I was the better at procrastination  You were the better at quiet debate. But who was the better man  old mate  Who was the better man  You were the better at rolling a reefer  I was the better at coke and rum  Remember that night on the beach in Ibiza  The Maori twins with the tattooed bum  But who was the better man  old chum  Who was the better man  Now we come down to it  relatives grieving. Out in the hall with their crocodile tears  Now that you're out of it  now that you're leaving  Now that they've sealed your arse and your ears  What I've been meaning to tell you for years  And years  and years  and years  old friend ... Is that you were the better man  in the end  You were the better man  My friend. I wrote this next poem for my mother. Every one of us had a mother  only one    probably the most important person in your life  if you're lucky enough to know them. My mother was certainly the most important in mine. Let me try and describe her to you. She's    years old. She's frail. White  platinum hair. Why do they do that  Why do old ladies go to those hair shops  and make those helmets  Bright as a button. All the ducks in a row. Looks like a much prettier version of Margaret Thatcher  but without any of the soft bits in Margaret's character. I wrote this poem for her. These are not my beliefs. But my mother has lived by this creed all her life.  Never Go Back.  Never go back. Never go back. Never return to the haunts of your youth. Keep to the track  to the beaten track  Memory holds all you need of the truth. Never look back. Never look back. Never succumb to the gorgon's stare. Keep to the track  to the beaten track  No one is waiting and nothing is there. Never go back. Never go back. Never surrender the future you earned. Keep to the track  to the beaten track  Never return to the bridges you've burned. Never look back. Never look back. Never retreat to the 'glorious past.' Keep to the track  to the beaten track  Treat every day of your life as your last. Never go back. Never go back. Never acknowledge the ghost on the stair. Keep to the track  to the beaten track  No one is waiting and nothing is there. Now ladies and gentlemen  I'm up on me hobbyhorse. If every commercially minded cosmetic surgeon were tied end to end along a railroad track  that would be me  stoking the train without a qualm in the world. Ladies  don't do it. Don't do it. You think we want you to do it  but we don't want you to do it. Stop it. Tell them to go to hell. You bodies are wonderful as they are. Just leave them alone.  To a Beautiful Lady of a Certain Age.  Lady lady  do not weep. What is gone is gone. Now sleep. Turn your pillow. Dry your tears. Count thy sheep and not thy years. Nothing good can come of this. Time rules all  my dearest. 'Tis but folly to be waging war On one who never lost before. Lady  this is all in vain. Youth can never come again  We have drunk the summer wine. None can make a stitch in time. Nip and tuck till crack of doom. What is foretold in the womb May not be foresworn with gold. Nor may time be bought or sold. Dearest  do I love thee less  Do I shrink from thy caress  Think you I could cease to care  Never was there one so fair  Lady lady  do not weep    What is gone is gone. Now sleep. Lean against me  calm your fears  Count thy blessings  not thy years. America  ladies and gentlemen  has done more for me financially than Britain ever has  or ever could have done. I was born in Britain  as you have probably guessed. Even when on its worst behavior  I find myself automatically defending the USA from the sneers of green eyed Europhiles playing their Greek card to Roman trumps. America is an empire. I hope you know that now. All empires  by definition  are bumbling  shambolic  bullying  bureaucratic affairs  as certain of the rightness of their cause in infancy  as they are corrupted by power in their dotage. I am no historian  ladies and gentlemen. But it seems to be that the USA's sins  compared to those of many previous empires  are of a more moderate  if more pervasive  kind. Let me put this bluntly. If Americans are so fat  stupid and ignorant  my dear friends from Birmingham  how come they rule the world   Hail to the Gods of America.  Hail to the Gods of America  Hail to the gods of the dream. Invictus E Pluribus Unum. But which of them reigns supreme  Which is America's Jupiter  The Brahmins of Capital Hill  A sorcerer's profit on Wall Street  They eye of a dollar bill  Or is it celebrity status  The worship of those we hate. Or the cult of living forever  If only we'd watch our weight. What of the titans of media  Or Hollywood's siren call  What of the temples of justice  Whose servants enslave us all  What of the Brand and the Label  What of the upstart Sport  And what of the Constitution  That bully of last resort  Hail to the God of America  Whose power the masses extol    Convenience rules America  Convenience owns our soul. Aye  that it does. And if you would like to know why I am not a father    I  who by a miracle have    godchildren    the answer is in this poem  which upsets me every time I read it.  Love Came to Visit Me.  Love came to visit me  shy as a fawn. But finding me busy  she fled  with the dawn. At    the torch of resentment was lit. My rage at injustice waxed hot as the pits. The flux of its lava cleared all in its path. Comrades and enemies fled from its wrath. Yet lovers grew wary  once novelty waned To lie with a bloody man  his terror unfeigned. At    my powers seemed mighty to me. The fruits of my rivals  I shook from the tree. By guile and by bluster  by night and by day  I battered and scattered the fools from my way. And women grew willing to sham and to bluff. Their trinkets and baubles cost little enough. From    to     grown easy and sly  I wined them and dined them  like pigs in a sty. We feasted and reveled and rutted in muck  Forgetting our peril  forgetting to duck  Forgetting times arrows are sharper than knives. Grown sick to our stomachs  and sick of our lives. Love came to visit me  shy as a fawn. But finding me busy  she fled with the dawn. Um  there are    I've got far too much money and I have far too much fun in my businesses. So poetry came as a complete shock to me  ladies and gentlemen. A complete shock. I was a little ill. Okay  I was ill. Okay  I had a life threatening illness  you know. I was in a clinic. I wasn't allowed to make telephone calls. I wasn't allowed to see any of my    you know  whatever. So  in the end I begged a pack of Post it notes off a nurse. And from another nurse  I begged a pencil  pen. And I didn't know what else to do. So I started to write poetry. That was in October of     . I'm not an evil man. But sometimes I try to put myself in an evil man's position. I'm not a glorious and fantastic looking woman  who men fall down  you know  when she walks in a room. But sometimes I try to put myself in that position. Not with much success. But it's interesting to me. I love to write historical verse. I love to think what they thought  what it was like. Because although many of the speakers and many of the people who are in the audience  although you guys can not only go to the moon  you know  you're going to totally transform everything. Cloning will transform everything. Voice navigation will transform everything. I don't know. You can do anything you want. All you guys are so clever  and women  you can do it all  But human nature doesn't change  mate. My friends  human nature is exactly the same as it was when my ancestor    probably it was my ancestor    got his hands around the neck of the last Neanderthal  and battered the bastard to death. You think we didn't do that  Oh  we did. We killed every single one of them. Inch by inch we killed them. We hunted them down wherever they were. Rivals for meat. Rivals for berries. We're still doing it  with all of the genius assembled in this room. Our natures haven't changed a single iota. And they never will. Even when we've got off this little planet  and have put some of our eggs in some other baskets. And I am as bad as you. I spent eight years running one of the most successful publishing businesses in the world. And at seven o'clock every night  I took me some more girls  already corrupted. I never did anything to anyone that wasn't. And I took crack cocaine  every single night for seven years. It was like Dante's  Inferno.  It was unbelievable. One of the offshoots of crack cocaine is that you keep an erection for about four hours. And you stay up for   . It was absolutely unbelievable. Twenty two godchildren I've got. What do I say to them  I only stopped because I thought if I got caught  what would happen to my mother. If you're a woman  remember that. The love of your son can utterly transform anything he does.  Our Lady in White.  Pale she was  listless  And soft to the touch. A generous mistress Whom many loved much. Shoulder to shoulder  Night after night  We hoarded and sold her    Our Lady in White. We breathed but to savor her crystal caress. We craved but to favor the hem of her dress. We dabbled and babbled  Denying our thirsts. But always we scrabbled to lie with her first. Absent  we missed her  grew haggard and limp. Toyed with her sister  or threatened her pimp. Came word out of Babel  the lady returns  And there on the table we took her  in turns. Sensing the power that tyranny craves  There in that hour  she made us her slaves. Many there were  to covet her kiss. My shame as a spur  I fled the abyss. But only just. I used to be a Malthusian. This was my mental model of the world  exploding population  small planet  it's going to lead to ugly things. But I'm moving past Malthus  because I think that we just might be about     years from a kind of new enlightenment. Here's why. This is the U.N.'s population data  you may have seen  for the world. And the world's population expected to top out at something hopefully a bit less than    billion  late this century. And after that  most likely it's going to begin to decline. So what then  Most of the economic models are built around scarcity and growth. So a lot of economists look at declining population and expect to see stagnation  maybe depression. But a declining population is going to have at least two very beneficial economic effects. One  fewer people on a fixed amount of land make investing in property a bad bet. In the cities  a lot of the cost of property is actually wrapped up in its speculative value. Take away land speculation  price of land drops. And that begins to lift a heavy burden off the world's poor. Number two  a declining population means scarce labor. Scarce labor drives wages. As wages increase that also lifts the burden on the poor and the working class. Now I'm not talking about a radical drop in population like we saw in the Black Death. But look what happened in Europe after the plague  rising wages  land reform  technological innovation  birth of the middle class  and after that  forward looking social movements like the Renaissance  and later the Enlightenment. Most of our cultural heritage has tended to look backward  romanticizing the past. All of the Western religions begin with the notion of Eden  and descend through a kind of profligate present to a very ugly future. So human history is viewed as sort of this downhill slide from the good old days. But I think we're in for another change  about two generations after the top of that curve  once the effects of a declining population start to settle in. At that point  we'll start romanticizing the future again  instead of the nasty  brutish past. So why does this matter  Why talk about social economic movements that may be more than a century away  Because transitions are dangerous times. When land owners start to lose money  and labor demands more pay  there are some powerful interests that are going to fear for the future. Fear for the future leads to some rash decisions. If we have a positive view about the future then we may be able to accelerate through that turn  instead of careening off a cliff. If we can make it through the next     years  I think that your great great grandchildren will forget all about Malthus. And instead  they'll be planning for the future and starting to build the   nd Century Enlightenment. Thank you. What's happening to the climate  It is unbelievably bad. This is  obviously  that famous view now of the Arctic  which is likely to be gone at this point in the next three or four or five years. Very  very  very scary. So we all look at what we can do. And when you look at the worldwide sources of CO      percent are tied to buildings. Only nine percent is passenger cars  interestingly enough. So we ran off to a sushi bar. And at that sushi bar we came up with a great idea. And it was something called EcoRock. And we said we could redesign the     year old gypsum drywall process that generates    billion pounds of CO  a year. So it was a big idea. We wanted to reduce that by    percent  which is exactly what we've done. We started R D in     . Decided to use recycled content from cement and steel manufacturing. There is the inside of our lab. We haven't shown this before. But our people had to do some       different mixes to get this right  to hit our targets. And they worked absolutely very  very  very hard. So then we went forward and built our production line in China. We don't build this production equipment any longer in the U.S.  unfortunately. We did the line install over the summer. We started right there  with absolutely nothing. You're seeing for the first time  a brand new drywall production line  not made using gypsum at all. That's the finished production line there. We got our first panel out on December third. That is the slurry being poured onto paper  basically. That's the line running. The exciting thing is  look at the faces of the people. These are people who worked this project for two to three years. And they are so excited. That's the first board off the line. Our Vice President of Operation kissing the board. Obviously very  very excited. But this has a huge  huge impact on the environment. We signed the first panel just a few weeks after that  had a great signing ceremony  leading to people hopefully using these products across the world. And we've got Cradle to Cradle Gold on this thing. We happened to win  just recently  the Green Product of the Year for  The Re Invention of Drywall   from Popular Science. Thank you. Thank you. So here is what we learned        gallons of gas equivalent to build one house. You probably had no idea. It's like driving around the world six times. We must change everything. Look around the room  chairs  wood  everything around us has to change or we're not going to lick this problem. Don't listen to the people who say you can't do this  because anyone can. And these job losses  we can fix them with green collar jobs. We've got four plants. We're building this stuff around the country. We're going as fast as we can. Two and a half million cars worth of gypsum  you know  CO  generated. Right  So what will you do  I'll tell you what I did and why I did it. And I know my time's up. Those are my kids  Natalie and David. When they have their kids        they'd better look back at Grandpa and say   Hey  you gave it a good shot. You did the best you could with the team that you had.  So my hope is that when you leave TED  you will look at reducing your carbon footprint in however you can do it. And if you don't know how  please find me    I will help you. Last but not least  Bill Gates  I know you invented Windows. Wait till you see  maybe next year  what kind of windows we've invented. Thank you so much. This is a world changing invention. The smoke alarm has saved perhaps hundreds of thousands of lives  worldwide. But smoke alarms don't prevent fires. Every year in the USA  over        are killed or injured with         home fires. And one of the main causes of all these fires is electricity. What if we could prevent electrical fires before they start  Well  a couple of friends and I figured out how to do this. So how does electricity ignite residential fires  Well it turns out that the main causes are faulty and misused appliances and electrical wiring. Our invention had to address all of these issues. So what about circuit breakers  Well  Thomas Edison invented the circuit breaker in     . This is     year old technology  and this is a problem  because over    percent of all home electrical fires start below the safety threshold of circuit breakers. Hmmm ... So we considered all of this. And we realized that electrical appliances must be able to communicate directly with the power receptacle itself. Any electrical device    an appliance  an extension cord  whatever    must be able to tell the power outlet   Hey  power outlet  I'm drawing too much current. Shut me off now  before I start a fire.  And the power outlet needs to be smart enough to do it. So here is what we did. We put a    cent digital transponder  a data tag  in the appliance plug. And we put an inexpensive  wireless data reader inside the receptacle so they could communicate. Now  every home electrical system becomes an intelligent network. The appliance's safe operating parameters are embedded into its plug. If too much current is flowing  the intelligent receptacle turns itself off  and prevents another fire from starting. We call this technology EFCI  Electrical Fault Circuit Interrupter. Okay  two more points. Every year in the USA  roughly       children are admitted to emergency rooms for shock and burn injuries related to electrical receptacles. And this is crazy. An intelligent receptacle prevents injuries because the power is always off  until an intelligent plug is detected. Simple. Now  besides saving lives  perhaps the greatest benefit of intelligent power is in its energy savings. This invention will reduce global energy consumption by allowing remote control and automation of every outlet in every home and business. Now you can choose to reduce your home energy bill by automatically cycling heavy loads like air conditioners and heaters. Hotels and businesses can shut down unused rooms from a central location  or even a cell phone. There are    billion electrical outlets in North America alone. The potential energy savings is very  very significant. So far we've applied for     patent claims. Of those      have been granted      are in process. And I'm pleased to announce that just three weeks ago we received our first international recognition  the      CES Innovation Award. So  to conclude  intelligent power can  globally  save thousands of lives  prevent tens of thousands of injuries  and eliminate tens of billions of dollars in property damage every single year  while significantly reducing global energy consumption. In the spirit of this year's TED Conference  we think this is a powerful  world changing invention. And I'd like to thank Chris for this opportunity to unveil our technology with you  and soon the world. Thank you. This is called Hooked on a Feeling  The Pursuit of Happiness and Human Design. I put up a somewhat dour Darwin  but a very happy chimp up there. My first point is that the pursuit of happiness is obligatory. Man wishes to be happy  only wishes to be happy  and cannot wish not to be so. We are wired to pursue happiness  not only to enjoy it  but to want more and more of it. So given that that's true  how good are we at increasing our happiness  Well  we certainly try. If you look on the Amazon site  there are over       titles with advice on the seven habits  the nine choices  the    secrets  the        thoughts that are supposed to bring happiness. Now another way we try to increase our happiness is we medicate ourselves. And so there's over     million prescriptions out there for antidepressants. Prozac was really the first absolute blockbuster drug. It was clean  efficient  there was no high  there was really no danger  it had no street value. In       illegal drugs were a      billion business  representing eight percent of world trade  roughly the same as gas and oil. These routes to happiness haven't really increased happiness very much. One problem that's happening now is  although the rates of happiness are about as flat as the surface of the moon  depression and anxiety are rising. Some people say this is because we have better diagnosis  and more people are being found out. It isn't just that. We're seeing it all over the world. In the United States right now there are more suicides than homicides. There is a rash of suicide in China. And the World Health Organization predicts by the year      that depression will be the second largest cause of disability. Now the good news here is that if you take surveys from around the world  we see that about three quarters of people will say they are at least pretty happy. But this does not follow any of the usual trends. For example  these two show great growth in income  absolutely flat happiness curves. My field  the field of psychology  hasn't done a whole lot to help us move forward in understanding human happiness. In part  we have the legacy of Freud  who was a pessimist  who said that pursuit of happiness is a doomed quest  is propelled by infantile aspects of the individual that can never be met in reality. He said   One feels inclined to say that the intention that man should be happy is not included in the plan of creation.  So the ultimate goal of psychoanalytic psychotherapy was really what Freud called ordinary misery. And Freud in part reflects the anatomy of the human emotion system    which is that we have both a positive and a negative system  and our negative system is extremely sensitive. So for example  we're born loving the taste of something sweet and reacting aversively to the taste of something bitter. We also find that people are more averse to losing than they are happy to gain. The formula for a happy marriage is five positive remarks  or interactions  for every one negative. And that's how powerful the one negative is. Especially expressions of contempt or disgust  well you really need a lot of positives to upset that. I also put in here the stress response. We're wired for dangers that are immediate  that are physical  that are imminent  and so our body goes into an incredible reaction where endogenous opioids come in. We have a system that is really ancient  and really there for physical danger. And so over time  this becomes a stress response  which has enormous effects on the body. Cortisol floods the brain  it destroys hippocampal cells and memory  and can lead to all kinds of health problems. But unfortunately  we need this system in part. If we were only governed by pleasure we would not survive. We really have two command posts. Emotions are short lived intense responses to challenge and to opportunity. And each one of them allows us to click into alternate selves that tune in  turn on  drop out thoughts  perceptions  feelings and memories. We tend to think of emotions as just feelings. But in fact  emotions are an all systems alert that change what we remember  what kind of decisions we make  and how we perceive things. So let me go forward to the new science of happiness. We've come away from the Freudian gloom  and people are now actively studying this. And one of the key points in the science of happiness is that happiness and unhappiness are not endpoints of a single continuum. The Freudian model is really one continuum that  as you get less miserable  you get happier. And that isn't true    when you get less miserable  you get less miserable. And that happiness is a whole other end of the equation. And it's been missing. It's been missing from psychotherapy. So when people's symptoms go away  they tend to recur  because there isn't a sense of the other half    of what pleasure  happiness  compassion  gratitude  what are the positive emotions. And of course we know this intuitively  that happiness is not just the absence of misery. But somehow it was not put forward until very recently  seeing these as two parallel systems. So that the body can both look for opportunity and also protect itself from danger  at the same time. And they're sort of two reciprocal and dynamically interacting systems. People have also wanted to deconstruct. We use this word  happy   and it's this very large umbrella of a term. And then three emotions for which there are no English words  fiero  which is the pride in accomplishment of a challenge  schadenfreude  which is happiness in another's misfortune  a malicious pleasure  and naches  which is a pride and joy in one's children. Absent from this list  and absent from any discussions of happiness  are happiness in another's happiness. We don't seem to have a word for that. We are very sensitive to the negative  but it is in part offset by the fact that we have a positivity. We're also born pleasure seekers. Babies love the taste of sweet and hate the taste of bitter. They love to touch smooth surfaces rather than rough ones. They like to look at beautiful faces rather than plain faces. They like to listen to consonant melodies instead of dissonant melodies. Babies really are born with a lot of innate pleasures. There was once a statement made by a psychologist that said that    percent of the pursuit of happiness is really just about the genes  and it's as difficult to become happier as it is to become taller. That's nonsense. There is a decent contribution to happiness from the genes    about    percent    but there is still that    percent that is unaccounted for. Let's just go into the brain for a moment  and see where does happiness arise from in evolution. We have basically at least two systems here  and they both are very ancient. One is the reward system  and that's fed by the chemical dopamine. And it starts in the ventral tegmental area. It goes to the nucleus accumbens  all the way up to the prefrontal cortex  orbital frontal cortex  where decisions are made  high level. This was originally seen as a system that was the pleasure system of the brain. In the     s  Olds and Milner put electrodes into the brain of a rat. And the rat would just keep pressing that bar thousands and thousands and thousands of times. It wouldn't eat. It wouldn't sleep. It wouldn't have sex. It wouldn't do anything but press this bar. So they assumed this must be  you know  the brain's orgasmatron. It turned out that it wasn't  that it really is a system of motivation  a system of wanting. It gives objects what's called incentive salience. It makes something look so attractive that you just have to go after it. That's something different from the system that is the pleasure system  which simply says   I like this.  The pleasure system  as you see  which is the internal opiates  there is a hormone oxytocin  is widely spread throughout the brain. Dopamine system  the wanting system  is much more centralized. The other thing about positive emotions is that they have a universal signal. And we see here the smile. And the universal signal is not just raising the corner of the lips to the zygomatic major. It's also crinkling the outer corner of the eye  the orbicularis oculi. So you see  even    month old babies  when they see their mother  will show this particular kind of smile. Extroverts use it more than introverts. People who are relieved of depression show it more after than before. So if you want to unmask a true look of happiness  you will look for this expression. Our pleasures are really ancient. And we learn  of course  many  many pleasures  but many of them are base. And one of them  of course  is biophilia    that we have a response to the natural world that's very profound. Very interesting studies done on people recovering from surgery  who found that people who faced a brick wall versus people who looked out on trees and nature  the people who looked out on the brick wall were in the hospital longer  needed more medication  and had more medical complications. There is something very restorative about nature  and it's part of how we are tuned. Humans  particularly so  we're very imitative creatures. And we imitate from almost the second we are born. Here is a three week old baby. And if you stick your tongue out at this baby  the baby will do the same. We are social beings from the beginning. And even studies of cooperation show that cooperation between individuals lights up reward centers of the brain. One problem that psychology has had is instead of looking at this intersubjectivity    or the importance of the social brain to humans who come into the world helpless and need each other tremendously    is that they focus instead on the self and self esteem  and not self other. It's sort of  me   not  we.  And I think this has been a really tremendous problem that goes against our biology and nature  and hasn't made us any happier at all. Because when you think about it  people are happiest when in flow  when they're absorbed in something out in the world  when they're with other people  when they're active  engaged in sports  focusing on a loved one  learning  having sex  whatever. They're not sitting in front of the mirror trying to figure themselves out  or thinking about themselves. These are not the periods when you feel happiest. The other thing is  that a piece of evidence is  is if you look at computerized text analysis of people who commit suicide  what you find there  and it's quite interesting  is use of the first person singular     I    me    my   not  we  and  us     and the letters are less hopeless than they are really alone. And being alone is very unnatural to the human. There is a profound need to belong. But there are ways in which our evolutionary history can really trip us up. Because  for example  the genes don't care whether we're happy  they care that we replicate  that we pass our genes on. So for example we have three systems that underlie reproduction  because it's so important. There's lust  which is just wanting to have sex. And that's really mediated by the sex hormones. Romantic attraction  that gets into the desire system. And that's dopamine fed. And that's   I must have this one person.  There's attachment  which is oxytocin  and the opiates  which says   This is a long term bond.  See the problem is that  as humans  these three can separate. So a person can be in a long term attachment  become romantically infatuated with someone else  and want to have sex with a third person. The other way in which our genes can sometimes lead us astray is in social status. We are very acutely aware of our social status and always seek to further and increase it. Now in the animal world  there is only one way to increase status  and that's dominance. I seize command by physical prowess  and I keep it by beating my chest  and you make submissive gestures. Now  the human has a whole other way to rise to the top  and that is a prestige route  which is freely conferred. Someone has expertise and knowledge  and knows how to do things  and we give that person status. And that's clearly the way for us to create many more niches of status so that people don't have to be lower on the status hierarchy as they are in the animal world. The data isn't terribly supportive of money buying happiness. But it's not irrelevant. So if you look at questions like this  life satisfaction  you see life satisfaction going up with each rung of income. You see mental distress going up with lower income. So clearly there is some effect. But the effect is relatively small. And one of the problems with money is materialism. What happens when people pursue money too avidly  is they forget about the real basic pleasures of life. So we have here  this couple.  Do you think the less fortunate are having better sex   And then this kid over here is saying   Leave me alone with my toys.  So one of the things is that it really takes over. That whole dopamine wanting system takes over and derails from any of the pleasure system. Maslow had this idea back in the     s that as people rise above their biological needs  as the world becomes safer and we don't have to worry about basic needs being met    our biological system  whatever motivates us  is being satisfied    we can rise above them  to think beyond ourselves toward self actualization or transcendence  and rise above the materialist. So to just quickly conclude with some brief data that suggests this might be so. One is people who underwent what is called a quantum change  they felt their life and their whole values had changed. And sure enough  if you look at the kinds of values that come in  you see wealth  adventure  achievement  pleasure  fun  be respected  before the change  and much more post materialist values after. Women had a whole different set of value shifts. But very similarly  the only one that survived there was happiness. They went from attractiveness and happiness and wealth and self control to generosity and forgiveness. I end with a few quotes.  There is only one question  How to love this world   And Rilke   If your daily life seems poor  do not blame it  blame yourself. Tell yourself that you are not poet enough to call forth its riches.   First  say to yourself what you would be. Then do what you have to do.  Thank you. Let me share with you today an original discovery. But I want to tell it to you the way it really happened    not the way I present it in a scientific meeting  or the way you'd read it in a scientific paper. It's a story about beyond biomimetics  to something I'm calling biomutualism. I define that as an association between biology and another discipline  where each discipline reciprocally advances the other  but where the collective discoveries that emerge are beyond any single field. Now  in terms of biomimetics  as human technologies take on more of the characteristics of nature  nature becomes a much more useful teacher. Engineering can be inspired by biology by using its principles and analogies when they're advantageous  but then integrating that with the best human engineering  ultimately to make something actually better than nature. Now  being a biologist  I was very curious about this. These are gecko toes. And we wondered how they use these bizarre toes to climb up a wall so quickly. We discovered it. And what we found was that they have leaf like structures on their toes  with millions of tiny hairs that look like a rug  and each of those hairs has the worst case of split ends possible  about     to      split ends that are nano size. And the individual has   billion of these nano size split ends. They don't stick by Velcro or suction or glue. They actually stick by intermolecular forces alone  van der Waals forces. And I'm really pleased to report to you today that the first synthetic self cleaning  dry adhesive has been made. From the simplest version in nature  one branch  my engineering collaborator  Ron Fearing  at Berkeley  had made the first synthetic version. And so has my other incredible collaborator  Mark Cutkosky  at Stanford    he made much larger hairs than the gecko  but used the same general principles. And here is its first test. That's Kellar Autumn  my former Ph.D. student  professor now at Lewis and Clark  literally giving his first born child up for this test. More recently  this happened. Man  This the first time someone has actually climbed with it. Narrator  Lynn Verinsky  a professional climber  who appeared to be brimming with confidence. Lynn Verinsky  Honestly  it's going to be perfectly safe. It will be perfectly safe. Man  How do you know  Lynn Verinsky  Because of liability insurance.  Laughter  Narrator  With a mattress below and attached to a safety rope  Lynn began her    foot ascent. Lynn made it to the top in a perfect pairing of Hollywood and science. Man  So you're the first human being to officially emulate a gecko. Lynn Verinsky  Ha  Wow. And what a privilege that has been. Robert Full  That's what she did on rough surfaces. But she actually used these on smooth surfaces    two of them    to climb up  and pull herself up. And you can try this in the lobby  and look at the gecko inspired material. Now the problem with the robots doing this is that they can't get unstuck  with the material. This is the gecko's solution. They actually peel their toes away from the surface  at high rates  as they run up the wall. Well I'm really excited today to show you the newest version of a robot  Stickybot  using a new hierarchical dry adhesive. Here is the actual robot. And here is what it does. And if you look  you can see that it uses the toe peeling  just like the gecko does. If we can show some of the video  you can see it climbing up the wall. There it is. And now it can go on other surfaces because of the new adhesive that the Stanford group was able to do in designing this incredible robot. Oh. One thing I want to point out is  look at Stickybot. You see something on it. It's not just to look like a gecko. It has a tail. And just when you think you've figured out nature  this kind of thing happens. The engineers told us  for the climbing robots  that  if they don't have a tail  they fall off the wall. So what they did was they asked us an important question. They said   Well  it kind of looks like a tail.  Even though we put a passive bar there.  Do animals use their tails when they climb up walls   What they were doing was returning the favor  by giving us a hypothesis to test  in biology  that we wouldn't have thought of. So of course  in reality  we were then panicked  being the biologists  and we should know this already. We said   Well  what do tails do   Well we know that tails store fat  for example. We know that you can grab onto things with them. And perhaps it is most well known that they provide static balance. It can also act as a counterbalance. So watch this kangaroo. See that tail  That's incredible  Marc Raibert built a Uniroo hopping robot. And it was unstable without its tail. Now mostly tails limit maneuverability  like this human inside this dinosaur suit. My colleagues actually went on to test this limitation  by increasing the moment of inertia of a student  so they had a tail  and running them through and obstacle course  and found a decrement in performance  like you'd predict. But of course  this is a passive tail. And you can also have active tails. And when I went back to research this  I realized that one of the great TED moments in the past  from Nathan  we've talked about an active tail. Video  Myhrvold thinks tail cracking dinosaurs were interested in love  not war. Robert Full  He talked about the tail being a whip for communication. It can also be used in defense. Pretty powerful. So we then went back and looked at the animal. And we ran it up a surface. But this time what we did is we put a slippery patch that you see in yellow there. And watch on the right what the animal is doing with its tail when it slips. This is slowed down    times. So here is normal speed. And watch it now slip  and see what it does with its tail. It has an active tail that functions as a fifth leg  and it contributes to stability. If you make it slip a huge amount  this is what we discovered. This is incredible. The engineers had a really good idea. And then of course we wondered  okay  they have an active tail  but let's picture them. They're climbing up a wall  or a tree. And they get to the top and let's say there's some leaves there. And what would happen if they climbed on the underside of that leaf  and there was some wind  or we shook it  And we did that experiment  that you see here. And this is what we discovered. Now that's real time. You can't see anything. But there it is slowed down. What we discovered was the world's fastest air righting response. For those of you who remember your physics  that's a zero angular momentum righting response. But it's like a cat. You know  cats falling. Cats do this. They twist their bodies. But geckos do it better. And they do it with their tail. So they do it with this active tail as they swing around. And then they always land in the sort of superman skydiving posture. Okay  now we wondered  if we were right  we should be able to test this in a physical model  in a robot. So for TED we actually built a robot  over there  a prototype  with the tail. And we're going to attempt the first air righting response in a tail  with a robot. If we could have the lights on it. Okay  there it goes. And show the video. There it is. And it works just like it does in the animal. So all you need is a swing of the tail to right yourself. Now  of course  we were normally frightened because the animal has no gliding adaptations  so we thought   Oh that's okay. We'll put it in a vertical wind tunnel. We'll blow the air up  we'll give it a landing target  a tree trunk  just outside the plexi glass enclosure  and see what it does. So we did. And here is what it does. So the wind is coming from the bottom. This is slowed down    times. It does an equilibrium glide. Highly controlled. This is sort of incredible. But actually it's quite beautiful  when you take a picture of it. And it's better than that  it    just in the slide    maneuvers in mid air. And the way it does it  is it takes its tail and it swings it one way to yaw left  and it swings its other way to yaw right. So we can maneuver this way. And then    we had to film this several times to believe this    it also does this. Watch this. It oscillates its tail up and down like a dolphin. It can actually swim through the air. But watch its front legs. Can you see what they are doing  What does that mean for the origin of flapping flight  Maybe it's evolved from coming down from trees  and trying to control a glide. Stay tuned for that. So then we wondered   Can they actually maneuver with this   So there is the landing target. Could they steer towards it with these capabilities  Here it is in the wind tunnel. And it certainly looks like it. You can see it even better from down on top. Watch the animal. Definitely moving towards the landing target. Watch the whip of its tail as it does it. Look at that. It's unbelievable. So now we were really confused  because there are no reports of it gliding. So we went   Oh my god  we have to go to the field  and see if it actually does this.  Completely opposite of the way you'd see it on a nature film  of course. We wondered   Do they actually glide in nature   Well we went to the forests of Singapore and Southeast Asia. And the next video you see is the first time we've showed this. This is the actual video    not staged  a real research video    of animal gliding down. There is a red trajectory line. Look at the end to see the animal. But then as it gets closer to the tree  look at the close up. And see if you can see it land. So there it comes down. There is a gecko at the end of that trajectory line. You see it there  There  Watch it come down. Now watch up there and you can see the landing. Did you see it hit  It actually uses its tail too  just like we saw in the lab. So now we can continue this mutualism by suggesting that they can make an active tail. And here is the first active tail  in the robot  made by Boston Dynamics. So to conclude  I think we need to build biomutualisms  like I showed  that will increase the pace of basic discovery in their application. To do this though  we need to redesign education in a major way  to balance depth with interdisciplinary communication  and explicitly train people how to contribute to  and benefit from other disciplines. And of course you need the organisms and the environment to do it. That is  whether you care about security  search and rescue or health  we must preserve nature's designs  otherwise these secrets will be lost forever. And from what I heard from our new president  I'm very optimistic. Thank you. Why do so many people reach success and then fail  One of the big reasons is  we think success is a one way street. So we do everything that leads up to success  but then we get there. We figure we've made it  we sit back in our comfort zone  and we actually stop doing everything that made us successful. And it doesn't take long to go downhill. And I can tell you this happens  because it happened to me. Reaching success  I worked hard  I pushed myself. But then I stopped  because I figured   Oh  you know  I made it. I can just sit back and relax.  Reaching success  I always tried to improve and do good work. But then I stopped because I figured   Hey  I'm good enough. I don't need to improve any more.  Reaching success  I was pretty good at coming up with good ideas. Because I did all these simple things that led to ideas. But then I stopped  because I figured I was this hot shot guy and I shouldn't have to work at ideas  they should just come like magic. And the only thing that came was creative block. I couldn't come up with any ideas. Reaching success  I always focused on clients and projects  and ignored the money. Then all this money started pouring in. And I got distracted by it. And suddenly I was on the phone to my stockbroker and my real estate agent  when I should have been talking to my clients. And reaching success  I always did what I loved. But then I got into stuff that I didn't love  like management. I am the world's worst manager  but I figured I should be doing it  because I was  after all  the president of the company. Well  soon a black cloud formed over my head and here I was  outwardly very successful  but inwardly very depressed. But I'm a guy  I knew how to fix it. I bought a fast car. It didn't help. I was faster but just as depressed. So I went to my doctor. I said   Doc  I can buy anything I want. But I'm not happy. I'm depressed. It's true what they say  and I didn't believe it until it happened to me. But money can't buy happiness.  He said   No. But it can buy Prozac.  And he put me on anti depressants. And yeah  the black cloud faded a little bit  but so did all the work  because I was just floating along. I couldn't care less if clients ever called. And clients didn't call. Because they could see I was no longer serving them  I was only serving myself. So they took their money and their projects to others who would serve them better. Well  it didn't take long for business to drop like a rock. My partner and I  Thom  we had to let all our employees go. It was down to just the two of us  and we were about to go under. And that was great. Because with no employees  there was nobody for me to manage. So I went back to doing the projects I loved. I had fun again  I worked harder and  to cut a long story short  did all the things that took me back up to success. But it wasn't a quick trip. It took seven years. But in the end  business grew bigger than ever. And when I went back to following these eight principles  the black cloud over my head disappeared altogether. And I woke up one day and I said   I don't need Prozac anymore.  And I threw it away and haven't needed it since. I learned that success isn't a one way street. It doesn't look like this  it really looks more like this. It's a continuous journey. And if we want to avoid  success to failure syndrome   we just keep following these eight principles  because that is not only how we achieve success  it's how we sustain it. So here is to your continued success. Thank you very much. I have had the distinct pleasure of living inside two biospheres. Of course we all here in this room live in Biosphere  . I've also lived in Biosphere  . And the wonderful thing about that is that I get to compare biospheres. And hopefully from that I get to learn something. So what did I learn  Well  here I am inside Biosphere    making a pizza. So I am harvesting the wheat  in order to make the dough. And then of course I have to milk the goats and feed the goats in order to make the cheese. It took me four months in Biosphere   to make a pizza. Here in Biosphere    well it takes me about two minutes  because I pick up the phone and I call and say   Hey  can you deliver the pizza   So Biosphere   was essentially a three acre  entirely sealed  miniature world that I lived in for two years and    minutes. Over the top it was sealed with steel and glass  underneath it was sealed with a pan of steel    essentially entirely sealed. So we had our own miniature rainforest  a private beach with a coral reef. We had a savanna  a marsh  a desert. We had our own half acre farm that we had to grow everything. And of course we had our human habitat  where we lived. Back in the mid '  s when we were designing Biosphere    we had to ask ourselves some pretty basic questions. I mean  what is a biosphere  Back then  yes  I guess we all know now that it is essentially the sphere of life around the Earth  right  Well  you have to get a little more specific than that if you're going to build one. And so we decided that what it really is is that it is entirely materially closed    that is  nothing goes in or out at all  no material    and energetically open  which is essentially what planet Earth is. This is a chamber that was      th the size of Biosphere   that we called our Test Module. And the very first day that this fellow  John Allen  walked in  to spend a couple of days in there with all the plants and animals and bacteria that we'd put in there to hopefully keep him alive  the doctors were incredibly concerned that he was going to succumb to some dreadful toxin  or that his lungs were going to get choked with bacteria or something  fungus. But of course none of that happened. And over the ensuing few years  there were great sagas about designing Biosphere  . But by      we finally had this thing built. And it was time for us to go in and give it a go. We needed to know  is life this malleable  Can you take this biosphere  that has evolved on a planetary scale  and jam it into a little bottle  and will it survive  Big questions. And we wanted to know this both for being able to go somewhere else in the universe    if we were going to go to Mars  for instance  would we take a biosphere with us  to live in it  We also wanted to know so we can understand more about the Earth that we all live in. Well  in      it was finally time for us to go in and try out this baby. Let's take it on a maiden voyage. Will it work  Or will something happen that we can't understand and we can't fix  thereby negating the concept of man made biospheres  So eight of us went in  four men and four women. More on that later. And this is the world that we lived in. So  on the top  we had these beautiful rainforests and an ocean  and underneath we had all this technosphere  we called it  which is where all the pumps and the valves and the water tanks and the air handlers  and all of that. One of the Biospherians called it  garden of Eden on top of an aircraft carrier.  And then also we had the human habitat of course  with the laboratories  and all of that. This is the agriculture. It was essentially an organic farm. The day I walked into Biosphere    I was  for the first time  breathing a completely different atmosphere than everybody else in the world  except seven other people. At that moment I became part of that biosphere. And I don't mean that in an abstract sense  I mean it rather literally. When I breathed out  my CO  fed the sweet potatoes that I was growing. And we ate an awful lot of the sweet potatoes. And those sweet potatoes became part of me. In fact  we ate so many sweet potatoes I became orange with sweet potato. I literally was eating the same carbon over and over again. I was eating myself in some strange sort of bizarre way. When it came to our atmosphere  however  it wasn't that much of a joke over the long term  because it turned out that we were losing oxygen  quite a lot of oxygen. And we knew that we were losing CO . And so we were working to sequester carbon. Good lord    we know that term now. We were growing plants like crazy. We were taking their biomass  storing them in the basement  growing plants  going around  around  around  trying to take all of that carbon out of the atmosphere. We were trying to stop carbon from going into the atmosphere. We stopped irrigating our soil  as much as we could. We stopped tilling  so that we could prevent greenhouse gasses from going into the air. But our oxygen was going down faster than our CO  was going up  which was quite unexpected  because we had seen them going in tandem in the test module. And it was like playing atomic hide and seek. We had lost seven tons of oxygen. And we had no clue where it was. And I tell you  when you lose a lot of oxygen    and our oxygen went down quite far  it went from    percent down to   .  percent    my goodness  do you feel dreadful. I mean we were dragging ourselves around the Biosphere. And we had sleep apnea at night. So you'd wake up gasping with breath  because your blood chemistry has changed. And that you literally do that. You stop breathing and then you     Gasps     take a breath and it wakes you up. And it's very irritating. And everybody outside thought we were dying. I mean  the media was making it sound like were were dying. And I had to call up my mother every other day saying   No  Mum  it's fine  fine. We're not dead. We're fine. We're fine.  And the doctor was  in fact  checking us to make sure we were  in fact  fine. But in fact he was the person who was most susceptible to the oxygen. And one day he couldn't add up a line of figures. And it was time for us to put oxygen in. And you might think  well   Boy  your life support system was failing you. Wasn't that dreadful   Yes. In a sense it was terrifying. Except that I knew I could walk out the airlock door at any time  if it really got bad  though who was going to say   I can't take it anymore    Not me  that was for sure. But on the other hand  it was the scientific gold of the project  because we could really crank this baby up  as a scientific tool  and see if we could  in fact  find where those seven tons of oxygen had gone. And we did indeed find it. And we found it in the concrete. Essentially it had done something very simple. We had put too much carbon in the soil in the form of compost. It broke down  it took oxygen out of the air  it put CO  into the air  and it went into the concrete. Pretty straightforward really. So at the end of the two years when we came out  we were elated  because  in fact  although you might say we had discovered something that was quite  uhh   when your oxygen is going down  stopped working  essentially  in your life support system  that's a very bad failure. Except that we knew what it was. And we knew how to fix it. And nothing else emerged that really was as serious as that. And we proved the concept  more or less. People  on the other hand  was a different subject. We were    yeah I don't know that we were fixable. We all went quite nuts  I will say. And the day I came out of Biosphere    I was thrilled I was going to see all my family and my friends. For two years I'd been seeing people through the glass. And everybody ran up to me. And I recoiled. They stank  People stink  We stink of hairspray and underarm deodorant  and all kinds of stuff. Now we had stuff inside Biosphere to keep ourselves clean  but nothing with perfume. And boy do we stink out here. Not only that  but I lost touch of where my food came from. I had been growing all my own food. I had no idea what was in my food  where it came from. I didn't even recognize half the names in most of the food that I was eating. In fact  I would stand for hours in the aisles of shops  reading all the names on all of the things. People must have thought I was nuts. It was really quite astonishing. And I slowly lost track of where I was in this big biosphere  in this big biosphere that we all live in. In Biosphere   I totally understood that I had a huge impact on my biosphere  everyday  and it had an impact on me  very viscerally  very literally. So I went about my business  Paragon Space Development Corporation  a little firm I started with people while I was in the Biosphere  because I had nothing else to do. And one of the things we did was try to figure out  how small can you make these biospheres  and what can you do with them  And so we sent one onto the Mir Space Station. We had one on the shuttle and one on the International Space Station  for    months  where we managed to produce the first organisms to go through complete multiple life cycles in space    really pushing the envelope of understanding how malleable our life systems are. And I'm also proud to announce that you're getting a sneak preview    on Friday we're going to announce that we're actually forming a team to develop a system to grow plants on the Moon  which is going to be pretty fun. And the legacy of that is a system that we were designing  an entirely sealed system to grow plants to grow on Mars. And part of that is that we had to model very rapid circulation of CO  and oxygen and water through this plant system. As a result of that modeling I ended up in all places  in Eritrea  in the Horn of Africa. Eritrea  formerly part of Ethiopia  is one of those places that is astonishingly beautiful  incredibly stark  and I have no understanding of how people eke out a living there. It is so dry. This is what I saw. But this is also what I saw. I saw a company that had taken seawater and sand  and they were growing a kind of crop that will grow on pure salt water without having to treat it. And it will produce a food crop. In this case it was oilseed. It was astonishing. They were also producing mangroves in a plantation. And the mangroves were providing wood and honey and leaves for the animals  so that they could produce milk and whatnot  like we had in the Biosphere. And all of it was coming from this  shrimp farms. Shrimp farms are a scourge on the earth  frankly  from an environmental point of view. They pour huge amounts of pollutants into the ocean. They also pollute their next door neighbors. So they're all shitting each other's ponds  quite literally. And what this project was doing was taking the effluent of these  and turning them into all of this food. They were literally turning pollution into abundance for a desert people. They had created an industrial ecosystem  of a sense. I was there because I was actually modeling the mangrove portion for a carbon credit program  under the U.N. Kyoto Protocol system. And as I was modeling this mangrove swamp  I was thinking to myself   How do you put a box around this   When I'm modeling a plant in a box  literally  I know where to draw the boundary. In a mangrove forest like this I have no idea. Well  of course you have to draw the boundary around the whole of the Earth. And understand its interactions with the entire Earth. And put your project in that context. Around the world today we're seeing an incredible transformation  from what I would call a biocidal species  one that    whether we intentionally or unintentionally    have designed our systems to kill life  a lot of the time. This is in fact  this beautiful photograph  is in fact over the Amazon. And here the light green are areas of massive deforestation. And those beautiful wispy clouds are  in fact  fires  human made fires. We're in the process of transforming from this  to what I would call a biophilic society  one where we learn to nurture society. Now it may not seem like it  but we are. It is happening all across the world  in every kind of walk of life  and every kind of career and industry that you can think of. And I think often times people get lost in that. They go   But how can I possibly find my way in that  It's such a huge subject.  And I would say that the small stuff counts. It really does. This is the story of a rake in my backyard. This was my backyard  very early on  when I bought my property. And in Arizona  of course  everybody puts gravel down. And they like to keep everything beautifully raked. And they keep all the leaves away. And on Sunday morning the neighbors leaf blower comes out  and I want to throttle them. It's a certain type of aesthetic. We're very uncomfortable with untidiness. And I threw away my rake. And I let all of the leaves fall from the trees that I have on my property. And over time  essentially what have I been doing  I've been building topsoil. And so now all the birds come in. And I have hawks. And I have an oasis. This is what happens every spring. For six weeks  six to eight weeks  I have this flush of green oasis. This is actually in a riparian area. And all of Tucson could be like this if everybody would just revolt and throw away the rake. The small stuff counts. The Industrial Revolution    and Prometheus    has given us this  the ability to light up the world. It has also given us this  the ability to look at the world from the outside. Now we may not all have another biosphere that we can run to  and compare it to this biosphere. But we can look at the world  and try to understand where we are in its context  and how we choose to interact with it. And if you lose where you are in your biosphere  or are perhaps having a difficulty connecting with where you are in the biosphere  I would say to you  take a deep breath. The yogis had it right. Breath does  in fact  connect us all in a very literal way. Take a breath now. And as you breathe  think about what is in your breath. There perhaps is the CO  from the person sitting next door to you. Maybe there is a little bit of oxygen from some algae on the beach not far from here. It also connects us in time. There may be some carbon in your breath from the dinosaurs. There could also be carbon that you are exhaling now that will be in the breath of your great great great grandchildren. Thank you.  Applause  I want to talk about the transformed media landscape  and what it means for anybody who has a message that they want to get out to anywhere in the world. And I want to illustrate that by telling a couple of stories about that transformation. I'll start here. Last November there was a presidential election. You probably read something about it in the papers. And there was some concern that in some parts of the country there might be voter suppression. And so a plan came up to video the vote. And the idea was that individual citizens with phones capable of taking photos or making video would document their polling places  on the lookout for any kind of voter suppression techniques  and would upload this to a central place. And that this would operate as a kind of citizen observation    that citizens would not be there just to cast individual votes  but also to help ensure the sanctity of the vote overall. So this is a pattern that assumes we're all in this together. What matters here isn't technical capital  it's social capital. These tools don't get socially interesting until they get technologically boring. It isn't when the shiny new tools show up that their uses start permeating society. It's when everybody is able to take them for granted. Because now that media is increasingly social  innovation can happen anywhere that people can take for granted the idea that we're all in this together. And so we're starting to see a media landscape in which innovation is happening everywhere  and moving from one spot to another. That is a huge transformation. Not to put too fine a point on it  the moment we're living through    the moment our historical generation is living through    is the largest increase in expressive capability in human history. Now that's a big claim. I'm going to try to back it up. There are only four periods in the last     years where media has changed enough to qualify for the label  revolution.  The first one is the famous one  the printing press  movable type  oil based inks  that whole complex of innovations that made printing possible and turned Europe upside down  starting in the middle of the     s. Then  a couple of hundred years ago  there was innovation in two way communication  conversational media  first the telegraph  then the telephone. Slow  text based conversations  then real time voice based conversations. Then  about     years ago  there was a revolution in recorded media other than print  first photos  then recorded sound  then movies  all encoded onto physical objects. And finally  about     years ago  the harnessing of electromagnetic spectrum to send sound and images through the air    radio and television. This is the media landscape as we knew it in the   th century. This is what those of us of a certain age grew up with  and are used to. But there is a curious asymmetry here. The media that is good at creating conversations is no good at creating groups. And the media that's good at creating groups is no good at creating conversations. If you want to have a conversation in this world  you have it with one other person. If you want to address a group  you get the same message and you give it to everybody in the group  whether you're doing that with a broadcasting tower or a printing press. That was the media landscape as we had it in the twentieth century. And this is what changed. This thing that looks like a peacock hit a windscreen is Bill Cheswick's map of the Internet. He traces the edges of the individual networks and then color codes them. The Internet is the first medium in history that has native support for groups and conversation at the same time. Whereas the phone gave us the one to one pattern  and television  radio  magazines  books  gave us the one to many pattern  the Internet gives us the many to many pattern. For the first time  media is natively good at supporting these kinds of conversations. That's one of the big changes. The second big change is that  as all media gets digitized  the Internet also becomes the mode of carriage for all other media  meaning that phone calls migrate to the Internet  magazines migrate to the Internet  movies migrate to the Internet. And that means that every medium is right next door to every other medium. Put another way  media is increasingly less just a source of information  and it is increasingly more a site of coordination  because groups that see or hear or watch or listen to something can now gather around and talk to each other as well. And the third big change is that members of the former audience  as Dan Gilmore calls them  can now also be producers and not consumers. Every time a new consumer joins this media landscape a new producer joins as well  because the same equipment    phones  computers    let you consume and produce. It's as if  when you bought a book  they threw in the printing press for free  it's like you had a phone that could turn into a radio if you pressed the right buttons. That is a huge change in the media landscape we're used to. And it's not just Internet or no Internet. We've had the Internet in its public form for almost    years now  and it's still changing as the media becomes more social. It's still changing patterns even among groups who know how to deal with the Internet well. Second story. Last May  China in the Sichuan province had a terrible earthquake   .  magnitude  massive destruction in a wide area  as the Richter Scale has it. And the earthquake was reported as it was happening. People were texting from their phones. They were taking photos of buildings. They were taking videos of buildings shaking. They were uploading it to QQ  China's largest Internet service. They were Twittering it. And so as the quake was happening the news was reported. And because of the social connections  Chinese students coming elsewhere  and going to school  or businesses in the rest of the world opening offices in China    there were people listening all over the world  hearing this news. The BBC got their first wind of the Chinese quake from Twitter. Twitter announced the existence of the quake several minutes before the US Geological Survey had anything up online for anybody to read. The last time China had a quake of that magnitude it took them three months to admit that it had happened. Now they might have liked to have done that here  rather than seeing these pictures go up online. But they weren't given that choice  because their own citizens beat them to the punch. Even the government learned of the earthquake from their own citizens  rather than from the Xinhua News Agency. And this stuff rippled like wildfire. For a while there the top    most clicked links on Twitter  the global short messaging service    nine of the top    links were about the quake. People collating information  pointing people to news sources  pointing people to the US geological survey. The   th one was kittens on a treadmill  but that's the Internet for you. But nine of the    in those first hours. And within half a day donation sites were up  and donations were pouring in from all around the world. This was an incredible  coordinated global response. And the Chinese then  in one of their periods of media openness  decided that they were going to let it go  that they were going to let this citizen reporting fly. And then this happened. People began to figure out  in the Sichuan Provence  that the reason so many school buildings had collapsed    because tragically the earthquake happened during a school day    the reason so many school buildings collapsed is that corrupt officials had taken bribes to allow those building to be built to less than code. And so they started  the citizen journalists started reporting that as well. And there was an incredible picture. You may have seen in on the front page of the New York Times. A local official literally prostrated himself in the street  in front of these protesters  in order to get them to go away. Essentially to say   We will do anything to placate you  just please stop protesting in public.  But these are people who have been radicalized  because  thanks to the one child policy  they have lost everyone in their next generation. Someone who has seen the death of a single child now has nothing to lose. And so the protest kept going. And finally the Chinese cracked down. That was enough of citizen media. And so they began to arrest the protesters. They began to shut down the media that the protests were happening on. China is probably the most successful manager of Internet censorship in the world  using something that is widely described as the Great Firewall of China. And the Great Firewall of China is a set of observation points that assume that media is produced by professionals  it mostly comes in from the outside world  it comes in relatively sparse chunks  and it comes in relatively slowly. And because of those four characteristics they are able to filter it as it comes into the country. But like the Maginot Line  the great firewall of China was facing in the wrong direction for this challenge  because not one of those four things was true in this environment. The media was produced locally. It was produced by amateurs. It was produced quickly. And it was produced at such an incredible abundance that there was no way to filter it as it appeared. And so now the Chinese government  who for a dozen years  has quite successfully filtered the web  is now in the position of having to decide whether to allow or shut down entire services  because the transformation to amateur media is so enormous that they can't deal with it any other way. And in fact that is happening this week. On the   th anniversary of Tiananmen they just  two days ago  announced that they were simply shutting down access to Twitter  because there was no way to filter it other than that. They had to turn the spigot entirely off. Now these changes don't just affect people who want to censor messages. They also affect people who want to send messages  because this is really a transformation of the ecosystem as a whole  not just a particular strategy. The classic media problem  from the   th century is  how does an organization have a message that they want to get out to a group of people distributed at the edges of a network. And here is the twentieth century answer. Bundle up the message. Send the same message to everybody. National message. Targeted individuals. Relatively sparse number of producers. Very expensive to do  so there is not a lot of competition. This is how you reach people. All of that is over. We are increasingly in a landscape where media is global  social  ubiquitous and cheap. Now most organizations that are trying to send messages to the outside world  to the distributed collection of the audience  are now used to this change. The audience can talk back. And that's a little freaky. But you can get used to it after a while  as people do. But that's not the really crazy change that we're living in the middle of. The really crazy change is here  it's the fact that they are no longer disconnected from each other  the fact that former consumers are now producers  the fact that the audience can talk directly to one another  because there is a lot more amateurs than professionals  and because the size of the network  the complexity of the network is actually the square of the number of participants  meaning that the network  when it grows large  grows very  very large. As recently at last decade  most of the media that was available for public consumption was produced by professionals. Those days are over  never to return. It is the green lines now  that are the source of the free content  which brings me to my last story. We saw some of the most imaginative use of social media during the Obama campaign. And I don't mean most imaginative use in politics    I mean most imaginative use ever. And one of the things Obama did  was they famously  the Obama campaign did  was they famously put up MyBarackObama.com  myBO.com And millions of citizens rushed in to participate  and to try and figure out how to help. An incredible conversation sprung up there. And then  this time last year  Obama announced that he was going to change his vote on FISA  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. He had said  in January  that he would not sign a bill that granted telecom immunity for possibly warrantless spying on American persons. By the summer  in the middle of the general campaign  He said   I've thought about the issue more. I've changed my mind. I'm going to vote for this bill.  And many of his own supporters on his own site went very publicly berserk. It was Senator Obama when they created it. They changed the name later.  Please get FISA right.  Within days of this group being created it was the fastest growing group on myBO.com  within weeks of its being created it was the largest group. Obama had to issue a press release. He had to issue a reply. And he said essentially   I have considered the issue. I understand where you are coming from. But having considered it all  I'm still going to vote the way I'm going to vote. But I wanted to reach out to you and say  I understand that you disagree with me  and I'm going to take my lumps on this one.  This didn't please anybody. But then a funny thing happened in the conversation. People in that group realized that Obama had never shut them down. Nobody in the Obama campaign had ever tried to hide the group or make it harder to join  to deny its existence  to delete it  to take to off the site. They had understood that their role with myBO.com was to convene their supporters but not to control their supporters. And that is the kind of discipline that it takes to make really mature use of this media. Media  the media landscape that we knew  as familiar as it was  as easy conceptually as it was to deal with the idea that professionals broadcast messages to amateurs  is increasingly slipping away. In a world where media is global  social  ubiquitous and cheap  in a world of media where the former audience are now increasingly full participants  in that world  media is less and less often about crafting a single message to be consumed by individuals. It is more and more often a way of creating an environment for convening and supporting groups. And the choice we face  I mean anybody who has a message they want to have heard anywhere in the world  isn't whether or not that is the media environment we want to operate in. That's the media environment we've got. The question we all face now is   How can we make best use of this media  Even though it means changing the way we've always done it.  Thank you very much. My journey to coming here today started in     . That's me with the funny gloves. I was    and going on a peace walk. What I didn't know though  was most of those people  standing there with me  were Moonies. And within a week I had come to believe that the second coming of Christ had occurred  that it was Sun Myung Moon  and that I had been specially chosen and prepared by God to be his disciple. Now as cool as that sounds  my family was not that thrilled with this. And they tried everything they could to get me out of there. There was an underground railroad of sorts that was going on during those years. Maybe some of you remember it. They were called deprogrammers. And after about five long years my family had me deprogrammed. And I then became a deprogrammer. I started going out on cases. And after about five years of doing this  I was arrested for kidnapping. Most of the cases I went out on were called involuntary. What happened was that the family had to get their loved ones some safe place somehow. And so they took them to some safe place. And we would come in and talk to them  usually for about a week. And so after this happened  I decided it was a good time to turn my back on this work. And about    years went by. There was a burning question though that would not leave me. And that was   How did this happen to me   And in fact  what did happen to my brain  Because something did. And so I decided to write a book  a memoir  about this decade of my life. And toward the end of writing that book there was a documentary that came out. It was on Jonestown. And it had a chilling effect on me. These are the dead in Jonestown. About     people died that day  most of them taking their own lives. Women gave poison to their babies  and watched foam come from their mouths as they died. The top picture is a group of Moonies that have been blessed by their messiah. Their mates were chosen for them. The bottom picture is Hitler youth. This is the leg of a suicide bomber. The thing I had to admit to myself  with great repulsion  was that I get it. I understand how this could happen. I understand how someone's brain  how someone's mind can come to the place where it makes sense    in fact it would be wrong  when your brain is working like that    not to try to save the world through genocide. And so what is this  How does this work  And how I've come to view what happened to me is a viral  memetic infection. For those of you who aren't familiar with memetics  a meme has been defined as an idea that replicates in the human brain and moves from brain to brain like a virus  much like a virus. The way a virus works is    it can infect and do the most damage to someone who has a compromised immune system. In       I was young  I was naive  and I was pretty lost in my world. I was really idealistic. These easy ideas to complex questions are very appealing when you are emotionally vulnerable. What happens is that circular logic takes over.  Moon is one with God. God is going to fix all the problems in the world. All I have to do is humbly follow. Because God is going to stop war and hunger    all these things I wanted to do    all I have to do is humbly follow. Because after all  God is  working through  the messiah. He's going to fix all this.  It becomes impenetrable. And the most dangerous part of this is that is creates  us  and  them    right  and  wrong    good  and  evil.  And it makes anything possible  makes anything rationalizable. And the thing is  though  if you looked at my brain during those years in the Moonies    neuroscience is expanding exponentially  as Ray Kurzweil said yesterday. Science is expanding. We're beginning to look inside the brain. And so if you looked at my brain  or any brain that's infected with a viral memetic infection like this  and compared it to anyone in this room  or anyone who uses critical thinking on a regular basis  I am convinced it would look very  very different. And that  strange as it may sound  gives me hope. And the reason that gives me hope is that the first thing is to admit that we have a problem. But it's a human problem. It's a scientific problem  if you will. It happens in the human brain. There is no evil force out there to get us. And so this is something that  through research and education  I believe that we can solve. And so the first step is to realize that we can do this together  and that there is no  us  and  them.  Thank you very much.  Applause  A talk about surgical robots is also a talk about surgery. And while I've tried to make my images not too graphic  keep in mind that surgeons have a different relationship with blood than normal people do  because  after all  what a surgeon does to a patient  if it were done without consent  would be a felony. Surgeons are the tailors  the plumbers  the carpenters    some would say the butchers    of the medical world  cutting  reshaping  reforming  bypassing  fixing. But you need to talk about surgical instruments and the evolution of surgical technology together. So in order to give you some kind of a perspective of where we are right now with surgical robots  and where we're going to be going in the future  I want to give you a little bit of perspective of how we got to this point  how we even came to believe that surgery was OK  that this was something that was possible to do  that this kind of cutting and reforming was OK. So  a little bit of perspective    about        years of perspective. This is a trephinated skull. And trephination is simply just cutting a hole in the skull. And many  many hundreds of skulls like this have been found in archaeological sites all over the world  dating back five to    thousand years. Five to    thousand years  Now imagine this. You are a healer in a Stone Age village. And you have some guy that you're not quite sure what's wrong with him    Oliver Sacks is going to be born way in the future. He's got some seizure disorder. And you don't understand this. But you think to yourself   I'm not quite sure what's wrong with this guy. But maybe if I cut a hole in his head I can fix it.  Now that is surgical thinking. Now we've got the dawn of interventional surgery here. What is astonishing about this is  even though we don't know really how much of this was intended to be religious  or how much of it was intended to be therapeutic  what we can tell is that these patients lived  Judging by the healing on the borders of these holes  they lived days  months  years following trephination. And so what we are seeing is evidence of a refined technique that was being handed down over thousands and thousands of years  all over the world. This arose independently at sites everywhere that had no communication to one another. We really are seeing the dawn of interventional surgery. Now we can fast forward many thousands of years into the Bronze Age and beyond. And we see new refined tools coming out. But surgeons in these eras are a little bit more conservative than their bold  trephinating ancestors. These guys confined their surgery to fairly superficial injuries. And surgeons were tradesmen  rather than physicians. This persisted all the way into and through the Renaissance. That may have saved the writers  but it didn't really save the surgeons terribly much. They were still a mistrusted lot. Surgeons still had a bit of a PR problem  because the landscape was dominated by the itinerant barber surgeon. These were folks that traveled from village to village  town to town  doing surgery sort of as a form of performance art. Because we were in the age before anesthesia  the agony of the patient is really as much of the public spectacle as the surgery itself. One of the most famous of these guys  Frere Jacques  shown here doing a lithotomy    which is the removal of the bladder stone  one of the most invasive surgeries they did at the time    had to take less than two minutes. You had to have quite a flair for the dramatic  and be really  really quick. And so here you see him doing a lithotomy. And he is credited with doing over       of these public surgeries  wandering around in Europe  which is an astonishing number  when you think that surgery must have been a last resort. I mean who would put themselves through that  Until anesthesia  the absence of sensation. With the demonstration of the Morton Ether Inhaler at the Mass. General in       a whole new era of surgery was ushered in. Anesthesia gave surgeons the freedom to operate. Anesthesia gave them the freedom to experiment  to start to delve deeper into the body. This was truly a revolution in surgery. But there was a pretty big problem with this. After these very long  painstaking operations  attempting to cure things they'd never been able to touch before  the patients died. They died of massive infection. Surgery didn't hurt anymore  but it killed you pretty quickly. And infection would continue to claim a majority of surgical patients until the next big revolution in surgery  which was aseptic technique. Joseph Lister was aepsis's  or sterility's  biggest advocate  to a very very skeptical bunch of surgeons. But eventually they did come around. The Mayo brothers came out to visit Lister in Europe. And they came back to their American clinic and they said they had learned it was as important to wash your hands before doing surgery as it was to wash up afterwards.  Laughter  Something so simple. And yet  operative mortality dropped profoundly. These surgeries were actually now being effective. With the patient insensitive to pain  and a sterile operating field all bets were off  the sky was the limit. You could now start doing surgery everywhere  on the gut  on the liver  on the heart  on the brain. Transplantation  you could take an organ out of one person  you could put it in another person  and it would work. Surgeons didn't have a problem with respectability anymore  they had become gods. The era of the  big surgeon  big incision  had arrived  but at quite a cost  because they are saving lives  but not necessarily quality of life  because healthy people don't usually need surgery  and unhealthy people have a very hard time recovering from a cut like that. The question had to be asked   Well  can we do these same surgeries but through little incisions   Laparoscopy is doing this kind of surgery  surgery with long instruments through small incisions. And it really changed the landscape of surgery. Some of the tools for this had been around for a hundred years  but it had only been used as a diagnostic technique until the     s  when there was changes in camera technologies and things like that  that allowed this to be done for real operations. So what you see    this is now the first surgical image    as we're coming down the tube  this is a new entry into the body. It looks very different from what you're expecting surgery to look like. We bring instruments in  from two separate cuts in the side  and then you can start manipulating tissue. Within    years of the first gallbladder surgeries being done laparoscopically  a majority of gallbladder surgeries were being done laparoscopically    truly a pretty big revolution. But there were casualties of this revolution. These techniques were a lot harder to learn than people had anticipated. The learning curve was very long. And during that learning curve the complications went quite a bit higher. Surgeons had to give up their  D vision. They had to give up their wrists. They had to give up intuitive motion in the instruments. This surgeon has over       hours of laparoscopic experience. Now this is a particularly frustrating placement of the needle. But this is hard. And one of the reasons why it is so hard is because the external ergonomics are terrible. You've got these long instruments  and you're working off your centerline. And the instruments are essentially working backwards. So what you need to do  to take the capability of your hand  and put it on the other side of that small incision  is you need to put a wrist on that instrument. And so    I get to talk about robots    the da Vinci robot put just that wrist on the other side of that incision. And so here you're seeing the operation of this wrist. And now  in contrast to the laparoscopy  you can precisely place the needle in your instruments  and you can pass it all the way through and follow it in a trajectory. And the reason why this becomes so much easier is    you can see on the bottom    the hands are making the motions  and the instruments are following those motions exactly. Now  what you put between those instruments and those hands  is a large  fairly complicated robot. The surgeon is sitting at a console  and controlling the robot with these controllers. And the robot is moving these instruments around  and powering them  down inside the body. You have a  D camera  so you get a  D view. And since this was introduced in       a lot of these robots have been out and being used for surgical procedures like a prostatectomy  which is a prostate deep in the pelvis  and it requires fine dissection and delicate manipulation to be able to get a good surgical outcome. You can also sew bypass vessels directly onto a beating heart without cracking the chest. This is all done in between the ribs. And you can go inside the heart itself and repair the valves from the inside. You've got these technologies    thank you    And so you might say   Wow this is really cool  So  smartypants  why isn't all surgery being done this way   And there are some reasons  some good reasons. And cost is one of them. I talked about the large  complicated robot. With all its bells and whistles  one of those robots will cost you about as much as a solid gold surgeon. More useful than a solid gold surgeon  but  still  it's a fairly big capital investment. But once you've got it  your procedure costs do come down. But there are other barriers. So something like a prostatectomy    the prostate is small  and it's in one spot  and you can set your robot up very precisely to work in that one spot. And so it's perfect for something like that. And in fact if you  or anyone you know  had their prostate taken out in the last couple of years  chances are it was done with one of these systems. But if you need to reach more places than just one  you need to move the robot. And you need to put some new incisions in there. And you need to re set it up. And then you need to add some more ports  and more. And the problem is it gets time consuming  and cumbersome. And for that reason there are many surgeries that just aren't being done with the da Vinci. So we had to ask the question   Well how do we fix that   What if we could change it so that we didn't have to re set up each time we wanted to move somewhere different  What if we could bring all the instruments in together in one place  How would that change the capabilities of the surgeon  And how would that change the experience for the patient  Now  to do that  we need to be able to bring a camera and instruments in together through one small tube  like that tube you saw in the laparoscopy video. Or  not so coincidentally  like a tube like this. So what's going to come out of that tube is the debut of this new technology  this new robot that is going to be able to reach anywhere. Ready  So here it comes. This is the camera  and three instruments. And as you see it come out  in order to actually be able to do anything useful  it can't all stay clustered up like this. It has to be able to come off of the centerline and then be able to work back toward that centerline. He's a cheeky little devil. But what this lets you do is gives you that all important traction  and counter traction  so that you can dissect  so that you can sew  so that you can do all the things that you need to do  all the surgical tasks. But it's all coming in through one incision. It's not so simple. But it's worth it for the freedom that this gives us as we're going around. For the patient  however  it's transparent. This is all they're going to see. It's very exciting to think where we get to go with this. We get to write the script of the next revolution in surgery. As we take these capabilities  and we get to go to the next places  we get to decide what our new surgeries are going to be. And I think to really get the rest of the way in that revolution  we need to not just take our hands in in new ways  we also need to take our eyes in in new ways. We need to see beyond the surface. We need to be able to guide what we're cutting in a much better way. This is a cancer surgery. One of the problems with this  even for surgeons who've been looking at this a lot  is you can't see the cancer  especially when it's hidden below the surface. And so what we're starting to do is we're starting to inject specially designed markers into the bloodstream that will target the cancer. It will go  bind to the cancer. And we can make those markers glow. And we can take special cameras  and we can look at it. Now we know where we need to cut  even when it's below the surface. We can take these markers and we can inject them in a tumor site. And we can follow where they flow out from that tumor site  so we can see the first places where that cancer might travel. We can inject these dyes into the bloodstream  so that when we do a new vessel and we bypass a blockage on the heart  we can see if we actually made the connection  before we close that patient back up again    something that we haven't been able to do without radiation before. We can light up tumors like this kidney tumor  so that you can exactly see where the boundary is between the kidney tumor and the kidney you want to leave behind  or the liver tumor and the liver you want to leave behind. And we don't even need to confine ourselves to this macro vision. We have flexible microscopic probes that we can bring down into the body. And we can look at cells directly. I'm looking at nerves here. So these are nerves you see  down on the bottom  and the microscope probe that's being held by the robotic hand  up at the top. So this is all very prototypey at this point. But you care about nerves  if you are a surgical patient. Because they let you keep continence  bladder control  and sexual function after surgery  all of which is generally fairly important to the patient. So  with the combination of these technologies we can reach it all  and we can see it all. We can heal the disease. And we can leave the patient whole and intact and functional afterwards. Now  I've talked about the patient as if the patient is  somehow  someone abstract outside this room. And that is not the case. Many of you  all of you maybe  will at some point  or have already  faced a diagnosis of cancer  or heart disease  or some organ dysfunction that's going to buy you a date with a surgeon. And when you get to that point    I mean  these maladies don't care how many books you've written  how many companies you've started  that Nobel Prize you have yet to win  how much time you planned to spend with your children. These maladies come for us all. And the prospect I'm offering you  of an easier surgery ... is that going to make that diagnosis any less terrifying  I'm not sure I really even want it to. Because facing your own mortality causes a re evaluation of priorities  and a realignment of what your goals are in life  unlike anything else. And I would never want to deprive you of that epiphany. What I want instead  is for you to be whole  intact  and functional enough to go out and save the world  after you've decided you need to do it. And that is my vision for your future. Thank you. I want to share with you some ideas about the secret power of time  in a very short time. Video  All right  start the clock please.    seconds studio. Keep it quiet please. Settle down. It's about time. End sequence. Take one.    seconds studio.     nine  eight  seven  six  five  four  three  two ... Philip Zimbardo  Let's tune into the conversation of the principals in Adam's temptation.  Come on Adam  don't be so wishy washy. Take a bite.   I did.   One bite  Adam. Don't abandon Eve.   I don't know  guys. I don't want to get in trouble.   Okay. One bite. What the hell   Life is temptation. It's all about yielding  resisting  yes  no  now  later  impulsive  reflective  present focus and future focus. Promised virtues fall prey to the passions of the moment. Of teenage girls who pledged sexual abstinence and virginity until marriage    thank you George Bush    the majority     percent  yielded to sexual temptations within one year. And most of them did so without using birth control. So much for promises. Now lets tempt four year olds  giving them a treat. They can have one marshmallow now. But if they wait until the experimenter comes back  they can have two. Of course it pays  if you like marshmallows  to wait. What happens is two thirds of the kids give in to temptation. They cannot wait. The others  of course  wait. They resist the temptation. They delay the now for later. Walter Mischel  my colleague at Stanford  went back    years later  to try to discover what was different about those kids. There were enormous differences between kids who resisted and kids who yielded  in many ways. The kids who resisted scored     points higher on the SAT. That's enormous. That's like a whole set of different IQ points. They didn't get in as much trouble. They were better students. They were self confident and determined. And the key for me today  the key for you  is  they were future focused rather than present focused. So what is time perspective  That's what I'm going to talk about today. Time perspective is the study of how individuals  all of us  divide the flow of your human experience into time zones or time categories. And you do it automatically and non consciously. They vary between cultures  between nations  between individuals  between social classes  between education levels. And the problem is that they can become biased  because you learn to over use some of them and under use the others. What determines any decision you make  You make a decision on which you're going to base an action. For some people it's only about what is in the immediate situation  what other people are doing and what you're feeling. And those people  when they make their decisions in that format    we're going to call them  present oriented   because their focus is what is now. For others  the present is irrelevant. It's always about  What is this situation like that I've experienced in the past   So that their decisions are based on past memories. And we're going to call those people  past oriented   because they focus on what was. For others it's not the past  it's not the present  it's only about the future. Their focus is always about anticipated consequences. Cost benefit analysis. We're going to call them  future oriented.  Their focus is on what will be. So  time paradox  I want to argue  the paradox of time perspective  is something that influences every decision you make  you're totally unaware of. Namely  the extent to which you have one of these biased time perspectives. Well there is actually six of them. There are two ways to be present oriented. There is two ways to be past oriented  two ways to be future. You can focus on past positive  or past negative. You can be present hedonistic  namely you focus on the joys of life  or present fatalist    it doesn't matter  your life is controlled. You can be future oriented  setting goals. Or you can be transcendental future  namely  life begins after death. Developing the mental flexibility to shift time perspectives fluidly depending on the demands of the situation  that's what you've got to learn to do. So  very quickly  what is the optimal time profile  High on past positive. Moderately high on future. And moderate on present hedonism. And always low on past negative and present fatalism. So the optimal temporal mix is what you get from the past    past positive gives you roots. You connect your family  identity and your self. What you get from the future is wings to soar to new destinations  new challenges. What you get from the present hedonism is the energy  the energy to explore yourself  places  people  sensuality. Any time perspective in excess has more negatives than positives. What do futures sacrifice for success  They sacrifice family time. They sacrifice friend time. They sacrifice fun time. They sacrifice personal indulgence. They sacrifice hobbies. And they sacrifice sleep. So it affects their health. And they live for work  achievement and control. I'm sure that resonates with some of the TEDsters. And it resonated for me. I grew up as a poor kid in the South Bronx ghetto  a Sicilian family    everyone lived in the past and present. I'm here as a future oriented person who went over the top  who did all these sacrifices because teachers intervened  and made me future oriented. Told me don't eat that marshmallow  because if you wait you're going to get two of them  until I learned to balance out. I've added present hedonism  I've added a focus on the past positive  so  at    years old  I am more energetic than ever  more productive  and I'm happier than I have ever been. I just want to say that we are applying this to many world problems  changing the drop out rates of school kids  combating addictions  enhancing teen health  curing vets' PTSD with time metaphors    getting miracle cures    promoting sustainability and conservation  reducing physical rehabilitation where there is a    percent drop out rate  altering appeals to suicidal terrorists  and modifying family conflicts as time zone clashes. So I want to end by saying  many of life's puzzles can be solved by understanding your time perspective and that of others. And the idea is so simple  so obvious  but I think the consequences are really profound. Thank you so much. I'm going to talk about post conflict recovery and how we might do post conflict recovery better. The record on post conflict recovery is not very impressive.    percent of all post conflict situations  historically  have reverted back to conflict within a decade. In fact  they've accounted for half of all civil wars. Why has the record been so poor  Well  the conventional approach to post conflict situations has rested on  on kind of  three principles. The first principle is  it's the politics that matters. So  the first thing that is prioritized is politics. Try and build a political settlement first. And then the second step is to say   The situation is admittedly dangerous  but only for a short time.  So get peacekeepers there  but get them home as soon as possible. So  short term peacekeepers. And thirdly  what is the exit strategy for the peacekeepers  It's an election. That will produce a legitimate and accountable government. So that's the conventional approach. I think that approach denies reality. We see that there is no quick fix. There's certainly no quick security fix. I've tried to look at the risks of reversion to conflict  during our post conflict decade. And the risks stay high throughout the decade. And they stay high regardless of the political innovations. Does an election produce an accountable and legitimate government  What an election produces is a winner and a loser. And the loser is unreconciled. The reality is that we need to reverse the sequence. It's not the politics first  it's actually the politics last. The politics become easier as the decade progresses if you're building on a foundation of security and economic development    the rebuilding of prosperity. Why does the politics get easier  And why is it so difficult initially  Because after years of stagnation and decline  the mentality of politics is that it's a zero sum game. If the reality is stagnation  I can only go up if you go down. And that doesn't produce a productive politics. And so the mentality has to shift from zero sum to positive sum before you can get a productive politics. You can only get positive  that mental shift  if the reality is that prosperity is being built. And in order to build prosperity  we need security in place. So that is what you get when you face reality. But the objective of facing reality is to change reality. And so now let me suggest two complimentary approaches to changing the reality of the situations. The first is to recognize the interdependence of three key actors  who are different actors  and at the moment are uncoordinated. The first actor is the Security Council. The Security Council typically has the responsibility for providing the peacekeepers who build the security. And that needs to be recognized  first of all  that peacekeeping works. It is a cost effective approach. It does increase security. But it needs to be done long term. It needs to be a decade long approach  rather than just a couple of years. That's one actor  the Security Council. The second actor  different cast of guys  is the donors. The donors provide post conflict aid. Typically in the past  the donors have been interested in the first couple of years  and then they got bored. They moved on to some other situation. Post conflict economic recovery is a slow process. There are no quick processes in economics except decline. You can do that quite fast. So the donors have to stick with this situation for at least a decade. And then the third key actor is the post conflict government. And there are two key things it's got to do. One is it's got to do economic reform  not fuss about the political constitution. It's got to reform economic policy. Why  Because during conflict economic policy typically deteriorates. Governments snatch short term opportunities and  by the end of the conflict  the chickens have come home to roost. So this legacy of conflict is really bad economic policy. So there is a reform agenda  and there is an inclusion agenda. The inclusion agenda doesn't come from elections. Elections produce a loser  who is then excluded. So the inclusion agenda means genuinely bringing people inside the tent. So those three actors. And they are interdependent over a long term. If the Security Council doesn't commit to security over the course of a decade  you don't get the reassurance which produces private investment. If you don't get the policy reform and the aid  you don't get the economic recovery  which is the true exit strategy for the peacekeepers. So we should recognize that interdependence  by formal  mutual commitments. The United Nations actually has a language for these mutual commitments  the recognition of mutual commitments  it's called the language of compact. And so we need a post conflict compact. The United Nations even has an agency which could broker these compacts  it's called the Peace Building Commission. It would be ideal to have a standard set of norms where  when we got to a post conflict situation  there was an expectation of these mutual commitments from the three parties. So that's idea one  recognize interdependence. And now let me turn to the second approach  which is complimentary. And that is to focus on a few critical objectives. Typical post conflict situation is a zoo of different actors with different priorities. And indeed  unfortunately  if you navigate by needs you get a very unfocused agenda  because in these situations  needs are everywhere  but the capacity to implement change is very limited. So we have to be disciplined and focus on things that are critical. And I want to suggest that in the typical post conflict situation three things are critical. One is jobs. One is improvements in basic services    especially health  which is a disaster during conflict. So jobs  health  and clean government. Those are the three critical priorities. So I'm going to talk a little about each of them. Jobs. What is a distinctive approach to generating jobs in post conflict situations  And why are jobs so important  Jobs for whom  Especially jobs for young men. In post conflict situations  the reason that they so often revert to conflict  is not because elderly women get upset. It's because young men get upset. And why are they upset  Because they have nothing to do. And so we need a process of generating jobs  for ordinary young men  fast. Now  that is difficult. Governments in post conflict situation often respond by puffing up the civil service. That is not a good idea. It's not sustainable. In fact  you're building a long term liability by inflating civil service. But getting the private sector to expand is also difficult  because any activity which is open to international trade is basically going to be uncompetitive in a post conflict situation. These are not environments where you can build export manufacturing. There's one sector which isn't exposed to international trade  and which can generate a lot of jobs  and which is  in any case  a sensible sector to expand  post conflict  and that is the construction sector. The construction sector has a vital role  obviously  in reconstruction. But typically that sector has withered away during conflict. During conflict people are doing destruction. There isn't any construction going on. And so the sector shrivels away. And then when you try and expand it  because it's shriveled away  you encounter a lot of bottlenecks. Basically  prices soar and crooked politicians then milk the rents from the sector  but it doesn't generate any jobs. And so the policy priority is to break the bottlenecks in expanding the construction sector. What might the bottlenecks be  Just think what you have to do successfully to build a structure  using a lot of labor. First you need access to land. Often the legal system is broken down so you can't even get access to land. Secondly you need skills  the mundane skills of the construction sector. In post conflict situations we don't just need Doctors Without Borders  we need Bricklayers Without Borders  to rebuild the skill set. We need firms. The firms have gone away. So we need to encourage the growth of local firms. If we do that  we not only get the jobs  we get the improvements in public infrastructure  the restoration of public infrastructure. Let me turn from jobs to the second objective  which is improving basic social services. And to date  there has been a sort of a schizophrenia in the donor community  as to how to build basic services in post conflict sectors. On the one hand it pays lip service to the idea of rebuild an effective state in the image of Scandinavia in the     s. Lets develop line ministries of this  that  and the other  that deliver these services. And it's schizophrenic because in their hearts donors know that's not a realistic agenda  and so what they also do is the total bypass  just fund NGOs. Neither of those approaches is sensible. And so what I'd suggest is what I call Independent Service Authorities. It's to split the functions of a monopoly line ministry up into three. The planning function and policy function stays with the ministry  the delivery of services on the ground  you should use whatever works    churches  NGOs  local communities  whatever works. And in between  there should be a public agency  the Independent Service Authority  which channels public money  and especially donor money  to the retail providers. So the NGOs become part of a public government system  rather than independent of it. One advantage of that is that you can allocate money coherently. Another is  you can make NGOs accountable. You can use yardstick competition  so they have to compete against each other for the resources. The good NGOs  like Oxfam  are very keen on this idea. They want to have the discipline and accountability. So that's a way to get basic services scaled up. And because the government would be funding it  it would be co branding these services. So they wouldn't be provided thanks to the United States government and some NGO. They would be co branded as being done by the post conflict government  in the country. So  jobs  basic services  finally  clean government. Clean means follow their money. The typical post conflict government is so short of money that it needs our money just to be on a life support system. You can't get the basic functions of the state done unless we put money into the core budget of these countries. But  if we put money into the core budget  we know that there aren't the budget systems with integrity that mean that money will be well spent. And if all we do is put money in and close our eyes it's not just that the money is wasted    that's the least of the problems    it's that the money is captured. It's captured by the crooks who are at the heart of the political problem. And so inadvertently we empower the people who are the problem. So building clean government means  yes  provide money to the budget  but also provide a lot of scrutiny  which means a lot of technical assistance that follows the money. Paddy Ashdown  who was the grand high nabob of Bosnia to the United Nations  in his book about his experience  he said   I realize what I needed was accountants without borders  to follow that money.  So that's the    let me wrap up  this is the package. What's the goal  If we follow this  what would we hope to achieve  That after    years  the focus on the construction sector would have produced both jobs and  hence  security    because young people would have jobs    and it would have reconstructed the infrastructure. So that's the focus on the construction sector. The focus on the basic service delivery through these independent service authorities would have rescued basic services from their catastrophic levels  and it would have given ordinary people the sense that the government was doing something useful. The emphasis on clean government would have gradually squeezed out the political crooks  because there wouldn't be any money in taking part in the politics. And so gradually the selection  the composition of politicians  would shift from the crooked to the honest. Where would that leave us  Gradually it would shift from a politics of plunder to a politics of hope. Thank you. I want to help you re perceive what philanthropy is  what it could be  and what your relationship to it is. And in doing that  I want to offer you a vision  an imagined future  if you will  of how  as the poet Seamus Heaney has put it   Once in a lifetime the longed for tidal wave of justice can rise up  and hope and history rhyme.  I want to start with these word pairs here. We all know which side of these we'd like to be on. When philanthropy was reinvented a century ago  when the foundation form was actually invented  they didn't think of themselves on the wrong side of these either. In fact they would never have thought of themselves as closed and set in their ways  as slow to respond to new challenges  as small and risk averse. And in fact they weren't. They were reinventing charity in those times  what Rockefeller called  the business of benevolence.  But by the end of the   th century  a new generation of critics and reformers had come to see philanthropy just this way. The thing to watch for as a global philanthropy industry comes about    and that's exactly what is happening    is how the aspiration is to flip these old assumptions  for philanthropy to become open and big and fast and connected  in service of the long term. This entrepreneurial energy is emerging from many quarters. And it's driven and propelled forward by new leaders  like many of the people here  by new tools  like the ones we've seen here  and by new pressures. I've been following this change for quite a while now  and participating in it. This report is our main public report. What it tells is the story of how today actually could be as historic as     years ago. What I want to do is share some of the coolest things that are going on with you. And as I do that  I'm not going to dwell much on the very large philanthropy that everybody already knows about    the Gates or the Soros or the Google. Instead  what I want to do is talk about the philanthropy of all of us  the democratization of philanthropy. This is a moment in history when the average person has more power than at any time. What I'm going to do is look at five categories of experiments  each of which challenges an old assumption of philanthropy. The first is mass collaboration  represented here by Wikipedia. Now  this may surprise you. But remember  philanthropy is about giving of time and talent  not just money. Clay Shirky  that great chronicler of everything networked  has captured the assumption that this challenges in such a beautiful way. He said   We have lived in this world where little things are done for love and big things for money. Now we have Wikipedia. Suddenly big things can be done for love.  Watch  this spring  for Paul Hawken's new book    Author and entrepreneur many of you may know about. The book is called  Blessed Unrest.  And when it comes out  a series of wiki sites under the label WISER  are going to launch at the same time. WISER stands for World Index for Social and Environmental Responsibility. WISER sets out to document  link and empower what Paul calls the largest movement  and fastest growing movement in human history  humanity's collective immune response to today's threats. Now  all of these big things for love    experiments    aren't going to take off. But the ones that do are going to be the biggest  the most open  the fastest  the most connected form of philanthropy in human history. Second category is online philanthropy marketplaces. This is  of course  to philanthropy what eBay and Amazon are to commerce. Think of it as peer to peer philanthropy. And this challenges yet another assumption  which is that organized philanthropy is only for the very wealthy. Take a look  if you haven't  at DonorsChoose. Omidyar Network has made a big investment in DonorsChoose. It's one of the best known of these new marketplaces where a donor can go straight into a classroom and connect with what a teacher says they need. Take a look at Changing the Present  started by a TEDster  next time you need a wedding present or a holiday present. GiveIndia is for a whole country. And it goes on and on. The third category is represented by Warren Buffet  which I call aggregated giving. It's not just that Warren Buffet was so amazingly generous in that historic act last summer. It's that he challenged another assumption  that every giver should have his or her own fund or foundation. There are now  today  so many new funds that are aggregating giving and investing  bringing together people around a common goal  to think bigger. One of the best known is Acumen Fund  led by Jacqueline Novogratz  a TEDster who got a big boost here at TED. But there are many others  New Profit in Cambridge  New School's Venture Fund in Silicon Valley  Venture Philanthropy Partners in Washington  Global Fund for Women in San Francisco. Take a look at these. These funds are to philanthropy what venture capital  private equity  and eventually mutual funds are to investing  but with a twist    because often a community forms around these funds  as it has at Acumen and other places. Now  imagine for a second these first three types of experiments  mass collaboration  online marketplaces  aggregated giving. And understand how they help us re perceive what organized philanthropy is. It's not about foundations necessarily  it's about the rest of us. And imagine the mash up  if you will  of these things  in the future  when these things come together in the experiments of the future    imagine that somebody puts up  say      million dollars for an inspiring goal    there were    gifts of     million dollars or more in the US last year  not out of the question    but only puts it up if it's matched by millions of small gifts from around the globe  thereby engaging lots of people  and building visibility and engaging people in the goal that's stated. I'm going to look quickly at the fourth and fifth categories  which are innovation  competitions and social investing. They're betting a visible competition  a prize  can attract talent and money to some of the most difficult issues  and thereby speed the solution. This tackles yet another assumption  that the giver and the organization is at the center  as opposed to putting the problem at the center. You can look to these innovators to help us especially with things that require technological or scientific solution. That leaves the final category  social investing  which is really  anyway  the biggest of them all  represented here by Xigi.net. And this  of course  tackles the biggest assumption of all  that business is business  and philanthropy is the vehicle of people who want to create change in the world. Xigi is a new community site that's built by the community  linking and mapping this new social capital market. It lists already       entities that are offering debt and equity for social enterprise. So we can look to these innovators to help us remember that if we can leverage even a small amount of the capital that seeks a return  the good that can be driven could be astonishing. Now  what's really interesting here is that we're not thinking our way into a new way of acting  we're acting our way into a new way of thinking. Philanthropy is reorganizing itself before our very eyes. And even though all of the experiments and all of the big givers don't yet fulfill this aspiration  I think this is the new zeitgeist  open  big  fast  connected  and  let us also hope  long. We have got to realize that it is going to take a long time to do these things. If we don't develop the stamina to stick with things    whatever it is you pick  stick with it    all of this stuff is just going to be  you know  a fad. But I'm really hopeful. And I'm hopeful because it's not only philanthropy that's reorganizing itself  it's also whole other portions of the social sector  and of business  that are busy challenging  business as usual.  And everywhere I go  including here at TED  I feel that there is a new moral hunger that is growing. What we're seeing is people really wrestling to describe what is this new thing that's happening. Words like  philanthrocapitalism   and  natural capitalism   and  philanthroentrepreneur   and  venture philanthropy.  We don't have a language for it yet. Whatever we call it  it's new  it's beginning  and I think it's gong to quite significant. And that's where my imagined future comes in  which I am going to call the social singularity. Many of you will realize that I'm ripping a bit off of the science fiction writer Vernor Vinge's notion of a technological singularity  where a number of trends accelerate and converge and come together to create  really  a shockingly new reality. It may be that the social singularity ahead is the one that we fear the most  a convergence of catastrophes  of environmental degradation  of weapons of mass destruction  of pandemics  of poverty. That's because our ability to confront the problems that we face has not kept pace with our ability to create them. And as we've heard here  it is no exaggeration to say that we hold the future of our civilization in our hands as never before. The question is  is there a positive social singularity  Is there a frontier for us of how we live together  Our future doesn't have to be imagined. We can create a future where hope and history rhyme. But we have a problem. Our experience to date  both individually and collectively  hasn't prepared us for what we're going to need to do  or who we're going to need to be. We are going to need a new generation of citizen leaders willing to commit ourselves to growing and changing and learning as rapidly as possible. That's why I have one last thing I want to show you. This is a photograph taken about     years ago of my grandfather and great grandfather. This is a newspaper publisher and a banker. And they were great community leaders. And  yes  they were great philanthropists. I keep this photograph close by to me    it's in my office    because I've always felt a mystical connection to these two men  both of whom I never knew. And so  in their honor  I want to offer you this blank slide. And I want you to imagine that this a photograph of you. And I want you to think about the community that you want to be part of creating. Whatever that means to you. And I want you to imagine that it's     years from now  and your grandchild  or great grandchild  or niece or nephew or god child  is looking at this photograph of you. What is the story you most want for them to tell  Thank you very much. A month ago today I stood there     degrees south  the top of the bottom of the world  the Geographic South Pole. And I stood there beside two very good friends of mine  Richard Weber and Kevin Vallely. Together we had just broken the world speed record for a trek to the South Pole. It took us    days     hours and    minutes to get there. We shaved five days off the previous best time. And in the process  I became the first person in history to make the entire     mile journey  from Hercules Inlet to South Pole  solely on feet  without skis. Now  many of you are probably saying   Wait a sec  is this tough to do   Imagine  if you will  dragging a sled  as you just saw in that video clip  with     pounds of gear  in it everything you need to survive on your Antarctic trek. It's going to be    below  every single day. You'll be in a massive headwind. And at some point you're going to have to cross these cracks in the ice  these crevasses. Some of them have a very precarious thin footbridge underneath them that could give way at a moment's notice  taking your sled  you  into the abyss  never to be seen again. The punchline to your journey  Look at the horizon. Yes  it's uphill the entire way  because the South Pole is at        feet  and you're starting at sea level. Our journey did not  in fact  begin at Hercules Inlet  where frozen ocean meets the land of Antarctica. It began a little less than two years ago. A couple of buddies of mine and I had finished a     day run across the entire Sahara desert. And while we were there we learned the seriousness of the water crisis in Northern Africa. We also learned that many of the issues facing the people of Northern Africa affected young people the most. I came home to my wife after     days of running in the sand  and I said   You know  there's no doubt if this bozo can get across the desert  we are capable of doing anything we set our minds to.  But if I'm going to continue doing these adventures  there has to be a reason for me to do them beyond just getting there. Around that time I met an extraordinary human being  Peter Thum  who inspired me with his actions. He's trying to find and solve water issues  the crisis around the world. His dedication inspired me to come up with this expedition  a run to the South Pole where  with an interactive website  I will be able to bring young people  students and teachers from around the world on board the expedition with me  as active members. So we would have a live website  that every single day of the    days  we would be blogging  telling stories of  you know  depleted ozone forcing us to cover our faces  or we will burn. Crossing miles and miles of sastrugi    frozen ice snowdrifts that could be hip deep. I'm telling you  crossing these things with     pound sled  that sled may as well have weighed       pounds  because that's what it felt like. We were blogging to this live website daily to these students that were tracking us as well  about    hour trekking days     hour trekking days  sometimes    hours of trekking daily to meet our goal. We'd catch cat naps at    below on our sled  incidentally. In turn  students  people from around the world  would ask us questions. Young people would ask the most amazing questions. One of my favorite  It's    below  you've got to go to the bathroom  where are you going to go and how are you going to do it  I'm not going to answer that. But I will answer some of the more popular questions. Where do you sleep  We slept in a tent that was very low to the ground  because the winds on Antarctica were so extreme  it would blow anything else away. What do you eat  One of my favorite dishes on expedition  butter and bacon. It's about a million calories. We were burning about       a day  so we needed it. How many batteries do you carry for all the equipment that you have  Virtually none. All of our equipment  including film equipment  was charged by the sun. And do you get along  I certainly hope so  because at some point or another on this expedition  one of your teammates is going to have to take a very big needle  and put it in an infected blister  and drain it for you. But seriously  seriously  we did get along  because we had a common goal of wanting to inspire these young people. They were our teammates  They were inspiring us. The stories we were hearing got us to the South Pole. The website worked brilliantly as a two way street of communication. Young people in northern Canada  kids in an elementary school  dragging sleds across the school yard  pretending they were Richard  Ray and Kevin. Amazing. We arrived at the South Pole. We huddled into that tent     below that day  I'll never forget it. We looked at each other with these looks of disbelief at what we had just completed. And I remember looking at the guys thinking   What do I take from this journey   You know  Seriously. That I'm this uber endurance guy  As I stand here today talking to you guys  I've been running for the grand sum of five years. And a year before that I was a pack a day smoker  living a very sedentary lifestyle. What I take from this journey  from my journeys  is that  in fact  within every fiber of my belief standing here  I know that we can make the impossible possible. I'm learning this at   . Can you imagine  Seriously  can you imagine  I'm learning this at    years of age. Imagine being    years old  hearing those words  and believing it. Thank you very much. Thank you. Now  if President Obama invited me to be the next Czar of Mathematics  then I would have a suggestion for him that I think would vastly improve the mathematics education in this country. And it would be easy to implement and inexpensive. The mathematics curriculum that we have is based on a foundation of arithmetic and algebra. And everything we learn after that is building up towards one subject. And at top of that pyramid  it's calculus. And I'm here to say that I think that that is the wrong summit of the pyramid ... that the correct summit    that all of our students  every high school graduate should know    should be statistics  probability and statistics. I mean  don't get me wrong. Calculus is an important subject. It's one of the great products of the human mind. The laws of nature are written in the language of calculus. And every student who studies math  science  engineering  economics  they should definitely learn calculus by the end of their freshman year of college. But I'm here to say  as a professor of mathematics  that very few people actually use calculus in a conscious  meaningful way  in their day to day lives. On the other hand  statistics    that's a subject that you could  and should  use on daily basis. Right  It's risk. It's reward. It's randomness. It's understanding data. I think if our students  if our high school students    if all of the American citizens    knew about probability and statistics  we wouldn't be in the economic mess that we're in today.  Laughter   Applause  Not only    thank you    not only that ... but if it's taught properly  it can be a lot of fun. I mean  probability and statistics  it's the mathematics of games and gambling. It's analyzing trends. It's predicting the future. Look  the world has changed from analog to digital. And it's time for our mathematics curriculum to change from analog to digital  from the more classical  continuous mathematics  to the more modern  discrete mathematics    the mathematics of uncertainty  of randomness  of data    that being probability and statistics. In summary  instead of our students learning about the techniques of calculus  I think it would be far more significant if all of them knew what two standard deviations from the mean means. And I mean it. Thank you very much. This is the exact moment that I started creating something called Tinkering School. Tinkering School is a place where kids can pick up sticks and hammers and other dangerous objects  and be trusted. Trusted not to hurt themselves  and trusted not to hurt others. Tinkering School doesn't follow a set curriculum  and there are no tests. We're not trying to teach anybody any specific thing. When the kids arrive they're confronted with lots of stuff  wood and nails and rope and wheels  and lots of tools  real tools. It's a six day immersive experience for the kids. And within that context  we can offer the kids time    something that seems in short supply in their over scheduled lives. Our goal is to ensure that they leave with a better sense of how to make things than when they arrived  and the deep internal realization that you can figure things out by fooling around. Nothing ever turns out as planned ... ever. And the kids soon learn that all projects go awry    and become at ease with the idea that every step in a project is a step closer to sweet success  or gleeful calamity. We start from doodles and sketches. And sometimes we make real plans. And sometimes we just start building. Building is at the heart of the experience  hands on  deeply immersed and fully committed to the problem at hand. Robin and I  acting as collaborators  keep the landscape of the projects tilted towards completion. Success is in the doing  and failures are celebrated and analyzed. Problems become puzzles and obstacles disappear. When faced with particularly difficult setbacks or complexities  a really interesting behavior emerges  decoration. Decoration of the unfinished project is a kind of conceptual incubation. From these interludes come deep insights and amazing new approaches to solving the problems that had them frustrated just moments before. All materials are available for use. Even those mundane  hateful  plastic grocery bags can become a bridge stronger than anyone imagined. And the things that they build amaze even themselves. Video  Three  two  one  go  Gever Tulley  A rollercoaster built by seven year olds. Video  Yay  GT  Thank you. It's been a great pleasure. I'll start with my favorite muse  Emily Dickinson  who said that wonder is not knowledge  neither is it ignorance. It's something which is suspended between what we believe we can be  and a tradition we may have forgotten. And I think  when I listen to these incredible people here  I've been so inspired    so many incredible ideas  so many visions. And yet  when I look at the environment outside  you see how resistant architecture is to change. You see how resistant it is to those very ideas. We can think them out. We can create incredible things. And yet  at the end  it's so hard to change a wall. We applaud the well mannered box. But to create a space that never existed is what interests me  to create something that has never been  a space that we have never entered except in our minds and our spirits. And I think that's really what architecture is based on. Architecture is not based on concrete and steel and the elements of the soil. It's based on wonder. And that wonder is really what has created the greatest cities  the greatest spaces that we have had. And I think that is indeed what architecture is. It is a story. By the way  it is a story that is told through its hard materials. But it is a story of effort and struggle against improbabilities. If you think of the great buildings  of the cathedrals  of the temples  of the pyramids  of pagodas  of cities in India and beyond  you think of how incredible this is that that was realized not by some abstract idea  but by people. So  anything that has been made can be unmade. Anything that has been made can be made better. There it is  the things that I really believe are of important architecture. These are the dimensions that I like to work with. It's something very personal. It's not  perhaps  the dimensions appreciated by art critics or architecture critics or city planners. But I think these are the necessary oxygen for us to live in buildings  to live in cities  to connect ourselves in a social space. And I therefore believe that optimism is what drives architecture forward. It's the only profession where you have to believe in the future. You can be a general  a politician  an economist who is depressed  a musician in a minor key  a painter in dark colors. But architecture is that complete ecstasy that the future can be better. And it is that belief that I think drives society. And today we have a kind of evangelical pessimism all around us. And yet it is in times like this that I think architecture can thrive with big ideas  ideas that are not small. Think of the great cities. Think of the Empire State Building  the Rockefeller Center. They were built in times that were not really the best of times in a certain way. And yet that energy and power of architecture has driven an entire social and political space that these buildings occupy. So again  I am a believer in the expressive. I have never been a fan of the neutral. I don't like neutrality in life  in anything. I think expression. And it's like espresso coffee  you know  you take the essence of the coffee. That's what expression is. It's been missing in much of the architecture  because we think architecture is the realm of the neutered  the realm of the kind of a state that has no opinion  that has no value. And yet  I believe it is the expression    expression of the city  expression of our own space    that gives meaning to architecture. And  of course  expressive spaces are not mute. Expressive spaces are not spaces that simply confirm what we already know. Expressive spaces may disturb us. And I think that's also part of life. Life is not just an anesthetic to make us smile  but to reach out across the abyss of history  to places we have never been  and would have perhaps been  had we not been so lucky. So again  radical versus conservative. Radical  what does it mean  It's something which is rooted  and something which is rooted deep in a tradition. And I think that is what architecture is  it's radical. It's not just a conservation in formaldehyde of dead forms. It is actually a living connection to the cosmic event that we are part of  and a story that is certainly ongoing. It's not something that has a good ending or a bad ending. It's actually a story in which our acts themselves are pushing the story in a particular way. So again I am a believer in the radical architecture. You know the Soviet architecture of that building is the conservation. It's like the old Las Vegas used to be. It's about conserving emotions  conserving the traditions that have obstructed the mind in moving forward and of course what is radical is to confront them. And I think our architecture is a confrontation with our own senses. Therefore I believe it should not be cool. There is a lot of appreciation for the kind of cool architecture. I've always been an opponent of it. I think emotion is needed. Life without emotion would really not be life. Even the mind is emotional. There is no reason which does not take a position in the ethical sphere  in the philosophical mystery of what we are. So I think emotion is a dimension that is important to introduce into city space  into city life. And of course  we are all about the struggle of emotions. And I think that is what makes the world a wondrous place. And of course  the confrontation of the cool  the unemotional with emotion  is a conversation that I think cities themselves have fostered. I think that is the progress of cities. It's not only the forms of cities  but the fact that they incarnate emotions  not just of those who build them  but of those who live there as well. Inexplicable versus understood. You know  too often we want to understand everything. But architecture is not the language of words. It's a language. But it is not a language that can be reduced to a series of programmatic notes that we can verbally write. Too many buildings that you see outside that are so banal tell you a story  but the story is very short  which says   We have no story to tell you.  So the important thing actually  is to introduce the actual architectural dimensions  which might be totally inexplicable in words  because they operate in proportions  in materials  in light. They connect themselves into various sources  into a kind of complex vector matrix that isn't really frontal but is really embedded in the lives  and in the history of a city  and of a people. So again  the notion that a building should just be explicit I think is a false notion  which has reduced architecture into banality. Hand versus the computer. Of course  what would we be without computers  Our whole practice depends on computing. But the computer should not just be the glove of the hand  the hand should really be the driver of the computing power. Because I believe that the hand in all its primitive  in all its physiological obscurity  has a source  though the source is unknown  though we don't have to be mystical about it. We realize that the hand has been given us by forces that are beyond our own autonomy. And I think when I draw drawings which may imitate the computer  but are not computer drawings    drawings that can come from sources that are completely not known  not normal  not seen  yet the hand    and that's what I really  to all of you who are working    how can we make the computer respond to our hand rather than the hand responding to the computer. I think that's part of what the complexity of architecture is. Because certainly we have gotten used to the propaganda that the simple is the good. But I don't believe it. Listening to all of you  the complexity of thought  the complexity of layers of meaning is overwhelming. And I think we shouldn't shy away in architecture  You know  brain surgery  atomic theory  genetics  economics are complex complex fields. There is no reason that architecture should shy away and present this illusory world of the simple. It is complex. Space is complex. Space is something that folds out of itself into completely new worlds. And as wondrous as it is  it cannot be reduced to a kind of simplification that we have often come to be admired. And yet  our lives are complex. Our emotions are complex. Our intellectual desires are complex. So I do believe that architecture as I see it needs to mirror that complexity in every single space that we have  in every intimacy that we possess. Of course that means that architecture is political. The political is not an enemy of architecture. The politeama is the city. It's all of us together. And I've always believed that the act of architecture  even a private house  when somebody else will see it  is a political act  because it will be visible to others. And we live in a world which is connecting us more and more. So again  the evasion of that sphere  which has been so endemic to that sort of pure architecture  the autonomous architecture that is just an abstract object has never appealed to me. And I do believe that this interaction with the history  with history that is often very difficult  to grapple with it  to create a position that is beyond our normal expectations and to create a critique. Because architecture is also the asking of questions. It's not only the giving of answers. It's also  just like life  the asking of questions. Therefore it is important that it be real. You know we can simulate almost anything. But the one thing that can be ever simulated is the human heart  the human soul. And architecture is so closely intertwined with it because we are born somewhere and we die somewhere. So the reality of architecture is visceral. It's not intellectual. It's not something that comes to us from books and theories. It's the real that we touch    the door  the window  the threshold  the bed    such prosaic objects. And yet  I try  in every building  to take that virtual world  which is so enigmatic and so rich  and create something in the real world. Create a space for an office  a space of sustainability that really works between that virtuality and yet can be realized as something real. Unexpected versus habitual. What is a habit  It's just a shackle for ourselves. It's a self induced poison. So the unexpected is always unexpected. You know  it's true  the cathedrals  as unexpected  will always be unexpected. You know Frank Gehry's buildings  they will continue to be unexpected in the future. So not the habitual architecture that instills in us the false sort of stability  but an architecture that is full of tension  an architecture that goes beyond itself to reach a human soul and a human heart  and that breaks out of the shackles of habits. And of course habits are enforced by architecture. When we see the same kind of architecture we become immured in that world of those angles  of those lights  of those materials. We think the world really looks like our buildings. And yet our buildings are pretty much limited by the techniques and wonders that have been part of them. So again  the unexpected which is also the raw. And I often think of the raw and the refined. What is raw  The raw  I would say is the naked experience  untouched by luxury  untouched by expensive materials  untouched by the kind of refinement that we associate with high culture. So the rawness  I think  in space  the fact that sustainability can actually  in the future translate into a raw space  a space that isn't decorated  a space that is not mannered in any source  but a space that might be cool in terms of its temperature  might be refractive to our desires. A space that doesn't always follow us like a dog that has been trained to follow us  but moves ahead into directions of demonstrating other possibilities  other experiences  that have never been part of the vocabulary of architecture. And of course that juxtaposition is of great interest to me because it creates a kind of a spark of new energy. And so I do like something which is pointed  not blunt  something which is focused on reality  something that has the power  through its leverage  to transform even a very small space. So architecture maybe is not so big  like science  but through its focal point it can leverage in an Archimedian way what we think the world is really about. And often it takes just a building to change our experience of what could be done  what has been done  how the world has remained both in between stability and instability. And of course buildings have their shapes. Those shapes are difficult to change. And yet  I do believe that in every social space  in every public space  there is a desire to communicate more than just that blunt thought  that blunt technique  but something that pinpoints  and can point in various directions forward  backward  sideways and around. So that is indeed what is memory. So I believe that my main interest is to memory. Without memory we would be amnesiacs. We would not know which way we were going  and why we are going where we're going. So I've been never interested in the forgettable reuse  rehashing of the same things over and over again  which  of course  get accolades of critics. Critics like the performance to be repeated again and again the same way. But I rather play something completely unheard of  and even with flaws  than repeat the same thing over and over which has been hollowed by its meaninglessness. So again  memory is the city  memory is the world. Without the memory there would be no story to tell. There would be nowhere to turn. The memorable  I think  is really our world  what we think the world is. And it's not only our memory  but those who remember us  which means that architecture is not mute. It's an art of communication. It tells a story. The story can reach into obscure desires. It can reach into sources that are not explicitly available. It can reach into millennia that have been buried  and return them in a just and unexpected equity. So again  I think the notion that the best architecture is silent has never appealed to me. Silence maybe is good for a cemetery but not for a city. Cities should be full of vibrations  full of sound  full of music. And that indeed is the architectural mission that I believe is important  is to create spaces that are vibrant  that are pluralistic  that can transform the most prosaic activities  and raise them to a completely different expectation. Create a shopping center  a swimming place that is more like a museum than like entertainment. And these are our dreams. And of course risk. I think architecture should be risky. You know it costs a lot of money and so on  but yes  it should not play it safe. It should not play it safe  because if it plays it safe it's not moving us in a direction that we want to be. And I think  of course  risk is what underlies the world. World without risk would not be worth living. So yes  I do believe that the risk we take in every building. Risks to create spaces that have never been cantilevered to that extent. Risks of spaces that have never been so dizzying  as they should be  for a pioneering city. Risks that really move architecture even with all its flaws  into a space which is much better that the ever again repeated hollowness of a ready made thing. And of course that is finally what I believe architecture to be. It's about space. It's not about fashion. It's not about decoration. It's about creating with minimal means something which can not be repeated  cannot be simulated in any other sphere. And there of course is the space that we need to breathe  is the space we need to dream. These are the spaces that are not just luxurious spaces for some of us  but are important for everybody in this world. So again  it's not about the changing fashions  changing theories. It's about carving out a space for trees. It's carving out a space where nature can enter the domestic world of a city. A space where something which has never seen a light of day can enter into the inner workings of a density. And I think that is really the nature of architecture. Now I am a believer in democracy. I don't like beautiful buildings built for totalitarian regimes. Where people cannot speak  cannot vote  cannot do anything. We too often admire those buildings. We think they are beautiful. And yet when I think of the poverty of society which doesn't give freedom to its people  I don't admire those buildings. So democracy  as difficult as it is  I believe in it. And of course  at Ground Zero what else  It's such a complex project. It's emotional. There is so many interests. It's political. There is so many parties to this project. There is so many interests. There's money. There's political power. There are emotions of the victims. And yet  in all its messiness  in all its difficulties  I would not have liked somebody to say   This is the tabula rasa  mister architect    do whatever you want.  I think nothing good will come out of that. I think architecture is about consensus. And it is about the dirty word  compromise.  Compromise is not bad. Compromise  if it's artistic  if it is able to cope with its strategies    and there is my first sketch and the last rendering    it's not that far away. And yet  compromise  consensus  that is what I believe in. And Ground Zero  despite all its difficulties  it's moving forward. It's difficult.           . Freedom Tower  the memorial. And that is where I end. I was inspired when I came here as an immigrant on a ship like millions of others  looking at America from that point of view. This is America. This is liberty. This is what we dream about. Its individuality  demonstrated in the skyline. It's resilience. And finally  it's the freedom that America represents  not just to me  as an immigrant  but to everyone in the world. Thank you. Chris Anderson  I've got a question. So have you come to peace with the process that happened at Ground Zero and the loss of the original  incredible design that you came up with  Daniel Libeskind  Look. We have to cure ourselves of the notion that we are authoritarian  that we can determine everything that happens. We have to rely on others  and shape the process in the best way possible. I came from the Bronx. I was taught not to be a loser  not to be somebody who just gives up in a fight. You have to fight for what you believe. You don't always win everything you want to win. But you can steer the process. And I believe that what will be built at Ground Zero will be meaningful  will be inspiring  will tell other generations of the sacrifices  of the meaning of this event. Not just for New York  but for the world. Chris Anderson  Thank you so much  Daniel Libeskind. Charles and Ray were a team. They were husband and wife. Despite the New York Times' and Vanity Fair's best efforts recently  they're not brothers.  Laughter  And they were a lot of fun. You know  Ray was the one who wore the ampersands in the family. We are going to focus on Charles today  because it is Charles'    th birthday. But when I speak of him  I'm really speaking of both of them as a team. Here's Charles when he was three. So he would be     this June. We have a lot of cool celebrations that we're going to do. The thing about their work is that most people come to the door of furniture    I suspect you probably recognize this chair and some of the others I'm going to show you. But we're going to first enter through the door of the Big Top. The whole thing about this  though  is that  you know  why am I showing it  Is it because Charles and Ray made this film  This is actually a training film for a clown college that they had. They also practiced a clown act when the future of furniture was not nearly as auspicious as it turned out to be. There is a picture of Charles. So let's watch the next clip. The film that we're about to see is a film they made for the Moscow World's Fair. Video  This is the land. It has many contrasts. It is rough and it is flat. In places it is cold. In some it is hot. Too much rain falls on some areas  and not enough on others. But people live on this land. And  as in Russia  they are drawn together into towns and cities. Here is something of the way they live. Eames Demetrios  Now  this is a film that was hardly ever seen in the United States. It was on seven screens and it was     feet across. And it was at the height of the Cold War. The Nixon Khrushchev Kitchen Debate happened about    feet from where this was shown. And yet  how did it start  You know  commonality  the first line in Charles' narration was   The same stars that shine down on Russia shine down on the United States. From the sky  our cities look much the same.  It was that human connection that Charles and Ray always found in everything. And you can imagine  and the thing about it is  that they believed that the human mind could handle this number of images because the important thing was to get the gestalt of what the images were about. So that was just a little snip. But the thing about Charles and Ray is that they were always modeling stuff. They were always trying things out. I think one of the things I am passionate about  my grandparents work  I'm passionate about my work  but on top of all that I'm passionate about a holistic vision of design  where design is a life skill  not a professional skill. And you know  those of us with kids often want our kids to take music. I'm no exception. But it's not about them becoming Bono or Tracy Chapman. It's about getting that music thing going through their heads and their thinking. Design is the same way. Design has to become that same way. And this is a model that they did of that seven screen presentation. And Charles just checking it out there. So now we're going to go through that door of furniture. This is an unusual installation of airport seating. So what we're going to see is some of the icons of Eames furniture. And the thing about their furniture is that they said the role of the designer was essentially that of a good host  anticipating the needs of the guest. So those are cool images. But these are ones I think are really cool. These are all the prototypes. These are the mistakes  although I don't think mistakes is the right word in design. It's just the things you try out to kind of make it work better. And you know some of them would probably be terrible chairs. Some of them are kind of cool looking. It's like  Hey  why didn't they try that   It was that hands on iterative process which is so much like vernacular design and folk design in traditional cultures. And I think that's one of the commonalities between modernism and traditional design. I think it may be a real common ground as we kind of figure out what on earth to do in the next    or    years. The other thing that's kind of cool is that you look at this and in the media when people say design  they actually mean style. And I'm really here to talk about design. But you know the object is just a pivot. It's a pivot between a process and a system. And this is a little film I made about the making of the Eames lounge chair. The design process for Charles and Ray never ended in manufacturing. It continued. They were always trying to make thing better and better. Because it's like as Bill Clinton was saying about Rwandan health clinics. It's not enough to create one. You've got to create a system that will work better and better. So I've always liked this prototype picture. Because it just kind of  you know  doesn't get any more basic than that. You try things out. This is a relatively famous chair. Its early version had an  X  base. That's what the collectors like. Charles and Ray liked this one because it was better. It worked better   H  base  much more practical. This is something called a splint. And I was very touched by Dean Kamen's work for the military  or for the soldiers  because Charles and Ray designed a molded plywood splint. This is it. And they'd been working on furniture before. But doing these splints they learned a lot about the manufacturing process  which was incredibly important to them. I'm trying to show you too much  because I want you to really get a broth of ideas and images. This is a house that Charles and Ray designed. My sister is chasing someone else. It's not me. Although I endorse heartily the fact that he stole her diary  it's not me. And then this is a film  on the lower left  that Charles and Ray made. Now look at that plastic chair. The house is     . The chair is done in     . Charles and Ray  they didn't obsess about style for it's own sake. They didn't say   Our style is curves. Let's make the house curvy.  They didn't say   Our style is grids. Let's make the chair griddy.  They focused on the need. They tried to solve the design problem. Charles used to say   The extent to which you have a design style is the extent to which you have not solved the design problem.  It's kind of a brutal quote. This is the earlier design of that house. And again  they managed to figure out a way to make a prototype of a house    architecture  very expensive medium. Here's a film we've been hearing things about. The  Powers of Ten  is a film they made. If we watch the next clip  you're going to see the first version of  Powers of Ten   upper left. The familiar one on the lower right. The Eames' film Tops  lower left. And a lamp that Charles designed for a church. Video  Which in turn belongs to a local group of galaxies. These form part of a grouping system much as the stars do. They are so many and so varied that from this distance they appear like the stars from Earth. ED  You've seen that film  and what's so great about this whole conference is that everybody has been talking about scale. Everybody here is coming at it from a different way. I want to give you one example. E.O. Wilson once told me that when he looked at ants    he loved them  of course  and he wanted to learn more about them    he consciously looked at them from the standpoint of scale. So here is the tiny creature. And yet simply by changing the frame of reference it reveals so much  including what ended up being the TED Prize. Modeling  they tried modeling all the time. They were always modeling things. And I think part of that is that they never delegated understanding. And I think in our family we were very lucky  because we learned about design backwards. Design was not something other. It was part of the business of life in general. It was part of the quality of life. And here is some family pictures. And you can see why I'm down on style  with a haircut like that. But anyway   Laughter  I remember the cut grapefruit that we would have at the Eames house when I was a kid. So we're going to watch another film. This is a film  the one called Toys. You can see me  I have the same haircut  in the upper right corner. Upper left is a film they did on toy trains. Lower right is a solar do nothing toy. Lower left is Day of the Dead toys. Charles used to say that toys are not as innocent as they appear. They are often the precursor to bigger things. And these ideas    that train up there  being about the honest use of materials  is totally the same as the honest use of materials in the plywood. And now I'm going to test you. This is a letter that my grandfather sent to my mom when she was five years old. So can you read it  Lucia angel  okay  eye. Audience  Saw many trains. ED  Awl  also  good that the leather crafter's guild is here. Also  what is he doing  Row  rowed. Sun  No. Well is there another name for a sunrise  Dawn  very good. Also rode on one. I ... Audience  You had  I hope you had    ED  Now you've been to the website Dogs of Saint Louis in the late  in the mid     's  then you'd know that was a Great Dane. So  I hope you had a Audience  Nice time  time    ED  Time at. Citizen Kane  rose    Audience  Rosebud. ED  No  bud.  D 's right. At Buddy's    Audience  Party. Love. ED  Okay  good. So   I saw many trains and also rode on one. I hope you had a nice time at Buddy's party.  So you guys did pretty good  cool. So my mom and Charles had this great relationship where they'd send those sorts of things back and forth to one another. And it's all part of the  you know  they used to say   Take your pleasure seriously.  These are some images from a project of mine that's called Kymaerica. It's sort of an alternative universe. It's kind of a reinterpretation of the landscape. Those plaques are plaques we've been installing around North America. We're about to do six in the U.K. next week. And they honor events in the linear world from the fictional world. So  of course  since it's bronze it has to be true. Video  Kymaerica with waterfalls  tumbling through our    ED  This is one of the traditional Kymaerican songs. And so we had spelling bees in Paris  Illinois. Video  Your word is N. Carolina. Girl  Y I N D I A N A. ED  And then Embassy Row is actually a historical site  because in the Kymaerican story this is where the Parisian Diaspora started  where there embassy was. So you can actually visit and have this three dimensional fictional experience there. And the town has really embraced it. We had the spelling bee in conjunction with the Gwomeus Club. But what is really cool is that we take our visual environment as inevitable. And it's not. Other things could have happened. The Japanese could have discovered Monterey. And we could have been born         years ago. And there are a lot of fun things. This is the Museum of the Bench. They have trading cards and all sorts of cool things. And you're kind of trapped in the texture of Kymaerica. The Tahatchabe  the great road building culture. A guy named Nobu Naga  the so called Japanese Columbus. But now I'm going to return you to the real world. And this is Cranbrook. I've got a real treat for you  which is the first film that Charles ever made. So let's watch that. Nobody's ever seen it. Cranbrook is very generous to let us show it for the first time here. It's a film about Maya Gretel  a famous ceramicist  and a teacher at Cranbrook. And he made it for the      faculty exhibition. Silent. We don't have a track for it yet. Very simple. It's just a start. But it's that learn by doing thing. You want to learn how to make films  Go make a movie. And you try something out. But here is what's really great. See that chair there  The orange one  That's the organic chair.     . At the same time that Charles was doing that chair  he was doing this film. So my point is that this scope of vision  this holistic vision of design  was with them from the beginning. It wasn't like  Oh  we made some chairs and got successful. Now we're going to do some movies.  It was always part of how they looked at the world. And that's what's really powerful. And I think that all of us in this room  as you move design forward  it's not about just doing one thing. It's about how you approach problems. And there is this huge  beautiful commonality between design  business and the world. So we're going to do the last clip. And I've shown you some of the images. I just want to focus on sound now. So this is Charles' voice. Charles Eames  In India  those without  and the lowest in caste  eat very often  particularly in southern India  they eat off of a banana leaf. And those a little bit up the scale eat off of a sort of a low fired ceramic dish. And a little bit higher  why they have a glaze on a thing they call a thali. If you're up the scale a little bit more  why  a brass thali. And then things get to be a little questionable. There are things like silver plated thalis. And there is solid silver thalis. And I suppose some nut has had a gold thali that he's eaten off of. But you can go beyond that. And the guys that have not only means  but a certain amount of knowledge and understanding  go to the next step  and they eat off a banana leaf. And I think that in these times when we fall back and regroup  that somehow or other  the banana leaf parable sort of got to get working there  because I'm not prepared to say that the banana leaf that one eats off of is the same as the other eats off of. But it is that process that has happened within the man that changes the banana leaf. ED  I've been looking forward to sharing that quote with you. Because that's part of where we've got to get to. And I also want to share this one.  Beyond the age of information is the age of choices.  And I really think that's where we are. And it's kind of cool for me to be part of a family and a tradition where he was talking about that in     . And part of why this stuff is important and all the things that we do are important  is that these are the ideas we need. And I think that this is all part of surrendering to the design journey. That's what we all need to do. Design is not just for designers anymore. It's a process. It's not style. All that great thinking needs to really get about solving pretty key problems. I really thank you for your time. Last year at TED we aimed to try to clarify the overwhelming complexity and richness that we experience at the conference in a project called Big Viz. And the Big Viz is a collection of     sketches that were made by two visual artists. David Sibbet from The Grove  and Kevin Richards  from Autodesk  made     sketches that strive to capture the essence of each presenter's ideas. And the consensus was  it really worked. These sketches brought to life the key ideas  the portraits  the magic moments that we all experienced last year. This year we were thinking   Why does it work   What is it about animation  graphics  illustrations  that create meaning  And this is an important question to ask and answer because the more we understand how the brain creates meaning  the better we can communicate  and  I also think  the better we can think and collaborate together. So this year we're going to visualize how the brain visualizes. Cognitive psychologists now tell us that the brain doesn't actually see the world as it is  but instead  creates a series of mental models through a collection of  Ah ha moments   or moments of discovery  through various processes. The processing  of course  begins with the eyes. Light enters  hits the back of the retina  and is circulated  most of which is streamed to the very back of the brain  at the primary visual cortex. And primary visual cortex sees just simple geometry  just the simplest of shapes. But it also acts like a kind of relay station that re radiates and redirects information to many other parts of the brain. As many as    other parts that selectively make more sense  create more meaning through the kind of  Ah ha  experiences. We're only going to talk about three of them. So the first one is called the ventral stream. It's on this side of the brain. And this is the part of the brain that will recognize what something is. It's the  what  detector. Look at a hand. Look at a remote control. Chair. Book. So that's the part of the brain that is activated when you give a word to something. A second part of the brain is called the dorsal stream. And what it does is locates the object in physical body space. So if you look around the stage here you'll create a kind of mental map of the stage. And if you closed your eyes you'd be able to mentally navigate it. You'd be activating the dorsal stream if you did that. The third part that I'd like to talk about is the limbic system. And this is deep inside of the brain. It's very old  evolutionarily. And it's the part that feels. It's the kind of gut center  where you see an image and you go   Oh  I have a strong or emotional reaction to whatever I'm seeing.  So the combination of these processing centers help us make meaning in very different ways. So what can we learn about this  How can we apply this insight  Well  again  the schematic view is that the eye visually interrogates what we look at. The brain processes this in parallel  the figments of information asking a whole bunch of questions to create a unified mental model. So  for example  when you look at this image a good graphic invites the eye to dart around  to selectively create a visual logic. So the act of engaging  and looking at the image creates the meaning. It's the selective logic. Now we've augmented this and spatialized this information. Many of you may remember the magic wall that we built in conjunction with Perceptive Pixel where we quite literally create an infinite wall. And so we can compare and contrast the big ideas. So the act of engaging and creating interactive imagery enriches meaning. It activates a different part of the brain. And then the limbic system is activated when we see motion  when we see color  and there are primary shapes and pattern detectors that we've heard about before. So the point of this is what  We make meaning by seeing  by an act of visual interrogation. The lessons for us are three fold. First  use images to clarify what we're trying to communicate. Secondly make those images interactive so that we engage much more fully. And the third is to augment memory by creating a visual persistence. These are techniques that can be used to be    that can be applied in a wide range of problem solving. So the low tech version looks like this. And  by the way  this is the way in which we develop and formulate strategy within Autodesk  in some of our organizations and some of our divisions. What we literally do is have the teams draw out the entire strategic plan on one giant wall. And it's very powerful because everyone gets to see everything else. There's always a room  always a place to be able to make sense of all of the components in the strategic plan. This is a time lapse view of it. You can ask the question   Who's the boss   You'll be able to figure that out.  Laughter  So the act of collectively and collaboratively building the image transforms the collaboration. No Powerpoint is used in two days. But instead the entire team creates a shared mental model that they can all agree on and move forward on. And this can be enhanced and augmented with some emerging digital technology. And this is our great unveiling for today. And this is an emerging set of technologies that use large screen displays with intelligent calculation in the background to make the invisible visible. Here what we can do is look at sustainability  quite literally. So a team can actually look at all the key components that heat the structure and make choices and then see the end result that is visualized on this screen. So making images meaningful has three components. The first again  is making ideas clear by visualizing them. Secondly  making them interactive. And then thirdly  making them persistent. And I believe that these three principles can be applied to solving some of the very tough problems that we face in the world today. Thanks so much. I normally teach courses on how to rebuild states after war. But today I've got a personal story to share with you. This is a picture of my family  my four siblings    my mom and I    taken in     . And we're actually Cambodians. And this picture is taken in Vietnam. So how did a Cambodian family end up in Vietnam in       Well to explain that  I've got a short video clip to explain the Khmer Rouge regime during      and     . Video  April   th      . The communist Khmer Rouge enters Phnom Penh to liberate their people from the encroaching conflict in Vietnam  and American bombing campaigns. Led by peasant born Pol Pot  the Khmer Rouge evacuates people to the countryside in order to create a rural communist utopia  much like Mao Tse tung's Cultural Revolution in China. The Khmer Rouge closes the doors to the outside world. But after four years the grim truth seeps out. In a country of only seven million people  one and a half million were murdered by their own leaders  their bodies piled in the mass graves of the killing fields. Sophal Ear  So  notwithstanding the     s narration  on April   th      we lived in Phnom Penh. And my parents were told by the Khmer Rouge to evacuate the city because of impending American bombing for three days. And here is a picture of the Khmer Rouge. They were young soldiers  typically child soldiers. And this is very normal now  of modern day conflict  because they're easy to bring into wars. The reason that they gave about American bombing wasn't all that far off. I mean  from      to      there were more munitions that fell on Cambodia than in all of World War II Japan  including the two nuclear bombs of August     . The Khmer Rouge didn't believe in money. So the equivalent of the Federal Reserve Bank in Cambodia was bombed. But not just that  they actually banned money. I think it's the only precedent in which money has ever been stopped from being used. And we know money is the root of all evil  but it didn't actually stop evil from happening in Cambodia  in fact. My family was moved from Phnom Penh to Pursat province. This is a picture of what Pursat looks like. It's actually a very pretty area of Cambodia  where rice growing takes place. And in fact they were forced to work the fields. So my father and mother ended up in a sort of concentration camp  labor camp. And it was at that time that my mother got word from the commune chief that the Vietnamese were actually asking for their citizens to go back to Vietnam. And she spoke some Vietnamese  as a child having grown up with Vietnamese friends. And she decided  despite the advice of her neighbors  that she would take the chance and claim to be Vietnamese so that we could have a chance to survive  because at this point they're forcing everybody to work. And they're giving about    in a modern day  caloric restriction diet  I guess    they're giving porridge  with a few grains of rice. And at about this time actually my father got very sick. And he didn't speak Vietnamese. So he died actually  in January     . And it made it possible  in fact  for us to take on this plan. So the Khmer Rouge took us from a place called Pursat to Kaoh Tiev  which is across from the border from Vietnam. And there they had a detention camp where alleged Vietnamese would be tested  language tested. And my mother's Vietnamese was so bad that to make our story more credible  she'd given all the boys and girls new Vietnamese names. But she'd given the boys girls' names  and the girls boys' names. And it wasn't until she met a Vietnamese lady who told her this  and then tutored her for two days intensively  that she was able to go into her exam and    you know  this was a moment of truth. If she fails  we're all headed to the gallows  if she passes  we can leave to Vietnam. And she actually  of course    I'm here  she passes. And we end up in Hong Ngu on the Vietnamese side. And then onwards to Chau Doc. And this is a picture of Hong Ngu  Vietnam today. A pretty idyllic place on the Mekong Delta. But for us it meant freedom. And freedom from persecution from the Khmer Rouge. Last year  the Khmer Rouge Tribunal  which the U.N. is helping Cambodia take on  started  and I decided that as a matter of record I should file a Civil Complaint with the Tribunal about my father's passing away. And I got word last month that the complaint was officially accepted by the Khmer Rouge Tribunal. And it's for me a matter of justice for history  and accountability for the future  because Cambodia remains a pretty lawless place  at times. Five years ago my mother and I went back to Chau Doc. And she was able to return to a place that for her meant freedom  but also fear  because we had just come out of Cambodia. I'm happy  actually  today  to present her. She's here today with us in the audience. Thank you mother. So it was about four years ago  five years ago  I was sitting on a stage in Philadelphia  I think it was  with a bag similar to this. And I was pulling a molecule out of this bag. And I was saying  you don't know this molecule really well  but your body knows it extremely well. And I was thinking that your body hated it  at the time  because we are very immune to this. This is called alpha gal epitope. And the fact that pig heart valves have lots of these on them is the reason that you can't transplant a pig heart valve into a person easily. Actually our body doesn't hate these. Our body loves these. It eats them. I mean  the cells in our immune system are always hungry. And if an antibody is stuck to one of these things on the cell  it means  that's food.  Now  I was thinking about that and I said  you know  we've got this immune response to this ridiculous molecule that we don't make  and we see it a lot in other animals and stuff. But I said we can't get rid of it  because all the people who tried to transplant heart valves found out you can't get rid of that immunity. And I said  why don't you use that  What if I could stick this molecule  slap it onto a bacteria that was pathogenic to me  that had just invaded my lungs  I mean I could immediately tap into an immune response that was already there  where it was not going to take five or six days to develop it    it was going to immediately attack whatever this thing was on. It was kind of like the same thing that happens when you  like when you're getting stopped for a traffic ticket in L.A.  and the cop drops a bag of marijuana in the back of your car  and then charges you for possession of marijuana. It's like this very fast  very efficient way to get people off the street. So you can take a bacteria that really doesn't make these things at all  and if you could clamp these on it really well you have it taken off the street. And for certain bacteria we don't have really efficient ways to do that anymore. Our antibiotics are running out. And  I mean  the world apparently is running out too. So probably it doesn't matter    years from now    streptococcus and stuff like that will be rampant    because we won't be here. But if we are    we're going to need something to do with the bacteria. So I started working with this thing  with a bunch of collaborators. And trying to attach this to things that were themselves attached to certain specific target zones  bacteria that we don't like. And I feel now like George Bush. It's like  mission accomplished.  So I might be doing something dumb  just like he was doing at the time. But basically what I was talking about there we've now gotten to work. And it's killing bacteria. It's eating them. This thing can be stuck  like that little green triangle up there  sort of symbolizing this right now. You can stick this to something called a DNA aptamer. And that DNA aptamer will attach specifically to a target that you have selected for it. So you can find a little feature on a bacterium that you don't like  like Staphylococcus    I don't like it in particular  because it killed a professor friend of mine last year. It doesn't respond to antibiotics. So I don't like it. And I'm making an aptamer that will have this attached to it. That will know how to find Staph when it's in your body  and will alert your immune system to go after it. Here's what happened. See that line on the very top with the little dots  That's a bunch of mice that had been poisoned by our scientist friends down in Texas  at Brooks Air Base  with anthrax. And they had also been treated with a drug that we made that would attack anthrax in particular  and direct your immune system to it. You'll notice they all lived  the ones on the top line    that's a     percent survival rate. And they actually lived another    days  or    when we finally killed them  and took them apart and figured out what went wrong. Why did they not die  And they didn't die because they didn't have anthrax anymore. So we did it. Okay  Mission accomplished  Because of what I'm about to say  I really should establish my green credentials. When I was a small boy  I took my pledge as an American  to save and faithfully defend from waste the natural resources of my country  its air  soil and minerals  its forests  waters and wildlife. And I've stuck to that. Stanford  I majored in ecology and evolution.       I put out the Whole Earth Catalog. Was  mister natural  for a while. And then worked for the Jerry Brown administration. The Brown administration  and a bunch of my friends  basically leveled the energy efficiency of California  so it's the same now     years later  even though our economy has gone up    percent  per capita. And we are putting out less greenhouse gasses than any other state. California is basically the equivalent of Europe  in this. This year  Whole Earth Catalog has a supplement that I'll preview today  called Whole Earth Discipline. The dominant demographic event of our time is this screamingly rapid urbanization that we have going on. By mid century we'll be about    percent urban  and that's mostly in the developing world  where that's happening. It's interesting  because history is driven to a large degree by the size of cities. The developing world now has all of the biggest cities  and they are developing three times faster than the developed countries  and nine times bigger. It's qualitatively different. They are the drivers of history  as we see by looking at history.       years ago this is what the world looked like. Well we now have a distribution of urban power similar to what we had       years ago. In other words  the rise of the West  dramatic as it was  is over. The aggregate numbers are absolutely overwhelming   .  million people a week coming to town  decade after decade. What's really going on  Well  what's going on is the villages of the world are emptying out. Subsistence farming is drying up basically. People are following opportunity into town. And this is why. I used to have a very romantic idea about villages  and it's because I never lived in one. Because in town    this is the bustling squatter city of Kibera  near Nairobi    they see action. They see opportunity. They see a cash economy that they were not able to participate in back in the subsistence farm. As you go around these places there's plenty of aesthetics. There is plenty going on. They are poor  but they are intensely urban. And they are intensely creative. The aggregate numbers now are that basically squatters  all one billion of them  are building the urban world  which means they're building the world    personally  one by one  family by family  clan by clan  neighborhood by neighborhood. They start flimsy and they get substantial as time goes by. They even build their own infrastructure. Well  steal their own infrastructure  at first. Cable TV  water  the whole gamut  all gets stolen. And then gradually gentrifies. It is not the case that slums undermine prosperity  not the working slums  they help create prosperity. So in a town like Mumbai  which is half slums  it's    th of the GDP of India. Social capital in the slums is at its most urban and dense. These people are valuable as a group. And that's how they work. There is a lot of people who think about all these poor people   Oh there's terrible things. We've got to fix their housing.  It used to be   Oh we've got to get them phone service.  Now they're showing us how they do their phone service. Famine mostly is a rural event now. There are things they care about. And this is where we can help. And the nations they're in can help. And they are helping each other solve these issues. And you go to a nice dense place like this slum in Mumbai. You look at that lane on the right. And you can ask   Okay what's going on there   The answer is   Everything.  This is better than a mall. It's much denser. It's much more interactive. And the scale is terrific. The main event is  these are not people crushed by poverty. These are people busy getting out of poverty just as fast as they can. They're helping each other do it. They're doing it through an outlaw thing  the informal economy. The informal economy  it's sort of like dark energy in astrophysics  it's not supposed to be there  but it's huge. We don't understand how it works yet  but we have to. Furthermore  people in the informal economy  the gray economy    as time goes by  crime is happening around them. And they can join the criminal world  or they can join the legitimate world. We should be able to make that choice easier for them to get toward the legitimate world  because if we don't  they will go toward the criminal world. There's all kinds of activity. In Dharavi the slum performs not only a lot of services for itself  but it performs services for the city at large. And one of the main events are these ad hoc schools. Parents pool their money to hire some local teachers to a private  tiny  unofficial school. Education is more possible in the cities  and that changes the world. So you see some interesting  typical  urban things. So one thing slammed up against another  such as in Sao Paulo here. That's what cities do. That's how they create value  is by slamming things together. In this case  supply right next to demand. So the maids and the gardeners and the guards that live in this lively part of town on the left walk to work  in the boring  rich neighborhood. Proximity is amazing. We are learning about how dense proximity can be. Connectivity between the city and the country is what's going to keep the country good  because the city has interesting ways of doing things. This is what makes cities    this is what makes cities so green in the developing world. Because people leave the poverty trap  an ecological disaster of subsistence farms  and head to town. And when they're gone the natural environment starts to come back very rapidly. And those who remain in the village can shift over to cash crops to send food to the new growing markets in town. So if you want to save a village  you do it with a good road  or with a good cell phone connection  and ideally some grid electrical power. So the event is  we're a city planet. That just happened. More than half. The numbers are considerable. A billion live in the squatter cities now. Another billion is expected. That's more than a sixth of humanity living a certain way. And that will determine a lot of how we function. Now  for us environmentalists  maybe the greenest thing about the cities is they diffuse the population bomb. People get into town. The immediately have fewer children. They don't even have to get rich yet. Just the opportunity of coming up in the world means they will have fewer  higher quality kids  and the birthrate goes down radically. Very interesting side effect here  here's a slide from Phillip Longman. Shows what is happening. As we have more and more old people  like me  and fewer and fewer babies. And they are regionally separated. What you're getting is a world which is old folks  and old cities  going around doing things the old way  in the north. And young people in brand new cities they're inventing  doing new things  in the south. Where do you think the action is going to be  Shift of subject. Quickly drop by climate. The climate news  I'm sorry to say  is going to keep getting worse than we think  faster than we think. Climate is a profoundly complex  nonlinear system  full of runaway positive feedbacks  hidden thresholds and irrevocable tipping points. Here's just a few samples. We're going to keep being surprised. And almost all the surprises are going to be bad ones. From your standpoint this means a great increase in climate refugees over the coming decades  and what goes along with that  which is resource wars and chaos wars  as we're seeing in Darfur. That's what drought does. It brings carrying capacity down  and there's not enough carrying capacity to support the people. And then you're in trouble. Shift to the power situation. Baseload electricity is what it takes to run a city  or a city planet. So far there is only three sources of baseload electricity  coal  some gas  nuclear and hydro. Of those  only nuclear and hydro are green. Coal is what is causing the climate problems. And everyone will keep burning it because it's so cheap  until governments make it expensive. Wind and solar can't help  because so far we don't have a way to store that energy. So with hydro maxed out  coal and lose the climate  or nuclear  which is the current operating low carbon source  and maybe save the climate. And if we can eventually get good solar in space  that also could help. Because remember  this is what drives the prosperity in the developing world in the villages and in the cities. So  between coal and nuclear  compare their waste products. If all of the electricity you used in your lifetime was nuclear  the amount of waste that would be added up would fit in a Coke can. Whereas a coal burning plant  a normal one gigawatt coal plant  burns    rail cars of coal a day  each car having     tons. And it puts    thousand tons of carbon dioxide in the air. So and then when you compare the lifetime emissions of these various energy forms  nuclear is about even with solar and wind  and ahead of solar    oh  I'm sorry    with hydro and wind  and ahead of solar. And does nuclear really compete with coal  Just ask the coal miners in Australia. That's where you see some of the source  not from my fellow environmentalists  but from people who feel threatened by nuclear power. Well the good news is that the developing world  but frankly  the whole world  is busy building  and starting to build  nuclear reactors. This is good for the atmosphere. It's good for their prosperity. I want to point out one interesting thing  which is that environmentalists like the thing we call micropower. It's supposed to be  I don't know  local solar and wind and cogeneration  and good things like that. But frankly micro reactors which are just now coming on  might serve even better. The Russians  who started this  are building floating reactors  for their new passage  where the ice is melting  north of Russia. And they're selling these floating reactors  only    megawatts  to developing countries. Here's the design of an early one from Toshiba. It's interesting  say  to take a    megawatt     million watts  and you compare it to the standard big iron of an ordinary Westinghouse or Ariva  which is  .    .  billion watts. These things are way smaller. They're much more adaptable. Here's an American design from Lawrence Livermore Lab. Here's another American design that came out of Los Alamos  and is now commercial. Almost all of these are not only small  they are proliferation proof. They're typically buried in the ground. And the innovation is moving very rapidly. So I think microreactors is going to be important for the future. In terms of proliferation  nuclear energy has done more to dismantle nuclear weapons than any other activity. And that's why    percent of the electricity in this room     percent of electricity in this room is probably nuclear. Half of that is coming from dismantled warheads from Russia  soon to be joined by our dismantled warheads. And so I would like to see the GNEP program  that was developed in the Bush administration  go forward aggressively. And I was glad to see that president Obama supported the nuclear fuel bank strategy when he spoke in Prague the other week. One more subject. Genetically engineered food crops  in my view  as a biologist  have no reason to be controversial. My fellow environmentalists  on this subject  have been irrational  anti scientific  and very harmful. Despite their best efforts  genetically engineered crops are the most rapidly successful agricultural innovation in history. They're good for the environment because they enable no till farming  which leaves the soil in place  getting healthier from year to year    slso keeps less carbon dioxide going from the soil into the atmosphere. They reduce pesticide use. And they increase yield  which allows you to have your agricultural area be smaller  and therefore more wild area is freed up. By the way  this map from      is out of date because it shows Africa still under the thumb of Greenpeace  and Friends of the Earth from Europe  and they're finally getting out from under that. And biotech is moving rapidly in Africa  at last. This is a moral issue. The Nuffield Council on Bioethics met on this issue twice in great detail and said it is a moral imperative to make genetically engineered crops readily available. Speaking of imperatives  geoengineering is taboo now  especially in government circles  though I think there was a DARPA meeting on it a couple of weeks ago  but it will be on your plate    not this year but pretty soon  because some harsh realizations are coming along. This is a list of them. Basically the news is going to keep getting more scary. There will be events  like        people dying of a heat wave  which happened a while back. Like cyclones coming up toward Bangladesh. Like wars over water  such as in the Indus. And as those events keep happening we're going to say   Okay  what can we do about that really   But there's this little problem with geoengineering  what body is going to decide who gets to engineer  How much they do  Where they do it  Because everybody is downstream  downwind of whatever is done. And if we just taboo it completely we could lose civilization. But if we just say  OK  China  you're worried  you go ahead. You geoengineer your way. We'll geoengineer our way.  That would be considered an act of war by both nations. So this is very interesting diplomacy coming along. I should say  it is more practical than people think. Here is an example that climatologists like a lot  one of the dozens of geoengineering ideas. This one came from the sulfur dioxide from Mount Pinatubo in         cooled the earth by half a degree. There was so much ice in       the following year  that there was a bumper crop of polar bear cubs who were known as the Pinatubo cubs. To put sulfur dioxide in the stratosphere would cost on the order of a billion dollars a year. That's nothing  compared to all of the other things we may be trying to do about energy. Just to run by another one  this is a plan to brighten the reflectance of ocean clouds  by atomizing seawater  that would brighten the albedo of the whole planet. A nice one  because it can happen lots of little ways in lots of little places  is by copying the ancient Amazon Indians who made good agricultural soil by pyrolizing  smoldering  plant waste  and biochar fixes large quantities of carbon while it's improving the soil. So here is where we are. Nobel Prize winning climatologist Paul Crutzen calls our geological era the Anthropocene  the human dominated era. We are stuck with its obligations. In the Whole Earth Catalog  my first words were   We are as Gods  and might as well get good at it.  The first words of Whole Earth Discipline are   We are as Gods  and have to get good at it.  Thank you. I have a studio in Berlin    let me cue on here    which is down there in this snow  just last weekend. In the studio we do a lot of experiments. I would consider the studio more like a laboratory. I have occasional meetings with scientists. And I have an academy  a part of the University of Fine Arts in Berlin. We have an annual gathering of people  and that is called Life in Space. Life in Space is really not necessarily about how we do things  but why we do things. Do you mind looking  with me  at that little cross in the center there  So just keep looking. Don't mind me. So you will have a yellow circle  and we will do an after image experiment. When the circle goes away you will have another color  the complementary color. I am saying something. And your eyes and your brain are saying something back. This whole idea of sharing  the idea of constituting reality by overlapping what I say and what you say    think of a movie. Since two years now  with some stipends from the science ministry in Berlin  I've been working on these films where we produce the film together. I don't necessarily think the film is so interesting. Obviously this is not interesting at all in the sense of the narrative. But nevertheless  what the potential is    and just keep looking there    what the potential is  obviously  is to kind of move the border of who is the author  and who is the receiver. Who is the consumer  if you want  and who has responsibility for what one sees  I think there is a socializing dimension in  kind of  moving that border. Who decides what reality is  This is the Tate Modern in London. The show was  in a sense  about that. It was about a space in which I put half a semi circular yellow disk. I also put a mirror in the ceiling  and some fog  some haze. And my idea was to make the space tangible. With such a big space  the problem is obviously that there is a discrepancy between what your body can embrace  and what the space  in that sense  is. So here I had the hope that by inserting some natural elements  if you want    some fog    I could make the space tangible. And what happens is that people  they start to see themselves in this space. So look at this. Look at the girl. Of course they have to look through a bloody camera in a museum. Right  That's how museums are working today. But look at her face there  as she's checking out  looking at herself in the mirror.  Oh  That was my foot there   She wasn't really sure whether she was seeing herself or not. And in that whole idea  how do we configure the relationship between our body and the space  How do we reconfigure it  How do we know that being in a space makes a difference  Do you see when I said in the beginning  it's about why  rather than how  The why meant really   What consequences does it have when I take a step    What does it matter    Does it matter if I am in the world or not    And does it matter whether the kind of actions I take filter into a sense of responsibility   Is art about that  I would say yes. It is obviously about not just about decorating the world  and making it look even better  or even worse  if you ask me. It's obviously also about taking responsibility  like I did here when throwing some green dye in the river in L.A.  Stockholm  Norway and Tokyo  among other places. The green dye is not environmentally dangerous  but it obviously looks really rather frightening. And it's on the other side also  I think  quite beautiful  as it somehow shows the turbulence in these kind of downtown areas  in these different places of the world. The  Green river   as a kind of activist idea  not a part of an exhibition  it was really about showing people  in this city  as they walk by  that space has dimensions. A space has time. And the water flows through the city with time. The water has an ability to make the city negotiable  tangible. Negotiable meaning that it makes a difference whether you do something or not. It makes a difference whether you say   I'm a part of this city. And if I vote it makes a difference. If I take a stand  it makes a difference.  This whole idea of a city not being a picture is  I think  something that art  in a sense  always was working with. The idea that art can actually evaluate the relationship between what it means to be in a picture  and what it means to be in a space. What is the difference  The difference between thinking and doing. So these are different experiments with that. I won't go into them. Iceland  lower right corner  my favorite place. These kinds of experiments  they filter into architectural models. These are ongoing experiments. One is an experiment I did for BMW  an attempt to make a car. It's made out of ice. A crystalline stackable principle in the center on the top  which I am trying to turn into a concert hall in Iceland. A sort of a run track  or a walk track  on the top of a museum in Denmark  which is made of colored glass  going all around. So the movement with your legs will change the color of your horizon. And two summers ago at the Hyde Park in London  with the Serpentine Gallery  a kind of a temporal pavilion where moving was the only way you could see the pavilion. This summer  in New York  there is one thing about falling water which is very much about the time it takes for water to fall. It's quite simple and fundamental. I've walked a lot in the mountains in Iceland. And as you come to a new valley  as you come to a new landscape  you have a certain view. If you stand still  the landscape doesn't necessarily tell you how big it is. It doesn't really tell you what you're looking at. The moment you start to move  the mountain starts to move. The big mountains far away  they move less. The small mountains in the foreground  they move more. And if you stop again  you wonder   Is that a one hour valley  Or is that a three hour hike  or is that a whole day I'm looking at   If you have a waterfall in there  right out there at the horizon  you look at the waterfall and you go   Oh  the water is falling really slowly.  And you go   My god it's really far away and it's a giant waterfall.  If a waterfall is falling faster  it's a smaller waterfall which is closer by    because the speed of falling water is pretty constant everywhere. And your body somehow knows that. So this means a waterfall is a way of measuring space. Of course being an iconic city like New York  that has had an interest in somehow playing around with the sense of space  you could say that New York wants to seem as big as possible. Adding a measurement to that is interesting  the falling water suddenly gives you a sense of   Oh  Brooklyn is exactly this much    the distance between Brooklyn and Manhattan  in this case the lower East River is this big.  So it was not just necessarily about putting nature into the cities. It was also about giving the city a sense of dimension. And why would we want to do that  Because I think it makes a difference whether you have a body that feels a part of a space  rather than having a body which is just in front of a picture. And  Ha ha  there is a picture and here is I. And what does it matter   Is there a sense of consequences  So if I have a sense of the space  if I feel that the space is tangible  if I feel there is time  if there is a dimension I could call time  I also feel that I can change the space. And suddenly it makes a difference in terms of making space accessible. One could say this is about community  collectivity. It's about being together. How do we create public space  What does the word  public  mean today anyway  So  asked in that way  I think it raises great things about parliamentary ideas  democracy  public space  being together  being individual. How do we create an idea which is both tolerant to individuality  and also to collectivity  without polarizing the two into two different opposites  Of course the political agendas in the world has been very obsessed  polarizing the two against each other into different  very normative ideas. I would claim that art and culture  and this is why art and culture are so incredibly interesting in the times we're living in now  have proven that one can create a kind of a space which is both sensitive to individuality and to collectivity. It's very much about this causality  consequences. It's very much about the way we link thinking and doing. So what is between thinking and doing  And right in between thinking and doing  I would say  there is experience. And experience is not just a kind of entertainment in a non casual way. Experience is about responsibility. Having an experience is taking part in the world. Taking part in the world is really about sharing responsibility. So art  in that sense  I think holds an incredible relevance in the world in which we're moving into  particularly right now. That's all I have. Thank you very much. So I am a pediatric cancer doctor and stem cell researcher at Stanford University where my clinical focus has been bone marrow transplantation. Now  inspired by Jill Bolte Taylor last year  I didn't bring a human brain  but I did bring a liter of bone marrow. And bone marrow is actually what we use to save the lives of tens of thousands of patients  most of whom have advanced malignancies like leukemia and lymphoma and some other diseases. So  a few years ago  I'm doing my transplant fellowship at Stanford. I'm in the operating room. We have Bob here  who is a volunteer donor. We're sending his marrow across the country to save the life of a child with leukemia. So actually how do we harvest this bone marrow  Well we have a whole O.R. team  general anesthesia  nurses  and another doctor across from me. Bob's on the table  and we take this sort of small needle  you know  not too big. And the way we do this is we basically place this through the soft tissue  and kind of punch it into the hard bone  into the tuchus    that's a technical term    and aspirate about    mls of bone marrow out  each time  with a syringe. And hand it off to the nurse. She squirts it into a tin. Hands it back to me. And we do that again and again. About     times usually. And by the end of this my arm is sore  I've got a callus on my hand  let alone Bob  whose rear end looks something more like this  like Swiss cheese. So I'm thinking  you know  this procedure hasn't changed in about    years. And there is probably a better way to do this. So I thought of a minimally invasive approach  and a new device that we call the Marrow Miner. This is it. And the Marrow Miner  the way it works is shown here. Our standard see through patient. Instead of entering the bone dozens of times  we enter just once  into the front of the hip or the back of the hip. And we have a flexible  powered catheter with a special wire loop tip that stays inside the crunchy part of the marrow and follows the contours of the hip  as it moves around. So it enables you to very rapidly aspirate  or suck out  rich bone marrow very quickly through one hole. We can do multiple passes through that same entry. No robots required. And  so  very quickly  Bob can just get one puncture  local anesthesia  and do this harvest as an outpatient. So I did a few prototypes. I got a small little grant at Stanford. And played around with this a little bit. And our team members developed this technology. And eventually we got two large animals  and pig studies. And we found  to our surprise  that we not only got bone marrow out  but we got    times the stem cell activity in the marrow from the Marrow Miner  compared to the normal device. This device was just FDA approved in the last year. Here is a live patient. You can see it following the flexible curves around. There will be two passes here  in the same patient  from the same hole. This was done under local anesthesia  as an outpatient. And we got  again  about three to six times more stem cells than the standard approach done on the same patient. So why should you care  Bone marrow is a very rich source of adult stem cells. You all know about embryonic stem cells. They've got great potential but haven't yet entered clinical trials. Adult stem cells are throughout our body  including the blood forming stem cells in our bone marrow  which we've been using as a form of stem cell therapy for over    years. In the last decade there's been an explosion of use of bone marrow stem cells to treat the patient's other diseases such as heart disease  vascular disease  orthopedics  tissue engineering  even in neurology to treat Parkinson's and diabetes. We've just come out  we're commercializing  this year  generation  .  of the Marrow Miner. The hope is that this gets more stem cells out  which translates to better outcomes. It may encourage more people to sign up to be potential live saving bone marrow donors. It may even enable you to bank your own marrow stem cells  when you're younger and healthier  to use in the future should you need it. And ultimately    and here's a picture of our bone marrow transplant survivors  who come together for a reunion each year at Stanford. Hopefully this technology will let us have more of these survivors in the future. Thanks. I'm a neuroscientist  a professor at the University of California. And over the past    years  I've studied behavior on the basis of everything from genes through neurotransmitters  dopamine  things like that  all the way through circuit analysis. So that's what I normally do. But then  for some reason  I got into something else  just recently. And it all grew out of one of my colleagues asking me to analyze a bunch of brains of psychopathic killers. And so this would be the typical talk I would give. And the question is   How do you end up with a psychopathic killer   What I mean by psychopathic killer are these people  these types of people. And so some of the brains that I've studied are people you know about. When I get the brains I don't know what I'm looking at. It's blind experiments. They also gave me normal people and everything. So I've looked at about    of these. And what came up was a number of pieces of data. So we look at these sorts of things theoretically  on the basis of genetics  and brain damage  and interaction with environment  and exactly how that machine works. So we're interested in exactly where in the brain  and what's the most important part of the brain. So we've been looking at this  the interaction of genes  what's called epigenetic effects  brain damage  and environment  and how these are tied together. And how you end up with a psychopath  and a killer  depends on exactly when the damage occurs. It's really a very precisely timed thing. You get different kinds of psychopaths. So we're going along with this. And here's  just to give you the pattern. The pattern is that those people  every one of them I looked at  who was a murderer  and was a serial killer  had damage to their orbital cortex  which is right above the eyes  the orbits  and also the interior part of the temporal lobe. So there is the pattern that every one of them had  but they all were a little different too. They had other sorts of brain damage. A key thing is that the major violence genes  it's called the MAO A gene. And there is a variant of this gene that is in the normal population. Some of you have this. And it's sex linked. It's on the X chromosome. And so in this way you can only get it from your mother. And in fact this is probably why mostly men  boys  are psychopathic killers  or are very aggressive. Because a daughter can get one X from the father  one X from the mother  it's kind of diluted out. But for a son  he can only get the X chromosome from his mother. So this is how it's passed from mother to son. And it has to do with too much brain serotonin during development  which is kind of interesting because serotonin is supposed to make you calm and relaxed. But if you have this gene  in utero your brain is bathed in this  so your whole brain becomes insensitive to serotonin  so it doesn't work later on in life. And I'd given this one talk in Israel  just this past year. And it does have some consequences. Theoretically what this means is that in order to express this gene  in a violent way  very early on  before puberty  you have to be involved in something that is really traumatic    not a little stress  not being spanked or something  but really seeing violence  or being involved in it  in  D. Right  That's how the mirror neuron system works. And so  if you have that gene  and you see a lot of violence in a certain situation  this is the recipe for disaster  absolute disaster. And what I think might happen in these areas of the world  where we have constant violence  you end up having generations of kids that are seeing all this violence. And if I was a young girl  somewhere in a violent area  you know  a    year old  and I want to find a mate  I'd find some tough guy  right  to protect me. Well what the problem is this tends to concentrate these genes. And now the boys and the girls get them. So I think after several generations  and here is the idea  we really have a tinderbox. So that was the idea. But then my mother said to me   I hear you've been going around talking about psychopathic killers. And you're talking as if you come from a normal family.  I said   What the hell are you talking about   She then told me about our own family tree. Now she blamed this on my father's side  of course. This was one of these cases  because she has no violence in her background  but my father did. Well she said   There is good news and bad news. One of your cousins is Ezra Cornell  founder of Cornell university. But the bad news is that your cousin is also Lizzie Borden. Now I said   Okay  so what  We have Lizzie.  She goes   No it gets worse  read this book.  And here is this  Killed Strangely   and it's this historical book. And the first murder of a mother by a son was my great great great great great great grandfather. Okay  so that's the first case of matricide. And that book is very interesting. Because it's about witch trials  and how people thought back then. But it doesn't stop there. There were seven more men  on my father's side  starting then  Cornells  that were all murderers. Okay  now this gives one a little pause. Because my father himself  and my three uncles  in World War II  were all conscientious objectors  all pussycats. But every once in a while  like Lizzie Borden  like three times a century  and we're kind of due. So the moral of the story is  people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones. But more likely is this. And we had to take action. Now our kids found out about it. And they all seemed to be OK. But our grandkids are going to be kind of concerned here. So what we've done is I've started to do PET scans of everybody in the family. We started to do PET scans  EEGs and genetic analysis to see where the bad news is. Now the only person    it turns out one son and one daughter  siblings  didn't get along and their patterns are exactly the same. They have the same brain  and the same EEG. And now they are close as can be. But there's gonna be bad news somewhere. And we don't know where it's going to pop up. So that's my talk. Interestingly  Charles Darwin was born a very lightly pigmented man  in a moderately to darkly pigmented world. Over the course of his life  Darwin had great privilege. He lived in a fairly wealthy home. He was raised by very supportive and interested parents. And when he was in his   s he embarked upon a remarkable voyage  on the ship the Beagle. And during the course of that voyage  he saw remarkable things  tremendous diversity of plants and animals  and humans. And the observations that he made on that epic journey were to be eventually distilled into his wonderful book   On the Origin of Species   published     years ago. Now what is so interesting and to some  the extent  what's a bit infamous about  The Origin of Species   is that there is only one line in it about human evolution.  Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history.  It wasn't until much longer  much later  that Darwin actually spoke and wrote about humans. Now in his years of traveling on the Beagle  and from listening to the accounts or explorers and naturalists  he knew that skin color was one of the most important ways in which people varied. And he was somewhat interested in the pattern of skin color. He knew that darkly pigmented peoples were found close to the equator  lightly pigmented peoples  like himself  were found closer to the poles. So what did he make of all this  Well he didn't write anything about it in The Origin of Species. But much later  in       he did have something to say about it. And it was quite curious. He said   Of all the differences between the races of men  the color of the skin is the most conspicuous and one of the best marked.  And he went on to say   These differences do not coincide with corresponding differences in climate.  So he had traveled all around. He had seen people of different colors living in different places. And yet he rejected the idea that human skin pigmentation was related to the climate. If only Darwin lived today. If only Darwin had NASA. Now  one of the wonderful things that NASA does is it puts up a variety of satellites that detect all sort of interesting things about our environment. And for many decades now there have been a series of TOMS satellites that have collected data about the radiation of the Earth's surface. The TOMS   satellite data  shown here  show the annual average ultraviolet radiation at the Earth's surface. Now the really hot pink and red areas are those parts of the world that receive the highest amounts of UV during the year. The incrementally cooler colors    blues  greens  yellows  and finally grays    indicate areas of much lower ultraviolet radiation. What's significant to the story of human skin pigmentation is just how much of the Northern Hemisphere is in these cool gray zones. This has tremendous implications for our understanding of the evolution of human skin pigmentation. And what Darwin could not appreciate  or didn't perhaps want to appreciate at the time  is that there was a fundamental relationship between the intensity of ultraviolet radiation and skin pigmentation. And that skin pigmentation itself was a product of evolution. And so when we look at a map of skin color  and predicted skin color  as we know it today  what we see is a beautiful gradient from the darkest skin pigmentations toward the equator  and the lightest ones toward the poles. What's very  very important here is that the earliest humans evolved in high UV environments  in equatorial Africa. The earliest members of our lineage  the genus Homo  were darkly pigmented. And we all share this incredible heritage of having originally been darkly pigmented  two million to one and half million years ago. Now what happened in our history  Let's first look at the relationship of ultraviolet radiation to the Earth's surface. In those early days of our evolution  looking at the equator  we were bombarded by high levels of ultraviolet radiation. The UVC  the most energetic type  was occluded by the Earth's atmosphere. But UVB and UVA especially  came in unimpeded. UVB turns out to be incredibly important. It's very destructive  but it also catalyzes the production of vitamin D in the skin  vitamin D being a molecule that we very much need for our strong bones  the health of our immune system  and myriad other important functions in our bodies. So  living at the equator  we got lots and lots of ultraviolet radiation and the melanin    this wonderful  complex  ancient polymer compound in our skin    served as a superb natural sunscreen. This polymer is amazing because it's present in so many different organisms. Melanin  in various forms  has probably been on the Earth a billion years  and has been recruited over and over again by evolution  as often happens. Why change it if it works  So melanin was recruited  in our lineage  and specifically in our earliest ancestors evolving in Africa  to be a natural sunscreen. Where it protected the body against the degradations of ultraviolet radiation  the destruction  or damage to DNA  and the breakdown of a very important molecule called folate  which helps to fuel cell production  and reproduction in the body. So  it's wonderful. We evolved this very protective  wonderful covering of melanin. But then we moved. And humans dispersed    not once  but twice. Major moves  outside of our equatorial homeland  from Africa into other parts of the Old World  and most recently  into the New World. When humans dispersed into these latitudes  what did they face  Conditions were significantly colder  but they were also less intense with respect to the ultraviolet regime. So if we're somewhere in the Northern Hemisphere  look at what's happening to the ultraviolet radiation. We're still getting a dose of UVA. But all of the UVB  or nearly all of it  is dissipated through the thickness of the atmosphere. In the winter  when you are skiing in the Alps  you may experience ultraviolet radiation. But it's all UVA  and  significantly  that UVA has no ability to make vitamin D in your skin. So people inhabiting northern hemispheric environments were bereft of the potential to make vitamin D in their skin for most of the year. This had tremendous consequences for the evolution of human skin pigmentation. Because what happened  in order to ensure health and well being  these lineages of people dispersing into the Northern Hemisphere lost their pigmentation. There was natural selection for the evolution of lightly pigmented skin. Here we begin to see the evolution of the beautiful sepia rainbow that now characterizes all of humanity. Lightly pigmented skin evolved not just once  not just twice  but probably three times. Not just in modern humans  but in one of our distant unrelated ancestors  the Neanderthals. A remarkable  remarkable testament to the power of evolution. Humans have been on the move for a long time. And just in the last       years  in increasing rates  over increasing distances. Here are just some of the biggest movements of people  voluntary movements  in the last       years. Look at some of the major latitudinal transgressions  people from high UV areas going to low UV and vice versa. And not all these moves were voluntary. Between      and          million      people were moved from high UV to low UV areas in the transatlantic slave trade. Now this had all sorts of invidious social consequences. But it also had deleterious health consequences to people. So what  We've been on the move. We're so clever we can overcome all of these seeming biological impediments. Well  often we're unaware of the fact that we're living in environments in which our skin is inherently poorly adapted. Some of us with lightly pigmented skin live in high UV areas. Some of us with darkly pigmented skin live in low UV areas. These have tremendous consequences for our health. We have to  if we're lightly pigmented  be careful about the problems of skin cancer  and destruction of folate in our bodies  by lots of sun. Epidemiologists and doctors have been very good about telling us about protecting our skin. What they haven't been so good about instructing people is the problem of darkly pigmented people living in high latitude areas  or working inside all the time. Because the problem there is just as severe  but it is more sinister  because vitamin D deficiency  from a lack of ultraviolet B radiation  is a major problem. Vitamin D deficiency creeps up on people  and causes all sorts of health problems to their bones  to their gradual decay of their immune systems  or loss of immune function  and probably some problems with their mood and health  their mental health. So we have  in skin pigmentation  one of these wonderful products of evolution that still has consequences for us today. And the social consequences  as we know  are incredibly profound. We live in a world where we have lightly and darkly pigmented people living next to one another  but often brought into proximity initially as a result of very invidious social interactions. So how can we overcome this  How can we begin to understand it  Evolution helps us.     years after Darwin's birthday  we have the first moderately pigmented President of the United States. How wonderful is that  This man is significant for a whole host of reasons. But we need to think about how he compares  in terms of his pigmentation  to other people on Earth. He  as one of many urban admixed populations  is very emblematic of a mixed parentage  of a mixed pigmentation. And he resembles  very closely  people with moderate levels of pigmentation who live in southern Africa  or Southeast Asia. These people have a tremendous potential to tan  to develop more pigment in their skin  as a result of exposure to sun. They also run the risk of vitamin D deficiency  if they have desk jobs  like that guy. So lets all wish for his great health  and his awareness of his own skin pigmentation. Now what is wonderful about the evolution of human skin pigmentation  and the phenomenon of pigmentation  is that it is the demonstration  the evidence  of evolution by natural selection  right on your body. When people ask you   What is the evidence for evolution   You don't have to think about some exotic examples  or fossils. You just have to look at your skin. Darwin  I think  would have appreciated this  even though he eschewed the importance of climate on the evolution of pigmentation during his own life. I think  were he able to look at the evidence we have today  he would understand it. He would appreciate it. And most of all  he would teach it. You  you can teach it. You can touch it. You can understand it. Take it out of this room. Take your skin color  and celebrate it. Spread the word. You have the evolution of the history of our species  part of it  written in your skin. Understand it. Appreciate it. Celebrate it. Go out. Isn't it beautiful  Isn't it wonderful  You are the products of evolution. Thank you. Can I say how delighted I am to be away from the calm of Westminster and Whitehall   Laughter  This is Kim  a nine year old Vietnam girl  her back ruined by napalm  and she awakened the conscience of the nation of America to begin to end the Vietnam War. This is Birhan  who was the Ethiopian girl who launched Live Aid in the     s     minutes away from death when she was rescued  and that picture of her being rescued is one that went round the world. This is Tiananmen Square. A man before a tank became a picture that became a symbol for the whole world of resistance. This next is the Sudanese girl  a few moments from death  a vulture hovering in the background  a picture that went round the world and shocked people into action on poverty. This is Neda  the Iranian girl who was shot while at a demonstration with her father in Iran only a few weeks ago  and she is now the focus  rightly so  of the YouTube generation. And what do all these pictures and events have in common  What they have in common is what we see unlocks what we cannot see. What we see unlocks the invisible ties and bonds of sympathy that bring us together to become a human community. What these pictures demonstrate is that we do feel the pain of others  however distantly. What I think these pictures demonstrate is that we do believe in something bigger than ourselves. What these pictures demonstrate is that there is a moral sense across all religions  across all faiths  across all continents    a moral sense that not only do we share the pain of others  and believe in something bigger than ourselves but we have a duty to act when we see things that are wrong that need righted  see injuries that need to be corrected  see problems that need to be rectified. There is a story about Olof Palme  the Swedish Prime Minister  going to see Ronald Reagan in America in the     s. Before he arrived Ronald Reagan said    and he was the Swedish Social Democratic Prime Minister     Isn t this man a communist   The reply was   No  Mr President  he s an anti communist.  And Ronald Reagan said   I don t care what kind of communist he is   Ronald Reagan asked Olof Palme  the Social Democratic Prime Minister of Sweden   Well  what do you believe in  Do you want to abolish the rich   He said   No  I want to abolish the poor.  Our responsibility is to let everyone have the chance to realize their potential to the full. I believe there is a moral sense and a global ethic that commands attention from people of every religion and every faith  and people of no faith. But I think what's new is that we now have the capacity to communicate instantaneously across frontiers right across the world. We now have the capacity to find common ground with people who we will never meet  but who we will meet through the Internet and through all the modern means of communication  that we now have the capacity to organize and take collective action together to deal with the problem or an injustice that we want to deal with  and I believe that this makes this a unique age in human history  and it is the start of what I would call the creation of a truly global society. Go back     years when the slave trade was under pressure from William Wilberforce and all the protesters. They protested across Britain. They won public opinion over a long period of time. But it took    years for the campaign to be successful. What could they have done with the pictures that they could have shown if they were able to use the modern means of communication to win people s hearts and minds  Or if you take Eglantyne Jebb  the woman who created Save the Children    years ago. She was so appalled by what was happening in Austria as a result of the First World War and what was happening to children who were part of the defeated families of Austria  that in Britain she wanted to take action  but she had to go house to house  leaflet to leaflet  to get people to attend a rally in the Royal Albert Hall that eventually gave birth to Save the Children  an international organization that is now fully recognized as one of the great institutions in our land and in the world. But what more could she have done if she d had the modern means of communications available to her to create a sense that the injustice that people saw had to be acted upon immediately  Now look at what s happened in the last    years. In Philippines in       President Estrada    a million people texted each other about the corruption of that regime  eventually brought it down and it was  of course  called the  coup de text.   Laughter  Then you have in Zimbabwe the first election under Robert Mugabe a year ago. Because people were able to take mobile phone photographs of what was happening at the polling stations  it was impossible for that Premier to fix that election in the way that he wanted to do. Or take Burma and the monks that were blogging out  a country that nobody knew anything about that was happening  until these blogs told the world that there was a repression  meaning that lives were being lost and people were being persecuted and Aung San Suu Kyi  who is one of the great prisoners of conscience of the world  had to be listened to. Then take Iran itself  and what people are doing today  following what happened to Neda  people who are preventing the security services of Iran finding those people who are blogging out of Iran  any by everybody who is blogging  changing their address to Tehran  Iran  and making it difficult for the security services. Take  therefore  what modern technology is capable of  the power of our moral sense allied to the power of communications and our ability to organize internationally. That  in my view  gives us the first opportunity as a community to fundamentally change the world. Foreign policy can never be the same again. It cannot be run by elites  it s got to be run by listening to the public opinions of peoples who are blogging  who are communicating with each other around the world.     years ago the problem we had to solve was slavery.     years ago I suppose the main problem in a country like ours was how young people  children  had the right to education.     years ago in most countries in Europe  the pressure was for the right to vote.    years ago the pressure was for the right to social security and welfare. In the last       years we have seen fascism  anti Semitism  racism  apartheid  discrimination on the basis of sex and gender and sexuality  all these have come under pressure because of the campaigns that have been run by people to change the world. I was with Nelson Mandela a year ago  when he was in London. I was at a concert that he was attending to mark his birthday and for the creation of new resources for his foundation. I was sitting next to Nelson Mandela    I was very privileged to do so    when Amy Winehouse came onto the stage.  Laughter  And Nelson Mandela was quite surprised at the appearance of the singer and I was explaining to him at the time who she was. Amy Winehouse said   Nelson Mandela and I have a lot in common. My husband too has spent a long time in prison.  Nelson Mandela then went down to the stage and he summarized the challenge for us all. He said in his lifetime he had climbed a great mountain  the mountain of challenging and then defeating racial oppression and defeating apartheid. He said that there was a greater challenge ahead  the challenge of poverty  of climate change    global challenges that needed global solutions and needed the creation of a truly global society. We are the first generation which is in a position to do this. Combine the power of a global ethic with the power of our ability to communicate and organize globally  with the challenges that we now face  most of which are global in their nature. Climate change cannot be solved in one country  but has got to be solved by the world working together. A financial crisis  just as we have seen  could not be solved by America alone or Europe alone  it needed the world to work together. Take the problems of security and terrorism and  equally  the problem of human rights and development  they cannot be solved by Africa alone  they cannot be solved by America or Europe alone. We cannot solve these problems unless we work together. So the great project of our generation  it seems to me  is to build for the first time  out of a global ethic and our global ability to communicate and organize together  a truly global society  built on that ethic but with institutions that can serve that global society and make for a different future. We have now  and are the first generation with  the power to do this. Take climate change. Is it not absolutely scandalous that we have a situation where we know that there is a climate change problem  where we know also that that will mean we have to give more resources to the poorest countries to deal with that  when we want to create a global carbon market  but there is no global institution that people have been able to agree upon to deal with this problem  One of the things that has got to come out of Copenhagen in the next few months is an agreement that there will be a global environmental institution that is able to deal with the problems of persuading the whole of the world to move along a climate change agenda. One of the reasons why an institution is not in itself enough is that we have got to persuade people around the world to change their behavior as well  so you need that global ethic of fairness and responsibility across the generations. Take the financial crisis. If people in poorer countries can be hit by a crisis that starts in New York or starts in the sub prime market of the United States of America. If people can find that that sub prime product has been transferred across nations many  many times until it ends up in banks in Iceland or the rest in Britain  and people's ordinary savings are affected by it  then you cannot rely on a system of national supervision. You need in the long run for stability  for economic growth  for jobs  as well as for financial stability  global economic institutions that make sure that growth to be sustained has to be shared  and are built on the principle that the prosperity of this world is indivisible. So another challenge for our generation is to create global institutions that reflect our ideas of fairness and responsibility  not the ideas that were the basis of the last stage of financial development over these recent years. Then take development and take the partnership we need between our countries and the rest of the world  the poorest part of the world. We do not have the basis of a proper partnership for the future  and yet  out of people s desire for a global ethic and a global society that can be done. I have just been talking to the President of Sierra Leone. This is a country of six and a half million people  but it has only    doctors  it has     nurses  it has     midwives. You cannot begin to build a healthcare system for six million people with such limited resources. Or take the girl I met when I was in Tanzania  a girl called Miriam. She was    years old  her parents had both died from AIDS  her mother and then her father. She was an AIDS orphan being handed across different extended families to be cared for. She herself was suffering from HIV  she was suffering from tuberculosis. I met her in a field  she was ragged  she had no shoes. When you looked in her eyes  any girl at the age of eleven is looking forward to the future  but there was an unreachable sadness in that girl s eyes and if I could have translated that to the rest of the world for that moment  I believe that all the work that it had done for the global HIV AIDS fund would be rewarded by people being prepared to make donations. We must then build a proper relationship between the richest and the poorest countries based on our desire that they are able to fend for themselves with the investment that is necessary in their agriculture  so that Africa is not a net importer of food  but an exporter of food. Take the problems of human rights and the problems of security in so many countries around the world. Burma is in chains  Zimbabwe is a human tragedy  in Sudan thousands of people have died unnecessarily for wars that we could prevent. In the Rwanda Children's Museum  there is a photograph of a    year old boy and the Children's Museum is commemorating the lives that were lost in the Rwandan genocide where a million people died. There is a photograph of a boy called David. Beside that photograph there is the information about his life. It said  David  age   .  David  ambition to be a doctor. Favorite sport  football. What did he enjoy most  Making people laugh. How did he die  Tortured to death. Last words said to his mother who was also tortured to death   Don't worry. The United Nations are coming.  And we never did. And that young boy believed our promises that we would help people in difficulty in Rwanda  and we never did. So we have got to create in this world also institutions for peacekeeping and humanitarian aid  but also for reconstruction and security for some of the conflict ridden states of the world. So my argument today is basically this. We have the means by which we could create a truly global society. The institutions of this global society can be created by our endeavors. That global ethic can infuse the fairness and responsibility that is necessary for these institutions to work  but we should not lose the chance in this generation  in this decade in particular  with President Obama in America  with other people working with us around the world  to create global institutions for the environment  and for finance  and for security and for development  that make sense of our responsibility to other peoples  our desire to bind the world together  and our need to tackle problems that everybody knows exist. It is said that in Ancient Rome that when Cicero spoke to his audiences  people used to turn to each other and say about Cicero   Great speech.  But it is said that in Ancient Greece when Demosthenes spoke to his audiences  people turned to each other and didn t say  Great speech.  They said   Let's march.  We should be marching towards a global society. Thank you. For me they normally happen  these career crises  often  actually  on a Sunday evening  just as the sun is starting to set  and the gap between my hopes for myself and the reality of my life starts to diverge so painfully that I normally end up weeping into a pillow. I'm mentioning all this    I'm mentioning all this because I think this is not merely a personal problem  you may think I'm wrong in this  but I think we live in an age when our lives are regularly punctuated by career crises  by moments when what we thought we knew    about our lives  about our careers    comes into contact with a threatening sort of reality. It's perhaps easier now than ever before to make a good living. It's perhaps harder than ever before to stay calm  to be free of career anxiety. I want to look now  if I may  at some of the reasons why we might be feeling anxiety about our careers. Why we might be victims of these career crises  as we're weeping softly into our pillows. One of the reasons why we might be suffering is that we are surrounded by snobs. In a way  I've got some bad news  particularly to anybody who's come to Oxford from abroad. There's a real problem with snobbery  because sometimes people from outside the U.K. imagine that snobbery is a distinctively U.K. phenomenon  fixated on country houses and titles. The bad news is that's not true. Snobbery is a global phenomenon  we are a global organization  this is a global phenomenon. What is a snob  A snob is anybody who takes a small part of you  and uses that to come to a complete vision of who you are. That is snobbery. The dominant kind of snobbery that exists nowadays is job snobbery. You encounter it within minutes at a party  when you get asked that famous iconic question of the early   st century   What do you do   According to how you answer that question  people are either incredibly delighted to see you  or look at their watch and make their excuses. Now  the opposite of a snob is your mother. Not necessarily your mother  or indeed mine  but  as it were  the ideal mother  somebody who doesn't care about your achievements. Unfortunately  most people are not our mothers. Most people make a strict correlation between how much time  and if you like  love    not romantic love  though that may be something    but love in general  respect    they are willing to accord us  that will be strictly defined by our position in the social hierarchy. And that's a lot of the reason why we care so much about our careers and indeed start caring so much about material goods. You know  we're often told that we live in very materialistic times  that we're all greedy people. I don't think we are particularly materialistic. I think we live in a society which has simply pegged certain emotional rewards to the acquisition of material goods. It's not the material goods we want  it's the rewards we want. It's a new way of looking at luxury goods. The next time you see somebody driving a Ferrari  don't think   This is somebody who's greedy.  Think   This is somebody who is incredibly vulnerable and in need of love.  Feel sympathy  rather than contempt. There are other reasons    There are other reasons why it's perhaps harder now to feel calm than ever before. One of these  and it's paradoxical  because it's linked to something that's rather nice  is the hope we all have for our careers. Never before have expectations been so high about what human beings can achieve with their lifespan. We're told  from many sources  that anyone can achieve anything. We've done away with the caste system  we are now in a system where anyone can rise to any position they please. And it's a beautiful idea. Along with that is a kind of spirit of equality  we're all basically equal. There are no strictly defined hierarchies. There is one really big problem with this  and that problem is envy. Envy  it's a real taboo to mention envy  but if there's one dominant emotion in modern society  that is envy. And it's linked to the spirit of equality. Let me explain. I think it would be very unusual for anyone here  or anyone watching  to be envious of the Queen of England. Even though she is much richer than any of you are  and she's got a very large house  the reason why we don't envy her is because she's too weird. She's simply too strange. We can't relate to her  she speaks in a funny way  she comes from an odd place. So we can't relate to her  and when you can't relate to somebody  you don't envy them. The closer two people are    in age  in background  in the process of identification    the more there's a danger of envy  which is incidentally why none of you should ever go to a school reunion  because there is no stronger reference point than people one was at school with. The problem of modern society is it turns the whole world into a school. Everybody's wearing jeans  everybody's the same. And yet  they're not. So there's a spirit of equality combined with deep inequality  which can make for a very stressful situation. It's probably as unlikely that you would nowadays become as rich and famous as Bill Gates  as it was unlikely in the   th century that you would accede to the ranks of the French aristocracy. But the point is  it doesn't feel that way. It's made to feel  by magazines and other media outlets  that if you've got energy  a few bright ideas about technology  a garage    you  too  could start a major thing. The consequences of this problem make themselves felt in bookshops. When you go to a large bookshop and look at the self help sections  as I sometimes do    if you analyze self help books produced in the world today  there are basically two kinds. The first kind tells you   You can do it  You can make it  Anything's possible   The other kind tells you how to cope with what we politely call  low self esteem   or impolitely call   feeling very bad about yourself.  There's a real correlation between a society that tells people that they can do anything  and the existence of low self esteem. So that's another way in which something quite positive can have a nasty kickback. There is another reason why we might be feeling more anxious    about our careers  about our status in the world today  than ever before. And it's  again  linked to something nice. And that nice thing is called meritocracy. Everybody  all politicians on Left and Right  agree that meritocracy is a great thing  and we should all be trying to make our societies really  really meritocratic. In other words    what is a meritocratic society  A meritocratic society is one in which  if you've got talent and energy and skill  you will get to the top  nothing should hold you back. It's a beautiful idea. The problem is  if you really believe in a society where those who merit to get to the top  get to the top  you'll also  by implication  and in a far more nasty way  believe in a society where those who deserve to get to the bottom also get to the bottom and stay there. In other words  your position in life comes to seem not accidental  but merited and deserved. And that makes failure seem much more crushing. You know  in the Middle Ages  in England  when you met a very poor person  that person would be described as an  unfortunate     literally  somebody who had not been blessed by fortune  an unfortunate. Nowadays  particularly in the United States  if you meet someone at the bottom of society  they may unkindly be described as a  loser.  There's a real difference between an unfortunate and a loser  and that shows     years of evolution in society and our belief in who is responsible for our lives. It's no longer the gods  it's us. We're in the driving seat. That's exhilarating if you're doing well  and very crushing if you're not. It leads  in the worst cases    in the analysis of a sociologist like Emil Durkheim    it leads to increased rates of suicide. There are more suicides in developed  individualistic countries than in any other part of the world. And some of the reason for that is that people take what happens to them extremely personally    they own their success  but they also own their failure. Is there any relief from some of these pressures that I've been outlining  I think there is. I just want to turn to a few of them. Let's take meritocracy. This idea that everybody deserves to get where they get to  I think it's a crazy idea  completely crazy. I will support any politician of Left and Right  with any halfway decent meritocratic idea  I am a meritocrat in that sense. But I think it's insane to believe that we will ever make a society that is genuinely meritocratic  it's an impossible dream. The idea that we will make a society where literally everybody is graded  the good at the top  bad at the bottom  exactly done as it should be  is impossible. There are simply too many random factors  accidents  accidents of birth  accidents of things dropping on people's heads  illnesses  etc. We will never get to grade them  never get to grade people as they should. I'm drawn to a lovely quote by St. Augustine in  The City of God   where he says   It's a sin to judge any man by his post.  In modern English that would mean it's a sin to come to any view of who you should talk to  dependent on their business card. It's not the post that should count. According to St. Augustine  only God can really put everybody in their place  he's going to do that on the Day of Judgment  with angels and trumpets  and the skies will open. Insane idea  if you're a secularist person  like me. But something very valuable in that idea  nevertheless. In other words  hold your horses when you're coming to judge people. You don't necessarily know what someone's true value is. That is an unknown part of them  and we shouldn't behave as though it is known. There is another source of solace and comfort for all this. When we think about failing in life  when we think about failure  one of the reasons why we fear failing is not just a loss of income  a loss of status. What we fear is the judgment and ridicule of others. And it exists. The number one organ of ridicule  nowadays  is the newspaper. If you open the newspaper any day of the week  it's full of people who've messed up their lives. They've slept with the wrong person  taken the wrong substance  passed the wrong piece of legislation    whatever it is  and then are fit for ridicule. In other words  they have failed. And they are described as  losers.  Now  is there any alternative to this  I think the Western tradition shows us one glorious alternative  which is tragedy. Tragic art  as it developed in the theaters of ancient Greece  in the fifth century B.C.  was essentially an art form devoted to tracing how people fail  and also according them a level of sympathy  which ordinary life would not necessarily accord them. A few years ago  I was thinking about this  and I went to  The Sunday Sport   a tabloid newspaper I don't recommend you start reading if you're not familiar with it already. And I went to talk to them about certain of the great tragedies of Western art. I wanted to see how they would seize the bare bones of certain stories  if they came in as a news item at the news desk on a Saturday afternoon. I mentioned Othello  they'd not heard of it but were fascinated. I asked them to write a headline for the story. They came up with  Love Crazed Immigrant Kills Senator's Daughter.  Splashed across the headline. I gave them the plotline of Madame Bovary. Again  a book they were enchanted to discover. And they wrote  Shopaholic Adulteress Swallows Arsenic After Credit Fraud.  And then my favorite    they really do have a kind of genius of their own  these guys    my favorite is Sophocles' Oedipus the King   Sex With Mum Was Blinding.  In a way  if you like  at one end of the spectrum of sympathy  you've got the tabloid newspaper. At the other end of the spectrum  you've got tragedy and tragic art. And I suppose I'm arguing that we should learn a little bit about what's happening in tragic art. It would be insane to call Hamlet a loser. He is not a loser  though he has lost. And I think that is the message of tragedy to us  and why it's so very  very important  I think. The other thing about modern society and why it causes this anxiety  is that we have nothing at its center that is non human. We are the first society to be living in a world where we don't worship anything other than ourselves. We think very highly of ourselves  and so we should  we've put people on the Moon  done all sorts of extraordinary things. And so we tend to worship ourselves. Our heroes are human heroes. That's a very new situation. Most other societies have had  right at their center  the worship of something transcendent  a god  a spirit  a natural force  the universe  whatever it is    something else that is being worshiped. We've slightly lost the habit of doing that  which is  I think  why we're particularly drawn to nature. Not for the sake of our health  though it's often presented that way  but because it's an escape from the human anthill. It's an escape from our own competition  and our own dramas. And that's why we enjoy looking at glaciers and oceans  and contemplating the Earth from outside its perimeters  etc. We like to feel in contact with something that is non human  and that is so deeply important to us. What I think I've been talking about really is success and failure. And one of the interesting things about success is that we think we know what it means. If I said that there's somebody behind the screen who's very successful  certain ideas would immediately come to mind. You'd think that person might have made a lot of money  achieved renown in some field. My own theory of success    I'm somebody who's very interested in success  I really want to be successful  always thinking  how can I be more successful  But as I get older  I'm also very nuanced about what that word  success  might mean. Here's an insight that I've had about success  You can't be successful at everything. We hear a lot of talk about work life balance. Nonsense. You can't have it all. You can't. So any vision of success has to admit what it's losing out on  where the element of loss is. And I think any wise life will accept  as I say  that there is going to be an element where we're not succeeding. And the thing about a successful life is that a lot of the time  our ideas of what it would mean to live successfully are not our own. They're sucked in from other people  chiefly  if you're a man  your father  and if you're a woman  your mother. Psychoanalysis has been drumming home this message for about    years. No one's quite listening hard enough  but I very much believe it's true. And we also suck in messages from everything from the television  to advertising  to marketing  etc. These are hugely powerful forces that define what we want and how we view ourselves. When we're told that banking is a very respectable profession  a lot of us want to go into banking. When banking is no longer so respectable  we lose interest in banking. We are highly open to suggestion. So what I want to argue for is not that we should give up on our ideas of success  but we should make sure that they are our own. We should focus in on our ideas  and make sure that we own them  that we are truly the authors of our own ambitions. Because it's bad enough not getting what you want  but it's even worse to have an idea of what it is you want  and find out  at the end of the journey  that it isn't  in fact  what you wanted all along. So  I'm going to end it there. But what I really want to stress is  by all means  success  yes. But let's accept the strangeness of some of our ideas. Let's probe away at our notions of success. Let's make sure our ideas of success are truly our own. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  That was fascinating. But how do you reconcile this idea of it being bad to think of someone as a  loser   with the idea that a lot of people like  of seizing control of your life  and that a society that encourages that  perhaps has to have some winners and losers  Alain De Botton  Yes  I think it's merely the randomness of the winning and losing process that I want to stress  because the emphasis nowadays is so much on the justice of everything  and politicians always talk about justice. Now I'm a firm believer in justice  I just think that it's impossible. So we should do everything we can to pursue it  but we should always remember that whoever is facing us  whatever has happened in their lives  there will be a strong element of the haphazard. That's what I'm trying to leave room for  otherwise  it can get quite claustrophobic. CA  I mean  do you believe that you can combine your kind of kinder  gentler philosophy of work with a successful economy  Or do you think that you can't  but it doesn't matter that much that we're putting too much emphasis on that  AB  The nightmare thought is that frightening people is the best way to get work out of them  and that somehow the crueler the environment  the more people will rise to the challenge. You want to think  who would you like as your ideal dad  And your ideal dad is somebody who is tough but gentle. And it's a very hard line to make. We need fathers  as it were  the exemplary father figures in society  avoiding the two extremes  which is the authoritarian disciplinarian on the one hand  and on the other  the lax  no rules option. CA  Alain De Botton. AB  Thank you very much. Hello  My name is Golan Levin. I'm an artist and an engineer  which is  increasingly  a more common kind of hybrid. But I still fall into this weird crack where people don't seem to understand me. And I was looking around and I found this wonderful picture. It's a letter from  Artforum  in      saying  We can't imagine ever doing a special issue on electronics or computers in art.  And they still haven't. And lest you think that you all  as the digerati  are more enlightened  I went to the Apple iPhone app store the other day. Where's art  I got productivity. I got sports. And somehow the idea that one would want to make art for the iPhone  which my friends and I are doing now  is still not reflected in our understanding of what computers are for. So  from both directions  there is kind of  I think  a lack of understanding about what it could mean to be an artist who uses the materials of his own day  or her own day  which I think artists are obliged to do  is to really explore the expressive potential of the new tools that we have. In my own case  I'm an artist  and I'm really interested in expanding the vocabulary of human action  and basically empowering people through interactivity. I want people to discover themselves as actors  as creative actors  by having interactive experiences. A lot of my work is about trying to get away from this. This a photograph of the desktop of a student of mine. And when I say desktop  I don't just mean the actual desk where his mouse has worn away the surface of the desk. If you look carefully  you can even see a hint of the Apple menu  up here in the upper left  where the virtual world has literally punched through to the physical. So this is  as Joy Mountford once said   The mouse is probably the narrowest straw you could try to suck all of human expression through.  And the thing I'm really trying to do is enabling people to have more rich kinds of interactive experiences. How can we get away from the mouse and use our full bodies as a way of exploring aesthetic experiences  not necessarily utilitarian ones. So I write software. And that's how I do it. And a lot of my experiences resemble mirrors in some way. Because this is  in some sense  the first way  that people discover their own potential as actors  and discover their own agency. By saying  Who is that person in the mirror  Oh it's actually me.  And so  to give an example  this is a project from last year  which is called the Interstitial Fragment Processor. And it allows people to explore the negative shapes that they create when they're just going about their everyday business. So as people make shapes with their hands or their heads and so forth  or with each other  these shapes literally produce sounds and drop out of thin air    basically taking what's often this  kind of  unseen space  or this undetected space  and making it something real  that people then can appreciate and become creative with. So again  people discover their creative agency in this way. And their own personalities come out in totally unique ways. So in addition to using full body input  something that I've explored now  for a while  has been the use of the voice  which is an immensely expressive system for us  vocalizing. Song is one of our oldest ways of making ourselves heard and understood. And I came across this fantastic research by Wolfgang K hler  the so called father of gestalt psychology  from       who submitted to an audience like yourselves the following two shapes. And he said one of them is called Maluma. And one of them is called Taketa. Which is which  Anyone want to hazard a guess  Maluma is on top. Yeah. So. As he says here  most people answer without any hesitation. So what we're really seeing here is a phenomenon called phonaesthesia  which is a kind of synesthesia that all of you have. And so  whereas Dr. Oliver Sacks has talked about how perhaps one person in a million actually has true synesthesia  where they hear colors or taste shapes  and things like this  phonaesthesia is something we can all experience to some extent. It's about mappings between different perceptual domains  like hardness  sharpness  brightness and darkness  and the phonemes that we're able to speak with. So    years on  there's been some research where cognitive psychologists have actually sussed out the extent to which  you know  L  M and B are more associated with shapes that look like this  and P  T and K are perhaps more associated with shapes like this. And here we suddenly begin to have a mapping between curvature that we can exploit numerically  a relative mapping between curvature and shape. So it occurred to me  what happens if we could run these backwards  And thus was born the project called Remark  which is a collaboration with Zachary Lieberman and the Ars Electronica Futurelab. And this is an interactive installation which presents the fiction that speech casts visible shadows. So the idea is you step into a kind of a magic light. And as you do  you see the shadows of your own speech. And they sort of fly away  out of your head. If a computer speech recognition system is able to recognize what you're saying  then it spells it out. And if it isn't then it produces a shape which is very phonaesthetically tightly coupled to the sounds you made. So let's bring up a video of that. Thanks. So. And this project here  I was working with the great abstract vocalist  Jaap Blonk. And he is a world expert in performing  The Ursonate   which is a half an hour nonsense poem by Kurt Schwitters  written in the     s  which is half an hour of very highly patterned nonsense. And it's almost impossible to perform. But Jaap is one of the world experts in performing it. And in this project we've developed a form of intelligent real time subtitles. So these are our live subtitles  that are being produced by a computer that knows the text of  The Ursonate     fortunately Jaap does too  very well    and it is delivering that text at the same time as Jaap is. So all the text you're going to see is real time generated by the computer  visualizing what he's doing with his voice. Here you can see the set up where there is a screen with the subtitles behind him. Okay. So ... The full videos are online if you are interested. I got a split reaction to that during the live performance  because there is some people who understand live subtitles are a kind of an oxymoron  because usually there is someone making them afterwards. And then a bunch of people who were like   What's the big deal  I see subtitles all the time on television.  You know  They don't imagine the person in the booth  typing it all. So in addition to the full body  and in addition to the voice  another thing that I've been really interested in  most recently  is the use of the eyes  or the gaze  in terms of how people relate to each other. It's a really profound amount of nonverbal information that's communicated with the eyes. And it's one of the most interesting technical challenges that's very currently active in the computer sciences  being able to have a camera that can understand  from a fairly big distance away  how these little tiny balls are actually pointing in one way or another to reveal what you're interested in  and where your attention is directed. So there is a lot of emotional communication that happens there. And so I've been beginning  with a variety of different projects  to understand how people can relate to machines with their eyes. And basically to ask the questions  What if art was aware that we were looking at it  How could it respond  in a way  to acknowledge or subvert the fact that we're looking at it  And what could it do if it could look back at us  And so those are the questions that are happening in the next projects. In the first one which I'm going to show you  called Eyecode  it's a piece of interactive software in which  if we read this little circle   the trace left by the looking of the previous observer looks at the trace left by the looking of previous observer.  The idea is that it's an image wholly constructed from its own history of being viewed by different people in an installation. So let me just switch over so we can do the live demo. So let's run this and see if it works. Okay. Ah  there is lots of nice bright video. There is just a little test screen that shows that it's working. And what I'm just going to do is    I'm going to hide that. And you can see here that what it's doing is it's recording my eyes every time I blink. Hello  And I can ... hello ... okay. And no matter where I am  what's really going on here is that it's an eye tracking system that tries to locate my eyes. And if I get really far away I'm blurry. You know  you're going to have these kind of blurry spots like this that maybe only resemble eyes in a very very abstract way. But if I come up really close and stare directly at the camera on this laptop then you'll see these nice crisp eyes. You can think of it as a way of  sort of  typing  with your eyes. And what you're typing are recordings of your eyes as you're looking at other peoples' eyes. So each person is looking at the looking of everyone else before them. And this exists in larger installations where there are thousands and thousands of eyes that people could be staring at  as you see who's looking at the people looking at the people looking before them. So I'll just add a couple more. Blink. Blink. And you can see  just once again  how it's sort of finding my eyes and doing its best to estimate when it's blinking. Alright. Let's leave that. So that's this kind of recursive observation system. Thank you. The last couple pieces I'm going to show are basically in the new realm of robotics    for me  new for me. It's called Opto Isolator. And I'm going to show a video of the older version of it  which is just a minute long. Okay. In this case  the Opto Isolator is blinking in response to one's own blinks. So it blinks one second after you do. This is a device which is intended to reduce the phenomenon of gaze down to the simplest possible materials. Just one eye  looking at you  and eliminating everything else about a face  but just to consider gaze in an isolated way as a kind of  as an element. And at the same time  it attempts to engage in what you might call familiar psycho social gaze behaviors. Like looking away if you look at it too long because it gets shy  or things like that. Okay. So the last project I'm going to show is this new one called Snout. It's an eight foot snout  with a googly eye. And inside it's got an     pound robot arm that I borrowed  from a friend. It helps to have good friends. I'm at Carnegie Mellon  we've got a great Robotics Institute there. I'd like to show you thing called Snout  which is    The idea behind this project is to make a robot that appears as if it's continually surprised to see you. The idea is that basically    if it's constantly like  Huh  ... Huh   That's why its other name is Doubletaker  Taker of Doubles. It's always kind of doing a double take   What   And the idea is basically  can it look at you and make you feel as if like   What  Is it my shoes    Got something on my hair   Here we go. Alright. Checking him out ... For you nerds  here's a little behind the scenes. It's got a computer vision system  and it tries to look at the people who are moving around the most. Those are its targets. Up there is the skeleton  which is actually what it's trying to do. It's really about trying to create a novel body language for a new creature. Hollywood does this all the time  of course. But also have the body language communicate something to the person who is looking at it. This language is communicating that it is surprised to see you  and it's interested in looking at you. Thank you very much. That's all I've got for today. And I'm really happy to be here. Thank you so much. Well  this is     . And it's the Bicentenary of Charles Darwin. And all over the world  eminent evolutionists are anxious to celebrate this. And what they're planning to do is to enlighten us on almost every aspect of Darwin and his life  and how he changed our thinking. I say almost every aspect  because there is one aspect of this story which they have thrown no light on. And they seem anxious to skirt around it and step over it and to talk about something else. So I'm going to talk about it. It's the question of  why are we so different from the chimpanzees  We get the geneticists keeping on telling us how extremely closely we are related    hardly any genes of difference  very  very closely related. And yet  when you look at the phenotypes  there's a chimp  there's a man  they're astoundingly different  no resemblance at all. I'm not talking about airy fairy stuff about culture or psychology  or behavior. I'm talking about ground base  nitty gritty  measurable physical differences. They  that one  is hairy and walking on four legs. That one is a naked biped. Why  I mean    if I'm a good Darwinist  I've got to believe there's a reason for that. If we changed so much  something must have happened. What happened  Now    years ago  that was a laughably simple question. Everybody knew the answer. They knew what happened. The ancestor of the apes stayed in the trees  our ancestors went out onto the plain. That explained everything. We had to get up on our legs to peer over the tall grass  or to chase after animals  or to free our hands for weapons. And we got so overheated in the chase that we had to take off that fur coat and throw it away. Everybody knew that  for generations. But then  in the '  s  something began to unravel. The paleontologists themselves looked a bit more closely at the accompanying microfauna that lived in the same time and place as the hominids. And they weren't savanna species. And they looked at the herbivores. And they weren't savanna herbivores. And then they were so clever  they found a way to analyze fossilized pollen. Shock  horror. The fossilized pollen was not of savanna vegetation. Some of it even came from lianas  those things that dangle in the middle of the jungle. So we're left with a situation where we know that our earliest ancestors were moving around on four legs in the trees  before the savanna ecosystem even came into existence. This is not something I've made up. It's not a minority theory. Everybody agrees with it. Professor Tobias came over from South Africa and spoke to University College London. He said   Everything I've been telling you for the last    years  forget about it. It was wrong. We've got to go back to square one and start again.  It made him very unpopular. They didn't want to go back to square one. I mean  it's a terrible thing to happen. You've got this beautiful paradigm. You've believed it through generations. Nobody has questioned it. You've been constructing fanciful things on top of it  relying on it to be as solid as a rock. And now it's whipped away from under you. What do you do  What does a scientist do in that case  Well  we know the answer because Thomas S. Kuhn wrote a seminal treatise about this back in     . He said what scientists do when a paradigm fails is  guess what    they carry on as if nothing had happened. If they haven't got a paradigm they can't ask the question. So they say   Yes it's wrong  but supposing it was right ...  And the only other option open to them is to stop asking the questions. So that is what they have done now. That's why you don't hear them talking about it. It's yesterday's question. Some of them have even elevated it into a principle. It's what we ought to be doing. Aaron Filler from Harvard said   Isn't it time we stopped talking about selective pressures  I mean  why don't we talk about  well  there's chromosomes  and there's genes. And we just record what we see.  Charles Darwin must be spinning in his grave  He knew all about that kind of science. And he called it hypothesis free science. And he despised it from the bottom of his heart. And if you're going to say   I'm going to stop talking about selective pressures   you can take  The Origin of Species  and throw it out of the window  for it's about nothing else but selective pressures. And the irony of it is  that this is one occasion of a paradigm collapse where we didn't have to wait for a new paradigm to come up. There was one waiting in the wings. It had been waiting there since      when Alister Hardy  a marine biologist  said   I think what happened  perhaps our ancestors had a more aquatic existence for some of the time.  He kept it to himself for    years. But then the press got hold of it and all hell broke loose. All his colleagues said   This is outrageous. You've exposed us to public ridicule  You must never do that again.  And at that time  it became set in stone  the aquatic theory should be dumped with the UFOs and the yetis  as part of the lunatic fringe of science. Well I don't think that. I think that Hardy had a lot going for him. I'd like to talk about just a handful of what have been called the hallmarks of mankind  the things that made us different from everybody else  and all our relatives. Let's look at our naked skin. It's obvious that most of the things we think about that have lost their body hair  mammals without body hair  are aquatic ones  like the dugong  the walrus  the dolphin  the hippopotamus  the manatee. And a couple of wallowers in mud like the babirusa. And you're tempted to think  well perhaps  could that be why we are naked  I suggested it and people said   No no no. I mean  look at the elephant. You've forgotten all about the elephant haven't you   So back in      I said   Well perhaps the elephant had an aquatic ancestor.  Peals of merry laughter   That crazy woman. She's off again. She'll say anything won't she   But by now  everybody agrees that the elephant had an aquatic ancestor. This has come 'round to be that all those naked pachyderms have aquatic ancestors. The last exception was supposed to be the rhinoceros. Last year in Florida they found extinct ancestor of a rhinoceros and said   Seems to have spent most of its time in the water.  So this is a close connection between nakedness and water. As an absolute connection  it only works one way. You can't say all aquatic animals are naked  because look at the sea otter. But you can say that every animal that has become naked has been conditioned by water  in its own lifetime  or the lifetime of its ancestors. I think this is significant. The only exception is the naked Somalian mole rat  which never puts its nose above the surface of the ground. And take bipedality. Here you can't find anybody to compare it with  because we're the only animal that walks upright on two legs. But you can say this  all the apes and all the monkeys are capable of walking on two legs  if they want to  for a short time. There is only one circumstance in which they always  all of them  walk on two legs  and that is when they are wading through water. Do you think that's significant  David Attenborough thinks it's significant  as the possible beginning of our bipedalism. Look at the fat layer. We have got  under our skin  a layer of fat  all over  nothing in the least like that in any other primate. Why should it be there  Well they do know  that if you look at other aquatic mammals  the fat that in most land mammals is deposited inside the body wall  around the kidneys and the intestines and so on  has started to migrate to the outside  and spread out in a layer inside the skin. In the whale it's complete  no fat inside at all  all in blubber outside. We cannot avoid the suspicion that in our case it's started to happen. We have got skin lined with this layer. It's the only possible explanation of why humans  if they're very unlucky  can become grossly obese  in a way that would be totally impossible for any other primate  physically impossible. Something very odd  matter of factly  never explained. The question of why we can speak. We can speak. And the gorilla can't speak. Why  Nothing to do with his teeth or his tongue or his lungs or anything like that    purely has to do with its conscious control of its breath. You can't even train a gorilla to say  Ah  on request. The only creatures that have got conscious control of their breath are the diving animals and the diving birds. It was an absolute precondition for our being able to speak. And then again  there is the fact that we are streamlined. Trying to imagine a diver diving into water    hardly makes a splash. Try to imagine a gorilla performing the same maneuver  and you can see that  compared with gorilla  we are halfway to being shaped like a fish. I am trying to suggest that  for    odd years  this aquatic idea has been miscategorized as lunatic fringe  and it is not lunatic fringe. And the ironic thing about it is that they are not staving off the aquatic theory to protect a theory of their own  which they've all agreed on  and they love. There is nothing there. They are staving off the aquatic theory to protect a vacuum. How do they react when I say these things  One very common reaction I've heard about    times is   But it was investigated. They conducted a serious investigation of this at the beginning  when Hardy put forward his article.  I don't believe it. For    years I've been looking for any evidence of any incident of that kind  and I've concluded that that's one of the urban myths. It's never been done. I ask people sometimes  and they say   I like the aquatic theory  Everybody likes the aquatic theory. Of course they don't believe it  but they like it.  Well I say   Why do you think it's rubbish   They say  Well ... everybody I talk to says it's rubbish. And they can't all be wrong  can they   The answer to that  loud and clear  is   Yes  They can all be wrong.  History is strewn with the cases when they've all got it wrong. And if you've got a scientific problem like that  you can't solve it by holding a head count  and saying   More of us say yes than say no.  Apart from that  some of the heads count more than others. Some of them have come over. There was Professor Tobias. He's come over. Daniel Dennett  he's come over. Sir David Attenborough  he's come over. Anybody else out there  Come on in. The water is lovely. And now we've got to look to the future. Ultimately one of three things is going to happen. Either they will go on for the next    years     years     years.  Yeah well we don't talk about that. Let's talk about something interesting.  That would be very sad. The second thing that could happen is that some young genius will arrive  and say   I've found it. It was not the savanna  it was not the water  it was this   No sign of that happening either. I don't think there is a third option. So the third thing that might happen is a very beautiful thing. If you look back at the early years of the last century  there was a stand off  a lot of bickering and bad feeling between the believers in Mendel  and the believers in Darwin. It ended with a new synthesis  Darwin's ideas and Mendel's ideas blending together. And I think the same thing will happen here. You'll get a new synthesis. Hardy's ideas and Darwin's ideas will be blended together. And we can move forward from there  and really get somewhere. That would be a beautiful thing. It would be very nice for me if it happened soon. Because I'm older now than George Burns was when he said   At my age  I don't even buy green bananas.  So if it's going to come and it's going to happen  what's holding it up  I can tell you that in three words. Academia says no. They decided in        That belongs with the UFOs and the yetis.  And it's not easy to change their minds. The professional journals won't touch it with a barge pole. The textbooks don't mention it. The syllabus doesn't mention even the fact that we're naked  let alone look for a reason to it.  Horizon   which takes its cue from the academics  won't touch it with a barge pole. So we never hear the case put for it  except in jocular references to people on the lunatic fringe. I don't know quite where this diktat comes from. Somebody up there is issuing the commandment   Thou shalt not believe in the aquatic theory. And if you hope to make progress in this profession  and you do believe it  you'd better keep it to yourself  because it will get in your way.  So I get the impression that some parts of the scientific establishment are morphing into a kind of priesthood. But you know  that makes me feel good  because Richard Dawkins has told us how to treat a priesthood. He says   Firstly  you've got to refuse to give it all the excessive awe and reverence it's been trained to receive.  Right. I'll go ahead with that. And secondly  he says   You must never be afraid to rock the boat.  I'll go along with that too. Thank you very much. There's an old saying   Just because you can't see something  doesn't mean it's not there.  My work is    it's a reflection of myself. What I wanted to do is to show the world that the little things can be the biggest things. We all seem to think that  you know  if we look down on the ground  there's nothing there. And we use the word  nothing.  Nothing doesn't exist  because there is always something. My mother told me that  when I was a child  that I should always respect the little things. What made me do this work  I shall go into my story. This all started when I was age five. What made me do it  At school  I will admit this  academically  I couldn't express myself. So I was  more or less  classed as  nothing.  My world was seen as less. So I decided I didn't really want to be a part of that world. I thought  I need to retreat into something else. So when my mother used to take me to school  she thought I was at school  and I used to do a U turn  when her back was turned  and run off and hide in the shed at the back of the garden. Now  the one time I was in the shed  and my mother suspected something  thinking I was at school. My mother was like the woman in Tom and Jerry. So you'd just see her feet. So I was hiding in the shed  like that. And all of a sudden ... And then I saw her legs. And then she said    grabbed me like that  because my mother was quite big    and she lifted me up and she says   How come you're not at school   I told her I couldn't face it because the way the teacher was treating me  ridiculing me  and using me as an example of failure. So I told her. At that age  obviously  I couldn't express it that way  but I told her I didn't feel right. And then she just said   You're going back to school tomorrow.  And walked off. And I didn't expect that  because I expected one of these ... But I didn't get it. So I'm sitting there thinking. And as I looked down on the ground  I noticed there was some ants running around. And I went into this little fantasy world. And I thought   These ants  are they looking for the queen ant  Or do they need somewhere to live   So I thought  Perhaps  if I made these ants some apartments  they'll move in.  So I did. And how I set about that  I got some splinters of wood. And I sliced the little splinters of wood with a broken shard of glass  constructed this little apartment. Well it looked like a little shanty shed when I'd finished. But I thought  perhaps the ant won't know  it'll probably move in. And so they did. That was a bit crude  at the time. And I made all these little apartments and little merry go rounds  seesaws and swings  little ladders. And then I encouraged the ants to come 'round by putting sugar and things like that. And then I sat down and all the ants came along. And all I could hear was  Is this for us   And I say   Yes  they're all for you.  And they moved in  and decided not to pay me any rent. And from there I was watching this little world. It became part of me. When I discovered that I had this gift  I wanted to experiment with this world that we can't see. So I realized that there was more to life than just everything that we see around us that's huge. So I started to educate myself on this molecular level. And as I got older  I continued. I showed my mother. My mother told me to take it smaller. Now I shall show you something here. And I'll explain. As you can see  that's a pinhead. Now that is called the Huf Haus. The gentleman who commissioned me to do this was a gentleman called Peter Huf. And he says to me  Willard  can you put my house on a pinhead   So I say   How are you going to fit in there   And then he said to me   I don't believe you can do it. Can you really do it   And I says   Well  try me.  And then he said   But I don't believe that you can do this.  So I said   OK.  So  to cut a long story short  I went home  went underneath the microscope  and I crushed up a piece of glass  crushed it up. And underneath the microscope there were splinters of glass. Some of them were quite jagged. So I was crushing up these pieces of glass  which  as you can see  that's the actual frame of the house. And the actual roof is made up of a fiber  which I found in my sister's old teddy bear. So I got the teddy bear and I said   Do you mind if I pull out one of your fibers   So I did. And I looked at it beneath the microscope. And some of it was flat. So I decided to slice these up with the tool that I make by    I sharpen the end of a needle into a blade. And then I actually slow down my whole nervous system. And then I work between my heartbeat  I have one and a half seconds to actually move. And at the same time I have to watch I don't inhale my own work  at the same time. Because that has happened to me. So what I did  like I said  come back to the glass. I found these little bits of glass. And I had to make them square. So I'm thinking  How can I do this   So what I did  I got an oilstone. Broke the edge of an oilstone off. And what I did  I took pieces of glass. And I started to rub them. I used a little tweezer which I made from a hair clip. And I built rubber around the end of the tweezer so it wouldn't crush the glass. And then I started rubbing  very very gently  till some of the edges were quite square. And then I constructed it. And how I constructed it  is by making grooves in the top of the pinhead. And then pushing the glass in with its own friction. And as I was doing it  what happened  The instrument that I used turned into a catapult. And it went like this ... And then that was it. Gone. So I'm thinking   Mr. Huf isn't going to be very happy when I told him his house has gone to another  into the atmosphere somewhere.  So to cut the story short  I decided that I had to go back and do it. So I found some more. And I decided to  sort of  construct it very  very slowly  holding my breath  working between my heartbeat  and making sure everything is leveled. Because it's such a small sculpture  nothing can go wrong. And I decided to build it up. Then I used fibers out of my jumper  which I held and stretched. And made the beams going around the house. And the actual windows and the balcony had to be sort of constructed. I used a money spider's web to actually attach certain things  which sent me insane. But I managed to do it. And when I finished it  I came back the next day. I noticed that the house was occupied. Have we ever heard of a dust mite  Darren dust mite and his family moved in. So basically I'd completed the house. And there you are. Right. As you can see  Bart Simpson is having a little argument. I think they're arguing about the space on the pin. There's not enough room for the two of them. So I didn't think he was going to throw Bart off. I think he was just warning him actually. But this one was made out of a nylon tag out of my shirt. What I did  I plucked the tag out and put it underneath the microscope. I used the needle which has got a slight blade on the end. Can anybody see the blade on the end of that needle  Audience  No. WW  So what I did is the same process where I just kind of hold my breath and just work away very  very slowly  manipulating the plastic  cutting it  because it behaves different. Whenever you work on that level  things behave different. Because it's on this molecular level things change and they act different. And sometimes they turn into little catapults and things go up in the air. And  you know  all different things happen. But I had to make a little barrier  going around it  out of cellophane  to stop it moving. Then static electricity set in. And it went ... And I'm trying to remove it. And the static is interfering with everything. So there is sweat dripping off my head  because I have to carve Homer Simpson like that  in that position. And after I've cut out the shape  then I have to make sure that there is room for Bart's neck. So after I've done the same thing  then I have to paint it. And after I've actually sculpted them  I have to paint them. I experimented with a    I found a dead fly. And I plucked the hair off the fly's head. Decided to make a paintbrush. But I would never do it to a living fly. Because I've heard a fly in pain. And they go  Meow  Ow   Even though they get on our nerves  I would never kill an insect because   All creatures great and small     there is a hymn that says that. So what I decided to do is to pluck fine hair out of my face. And I looked at it underneath the microscope. That was the paintbrush. And whilst I'm painting I have to be very careful  because the paint starts to turn into little blobs. And it starts to dry very quickly. So I have to be very quick. If I'm not  it will end up looking not like what it's supposed to look like. It could end up looking like Humpty Dumpty or somebody else. So I have to be very very careful. This one took me approximately  I would say  six to seven weeks. My work  rough estimate  sometimes five  six to seven weeks  you can't always anticipate. As you can see  that's Charlton Heston brought down to size. He says to me   Willard     You can see him saying   Why me   I says   I enjoyed your film. That's why.  As you can see  there's an aphid fly there. That's just to show the scale and the actual size of the sculpture. I would say it probably measures ... a quarter of a millimeter. In America they say a period stop. So say if you cut a period stop in half  a full stop  that's about the size of the whole thing. It's made    the chariot is made of gold. And Charlton Heston is made of a floating fiber  which I took out of the air. When the sunlight comes through the window you see these little fibers. And what I normally do is walk 'round a room    trying to find one. And then I put it underneath the microscope. I remember one time I was doing it  and the window was open. And there was a lady standing by the bus stop. And she saw me walking around like this. And then she looked at me. And then I went ... And then she went   Hmm  OK  he's not mad.  Yeah  to actually do this thing    the actual chariot is made of gold. I had a    karat gold ring. And I cut off a little flake of gold. And I bent it 'round  and made it into the chariot. And the horse is made from nylon. And the spider's web is for the reins on the horse. To get the symmetrical shape of the horse was very difficult  because I had to get the horse to rear up and look as though it was in some kind of action. When I did this one  a gentleman seen it and said to me   There's no way you can do this  you must have used some kind of machine. There's no way a man can do that. It must be a machine.  So I says   OK then  if you say it's a machine ...  That one took me approximately six weeks. The most famous statue in the world. This one  I would say  was a serious challenge. Because I had to put the torch on the top. That one is  more or less  the same type of process. The bottom of it is carved from a grain of sand  because I wanted to get a bit of the stone effect. I used a microscopic shard of diamond to actually carve the actual base. Well  I can look at this one and I can be very proud of this  because that statue has always sort of kept an image in my head of  you know  the beginning of people coming to America. So it's sort of Ellis Island  and seeing America for the first time. And that's the first thing they saw. So I wanted to have that little image. And this is it. And we all know that is the Hulk. I wanted to create movement in the eye of a needle. Because we know we see needles  but people aren't familiar with the eye of a needle apart from putting a thread through it. So I broke the needle. And made a needle look like the Hulk's broken it. It's    I had to make little holes in the base of the needle  to shove his feet in. So most of my work  I don't use glue. They go in with their own friction. And that's how I managed to do it. As you can see  he's looking at the moment. He's got a little grimace on his face. And his mouth must be probably about three microns. So the eyes are probably about one micron or something. That ship there  that's made from    karat gold. And I normally rig it with the web of a money spider. But I had to rig it with strands of glue. Because the web of the spider  it was sending me insane  because I couldn't get the web to move off. And that's    karat gold. And it's constructed. I built it. Constructed each plank of gold. And the whole thing is sort of symmetrical. The flag had to be made out of little strands of gold. It's almost like doing a surgical operation to get this thing right. As you can see  dressage. It's something I wanted to do just to show how I could get the symmetrical shape. The actual rigging on the reins on the horse are made from the same sort of thing. And that was done with a particle from my shirt. And the pinhead I've made green around there by scraping the particles off a green shirt and then pressed onto the needle. It's very painstaking work  but the best things come in small packages. Bruno Giussani  Willard Wigan  Good morning everybody. I'd like to talk about a couple of things today. The first thing is water. Now I see you've all been enjoying the water that's been provided for you here at the conference  over the past couple of days. And I'm sure you'll feel that it's from a safe source. But what if it wasn't  What if it was from a source like this  Then statistics would actually say that half of you would now be suffering with diarrhea. I talked a lot in the past about statistics  and the provision of safe drinking water for all. But they just don't seem to get through. And I think I've worked out why. It's because  using current thinking  the scale of the problem just seems too huge to contemplate solving. So we just switch off  us  governments and aid agencies. Well  today  I'd like to show you that through thinking differently  the problem has been solved. By the way  since I've been speaking  another        people around the world are suffering now with diarrhea. And four children have just died. I invented Lifesaver bottle because I got angry. I  like most of you  was sitting down  the day after Christmas in       when I was watching the devastating news of the Asian tsunami as it rolled in  playing out on TV. The days and weeks that followed  people fleeing to the hills  being forced to drink contaminated water or face death. That really stuck with me. Then  a few months later  Hurricane Katrina slammed into the side of America.  Okay   I thought   here's a First World country  let's see what they can do.  Day one  nothing. Day two  nothing. Do you know it took five days to get water to the Superdome  People were shooting each other on the streets for TV sets and water. That's when I decided I had to do something. Now I spent a lot of time in my garage  over the next weeks and months  and also in my kitchen    much to the dismay of my wife.  Laughter  However  after a few failed prototypes  I finally came up with this  the Lifesaver bottle. Okay  now for the science bit. Before Lifesaver  the best hand filters were only capable of filtering down to about     nanometers. The smallest bacteria is about     nanometers. So a     nanometer bacteria is going to get through a     nanometer hole. The smallest virus  on the other hand  is about    nanometers. So that's definitely going to get through those     nanometer holes. Lifesaver pores are    nanometers. So nothing is getting through. Okay  I'm going to give you a bit of a demonstration. Would you like to see that  I spent all the time setting this up  so I guess I should. We're in the fine city of Oxford. So    someone's done that up. Fine city of Oxford  so what I've done is I've gone and got some water from the River Cherwell  and the River Thames  that flow through here. And this is the water. But I got to thinking  you know  if we were in the middle of a flood zone in Bangladesh  the water wouldn't look like this. So I've gone and got some stuff to add into it. And this is from my pond. Okay.  Laughs  Right. We're just going to pour that in there. Audience  Ugh  Michael Pritchard  Okay. We've got some runoff from a sewage plant farm. So I'm just going to put that in there. Put that in there. There we go. And some other bits and pieces  chuck that in there. And I've got a gift here from a friend of mine's rabbit. So we're just going to put that in there as well. Okay.  Laughter  Now. The Lifesaver bottle works really simply. You just scoop the water up. Today I'm going to use a jug just to show you all. Let's get a bit of that poo in there. That's not dirty enough. Let's just stir that up a little bit. Okay  so I'm going to take this really filthy water  and put it in here. Do you want a drink yet  Okay. There we go. Replace the top. Give it a few pumps. Okay  That's all that's necessary. Now as soon as I pop the teat  sterile drinking water is going to come out. I've got to be quick. Okay  ready  There we go. Mind the electrics. That is safe  sterile drinking water. Cheers. There you go Chris. What's it taste of  Chris Anderson  Delicious. Michael Pritchard  Okay. Let's see Chris's program throughout the rest of the show. Okay  Okay. Lifesaver bottle is used by thousands of people around the world. It'll last for       liters. And when it's expired  using failsafe technology  the system will shut off  protecting the user. Pop the cartridge out. Pop a new one in. It's good for another       liters. So let's look at the applications. Traditionally  in a crisis  what do we do  We ship water. Then  after a few weeks  we set up camps. And people are forced to come into the camps to get their safe drinking water. What happens when        people congregate in a camp  Diseases spread. More resources are required. The problem just becomes self perpetuating. But by thinking differently  and shipping these  people can stay put. They can make their own sterile drinking water  and start to get on with rebuilding their homes and their lives. Now  it doesn't require a natural disaster for this to work. Using the old thinking  of national infrastructure and pipe work  is too expensive. When you run the numbers on a calculator  you run out of noughts. So here is the  thinking different  bit. Instead of shipping water  and using man made processes to do it  let's use Mother Nature. She's got a fantastic system. She picks the water up from there  desalinates it  for free  transports it over there  and dumps it onto the mountains  rivers  and streams. And where do people live  Near water. All we've go to do is make it sterile. How do we do that  Well  we could use the Lifesaver bottle. Or we could use one of these. The same technology  in a jerry can. This will process        liters of water  that's good enough for a family of four  for three years. And how much does it cost  About half a cent a day to run. Thank you. So  by thinking differently  and processing water at the point of use  mothers and children no longer have to walk four hours a day to collect their water. They can get it from a source nearby. So with just eight billion dollars  we can hit the millennium goal's target of halving the number of people without access to safe drinking water. To put that into context  The U.K. government spends about    billion pounds a year on foreign aid. But why stop there  With    billion dollars  everyone can have access to safe drinking water. So the three and a half billion people that suffer every year as a result  and the two million kids that die every year  will live. Thank you. Take a look at this picture. It poses a very fascinating puzzle for us. These African students are doing their homework under streetlights at the airport in the capital city because they don't have any electricity at home. Now  I haven't met these particular students  but I've met students like them. Let's just pick one    for example  the one in the green shirt. Let's give him a name  too  Nelson. I'll bet Nelson has a cellphone. So here is the puzzle. Why is it that Nelson has access to a cutting edge technology  like the cellphone  but doesn't have access to a     year old technology for generating electric light in the home  Now  in a word  the answer is  rules.  Bad rules can prevent the kind of win win solution that's available when people can bring new technologies in and make them available to someone like Nelson. What kinds of rules  The electric company in this nation operates under a rule  which says that it has to sell electricity at a very low  subsidized price    in fact  a price that is so low it loses money on every unit that it sells. So it has neither the resources  nor the incentives  to hook up many other users. The president wanted to change this rule. He's seen that it's possible to have a different set of rules  rules where businesses earn a small profit  so they have an incentive to sign up more customers. That's the kind of rules that the cellphone company that Nelson purchases his telephony from operates under. The president has seen how those rules worked well. So he tried to change the rules for pricing on electricity  but ran into a firestorm of protest from businesses and consumers who wanted to preserve the existing subsidized rates. So he was stuck with rules that prevented him from letting the win win solution help his country. And Nelson is stuck studying under the streetlights. The real challenge then  is to try to figure out how we can change rules. Are there some rules we can develop for changing rules  I want to argue that there is a general abstract insight that we can make practical  which is that  if we can give more choices to people  and more choices to leaders    who  in many countries  are also people. But  it's useful to present the opposition between these two. Because the kind of choice you might want to give to a leader  a choice like giving the president the choice to raise prices on electricity  takes away a choice that people in the economy want. They want the choice to be able to continue consuming subsidized electric power. So if you give just to one side or the other  you'll have tension or friction. But if we can find ways to give more choices to both  that will give us a set of rules for changing rules that get us out of traps. Now  Nelson also has access to the Internet. And he says that if you want to see the damaging effects of rules  the ways that rules can keep people in the dark  look at the pictures from NASA of the earth at night. In particular check out Asia. If you zoom in here  you can see North Korea  in outline here  which is like a black hole compared to its neighbors. Now  you won't be surprised to learn that the rules in North Korea keep people there in the dark. But it is important to recognize that North Korea and South Korea started out with identical sets of rules in both the sense of laws and regulations  but also in the deeper senses of understandings  norms  culture  values and beliefs. When they separated  they made choices that led to very divergent paths for their sets of rules. So we can change    we as humans can change the rules that we use to interact with each other  for better  or for worse. Now let's look at another region  the Caribbean. Zoom in on Haiti  in outline here. Haiti is also dark  compared to its neighbor here  the Dominican Republic  which has about the same number of residents. Both of these countries are dark compared to Puerto Rico  which has half as many residents as either Haiti or the Dominican Republic. What Haiti warns us is that rules can be bad because governments are weak. It's not just that the rules are bad because the government is too strong and oppressive  as in North Korea. So that if we want to create environments with good rules  we can't just tear down. We've got to find ways to build up  as well. Now  China dramatically demonstrates both the potential and the challenges of working with rules. Back in the beginning of the data presented in this chart  China was the world's high technology leader. Chinese had pioneered technologies like steel  printing  gunpowder. But the Chinese never adopted  at least in that period  effective rules for encouraging the spread of those ideas    a profit motive that could have encouraged the spread. And they soon adopted rules which slowed down innovation and cut China off from the rest of the world. So as other countries in the world innovated  in the sense both of developing newer technologies  but also developing newer rules  the Chinese were cut off from those advances. Income there stayed stagnant  as it zoomed ahead in the rest of the world. This next chart looks at more recent data. It plots income  average income in China as a percentage of average income in the United States. In the '  s and '  s you can see that it was hovering at about three percent. But then in the late '  s something changed. Growth took off in China. The Chinese started catching up very quickly with the United States. If you go back to the map at night  you can get a clue to the process that lead to the dramatic change in rules in China. The brightest spot in China  which you can see on the edge of the outline here  is Hong Kong. Hong Kong was a small bit of China that  for most of the   th century  operated under a very different set of rules than the rest of mainland China    rules that were copied from working market economies of the time  and administered by the British. In the     s  Hong Kong was a place where millions of people could go  from the mainland  to start in jobs like sewing shirts  making toys. But  to get on a process of increasing income  increasing skills led to very rapid growth there. Hong Kong was also the model which leaders like Deng Xiaoping could copy  when they decided to move all of the mainland towards the market model. But Deng Xiaoping instinctively understood the importance of offering choices to his people. So instead of forcing everyone in China to shift immediately to the market model  they proceeded by creating some special zones that could do  in a sense  what Britain did  make the opportunity to go work with the market rules available to the people who wanted to opt in there. So they created four special economic zones around Hong Kong  zones where Chinese could come and work  and cities grew up very rapidly there  also zones where foreign firms could come in and make things. One of the zones next to Hong Kong has a city called Shenzhen. In that city there is a Taiwanese firm that made the iPhone that many of you have  and they made it with labor from Chinese who moved there to Shenzhen. So after the four special zones  there were    coastal cites that were open in the same sense  and eventually demonstrated successes in these places that people could opt in to  that they flocked to because of the advantages they offered. Demonstrated successes there led to a consensus for a move toward the market model for the entire economy. Now the Chinese example shows us several points. One is  preserve choices for people. Two  operate on the right scale. If you try to change the rules in a village  you could do that  but a village would be too small to get the kinds of benefits you can get if you have millions of people all working under good rules. On the other hand  the nation is too big. If you try to change the rules in the nation  you can't give some people a chance to hold back  see how things turn out  and let others zoom ahead and try the new rules. But cities give you this opportunity to create new places  with new rules that people can opt in to. And they're large enough to get all of the benefits that we can have when millions of us work together under good rules. So the proposal is that we conceive of something called a charter city. We start with a charter that specifies all the rules required to attract the people who we'll need to build the city. We'll need to attract the investors who will build out the infrastructure    the power system  the roads  the port  the airport  the buildings. You'll need to attract firms  who will come hire the people who move there first. And you'll need to attract families  the residents who will come and live there permanently  raise their children  get an education for their children  and get their first job. With that charter  people will move there. The city can be built. And we can scale this model. We can go do it over and over again. To make it work  we need good rules. We've already discussed that. Those are captured in the charter. We also need the choices for people. That's really built into the model if we allow for the possibility of building cities on uninhabited land. You start from uninhabited territory. People can come live under the new charter  but no one is forced to live under it. The final thing we need are choices for leaders. And  to achieve the kind of choices we want for leaders we need to allow for the potential for partnerships between nations  cases where nations work together  in effect  de facto  the way China and Britain worked together to build  first a little enclave of the market model  and then scale it throughout China. In a sense  Britain  inadvertently  through its actions in Hong Kong  did more to reduce world poverty than all the aid programs that we've undertaken in the last century. So if we allow for these kind of partnerships to replicate this again  we can get those kinds of benefits scaled throughout the world. In some cases this will involve a delegation of responsibility  a delegation of control from one country to another to take over certain kinds of administrative responsibilities. Now  when I say that  some of you are starting to think   Well  is this just bringing back colonialism   It's not. But it's important to recognize that the kind of emotions that come up when we start to think about these things  can get in the way  can make us pull back  can shut down our ability  and our interest in trying to explore new ideas. Why is this not like colonialism  The thing that was bad about colonialism  and the thing which is residually bad in some of our aid programs  is that it involved elements of coercion and condescension. This model is all about choices  both for leaders and for the people who will live in these new places. And  choice is the antidote to coercion and condescension. So let's talk about how this could play out in practice. Let's take a particular leader  Raul Castro  who is the leader of Cuba. It must have occurred to Castro that he has the chance to do for Cuba what Deng Xiaoping did for China  but he doesn't have a Hong Kong there on the island in Cuba. He does  though  have a little bit of light down in the south that has a very special status. There is a zone there  around Guantanamo Bay  where a treaty gives the United States administrative responsibility for a piece of land that's about twice the size of Manhattan. Castro goes to the prime minister of Canada and says   Look  the Yankees have a terrible PR problem. They want to get out. Why don't you  Canada  take over  Build    run a special administrative zone. Allow a new city to be built up there. Allow many people to come in. Let us have a Hong Kong nearby. Some of my citizens will move into that city as well. Others will hold back. But this will be the gateway that will connect the modern economy and the modern world to my country.  Now  where else might this model be tried  Well  Africa. I've talked with leaders in Africa. Many of them totally get the notion of a special zone that people can opt into as a rule. It's a rule for changing rules. It's a way to create new rules  and let people opt in without coercion  and the opposition that coercion can force. They also totally get the idea that in some instances they can make more credible promises to long term investors    the kind of investors who will come build the port  build the roads  in a new city    they can make more credible promises if they do it along with a partner nation. Perhaps even in some arrangement that's a little bit like an escrow account  where you put land in the escrow account and the partner nation takes responsibility for it. There is also lots of land in Africa where new cities could be built. This is a picture I took when I was flying along the coast. There are immense stretches of land like this    land where hundreds of millions of people could live. Now  if we generalize this and think about not just one or two charter cites  but dozens    cities that will help create places for the many hundreds of millions  perhaps billions of people who will move to cities in the coming century    is there enough land for them  Well  throughout the world  if we look at the lights at night  the one thing that's misleading is that  visually  it looks like most of the world is already built out. So let me show you why that's wrong. Take this representation of all of the land. Turn it into a square that stands for all the arable land on Earth. And let these dots represent the land that's already taken up by the cities that three billion people now live in. If you move the dots down to the bottom of the rectangle you can see that the cities for the existing three billion urban residents take up only three percent of the arable land on earth. So if we wanted to build cities for another billion people  they would be dots like this. We'd go from three percent of the arable land  to four percent. We'd dramatically reduce the human footprint on Earth by building more cities that people can move to. And if these are cities governed by good rules  they can be cities where people are safe from crime  safe from disease and bad sanitation  where people have a chance to get a job. They can get basic utilities like electricity. Their kids can get an education. So what will it take to get started building the first charter cities  scaling this so we build many more  It would help to have a manual. What university professors could do is write some details that might go into this manual. You wouldn't want to let us run the cities  go out and design them. You wouldn't let academics out in the wild.  Laughter  But  you could set us to work thinking about questions like  suppose it isn't just Canada that does the deal with Raul Castro. Perhaps Brazil comes in as a participant  and Spain as well. And perhaps Cuba wants to be one of the partners in a four way joint venture. How would we write the treaty to do that  There is less precedent for that  but that could easily be worked out. How would we finance this  Turns out Singapore and Hong Kong are cities that made huge gains on the value of the land that they owned when they got started. You could use the gains on the value of the land to pay for things like the police  the courts  but the school system and the health care system too  which make this a more attractive place to live  makes this a place where people have higher incomes    which  incidentally  makes the land more valuable. So the incentives for the people helping to construct this zone and build it  and set up the basic rules  go very much in the right direction. So there are many other details like this. How could we have buildings that are low cost and affordable for people who work in a first job  assembling something like an iPhone  but make those buildings energy efficient  and make sure that they are safe  so they don't fall down in an earthquake or a hurricane. Many technical details to be worked out  but those of us who are already starting to pursue these things can already tell that there is no roadblock  there's no impediment  other than a failure of imagination  that will keep us from delivering on a truly global win win solution. Let me conclude with this picture. The reason we can be so well off  even though there is so many people on earth  is because of the power of ideas. We can share ideas with other people  and when they discover them  they share with us. It's not like scarce objects  where sharing means we each get less. When we share ideas we all get more. When we think about ideas in that way  we usually think about technologies. But there is another class of ideas  the rules that govern how we interact with each other  rules like  let's have a tax system that supports a research university that gives away certain kinds of knowledge for free. Let's have a system where we have ownership of land that is registered in a government office  that people can pledge as collateral. If we can keep innovating on our space of rules  and particularly innovate in the sense of coming up with rules for changing rules  so we don't get stuck with bad rules  then we can keep moving progress forward and truly make the world a better place  so that people like Nelson and his friends don't have to study any longer under the streetlights. Thank you. If I could reveal anything that is hidden from us  at least in modern cultures  it would be to reveal something that we've forgotten  that we used to know as well as we knew our own names. And that is that we live in a competent universe  that we are part of a brilliant planet  and that we are surrounded by genius. Biomimicry is a new discipline that tries to learn from those geniuses  and take advice from them  design advice. That's where I live  and it's my university as well. I'm surrounded by genius. I cannot help but remember the organisms and the ecosystems that know how to live here gracefully on this planet. This is what I would tell you to remember if you ever forget this again. Remember this. This is what happens every year. This is what keeps its promise. While we're doing bailouts  this is what happened. Spring. Imagine designing spring. Imagine that orchestration. You think TED is hard to organize.  Laughter  Right  Imagine  and if you haven't done this in a while  do. Imagine the timing  the coordination  all without top down laws  or policies  or climate change protocols. This happens every year. There is lots of showing off. There is lots of love in the air. There's lots of grand openings. And the organisms  I promise you  have all of their priorities in order. I have this neighbor that keeps me in touch with this  because he's living  usually on his back  looking up at those grasses. And one time he came up to me    he was about seven or eight years old    he came up to me. And there was a wasp's nest that I had let grow in my yard  right outside my door. And most people knock them down when they're small. But it was fascinating to me  because I was looking at this sort of fine Italian end papers. And he came up to me and he knocked. He would come every day with something to show me. And like  knock like a woodpecker on my door until I opened it up. And he asked me how I had made the house for those wasps  because he had never seen one this big. And I told him   You know  Cody  the wasps actually made that.  And we looked at it together. And I could see why he thought  you know    it was so beautifully done. It was so architectural. It was so precise. But it occurred to me  how in his small life had he already believed the myth that if something was that well done  that we must have done it. How did he not know    it's what we've all forgotten    that we're not the first ones to build. We're not the first ones to process cellulose. We're not the first ones to make paper. We're not the first ones to try to optimize packing space  or to waterproof  or to try to heat and cool a structure. We're not the first ones to build houses for our young. What's happening now  in this field called biomimicry  is that people are beginning to remember that organisms  other organisms  the rest of the natural world  are doing things very similar to what we need to do. But in fact they are doing them in a way that have allowed them to live gracefully on this planet for billions of years. So these people  biomimics  are nature's apprentices. And they're focusing on function. What I'd like to do is show you a few of the things that they're learning. They have asked themselves   What if  every time I started to invent something  I asked  'How would nature solve this '  And here is what they're learning. This is an amazing picture from a Czech photographer named Jack Hedley. This is a story about an engineer at J.R. West. They're the people who make the bullet train. It was called the bullet train because it was rounded in front  but every time it went into a tunnel it would build up a pressure wave  and then it would create like a sonic boom when it exited. So the engineer's boss said   Find a way to quiet this train.  He happened to be a birder. He went to the equivalent of an Audubon Society meeting. And he studied    there was a film about king fishers. And he thought to himself   They go from one density of medium  the air  into another density of medium  water  without a splash. Look at this picture. Without a splash  so they can see the fish. And he thought   What if we do this   Quieted the train. Made it go    percent faster on    percent less electricity. How does nature repel bacteria  We're not the first ones to have to protect ourselves from some bacteria. Turns out that    this is a Galapagos Shark. It has no bacteria on its surface  no fouling on its surface  no barnacles. And it's not because it goes fast. It actually basks. It's a slow moving shark. So how does it keep its body free of bacteria build up  It doesn't do it with a chemical. It does it  it turns out  with the same denticles that you had on Speedo bathing suits  that broke all those records in the Olympics  but it's a particular kind of pattern. And that pattern  the architecture of that pattern on its skin denticles keep bacteria from being able to land and adhere. There is a company called Sharklet Technologies that's now putting this on the surfaces in hospitals to keep bacteria from landing  which is better than dousing it with anti bacterials or harsh cleansers that many  many organisms are now becoming drug resistant. Hospital acquired infections are now killing more people every year in the United States than die from AIDS or cancer or car accidents combined    about        . This is a little critter that's in the Namibian desert. It has no fresh water that it's able to drink  but it drinks water out of fog. It's got bumps on the back of its wing covers. And those bumps act like a magnet for water. They have water loving tips  and waxy sides. And the fog comes in and it builds up on the tips. And it goes down the sides and goes into the critter's mouth. There is actually a scientist here at Oxford who studied this  Andrew Parker. And now kinetic and architectural firms like Grimshaw are starting to look at this as a way of coating buildings so that they gather water from the fog.    times better than our fog catching nets. CO  as a building block. Organisms don't think of CO  as a poison. Plants and organisms that make shells  coral  think of it as a building block. There is now a cement manufacturing company starting in the United States called Calera. They've borrowed the recipe from the coral reef  and they're using CO  as a building block in cement  in concrete. Instead of    cement usually emits a ton of CO  for every ton of cement. Now it's reversing that equation  and actually sequestering half a ton of CO  thanks to the recipe from the coral. None of these are using the organisms. They're really only using the blueprints or the recipes from the organisms. How does nature gather the sun's energy  This is a new kind of solar cell that's based on how a leaf works. It's self assembling. It can be put down on any substrate whatsoever. It's extremely inexpensive and rechargeable every five years. It's actually a company a company that I'm involved in called OneSun  with Paul Hawken. There are many many ways that nature filters water that takes salt out of water. We take water and push it against a membrane. And then we wonder why the membrane clogs and why it takes so much electricity. Nature does something much more elegant. And it's in every cell. Every red blood cell of your body right now has these hourglass shaped pores called aquaporins. They actually export water molecules through. It's kind of a forward osmosis. They export water molecules through  and leave solutes on the other side. A company called Aquaporin is starting to make desalination membranes mimicking this technology. Trees and bones are constantly reforming themselves along lines of stress. This algorithm has been put into a software program that's now being used to make bridges lightweight  to make building beams lightweight. Actually G.M. Opel used it to create that skeleton you see  in what's called their bionic car. It lightweighted that skeleton using a minimum amount of material  as an organism must  for the maximum amount of strength. This beetle  unlike this chip bag here  this beetle uses one material  chitin. And it finds many many ways to put many functions into it. It's waterproof. It's strong and resilient. It's breathable. It creates color through structure. Whereas that chip bag has about seven layers to do all of those things. One of our major inventions that we need to be able to do to come even close to what these organisms can do is to find a way to minimize the amount of material  the kind of material we use  and to add design to it. We use five polymers in the natural world to do everything that you see. In our world we use about     polymers to make all this. Nature is nano. Nanotechnology  nanoparticles  you hear a lot of worry about this. Loose nanoparticles. What is really interesting to me is that not many people have been asking   How can we consult nature about how to make nanotechnology safe   Nature has been doing that for a long time. Embedding nanoparticles in a material for instance  always. In fact  sulfur reducing bacteria  as part of their synthesis  they will emit  as a byproduct  nanoparticles into the water. But then right after that  they emit a protein that actually gathers and aggregates those nanoparticles so that they fall out of solution. Energy use. Organisms sip energy  because they have to work or barter for every single bit that they get. And one of the largest fields right now  in the world of energy grids  you hear about the smart grid. One of the largest consultants are the social insects. Swarm technology. There is a company called Regen. They are looking at how ants and bees find their food and their flowers in the most effective way as a whole hive. And they're having appliances in your home talk to one another through that algorithm  and determine how to minimize peak power use. There's a group of scientists in Cornell that are making what they call a synthetic tree  because they are saying   There is no pump at the bottom of a tree.  It's capillary action and transpiration pulls water up  a drop at a time  pulling it  releasing it from a leaf and pulling it up through the roots. And they're creating    you can think of it as a kind of wallpaper. They're thinking about putting it on the insides of buildings to move water up without pumps. Amazon electric eel    incredibly endangered  some of these species    create     volts of electricity with the chemicals that are in your body. Even more interesting to me is that     volts doesn't fry it. You know we use PVC  and we sheath wires with PVC for insulation. These organisms  how are they insulating against their own electric charge  These are some questions that we've yet to ask. Here's a wind turbine manufacturer that went to a whale. Humpback whale has scalloped edges on its flippers. And those scalloped edges play with flow in such a way that is reduces drag by    percent. These wind turbines can rotate in incredibly slow windspeeds  as a result. MIT just has a new radio chip that uses far less power than our chips. And it's based on the cochlear of your ear  able to pick up internet  wireless  television signals and radio signals  in the same chip. Finally  on an ecosystem scale. At Biomimicry Guild  which is my consulting company  we work with HOK Architects. We're looking at building whole cities in their planning department. And what we're saying is that  shouldn't our cities do at least as well  in terms of ecosystem services  as the native systems that they replace  So we're creating something called Ecological Performance Standards that hold cities to this higher bar. The question is    biomimicry is an incredibly powerful way to innovate. The question I would ask is   What's worth solving   If you haven't seen this  it's pretty amazing. Dr. Adam Neiman. This is a depiction of all of the water on Earth in relation to the volume of the Earth    all the ice  all the fresh water  all the sea water    and all the atmosphere that we can breathe  in relation to the volume of the Earth. And inside those balls life  over  .  billion years  has made a lush  livable place for us. And we are in a long  long line of organisms to come to this planet and ask ourselves   How can we live here gracefully over the long haul   How can we do what life has learned to do  Which is to create conditions conducive to life. Now in order to do this  the design challenge of our century  I think  we need a way to remind ourselves of those geniuses  and to somehow meet them again. One of the big ideas  one of the big projects I've been honored to work on is a new website. And I would encourage you all to please go to it. It's called AskNature.org. And what we're trying to do  in a TEDesque way  is to organize all biological information by design and engineering function. And we're working with EOL  Encyclopedia of Life  Ed Wilson's TED wish. And he's gathering all biological information on one website. And the scientists who are contributing to EOL are answering a question   What can we learn from this organism   And that information will go into AskNature.org. And hopefully  any inventor  anywhere in the world  will be able  in the moment of creation  to type in   How does nature remove salt from water   And up will come mangroves  and sea turtles and your own kidneys. And we'll begin to be able to do as Cody does  and actually be in touch with these incredible models  these elders that have been here far  far longer than we have. And hopefully  with their help  we'll learn how to live on this Earth  and on this home that is ours  but not ours alone. Thank you very much. I just want to say my name is Emmanuel Jal. And I come from a long way. I've been telling a story that has been so painful for me. It's been a tough journey for me  traveling the world  telling my story in form of a book. And also telling it like now. And also  the easiest one was when I was doing it in form of a music. So I have branded myself as a war child. I'm doing this because of an old lady in my village now  who have lost her children. There is no newspaper to cover her pain  and what she wants to change in this society. And I'm doing it for a young man who want to create a change and has no way to project his voice because he can't write. Or there is no Internet  like Facebook  MySpace  YouTube  for them to talk. Also one thing that kept me pushing this story  this painful stories out  the dreams I have  sometimes  is like the voices of the dead  that I have seen would tell me   Don't give up. Keep on going.  Because sometime I feel like stopping and not doing it  because I didn't know what I was putting myself into. Well I was born in the most difficult time  when my country was at war. I saw my village burned down. The world that meant a lot to me  I saw it vanish in my face. I saw my aunt in rape when I was only five. My mother was claimed by the war. My brothers and sisters were scattered. And up to now  me and my father were detached and I still have issues with him. Seeing people die every day  my mother crying  it's like I was raised in a violence. And that made me call myself a war child. And not only that  when I was eight I became a child soldier. I didn't know what was the war for. But one thing I knew was an image that I saw that stuck in my head. When I went to the training camp I say   I want to kill as many Muslims  and as many Arabs  as possible.  The training wasn't easy  but that was the driving force  because I wanted to revenge for my family. I wanted to revenge for my village. Luckily now things have changed because I came to discover the truth. What was actually killing us wasn't the Muslims  wasn't the Arabs. It was somebody sitting somewhere manipulating the system  and using religion to get what they want to get out of us  which is the oil  the diamond  the gold and the land. So realizing the truth gave me a position to choose  should I continue to hate  or let it go  So I happened to forgive. Now I sing music with the Muslims. I dance with them. I even had a movie out called  War Child   funded by Muslim people. So that pain has gone out. But my story is huge. So I'm just going to go into a different step now  which is easier for me. I'm going to give you poem called  Forced to Sin   which is from my album  War Child.  I talk about my story. One of the journey that I tread when I was tempted to eat my friend because we had no food and we were like around    . And only    people survived that journey. So I hope you're going to hear this. My dreams are like torment. My every moment. Voices in my brain  of friends that was slain. Friends like Lual who died by my side  of starvation. In the burning jungle  and the desert plain. Next was I  but Jesus heard my cry. As I was tempted to eat the rotten flesh of my comrade  he gave me comfort. We used to raid villages  stealing chickens  goats and sheeps  anything we could eat. I knew it was rude  but we needed food. And therefore I was forced to sin  forced to sin to make a living  forced to sin to make a living. Sometimes you gotta lose to win. Never give up. Never give in. Left home at the age of seven. One year later  live with an AK    by my side. Slept with one eye open wide. Run  duck  play dead and hide. I've seen my people die like flies. But I've never seen a dead body  at least one that I've killed. But still as I wonder  I won't go under. Guns barking like lightning and thunder. As a child so young and tender  Words I can't forget I still remember. I saw sergeant command raising his hand  no retreat  no surrender. I carry the banner of the trauma. War child  child without a mama  still fighting in the saga. Yet as I wage this new war I'm not alone in this drama. No sit or stop  as I reach for the top I'm fully dedicated like a patriotic cop. I'm on a fight  day and night. Sometime I do wrong in order to make things right. It's like I'm living a dream. First time I'm feeling like a human being. Ah  The children of Darfur. Your empty bellies on the telly and now it's you that I'm fighting for. Left home. Don't even know the day I'll ever return. My country is war torn. Music I used to hear was bombs and fire of guns. So many people die that I don't even cry no more. Ask God question  what am I here for. And why are my people poor. And why  why when the rest of the children were learning how to read and write  I was learning how to fight. I ate snails  vultures  rabbits  snakes  and anything that had life. I was ready to eat. I know it's a shame. But who is to be blamed  That's my story shared in the form of a lesson. Thank you. What energized me and kept me going is the music I do. I never saw anybody to tell my story to them so they could advise me or do therapy. So the music had been my therapy for me. It's been where I actually see heaven  where I can be happy  where I can be a child again  in dances  through music. So one thing I know about music  music is the only thing that has power to enter your cell system  your mind  your heart  influence your soul and your spirit  and can even influence the way you live without even you knowing. Music is the only thing that can make you want to wake up your bed and shake your leg  without even wanting to do it. And so the power music has I normally compare to the power love when love doesn't see a color. You know  if you fall in love with a frog  that's it. One testimony about how I find music is powerful is when I was still a soldier back then. I hated the people in the north. But I don't know why I don't hate their music. So we party and dance to their music. And one thing that shocked me is one day they brought an Arab musician to come and entertain the soldiers. And I almost broke my leg dancing to his music. But I had this question. So now I'm doing music so I know what the power of music is. So what's happening here  I've been in a painful journey. Today is day number     in which I only eat dinner. I don't eat breakfast. No lunch. And I've done a campaign called Lose to Win. Where I'm losing so that I could win the battle that I'm fighting now. So my breakfast  my lunch  I donate it to a charity that I founded because we want to build a school in Sudan. And I'm doing this because also it's a normal thing in my home  people eat one meal a day. Here I am in the West. I choose not to. So in my village now  kids there  they normally listen to BBC  or any radio  and they are waiting to know  the day Emmanuel will eat his breakfast it means he got the money to build our school. And so I made a commitment. I say   I'm gonna not eat my breakfast.  I thought I was famous enough that I would raise the money within one month  but I've been humbled. So it's taken me     days. And I said   No stop until we get it.  And like it's been done on Facebook  MySpace. The people are giving three dollars. The lowest amount we ever got was    cents. Somebody donated    cents online. I don't know how they did it. But that moved me. And so  the importance of education to me is what I'm willing to die for. I'm willing to die for this  because I know what it can do to my people. Education enlighten your brain  give you so many chances  and you're able to survive. As a nation we have been crippled. For so many years we have fed on aid. You see a    years old     years old families in a refugee camps. They only get the food that drops from the sky  from the U.N. So these people  you're killing a whole generation if you just give them aid. If anybody want to help us this is what we need. Give us tools. Give the farmers tools. It's rain. Africa is fertile. They can grow the crops. Invest in education. Education so that we have strong institution that can create a revolution to change everything. Because we have all those old men that are creating wars in Africa. They will die soon. But if you invest in education then we'll be able to change Africa. That's what I'm asking. So in order to do that  I founded a charter called Gua Africa  where we put kids in school. And now we have a couple in university. We have like    kids  ex child soldiers mixed with anybody that we feel like we want to support. And I said  I'm going to put it in practice.  And with the people that are going to follow me and help me do things. That's what I want to do to change  to make a difference in the world. Well now  my time is going  so I want to sing a song. But I'll ask you guys to stand up so we celebrate the life of a British aid worker called Emma McCune that made it possible for me to be here. I'm gonna sing this song  just to inspire you how this woman has made a difference. She came to my country and saw the importance of education. She said the only way to help Sudan is to invest in the women  educating them  educating the children  so that they could come and create a revolution in this complex society. So she even ended up marrying a commander from the SPLA. And she rescued over     child soldiers. One of them happened to be me now. And so at this moment I want to ask to celebrate Emma with me. Are you guys ready to celebrate Emma  Audience  Yes  Emmanuel Jal  All right.   This one goes to Emma McCune     Angel to rescue came one afternoon     I'm here because you rescued me     I'm proud to carry your legacy     Thank you. Bless you. R.I.P.     What would I be  Me      If Emma never rescued me  What would I be      What would I be  Me      Another starving refugee     What would I be      What would I be  Me      If Emma never rescued me  Yeah      Yeah  Yeah      You would have seen my face on the telly     Fat hungry belly     Flies in my eyes  head too big for my size     Just another little starving child     Running around in Africa  born to be wild     Praise God  praise the Almighty     for sending an angel to rescue me     I got a reason for being on this Earth     'Cause I know more than many what a life is worth     Now that I got a chance to stand my ground     I'm gonna run over mountains  leaps and bounds     I ain't an angel  hope I'll be one soon     And if I am  I wanna be like Emma McCune     Me  What would I be  Me      If Emma never rescued me      What would I be      What would I be  Me      Another starving refugee     What would I be      What would I be  Me      If Emma never rescued me  Yeah  Yeah     Yeah  Yeah      I would have probably died from starvation     Or some other wretched disease     I would have grown up with no education     Just another refugee     I stand here because somebody cared     I stand here because somebody dared     I know there is a lot of Emmas out there     Who is willing and trying to save a life of a child     What would I be  Me      If Emma never rescued me      What would I be      What would I be      Another starving refugee     I remember the time when I was small     When I couldn't read or write at all     Now I'm all grown up  I got my education     The sky is the limit and I can't be stopped by no one     How I prayed for this day to come     And I pray that the world find wisdom     To give the poor in need some assistance     Instead of putting up resistance  yeah     Sitting and waiting for the politics to fix this     It ain't gonna happen     They're all sitting on they asses     Popping champagne and sponging off the masses     Coming from a refugee boy soldier     But I still got my dignity     I gotta say it again     If Emma never rescued me     I'd be a corpse on the African plain   Is there anybody who's here in the back  some love. Big scream for Emma everybody. Yeah  I'm gonna get crazy now.   What would I be      If Emma never rescued me      What would I be      Another starving refugee     What would I be      If Emma never rescued me      Yeah  Yeah     Yeah  I would have probably died from starvation     Or some other wretched disease     I would have grown up with no education     Just another refugee   Thank you. Go save a life of a child. I need to make a confession at the outset here. A little over    years ago  I did something that I regret  something that I'm not particularly proud of. Something that  in many ways  I wish no one would ever know  but here I feel kind of obliged to reveal. In the late     s  in a moment of youthful indiscretion  I went to law school. In America  law is a professional degree  after your university degree  you go on to law school. When I got to law school  I didn't do very well. To put it mildly  I didn't do very well. I  in fact  graduated in the part of my law school class that made the top     possible. Thank you. I never practiced law a day in my life  I pretty much wasn't allowed to. But today  against my better judgment  against the advice of my own wife  I want to try to dust off some of those legal skills    what's left of those legal skills. I don't want to tell you a story. I want to make a case. I want to make a hard headed  evidence based  dare I say lawyerly case  for rethinking how we run our businesses. So  ladies and gentlemen of the jury  take a look at this. This is called the candle problem. Some of you might know it. It's created in      by a psychologist named Karl Duncker. He created this experiment that is used in many other experiments in behavioral science. And here's how it works. Suppose I'm the experimenter. I bring you into a room. I give you a candle  some thumbtacks and some matches. And I say to you   Your job is to attach the candle to the wall so the wax doesn't drip onto the table.  Now what would you do  Many people begin trying to thumbtack the candle to the wall. Doesn't work. I saw somebody kind of make the motion over here    some people have a great idea where they light the match  melt the side of the candle  try to adhere it to the wall. It's an awesome idea. Doesn't work. And eventually  after five or ten minutes  most people figure out the solution  which you can see here. The key is to overcome what's called functional fixedness. You look at that box and you see it only as a receptacle for the tacks. But it can also have this other function  as a platform for the candle. The candle problem. I want to tell you about an experiment using the candle problem  done by a scientist named Sam Glucksberg  who is now at Princeton University  US  This shows the power of incentives. He gathered his participants and said   I'm going to time you  how quickly you can solve this problem.  To one group he said   I'm going to time you to establish norms  averages for how long it typically takes someone to solve this sort of problem.  To the second group he offered rewards. He said   If you're in the top     of the fastest times  you get five dollars. If you're the fastest of everyone we're testing here today  you get    dollars.  Now this is several years ago  adjusted for inflation  it's a decent sum of money for a few minutes of work. It's a nice motivator. Question  How much faster did this group solve the problem  Answer  It took them  on average  three and a half minutes longer.  .  min longer. This makes no sense  right  I mean  I'm an American. I believe in free markets. That's not how it's supposed to work  right  If you want people to perform better  you reward them. Right  Bonuses  commissions  their own reality show. Incentivize them. That's how business works. But that's not happening here. You've got an incentive designed to sharpen thinking and accelerate creativity  and it does just the opposite. It dulls thinking and blocks creativity. What's interesting about this experiment is that it's not an aberration. This has been replicated over and over again for nearly    years. These contingent motivators    if you do this  then you get that    work in some circumstances. But for a lot of tasks  they actually either don't work or  often  they do harm. This is one of the most robust findings in social science  and also one of the most ignored. I spent the last couple of years looking at the science of human motivation  particularly the dynamics of extrinsic motivators and intrinsic motivators. And I'm telling you  it's not even close. If you look at the science  there is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does. What's alarming here is that our business operating system    think of the set of assumptions and protocols beneath our businesses  how we motivate people  how we apply our human resources   it's built entirely around these extrinsic motivators  around carrots and sticks. That's actually fine for many kinds of   th century tasks. But for   st century tasks  that mechanistic  reward and punishment approach doesn't work  often doesn't work  and often does harm. Let me show you. Glucksberg did another similar experiment  he presented the problem in a slightly different way  like this up here. Attach the candle to the wall so the wax doesn't drip onto the table. Same deal. You  we're timing for norms. You  we're incentivizing. What happened this time  This time  the incentivized group kicked the other group's butt. Why  Because when the tacks are out of the box  it's pretty easy isn't it  If then rewards work really well for those sorts of tasks  where there is a simple set of rules and a clear destination to go to. Rewards  by their very nature  narrow our focus  concentrate the mind  that's why they work in so many cases. So  for tasks like this  a narrow focus  where you just see the goal right there  zoom straight ahead to it  they work really well. But for the real candle problem  you don't want to be looking like this. The solution is on the periphery. You want to be looking around. That reward actually narrows our focus and restricts our possibility. Let me tell you why this is so important. In western Europe  in many parts of Asia  in North America  in Australia  white collar workers are doing less of this kind of work  and more of this kind of work. That routine  rule based  left brain work    certain kinds of accounting  financial analysis  computer programming    has become fairly easy to outsource  fairly easy to automate. Software can do it faster. Low cost providers can do it cheaper. So what really matters are the more right brained creative  conceptual kinds of abilities. Think about your own work. Think about your own work. Are the problems that you face  or even the problems we've been talking about here  do they have a clear set of rules  and a single solution  No. The rules are mystifying. The solution  if it exists at all  is surprising and not obvious. Everybody in this room is dealing with their own version of the candle problem. And for candle problems of any kind  in any field  those if then rewards  the things around which we've built so many of our businesses  don't work  It makes me crazy. And here's the thing. This is not a feeling. Okay  I'm a lawyer  I don't believe in feelings. This is not a philosophy. I'm an American  I don't believe in philosophy. This is a fact    or  as we say in my hometown of Washington  D.C.  a true fact. Let me give you an example. Let me marshal the evidence here. I'm not telling a story  I'm making a case. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury  some evidence  Dan Ariely  one of the great economists of our time  he and three colleagues did a study of some MIT students. They gave these MIT students a bunch of games  games that involved creativity  and motor skills  and concentration. And the offered them  for performance  three levels of rewards  small reward  medium reward  large reward. If you do really well you get the large reward  on down. What happened  As long as the task involved only mechanical skill bonuses worked as they would be expected  the higher the pay  the better the performance. Okay  But once the task called for even rudimentary cognitive skill  a larger reward led to poorer performance. Then they said   Let's see if there's any cultural bias here. Let's go to Madurai  India and test it.  Standard of living is lower. In Madurai  a reward that is modest in North American standards  is more meaningful there. Same deal. A bunch of games  three levels of rewards. What happens  People offered the medium level of rewards did no better than people offered the small rewards. But this time  people offered the highest rewards  they did the worst of all. In eight of the nine tasks we examined across three experiments  higher incentives led to worse performance. Is this some kind of touchy feely socialist conspiracy going on here  No  these are economists from MIT  from Carnegie Mellon  from the University of Chicago. Do you know who sponsored this research  The Federal Reserve Bank of the United States. That's the American experience. Let's go across the pond to the London School of Economics  LSE  London School of Economics  alma mater of eleven Nobel Laureates in economics. Training ground for great economic thinkers like George Soros  and Friedrich Hayek  and Mick Jagger. Last month  just last month  economists at LSE looked at    studies of pay for performance plans  inside of companies. Here's what they said   We find that financial incentives can result in a negative impact on overall performance.  There is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does. And what worries me  as we stand here in the rubble of the economic collapse  is that too many organizations are making their decisions  their policies about talent and people  based on assumptions that are outdated  unexamined  and rooted more in folklore than in science. And if we really want to get out of this economic mess  if we really want high performance on those definitional tasks of the   st century  the solution is not to do more of the wrong things  to entice people with a sweeter carrot  or threaten them with a sharper stick. We need a whole new approach. The good news is that the scientists who've been studying motivation have given us this new approach. It's built much more around intrinsic motivation. Around the desire to do things because they matter  because we like it  they're interesting  or part of something important. And to my mind  that new operating system for our businesses revolves around three elements  autonomy  mastery and purpose. Autonomy  the urge to direct our own lives. Mastery  the desire to get better and better at something that matters. Purpose  the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves. These are the building blocks of an entirely new operating system for our businesses. I want to talk today only about autonomy. In the   th century  we came up with this idea of management. Management did not emanate from nature. Management is not a tree  it's a television set. Somebody invented it. It doesn't mean it's going to work forever. Management is great. Traditional notions of management are great if you want compliance. But if you want engagement  self direction works better. Some examples of some kind of radical notions of self direction. You don't see a lot of it  but you see the first stirrings of something really interesting going on  what it means is paying people adequately and fairly  absolutely    getting the issue of money off the table  and then giving people lots of autonomy. Some examples. How many of you have heard of the company Atlassian  It looks like less than half. Atlassian is an Australian software company. And they do something incredibly cool. A few times a year they tell their engineers   Go for the next    hours and work on anything you want  as long as it's not part of your regular job. Work on anything you want.  Engineers use this time to come up with a cool patch for code  come up with an elegant hack. Then they present all of the stuff that they've developed to their teammates  to the rest of the company  in this wild and woolly all hands meeting at the end of the day. Being Australians  everybody has a beer. They call them FedEx Days. Why  Because you have to deliver something overnight. It's pretty  not bad. It's a huge trademark violation  but it's pretty clever. That one day of intense autonomy has produced a whole array of software fixes that might never have existed. It's worked so well that Atlassian has taken it to the next level with     time    done  famously  at Google    where engineers can spend     of their time working on anything they want. They have autonomy over their time  their task  their team  their technique. Radical amounts of autonomy. And at Google  as many of you know  about half of the new products in a typical year are birthed during that     time  things like Gmail  Orkut  Google News. Let me give you an even more radical example of it  something called the Results Only Work Environment  the ROWE   created by two American consultants  in place at a dozen companies around North America. In a ROWE people don't have schedules. They show up when they want. They don't have to be in the office at a certain time  or any time. They just have to get their work done. How they do it  when they do it  where they do it  is totally up to them. Meetings in these kinds of environments are optional. What happens  Almost across the board  productivity goes up  worker engagement goes up  worker satisfaction goes up  turnover goes down. Autonomy  mastery and purpose  the building blocks of a new way of doing things. Some of you might look at this and say   Hmm  that sounds nice  but it's Utopian.  And I say   Nope. I have proof.  The mid     s  Microsoft started an encyclopedia called Encarta. They had deployed all the right incentives  They paid professionals to write and edit thousands of articles. Well compensated managers oversaw the whole thing to make sure it came in on budget and on time. A few years later  another encyclopedia got started. Different model  right  Do it for fun. No one gets paid a cent  or a euro or a yen. Do it because you like to do it. Just    years ago  if you had gone to an economist  anywhere   Hey  I've got these two different models for creating an encyclopedia. If they went head to head  who would win      years ago you could not have found a single sober economist anywhere on planet Earth who would have predicted the Wikipedia model. This is the titanic battle between these two approaches. This is the Ali Frazier of motivation  right  This is the Thrilla in Manila. Intrinsic motivators versus extrinsic motivators. Autonomy  mastery and purpose  versus carrot and sticks  and who wins  Intrinsic motivation  autonomy  mastery and purpose  in a knockout. Let me wrap up. There is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does. Here is what science knows. One  Those   th century rewards  those motivators we think are a natural part of business  do work  but only in a surprisingly narrow band of circumstances. Two  Those if then rewards often destroy creativity. Three  The secret to high performance isn't rewards and punishments  but that unseen intrinsic drive   the drive to do things for their own sake. The drive to do things cause they matter. And here's the best part. We already know this. The science confirms what we know in our hearts. So  if we repair this mismatch between science and business  if we bring our motivation  notions of motivation into the   st century  if we get past this lazy  dangerous  ideology of carrots and sticks  we can strengthen our businesses  we can solve a lot of those candle problems  and maybe  maybe    we can change the world. I rest my case. Early visions of wireless power actually were thought of by Nikola Tesla basically about     years ago. The thought that you wouldn't want to transfer electric power wirelessly  no one ever thought of that. They thought   Who would use it if you didn't   And so  in fact  he actually set about doing a variety of things. Built the Tesla coil. This tower was built on Long Island back at the beginning of the     s. And the idea was  it was supposed to be able to transfer power anywhere on Earth. We'll never know if this stuff worked. Actually  I think the Federal Bureau of Investigation took it down for security purposes  sometime in the early     s. But the one thing that did come out of electricity is that we love this stuff so much. I mean  think about how much we love this. If you just walk outside  there are trillions of dollars that have been invested in infrastructure around the world  putting up wires to get power from where it's created to where it's used. The other thing is  we love batteries. And for those of us that have an environmental element to us  there is something like    billion disposable batteries built every year for power that  generally speaking  is used within a few inches or a few feet of where there is very inexpensive power. So  before I got here  I thought   You know  I am from North America. We do have a little bit of a reputation in the United States.  So I thought I'd better look it up first. So definition number six is the North American definition of the word  suck.  Wires suck  they really do. Think about it. Whether that's you in that picture or something under your desk. The other thing is  batteries suck too. And they really  really do. Do you ever wonder what happens to this stuff     billion of these things built. This is what happens. They fall apart  they disintegrate  and they end up here. So when you talk about expensive power  the cost per kilowatt hour to supply battery power to something is on the order of two to three hundred pounds. Think about that. The most expensive grid power in the world is thousandths of that. So fortunately  one of the other definitions of  suck  that was in there  it does create a vacuum. And nature really does abhor a vacuum. What happened back a few years ago was a group of theoretical physicists at MIT actually came up with this concept of transferring power over distance. Basically they were able to light a    watt light bulb at a distance of about two meters. It got about    percent of the efficiency    by the way  that's still a couple thousand times more efficient than a battery would be  to do the same thing. But were able to light that  and do it very successfully. This was actually the experiment. So you can see the coils were somewhat larger. The light bulb was a fairly simple task  from their standpoint. This all came from a professor waking up at night to the third night in a row that his wife's cellphone was beeping because it was running out of battery power. And he was thinking   With all the electricity that's out there in the walls  why couldn't some of that just come into the phone so I could get some sleep   And he actually came up with this concept of resonant energy transfer. But inside a standard transformer are two coils of wire. And those two coils of wire are really  really close to each other  and actually do transfer power magnetically and wirelessly  only over a very short distance. What Dr. Soljacic figured out how to do was separate the coils in a transformer to a greater distance than the size of those transformers using this technology  which is not dissimilar from the way an opera singer shatters a glass on the other side of the room. It's a resonant phenomenon for which he actually received a MacArthur Fellowship Award  which is nicknamed the Genius Award  last September  for his discovery. So how does it work  Imagine a coil. For those of you that are engineers  there's a capacitor attached to it too. And if you can cause that coil to resonate  what will happen is it will pulse at alternating current frequencies    at a fairly high frequency  by the way. And if you can bring another device close enough to the source  that will only work at exactly that frequency  you can actually get them to do what's called strongly couple  and transfer magnetic energy between them. And then what you do is  you start out with electricity  turn it into magnetic field  take that magnetic field  turn it back into electricity  and then you can use it. Number one question I get asked. I mean  people are worried about cellphones being safe. You know. What about safety  The first thing is this is not a  radiative  technology. It doesn't radiate. There aren't electric fields here. It's a magnetic field. It stays within either what we call the source  or within the device. And actually  the magnetic fields we're using are basically about the same as the Earth's magnetic field. We live in a magnetic field. And the other thing that's pretty cool about the technology is that it only transfers energy to things that work at exactly the same frequency. And it's virtually impossible in nature to make that happen. Then finally we have governmental bodies everywhere that will regulate everything we do. They've pretty much set field exposure limits  which all of the things in the stuff I'll show you today sort of sit underneath those guidelines. Mobile electronics. Home electronics. Those cords under your desk  I bet everybody here has something that looks like that or those batteries. There are industrial applications. And then finally  electric vehicles. These electric cars are beautiful. But who is going to want to plug them in  Imagine driving into your garage    we've built a system to do this    you drive into your garage  and the car charges itself  because there is a mat on the floor that's plugged into the wall. And it actually causes your car to charge safely and efficiently. Then there's all kinds of other applications. Implanted medical devices  where people don't have to die of infections anymore if you can seal the thing up. Credit cards  robot vacuum cleaners. So what I'd like to do is take a couple minutes and show you  actually  how it works. And what I'm going to do is to show you pretty much what's here. You've got a coil. That coil is connected to an R.F. amplifier that creates a high frequency oscillating magnetic field. We put one on the back of the television set. By the way  I do make it look a little bit easier than it is. There's lots of electronics and secret sauce and all kinds of intellectual property that go into it. But then what's going to happen is  it will create a field. It will cause one to get created on the other side. And if the demo gods are willing  in about    seconds or so we should see it. The    seconds actually are because we    I don't know if any of you have ever thought about plugging a T.V. in when you use just a cord. Generally  you have to go over and hit the button. So I thought we put a little computer in it that has to wake up to tell it to do that. So  I'll plug that in. It creates a magnetic field here. It causes one to be created out here. And as I said  in sort of about    seconds we should start to see ... This is a commercially    available color television set. Imagine  you get one of these things. You want to hang them on the wall. How many people want to hang them on the wall  Think about it. You don't want those ugly cords coming down. Imagine if you can get rid of it. The other thing I wanted to talk about was safety. So  there is nothing going on. I'm okay. And I'll do it again  just for safety's sake. Almost immediately  though  people ask   How small can you make this  Can you make this small enough   Because remember Dr. Soljacic's original idea was his wife's cellphone beeping. So  I wanted to show you something. We're an equal opportunity designer of this sort of thing. This a Google G . You know  it's the latest thing that's come out. It runs the Android operating system. I think I heard somebody talk about that before. It's odd. It has a battery. It also has coiled electronics that WiTricity has put into the back of it. And if I can get the camera    okay  great    you'll see  as I get sort of close... you're looking at a cellphone powered completely wirelessly. And I know some of you are Apple aficionados. So  you know they don't make it easy at Apple to get inside their phones. So we put a little sleeve on the back  but we should be able to get this guy to wake up too. And those of you that have an iPhone recognize the green center. And Nokia as well. You'll see that what we did there is put a little thing in the back  to do that  and it probably beeps  actually  as it goes on as well. But they typically use it to light up the screen. So  imagine these things could go ... they could go in your ceiling. They could go in the floor. They could go  actually  underneath your desktop. So that when you walk in or you come in from home  if you carry a purse  it works in your purse. You never have to worry about plugging these things in again. And think of what that would do for you. So I think in closing  sort of in the immortal visions of The New Yorker magazine  I thought I'd put up one more slide. And for those of you who can't read it  it says   It does appear to be some kind of wireless technology.  So  thank you very much. I'm going to talk about your mindset. Does your mindset correspond to my dataset  If not  one or the other needs upgrading  isn't it  When I talk to my students about global issues  and I listen to them in the coffee break  they always talk about  we  and  them.  And when they come back into the lecture room I ask them   What do you mean with  we  and  them    Oh  it's very easy. It's the western world and it's the developing world   they say.  We learned it in college.  And what is the definition then   The definition  Everyone knows   they say. But then you know  I press them like this. So one girl said  very cleverly   It's very easy. Western world is a long life in a small family. Developing world is a short life in a large family.  And I like that definition  because it enabled me to transfer their mindset into the dataset. And here you have the dataset. So  you can see that what we have on this axis here is size of family. One  two  three  four  five children per woman on this axis. And here  length of life  life expectancy            . Exactly what the students said was their concept about the world. And really this is about the bedroom. Whether the man and woman decide to have small family  and take care of their kids  and how long they will live. It's about the bathroom and the kitchen. If you have soap  water and food  you know  you can live long. And the students were right. It wasn't that the world consisted    the world consisted here  of one set of countries over here  which had large families and short life. Developing world. And we had one set of countries up there which was the western world. They had small families and long life. And you are going to see here the amazing thing that has happened in the world during my lifetime. Then the developing countries applied soap and water  vaccination. And all the developing world started to apply family planning. And partly to USA who help to provide technical advice and investment. And you see all the world moves over to a two child family  and a life with    to    years. But some countries remain back in this area here. And you can see we still have Afghanistan down here. We have Liberia. We have Congo. So we have countries living there. So the problem I had is that the worldview that my students had corresponds to reality in the world the year their teachers were born. And we  in fact  when we have played this over the world. I was at the Global Health Conference here in Washington last week  and I could see the wrong concept even active people in United States had  that they didn't realize the improvement of Mexico there  and China  in relation to United States. Look here when I move them forward. Here we go. They catch up. There's Mexico. It's on par with United States in these two social dimensions. There was less than five percent of the specialists in Global Health that was aware of this. This great nation  Mexico  has the problem that arms are coming from North  across the borders  so they had to stop that  because they have this strange relationship to the United States  you know. But if I would change this axis here  I would instead put income per person. Income per person. I can put that here. And we will then see a completely different picture. By the way  I'm teaching you how to use our website  Gapminder World  while I'm correcting this  because this is a free utility on the net. And when I now finally got it right  I can go back     years in history. And I can find United States up there. And I can let the other countries be shown. And now I have income per person on this axis. And United States only had some  one  two thousand dollars at that time. And the life expectancy was    to    years  on par with Afghanistan today. And what has happened in the world  I will show now. This is instead of studying history for one year at university. You can watch me for one minute now and you'll see the whole thing. You can see how the brown bubbles  which is west Europe  and the yellow one  which is the United States  they get richer and richer and also start to get healthier and healthier. And this is now     years ago  where the rest of the world remains behind. Here we come. And that was the influenza. That's why we are so scared about flu  isn't it  It's still remembered. The fall of life expectancy. And then we come up. Not until independence started. Look here You have China over there  you have India over there  and this is what has happened. Did you note there  that we have Mexico up there  Mexico is not at all on par with the United States  but they are quite close. And especially  it's interesting to see China and the United States during     years  because I have my oldest son now working for Google  after Google acquired this software. Because in fact  this is child labor. My son and his wife sat in a closet for many years and developed this. And my youngest son  who studied Chinese in Beijing. So they come in with the two perspectives I have  you know  And my son  youngest son who studied in Beijing  in China  he got a long term perspective. Whereas when my oldest son  who works for Google  he should develop by quarter  or by half year. Or Google is quite generous  so he can have one or two years to go. But in China they look generation after generation because they remember the very embarrassing period  for     years  when they went backwards. And then they would remember the first part of last century  which was really bad  and we could go by this so called Great Leap Forward. But this was     . Mao Tse Tung eventually brought health to China  and then he died  and then Deng Xiaoping started this amazing move forward. Isn't it strange to see that the United States first grew the economy  and then gradually got rich  Whereas China could get healthy much earlier  because they applied the knowledge of education  nutrition  and then also benefits of penicillin and vaccines and family planning. And Asia could have social development before they got the economic development. So to me  as a public health professor  it's not strange that all these countries grow so fast now. Because what you see here  what you see here is the flat world of Thomas Friedman  isn't it. It's not really  really flat. But the middle income countries    and this is where I suggest to my students  stop using the concept  developing world.  Because after all  talking about the developing world is like having two chapters in the history of the United States. The last chapter is about present  and president Obama  and the other is about the past  where you cover everything from Washington to Eisenhower. Because Washington to Eisenhower  that is what we find in the developing world. We could actually go to Mayflower to Eisenhower  and that would be put together into a developing world  which is rightly growing its cities in a very amazing way  which have great entrepreneurs  but also have the collapsing countries. So  how could we make better sense about this  Well  one way of trying is to see whether we could look at income distribution. This is the income distribution of peoples in the world  from   . This is where you have food to eat. These people go to bed hungry. And this is the number of people. This is      whether you have a public or a private health service system. This is where you can provide health service for your family and school for your children  and this is OECD countries  Green  Latin America  East Europe. This is East Asia  and the light blue there is South Asia. And this is how the world changed. It changed like this. Can you see how it's growing  And how hundreds of millions and billions is coming out of poverty in Asia  And it goes over here  And I come now  into projections  but I have to stop at the door of Lehman Brothers there  you know  because    that's where the projections are not valid any longer. Probably the world will do this. and then it will continue forward like this. But more or less  this is what will happen  and we have a world which cannot be looked upon as divided. We have the high income countries here  with the United States as a leading power  we have the emerging economies in the middle  which provide a lot of the funding for the bailout  and we have the low income countries here. Yeah  this is a fact that from where the money comes  they have been saving  you know  over the last decade. And here we have the low income countries where entrepreneurs are. And here we have the countries in collapse and war  like Afghanistan  Somalia  parts of Congo  Darfur. We have all this at the same time. That's why it's so problematic to describe what has happened in the developing world. Because it's so different  what has happened there. And that's why I suggest a slightly different approach of what you would call it. And you have huge differences within countries also. I heard that your departments here were by regions. Here you have Sub Saharan Africa  South Asia  East Asia  Arab states  East Europe  Latin America  and OECD. And on this axis  GDP. And on this  heath  child survival  and it doesn't come as a surprise that Africa south of Sahara is at the bottom. But when I split it  when I split it into country bubbles  the size of the bubbles here is the population. Then you see Sierra Leone and Mauritius  completely different. There is such a difference within Sub Saharan Africa. And I can split the others. Here is the South Asian  Arab world. Now all your different departments. East Europe  Latin America  and OECD countries. And here were are. We have a continuum in the world. We cannot put it into two parts. It is Mayflower down here. It is Washington here  building  building countries. It's Lincoln here  advancing them. It's Eisenhower bringing modernity into the countries. And then it's United States today  up here. And we have countries all this way. Now  this is the important thing of understanding how the world has changed. At this point I decided to make a pause. And it is my task  on behalf of the rest of the world  to convey a thanks to the U.S. taxpayers  for Demographic Health Survey. Many are not aware of    no  this is not a joke. This is very serious. It is due to USA's continuous sponsoring during    years of the very good methodology for measuring child mortality that we have a grasp of what's happening in the world. And it is U.S. government at its best  without advocacy  providing facts  that it's useful for the society. And providing data free of charge on the internet  for the world to use. Thank you very much. Quite the opposite of the World Bank  who compiled data with government money  tax money  and then they sell it to add a little profit  in a very inefficient  Gutenberg way. But the people doing that at the World Bank are among the best in the world. And they are highly skilled professionals. It's just that we would like to upgrade our international agencies to deal with the world in the modern way  as we do. And when it comes to free data and transparency  United States of America is one of the best. And that doesn't come easy from the mouth of a Swedish public health professor. And I'm not paid to come here  no. I would like to show you what happens with the data  what we can show with this data. Look here. This is the world. With income down there and child mortality. And what has happened in the world  Since       during the last    years we have had a fall in child mortality. And it is the DHS that makes it possible to know this. And we had an increase in income. And the blue former developing countries are mixing up with the former industrialized western world. We have a continuum. But we still have  of course  Congo  up there. We still have as poor countries as we have had  always  in history. And that's the bottom billion  where we've heard today about a completely new approach to do it. And how fast has this happened  Well  MDG  . The United States has not been so eager to use MDG  . But you have been the main sponsor that has enabled us to measure it  because it's the only child mortality that we can measure. And we used to say that it should fall four percent per year. Let's see what Sweden has done. We used to boast about fast social progress. That's where we were      .       Sweden was there. Same child mortality as Bangladesh had        though they had lower income. They started very well. They used the aid well. They vaccinated the kids. They get better water. And they reduced child mortality  with an amazing  .  percent per year. They beat Sweden. I run Sweden the same    year period. Second round  it's Sweden        against Egypt      . Here we go. Once again the USA is part of the reason here. They get safe water  they get food for the poor  and they get malaria eradicated.  .  percent. They are faster than the millennium development goal. And third chance for Sweden  against Brazil here. Brazil here has amazing social improvement over the last    years  and they go faster than Sweden. This means that the world is converging. The middle income countries  the emerging economy  they are catching up. They are moving to cities  where they also get better assistance for that. Well the Swedish students protest at this point. They say   This is not fair  because these countries had vaccines and antibiotics that were not available for Sweden. We have to do real time competition.  Okay. I give you Singapore  the year I was born. Singapore had twice the child mortality of Sweden. It's the most tropical country in the world  a marshland on the equator. And here we go. It took a little time for them to get independent. But then they started to grow their economy. And they made the social investment. They got away malaria. They got a magnificent health system that beat both the U.S. and Sweden. We never thought it would happen that they would win over Sweden  All these green countries are achieving millennium development goals. These yellow are just about to be doing this. These red are the countries that doesn't do it  and the policy has to be improved. Not simplistic extrapolation. We have to really find a way of supporting those countries in a better way. We have to respect the middle income countries on what they are doing. And we have to fact base the whole way we look at the world. This is dollar per person. This is HIV in the countries. The blue is Africa. The size of the bubbles is how many are HIV affected. You see the tragedy in South Africa there. About    percent of the adult population are infected. And in spite of them having quite a high income  they have a huge number of HIV infected. But you also see that there are African countries down here. There is no such thing as an HIV epidemic in Africa. There's a number  five to    countries in Africa that has the same level as Sweden and United States. And there are others who are extremely high. And I will show you that what has happened in one of the best countries  with the most vibrant economy in Africa and a good governance  Botswana. They have a very high level. It's coming down. But now it's not falling  because there  with help from PEPFAR  it's working with treatment. And people are not dying. And you can see it's not that easy  that it is war which caused this. Because here  in Congo  there is war. And here  in Zambia  there is peace. And it's not the economy. Richer country has a little higher. If I split Tanzania in its income  the richer    percent in Tanzania has more HIV than the poorest one. And it's really different within each country. Look at the provinces of Kenya. They are very different. And this is the situation you see. It's not deep poverty. It's the special situation  probably of concurrent sexual partnership among part of the heterosexual population in some countries  or some parts of countries  in south and eastern Africa. Don't make it Africa. Don't make it a race issue. Make it a local issue. And do prevention at each place  in the way it can be done there. So to just end up  there are things of suffering in the one billion poorest  which we don't know. Those who live beyond the cellphone  those who have yet to see a computer  those who have no electricity at home. This is the disease  Konzo  I spent    years elucidating in Africa. It's caused by fast processing of toxic cassava root in famine situation. It's similar to the pellagra epidemic in Mississippi in the '  s. It's similar to other nutritional diseases. It will never affect a rich person. We have seen it here in Mozambique. This is the epidemic in Mozambique. This is an epidemic in northern Tanzania. You never heard about the disease. But it's much more than Ebola that has been affected by this disease. Cause crippling throughout the world. And over the last two years        people has been crippled in the southern tip of Bandundu region. That used to be the illegal diamond trade  from the UNITA dominated area in Angola. That has now disappeared  and they are now in great economic problem. And one week ago  for the first time  there were four lines on the Internet. Don't get confused of the progress of the emerging economies and the great capacity of people in the middle income countries and in peaceful low income countries. There is still mystery in one billion. And we have to have more concepts than just developing countries and developing world. We need a new mindset. The world is converging  but    but    but not the bottom billion. They are still as poor as they've ever been. It's not sustainable  and it will not happen around one superpower. But you will remain one of the most important superpowers  and the most hopeful superpower  for the time to be. And this institution will have a very crucial role  not for United States  but for the world. So you have a very bad name  State Department. This is not the State Department. It's the World Department. And we have a high hope in you. Thank you very much. I love theater. I love the idea that you can transform  become somebody else and look at life with a completely new perspective. I love the idea that people will sit in one room for a couple of hours and listen. The idea that in that room at that moment  everyone  regardless of their age  their gender  their race  their color  their religion  comes together. At that moment  we transcend space and time together. Theater awakens our senses and opens the door to our imagination. And our ability to imagine is what makes us explorers. Our ability to imagine makes us inventors and creators and unique. I was commissioned in      to create an original show  and began developing  Upwake.   Upwake  tells the story of Zero  a modern day business man  going to work with his life in a suitcase  stuck between dream and reality and not able to decipher the two. I wanted  Upwake  to have the same audiovisual qualities as a movie would. And I wanted to let my imagination run wild. So I began drawing the story that was moving in my head. If Antoine de Saint Exupery  the author of  The Little Prince   were here  he would have drawn three holes inside that box and told you your sheep was inside. Because  if you look closely enough  things will begin to appear. This is not a box  these are the renderings of my imagination from head to paper to screen to life. In  Upwake  buildings wear suits  Zero tap dances on a giant keyboard  clones himself with a scanner  tames and whips the computer mice  sails away into dreamscape from a single piece of paper and launches into space. I wanted to create environments that moved and morphed like an illusionist. Go from one world to another in a second. I wanted to have humor  beauty  simplicity and complexity and use metaphors to suggest ideas. At the beginning of the show  for example  Zero deejays dream and reality. Technology is an instrument that allowed me to manifest my visions in high definition  live  on stage. So today  I would like to talk to you about the relationship between theater and technology. Let's start with technology. All right. Let's start with theater. Thank you.  Upwake  lasts    minutes and    seconds. I project  D animation on all the four surfaces of the stage which I interact with. The use of animation and projection was a process of discovery. I didn't use it as a special effect  but as a partner on stage. There are no special effects in  Upwake   no artifice. It's as lavish and intricate as it is simple and minimal. Three hundred and forty four frames  four and a half years and commissions later  what started as a one person show became a collaborative work of nineteen most talented artists. And here are some excerpts. Thank you. So this is  relatively  a new show that we're now beginning to tour. And in Austin  Texas  I was asked to give small demonstrations in schools during the afternoon. When I arrived at one of the schools  I certainly did not expect this  Six hundred kids  packed in a gymnasium  waiting. I was a little nervous performing without animation  costume    really    and make up. But the teachers came to me afterward and told me they hadn't seen the kids that attentive. And I think the reason why is that I was able to use their language and their reality in order to transport them into another. Something happened along the way. Zero became a person and not just a character in a play. Zero does not speak  is neither man nor woman. Zero is Zero  a little hero of the   st Century  and Zero can touch so many more people than I possibly could. It's as much about bringing new disciplines inside this box as it is about taking theater out of its box. As a street performer  I have learned that everybody wants to connect. And that usually  if you're a bit extraordinary  if you're not exactly of human appearance  then people will feel inclined to participate and to feel out loud. It's as though you made something resonate within them. It's as though the mystery of the person they're interacting with and connecting allows them to be themselves just a bit more. Because through your mask  they let theirs go. Being human is an art form. I know theater can improve the quality of people's lives  and I know theater can heal. I've worked as a doctor clown in a hospital for two years. I have seen sick kids and sad parents and doctors be lifted and transported in moments of pure joy. I know theater unites us. Zero wants to engage the generation of today and tomorrow  tell various stories through different mediums. Comic books. Quantum physics video games. And Zero wants to go to the moon. In       Zero launched a green campaign  suggesting his friends and fans to turn off their electricity every Sunday from      to      p.m. The idea is simple  basic. It's not original  but it's important  and it's important to participate. There is a revolution. It's a human and technological revolution. It's motion and emotion. It's information. It's visual. It's musical. It's sensorial. It's conceptual. It's universal. It's beyond words and numbers. It's happening. The natural progression of science and art finding each other to better touch and define the human experience. There is a revolution in the way that we think  in the way that we share  and the way that we express our stories  our evolution. This is a time of communication  connection and creative collaboration. Charlie Chaplin innovated motion pictures and told stories through music  silence  humor and poetry. He was social  and his character  The Tramp  spoke to millions. He gave entertainment  pleasure and relief to so many human beings when they needed it the most. We are not here to question the possible  we are here to challenge the impossible. In the science of today  we become artists. In the art of today  we become scientists. We design our world. We invent possibilities. We teach  touch and move. It is now that we can use the diversity of our talents to create intelligent  meaningful and extraordinary work. It's now. Thank you. I've been fascinated with crop diversity for about    years from now  ever since I stumbled across a fairly obscure academic article by a guy named Jack Harlan. And he described the diversity within crops    all the different kinds of wheat and rice and such    as a genetic resource. And he said   This genetic resource      and I'll never forget the words     stands between us and catastrophic starvation on a scale we cannot imagine.  I figured he was either really on to something  or he was one of these academic nutcases. So  I looked a little further  and what I figured out was that he wasn't a nutcase. He was the most respected scientist in the field. What he understood was that biological diversity    crop diversity    is the biological foundation of agriculture. It's the raw material  the stuff  of evolution in our agricultural crops. Not a trivial matter. And he also understood that that foundation was crumbling  literally crumbling. That indeed  a mass extinction was underway in our fields  in our agricultural system. And that this mass extinction was taking place with very few people noticing and even fewer caring. Now  I know that many of you don't stop to think about diversity in agricultural systems and  let's face it  that's logical. You don't see it in the newspaper every day. And when you go into the supermarket  you certainly don't see a lot of choices there. You see apples that are red  yellow  and green and that's about it. So  let me show you a picture of one form of diversity. Here's some beans  and there are about    or    different varieties of beans on this picture. Now  imagine each one of these varieties as being distinct from another about the same way as a poodle from a Great Dane. If I wanted to show you a picture of all the dog breeds in the world  and I put    or    of them on a slide  it would take about    slides because there about     breeds of dogs in the world. But there are    to        different varieties of beans. So if I were to going to show you all the beans in the world  and I had a slide like this  and I switched it every second  it would take up my entire TED talk  and I wouldn't have to say anything. But the interesting thing is that this diversity    and the tragic thing is    that this diversity is being lost. We have about         different varieties of wheat  and we have about   to         different varieties of rice  but it's being lost. And I want to give you an example of that. It's a bit of a personal example  in fact. In the United States  in the     s    that's where we have the best data    farmers and gardeners were growing       named varieties of apples. Imagine that.       apples with names. Today        of those are extinct  no longer to be seen again. I used to have a list of these extinct apples  and when I would go out and give a presentation  I would pass the list out in the audience. I wouldn't tell them what it was  but it was in alphabetical order  and I would tell them to look for their names  their family names  their mother's maiden name. And at the end of the speech  I would ask   How many people have found a name   And I never had fewer than two thirds of an audience hold up their hand. And I said   You know what  These apples come from your ancestors  and your ancestors gave them the greatest honor they could give them. They gave them their name. The bad news is they're extinct. The good news is a third of you didn't hold up your hand. Your apple's still out there. Find it. Make sure it doesn't join the list.  So  I want to tell you that the piece of the good news is that the Fowler apple is still out there. And there's an old book back here  and I want to read a piece from it. This book was published in     . It's called  The Apples of New York  and this is the second volume. See  we used to have a lot of apples. And the Fowler apple is described in here    I hope this doesn't surprise you    as   a beautiful fruit.  I don't know if we named the apple or if the apple named us  but ... but  to be honest  the description goes on and it says that it  doesn't rank high in quality  however.  And then he has to go even further. It sounds like it was written by an old school teacher of mine.  As grown in New York  the fruit usually fails to develop properly in size and quality and is  on the whole  unsatisfactory.  And I guess there's a lesson to be learned here  and the lesson is  so why save it  I get this question all the time. Why don't we just save the best one  And there are a couple of answers to that question. One thing is that there is no such thing as a best one. Today's best variety is tomorrow's lunch for insects or pests or disease. The other thing is that maybe that Fowler apple or maybe a variety of wheat that's not economical right now has disease or pest resistance or some quality that we're going to need for climate change that the others don't. So it's not necessary  thank God  that the Fowler apple is the best apple in the world. It's just necessary or interesting that it might have one good  unique trait. And for that reason  we ought to be saving it. Why  As a raw material  as a trait we can use in the future. Think of diversity as giving us options. And options  of course  are exactly what we need in an era of climate change. I want to show you two slides  but first  I want to tell you that we've been working at the Global Crop Diversity Trust with a number of scientists    particularly at Stanford and University of Washington    to ask the question  What's going to happen to agriculture in an era of climate change and what kind of traits and characteristics do we need in our agricultural crops to be able to adapt to this  In short  the answer is that in the future  in many countries  the coldest growing seasons are going to be hotter than anything those crops have seen in the past. The coldest growing seasons of the future  hotter than the hottest of the past. Is agriculture adapted to that  I don't know. Can fish play the piano  If agriculture hasn't experienced that  how could it be adapted  Now  the highest concentration of poor and hungry people in the world  and the place where climate change  ironically  is going to be the worst is in South Asia and sub Saharan Africa. So I've picked two examples here  and I want to show you. In the histogram before you now  the blue bars represent the historical range of temperatures  going back about far as we have temperature data. And you can see that there's some difference between one growing season and another. Some are colder  some are hotter and it's a bell shaped curve. The tallest bar is the average temperature for the most number of growing seasons. In the future  later this century  it's going to look like the red  totally out of bounds. The agricultural system and  more importantly  the crops in the field in India have never experienced this before. Here's South Africa. The same story. But the most interesting thing about South Africa is we don't have to wait for      for there to be trouble. By       if the maize  or corn  varieties  which is the dominant crop       percent of the nutrition in Southern Africa are still in the field    in       we'll have a    percent decrease in production of maize because of the climate change already in     .    percent decrease of production in the context of increasing population  that's a food crisis. It's global in nature. We will watch children starve to death on TV. Now  you may say that    years is a long way off. It's two breeding cycles for maize. We have two rolls of the dice to get this right. We have to get climate ready crops in the field  and we have to do that rather quickly. Now  the good news is that we have conserved. We have collected and conserved a great deal of biological diversity  agricultural diversity  mostly in the form of seed  and we put it in seed banks  which is a fancy way of saying a freezer. If you want to conserve seed for a long term and you want to make it available to plant breeders and researchers  you dry it and then you freeze it. Unfortunately  these seed banks are located around the world in buildings and they're vulnerable. Disasters have happened. In recent years we lost the gene bank  the seed bank in Iraq and Afghanistan. You can guess why. In Rwanda  in the Solomon Islands. And then there are just daily disasters that take place in these buildings  financial problems and mismanagement and equipment failures  and all kinds of things  and every time something like this happens  it means extinction. We lose diversity. And I'm not talking about losing diversity in the same way that you lose your car keys. I'm talking about losing it in the same way that we lost the dinosaurs  actually losing it  never to be seen again. So  a number of us got together and decided that  you know  enough is enough and we need to do something about that and we need to have a facility that can really offer protection for our biological diversity of    maybe not the most charismatic diversity. You don't look in the eyes of a carrot seed quite in the way you do a panda bear  but it's very important diversity. So we needed a really safe place  and we went quite far north to find it. To Svalbard  in fact. This is above mainland Norway. You can see Greenland there. That's at    degrees north. It's as far as you can fly on a regularly scheduled airplane. It's a remarkably beautiful landscape. I can't even begin to describe it to you. It's otherworldly  beautiful. We worked with the Norwegian government and with the NorGen  the Norwegian Genetic Resources Program  to design this facility. What you see is an artist's conception of this facility  which is built in a mountain in Svalbard. The idea of Svalbard was that it's cold  so we get natural freezing temperatures. But it's remote. It's remote and accessible so it's safe and we don't depend on mechanical refrigeration. This is more than just an artist's dream  it's now a reality. And this next picture shows it in context  in Svalbard. And here's the front door of this facility. When you open up the front door  this is what you're looking at. It's pretty simple. It's a hole in the ground. It's a tunnel  and you go into the tunnel  chiseled in solid rock  about     meters. There are now a couple of security doors  so you won't see it quite like this. Again  when you get to the back  you get into an area that's really my favorite place. I think of it as sort of a cathedral. And I know that this tags me as a bit of a nerd  but ... Some of the happiest days of my life have been spent ... in this place there. If you were to walk into one of these rooms  you would see this. It's not very exciting  but if you know what's there  it's pretty emotional. We have now about         samples of unique crop varieties. There's        samples of different varieties of rice in this facility right now. About a year from now  we'll have over half a million samples. We're going up to over a million  and someday we'll basically have samples    about     seeds    of every variety of agricultural crop that can be stored in a frozen state in this facility. This is a backup system for world agriculture. It's a backup system for all the seed banks. Storage is free. It operates like a safety deposit box. Norway owns the mountain and the facility  but the depositors own the seed. And if anything happens  then they can come back and get it. This particular picture that you see shows the national collection of the United States  of Canada  and an international institution from Syria. I think it's interesting in that this facility  I think  is almost the only thing I can think of these days where countries  literally  every country in the world    because we have seeds from every country in the world    all the countries of the world have gotten together to do something that's both long term  sustainable and positive. I can't think of anything else that's happened in my lifetime that way. I can't look you in the eyes and tell you that I have a solution for climate change  for the water crisis. Agriculture takes    percent of fresh water supplies on earth. I can't look you in the eyes and tell you that there is such a solution for those things  or the energy crisis  or world hunger  or peace in conflict. I can't look you in the eyes and tell you that I have a simple solution for that  but I can look you in the eyes and tell you that we can't solve any of those problems if we don't have crop diversity. Because I challenge you to think of an effective  efficient  sustainable solution to climate change if we don't have crop diversity. Because  quite literally  if agriculture doesn't adapt to climate change  neither will we. And if crops don't adapt to climate change  neither will agriculture  neither will we. So  this is not something pretty and nice to do. There are a lot of people who would love to have this diversity exist just for the existence value of it. It is  I agree  a nice thing to do. But it's a necessary thing to do. So  in a very real sense  I believe that we  as an international community  should get organized to complete the task. The Svalbard Global Seed Vault is a wonderful gift that Norway and others have given us  but it's not the complete answer. We need to collect the remaining diversity that's out there. We need to put it into good seed banks that can offer those seeds to researchers in the future. We need to catalog it. It's a library of life  but right now I would say we don't have a card catalog for it. And we need to support it financially. My big idea would be that while we think of it as commonplace to endow an art museum or endow a chair at a university  we really ought to be thinking about endowing wheat.    million dollars in an endowment would take care of preserving all the diversity in wheat forever. So we need to be thinking a little bit in those terms. And my final thought is that we  of course  by conserving wheat  rice  potatoes  and the other crops  we may  quite simply  end up saving ourselves. Thank you.
