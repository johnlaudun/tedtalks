Okay  I'm going to show you again something about our diets. And I would like to know what the audience is  and so who of you ever ate insects  That's quite a lot. But still  you're not representing the overall population of the Earth. Because there's    percent out there that really eats insects. But this is quite good. Why not eat insects  Well first  what are insects  Insects are animals that walk around on six legs. And here you see just a selection. There's six million species of insects on this planet  six million species. There's a few hundreds of mammals    six million species of insects. In fact  if we count all the individual organisms  we would come at much larger numbers. In fact  of all animals on Earth  of all animal species     percent walks on six legs. But if we would count all the individuals  and we take an average weight of them  it would amount to something like     to       kilograms for each of you and me on Earth. That means that in terms of biomass  insects are more abundant than we are  and we're not on a planet of men  but we're on a planet of insects. Insects are not only there in nature  but they also are involved in our economy  usually without us knowing. There was an estimation  a conservative estimation  a couple of years ago that the U.S. economy benefited by    billion dollars per year. It's a number    very large    a contribution to the economy of the United States for free. And so I looked up what the economy was paying for the war in Iraq in the same year. It was    billion U.S. dollars. Well we know that that was not a cheap war. So insects  just for free  contribute to the economy of the United States with about the same order of magnitude  just for free  without everyone knowing. And not only in the States  but in any country  in any economy. What do they do  They remove dung  they pollinate our crops. A third of all the fruits that we eat are all a result of insects taking care of the reproduction of plants. They control pests  and they're food for animals. They're at the start of food chains. Small animals eat insects. Even larger animals eat insects. But the small animals that eat insects are being eaten by larger animals  still larger animals. And at the end of the food chain  we are eating them as well. There's quite a lot of people that are eating insects. And here you see me in a small  provincial town in China  Lijiang    about two million inhabitants. If you go out for dinner  like in a fish restaurant  where you can select which fish you want to eat  you can select which insects you would like to eat. And they prepare it in a wonderful way. And here you see me enjoying a meal with caterpillars  locusts  bee pupae    delicacies. And you can eat something new everyday. There's more than       species of insects that are being eaten all around the globe. That's quite a bit more than just a few mammals that we're eating  like a cow or a pig or a sheep. More than       species    an enormous variety. And now you may think  okay  in this provincial town in China they're doing that  but not us. Well we've seen already that quite some of you already ate insects maybe occasionally  but I can tell you that every one of you is eating insects  without any exception. You're eating at least     grams per year. What are you eating  Tomato soup  peanut butter  chocolate  noodles    any processed food that you're eating contains insects  because insects are here all around us  and when they're out there in nature they're also in our crops. Some fruits get some insect damage. Those are the fruits  if they're tomato  that go to the tomato soup. If they don't have any damage  they go to the grocery. And that's your view of a tomato. But there's tomatoes that end up in a soup  and as long as they meet the requirements of the food agency  there can be all kinds of things in there  no problem. In fact  why would we put these balls in the soup  there's meat in there anyway  In fact  all our processed foods contain more proteins than we would be aware of. So anything is a good protein source already. Now you may say   Okay  so we're eating     grams just by accident.  We're even doing this on purpose. In a lot of food items that we have    I have only two items here on the slide    pink cookies or surimi sticks or  if you like  Campari    a lot of our food products that are of a red color are dyed with a natural dye. The surimi sticks  of  crabmeat  or is being sold as crab meat  is white fish that's being dyed with cochineal. Cochineal is a product of an insect that lives off these cacti. It's being produced in large amounts      to     metric tons per year in the Canary Islands in Peru  and it's big business. One gram of cochineal costs about    euros. One gram of gold is    euros. So it's a very precious thing that we're using to dye our foods. Now the situation in the world is going to change for you and me  for everyone on this Earth. The human population is growing very rapidly and is growing exponentially. Where  at the moment  we have something between six and seven billion people  it will grow to about nine billion in     . That means that we have a lot more mouths to feed  and this is something that worries more and more people. There was an FAO conference last October that was completely devoted to this. How are we going to feed this world  And if you look at the figures up there  it says that we have a third more mouths to feed  but we need an agricultural production increase of    percent. And that's especially because this world population is increasing  and it's increasing  not only in numbers  but we're also getting wealthier  and anyone that gets wealthier starts to eat more and also starts to eat more meat. And meat  in fact  is something that costs a lot of our agricultural production. Our diet consists   in  some part  of animal proteins  and at the moment  most of us here get it from livestock  from fish  from game. And we eat quite a lot of it. In the developed world it's on average    kilograms per person per year  which goes up to     in the United States and a bit lower in some other countries  but on average    kilograms per person per year. In the developing world it's much lower. It's    kilograms per person per year. But it's increasing enormously. In China in the last    years  it increased from    to     and it's still increasing. So if a third of the world population is going to increase its meat consumption from    to    on average  and a third of the world population is living in China and in India  we're having an enormous demand on meat. And of course  we are not there to say that's only for us  it's not for them. They have the same share that we have. Now to start with  I should say that we are eating way too much meat in the Western world. We could do with much  much less    and I know  I've been a vegetarian for a long time  and you can easily do without anything. You'll get proteins in any kind of food anyway. But then there's a lot of problems that come with meat production  and we're being faced with that more and more often. The first problem that we're facing is human health. Pigs are quite like us. They're even models in medicine  and we can even transplant organs from a pig to a human. That means that pigs also share diseases with us. And a pig disease  a pig virus  and a human virus can both proliferate  and because of their kind of reproduction  they can combine and produce a new virus. This has happened in the Netherlands in the     s during the classical swine fever outbreak. You get a new disease that can be deadly. We eat insects    they're so distantly related from us that this doesn't happen. So that's one point for insects. And there's the conversion factor. You take    kilograms of feed  you can get one kilogram of beef  but you can get nine kilograms of locust meat. So if you would be an entrepreneur  what would you do  With    kilograms of input  you can get either one or nine kg. of output. So far we're taking the one  or up to five kilograms of output. We're not taking the bonus yet. We're not taking the nine kilograms of output yet. So that's two points for insects. And there's the environment. If we take    kilograms of food    and it results in one kilogram of beef  the other nine kilograms are waste  and a lot of that is manure. If you produce insects  you have less manure per kilogram of meat that you produce. So less waste. Furthermore  per kilogram of manure  you have much  much less ammonia and fewer greenhouse gases when you have insect manure than when you have cow manure. So you have less waste  and the waste that you have is not as environmental malign as it is with cow dung. So that's three points for insects. Now there's a big  if   of course  and it is if insects produce meat that is of good quality. Well there have been all kinds of analyses and in terms of protein  or fat  or vitamins  it's very good. In fact  it's comparable to anything we eat as meat at the moment. And even in terms of calories  it is very good. One kilogram of grasshoppers has the same amount of calories as    hot dogs  or six Big Macs. So that's four points for insects. I can go on  and I could make many more points for insects  but time doesn't allow this. So the question is  why not eat insects  I gave you at least four arguments in favor. We'll have to. Even if you don't like it  you'll have to get used to this because at the moment     percent of all our agricultural land is being used to produce livestock. That's not only the land where the livestock is walking and feeding  but it's also other areas where the feed is being produced and being transported. We can increase it a bit at the expense of rainforests  but there's a limitation very soon. And if you remember that we need to increase agricultural production by    percent  we're not going to make it that way. We could much better change from meat  from beef  to insects. And then    percent of the world already eats insects  so we are just a minority    in a country like the U.K.  the USA  the Netherlands  anywhere. On the left hand side  you see a market in Laos where they have abundantly present all kinds of insects that you choose for dinner for the night. On the right hand side you see a grasshopper. So people there are eating them  not because they're hungry  but because they think it's a delicacy. It's just very good food. You can vary enormously. It has many benefits. In fact  we have delicacy that's very much like this grasshopper  shrimps  a delicacy being sold at a high price. Who wouldn't like to eat a shrimp  There are a few people who don't like shrimp  but shrimp  or crabs  or crayfish  are very closely related. They are delicacies. In fact  a locust is a  shrimp  of the land  and it would make very good into our diet. So why are we not eating insects yet  Well that's just a matter of mindset. We're not used to it  and we see insects as these organisms that are very different from us. That's why we're changing the perception of insects. And I'm working very hard with my colleague  Arnold van Huis  in telling people what insects are  what magnificent things they are  what magnificent jobs they do in nature. And in fact  without insects  we would not be here in this room  because if the insects die out  we will soon die out as well. If we die out  the insects will continue very happily. So we have to get used to the idea of eating insects. And some might think  well they're not yet available. Well they are. There are entrepreneurs in the Netherlands that produce them  and one of them is here in the audience  Marian Peeters  who's in the picture. I predict that later this year  you'll get them in the supermarkets    not visible  but as animal protein in the food. And maybe by       you'll buy them just knowing that this is an insect that you're going to eat. And they're being made in the most wonderful ways. A Dutch chocolate maker. So there's even a lot of design to it. Well in the Netherlands  we have an innovative Minister of Agriculture  and she puts the insects on the menu in her restaurant in her ministry. And when she got all the Ministers of Agriculture of the E.U. over to the Hague recently  she went to a high class restaurant  and they ate insects all together. It's not something that is a hobby of mine. It's really taken off the ground. So why not eat insects  You should try it yourself. A couple of years ago  we had       people all together in a square in Wageningen town  and they ate insects at the same moment  and this was still big  big news. I think soon it will not be big news anymore when we all eat insects  because it's just a normal way of doing. So you can try it yourself today  and I would say  enjoy. And I'm going to show to Bruno some first tries  and he can have the first bite. Bruno Giussani  Look at them first. Look at them first. Marcel Dicke  It's all protein. BG  That's exactly the same  one  you saw in the video actually. And it looks delicious. They just make it  with  nuts or something. MD  Thank you. I'm here today to share with you an extraordinary journey   extraordinarily rewarding journey  actually   which brought me into training rats to save human lives by detecting landmines and tuberculosis. As a child  I had two passions. One was a passion for rodents. I had all kinds of rats  mice  hamsters  gerbils  squirrels. You name it  I bred it  and I sold them to pet shops. I also had a passion for Africa. Growing up in a multicultural environment  we had African students in the house  and I learned about their stories  so different backgrounds  dependency on imported know how  goods  services  exuberant cultural diversity. Africa was truly fascinating for me. I became an industrial engineer  engineer in product development  and I focused on appropriate detection technologies  actually the first appropriate technologies for developing countries. I started working in the industry  but I wasn't really happy to contribute to a material consumer society in a linear  extracting and manufacturing mode. I quit my job to focus on the real world problem  landmines. We're talking '   now. Princess Diana is announcing on TV that landmines form a structural barrier to any development  which is really true. As long as these devices are there  or there is suspicion of landmines  you can't really enter into the land. Actually  there was an appeal worldwide for new detectors sustainable in the environments where they're needed to produce  which is mainly in the developing world. We chose rats. Why would you choose rats  Because  aren't they vermin  Well  actually rats are  in contrary to what most people think about them  rats are highly sociable creatures. And actually  our product    what you see here. There's a target somewhere here. You see an operator  a trained African with his rats in front who actually are left and right. There  the animal finds a mine. It scratches on the soil. And the animal comes back for a food reward. Very  very simple. Very sustainable in this environment. Here  the animal gets its food reward. And that's how it works. Very  very simple. Now why would you use rats  Rats have been used since the '  s last century  in all kinds of experiments. Rats have more genetic material allocated to olfaction than any other mammal species. They're extremely sensitive to smell. Moreover  they have the mechanisms to map all these smells and to communicate about it. Now how do we communicate with rats  Well don't talk rat  but we have a clicker  a standard method for animal training  which you see there. A clicker  which makes a particular sound with which you can reinforce particular behaviors. First of all  we associate the click sound with a food reward  which is smashed banana and peanuts together in a syringe. Once the animal knows click  food  click  food  click  food    so click is food    we bring it in a cage with a hole  and actually the animal learns to stick the nose in the hole under which a target scent is placed  and to do that for five seconds    five seconds  which is long for a rat. Once the animal knows this  we make the task a bit more difficult. It learns how to find the target smell in a cage with several holes  up to    holes. Then the animal learns to walk on a leash in the open and find targets. In the next step  animals learn to find real mines in real minefields. They are tested and accredited according to International Mine Action Standards  just like dogs have to pass a test. This consists of     square meters. There's a number of mines placed blindly  and the team of trainer and their rat have to find all the targets. If the animal does that  it gets a license as an accredited animal to be operational in the field    just like dogs  by the way. Maybe one slight difference  we can train rats at a fifth of the price of training the mining dog. This is our team in Mozambique  one Tanzanian trainer  who transfers the skills to these three Mozambican fellows. And you should see the pride in the eyes of these people. They have a skill  which makes them much less dependent on foreign aid. Moreover  this small team together with  of course  you need the heavy vehicles and the manual de miners to follow up. But with this small investment in a rat capacity  we have demonstrated in Mozambique that we can reduce the cost price per square meter up to    percent of what is currently normal    two dollars per square meter  we do it at   .    and we can still bring that price down. Question of scale. If you can bring in more rats  we can actually make the output even bigger. We have a demonstration site in Mozambique. Eleven African governments have seen that they can become less dependent by using this technology. They have signed the pact for peace and treaty in the Great Lakes region  and they endorse hero rats to clear their common borders of landmines. But let me bring you to a very different problem. And there's about       people last year that walked on a landmine  but worldwide last year  almost  .  million died from tuberculosis as a first cause of infection. Especially in Africa where T.B. and HIV are strongly linked  there is a huge common problem. Microscopy  the standard WHO procedure  reaches from    to    percent reliability. In Tanzania    the numbers don't lie       percent of people    T.B. patients    get diagnosed with T.B. before they die. It means that  if you have T.B.  you have more chance that you won't be detected  but will just die from T.B. secondary infections and so on. And if  however  you are detected very early  diagnosed early  treatment can start  and even in HIV positives  it makes sense. You can actually cure T.B.  even in HIV positives. So in our common language  Dutch  the name for T.B. is  tering   which  etymologically  refers to the smell of tar. Already the old Chinese and the Greek  Hippocrates  have actually published  documented  that T.B. can be diagnosed based on the volatiles exuding from patients. So what we did is we collected some samples    just as a way of testing    from hospitals  trained rats on them and see if this works  and wonder  well  we can reach    percent sensitivity     percent specificity using multiple rats in a row. This is how it works  and really  this is a generic technology. We're talking now explosives  tuberculosis  but can you imagine  you can actually put anything under there. So how does it work  You have a cassette with    samples. You put these    samples at once in the cage. An animal only needs two hundredths of a second to discriminate the scent  so it goes extremely fast. Here it's already at the third sample. This is a positive sample. It gets a click sound and comes for the food reward. And by doing so  very fast  we can have like a second line opinion to see which patients are positive  which are negative. Just as an indication  whereas a microscopist can process    samples in a day  a rat can process the same amount of samples in seven minutes only. A cage like this    A cage like this    provided that you have rats  and we have now currently    tuberculosis rats    a cage like this  operating throughout the day  can process       samples. Can you imagine the potential offspring applications    environmental detection of pollutants in soils  customs applications  detection of illicit goods in containers and so on. But let's stick first to tuberculosis. I just want to briefly highlight  the blue rods are the scores of microscopy only at the five clinics in Dar es Salaam on a population of         people  where        reported to get a test done. Microscopy for       patients. And by just presenting the samples once more to the rats and looping those results back  we were able to increase case detection rates by over    percent. Throughout last year  we've been    depending on which intervals you take    we've been consistently increasing case detection rates in five hospitals in Dar es Salaam between    and    percent. So this is really considerable. Knowing that a missed patient by microscopy infects up to    people  healthy people  per year  you can be sure that we have saved lots of lives. At least our hero rats have saved lots of lives. The way forward for us is now to standardize this technology. And there are simple things like  for instance  we have a small laser in the sniffer hole where the animal has to stick for five seconds. So  to standardize this. Also  to standardize the pellets  the food rewards  and to semi automate this in order to replicate this on a much larger scale and affect the lives of many more people. To conclude  there are also other applications at the horizon. Here is a first prototype of our camera rat  which is a rat with a rat backpack with a camera that can go under rubble to detect for victims after earthquake and so on. This is in a prototype stage. We don't have a working system here yet. To conclude  I would actually like to say  you may think this is about rats  these projects  but in the end it is about people. It is about empowering vulnerable communities to tackle difficult  expensive and dangerous humanitarian detection tasks  and doing that with a local resource  plenty available. So something completely different is to keep on challenging your perception about the resources surrounding you  whether they are environmental  technological  animal  or human. And to respectfully harmonize with them in order to foster a sustainable world. Thank you very much. Restaurants and the food industry in general are pretty much the most wasteful industry in the world. For every calorie of food that we consume here in Britain today     calories are taken to produce it. That's a lot. I want to take something rather humble to discuss. I found this in the farmers' market today  and if anybody wants to take it home and mash it later  you're very welcome to. The humble potato    and I've spent a long time     years  preparing these. And it pretty much goes through eight different forms in its lifetime. First of all  it's planted  and that takes energy. It grows and is nurtured. It's then harvested. It's then distributed  and distribution is a massive issue. It's then sold and bought  and it's then delivered to me. I basically take it  prepare it  and then people consume it    hopefully they enjoy it. The last stage is basically waste  and this is is pretty much where everybody disregards it. There are different types of waste. There's a waste of time  there's a waste of space  there's a waste of energy  and there's a waste of waste. And every business I've been working on over the past five years  I'm trying to lower each one of these elements. Okay  so you ask what a sustainable restaurant looks like. Basically a restaurant just like any other. This is the restaurant  Acorn House. Front and back. So let me run you through a few ideas. Floor  sustainable  recyclable. Chairs  recycled and recyclable. Tables  Forestry Commission. This is Norwegian Forestry Commission wood. This bench  although it was uncomfortable for my mom    she didn't like sitting on it  so she went and bought these cushions for me from a local jumble sale    reusing  a job that was pretty good. I hate waste  especially walls. If they're not working  put a shelf on it  which I did  and that shows all the customers my products. The whole business is run on sustainable energy. This is powered by wind. All of the lights are daylight bulbs. Paint is all low volume chemical  which is very important when you're working in the room all the time. I was experimenting with these    I don't know if you can see it    but there's a work surface there. And that's a plastic polymer. And I was thinking  well I'm trying to think nature  nature  nature. But I thought  no  no  experiment with resins  experiment with polymers. Will they outlive me  They probably might. Right  here's a reconditioned coffee machine. It actually looks better than a brand new one    so looking good there. Now reusing is vital. And we filter our own water. We put them in bottles  refrigerate them  and then we reuse that bottle again and again and again. Here's a great little example. If you can see this orange tree  it's actually growing in a car tire  which has been turned inside out and sewn up. It's got my compost in it  which is growing an orange tree  which is great. This is the kitchen  which is in the same room. I basically created a menu that allowed people to choose the amount and volume of food that they wanted to consume. Rather than me putting a dish down  they were allowed to help themselves to as much or as little as they wanted. Okay  it's a small kitchen. It's about five square meters. It serves     people a day. We generate quite a lot of waste. This is the waste room. You can't get rid of waste. But this story's not about eliminating it  it's about minimizing it. In here  I have produce and boxes that are unavoidable. I put my food waste into this dehydrating  desiccating macerator    turns food into an inner material  which I can store and then compost later. I compost it in this garden. All of the soil you can see there is basically my food  which is generated by the restaurant  and it's growing in these tubs  which I made out of storm felled trees and wine casks and all kinds of things. Three compost bins    go through about    kilos of raw vegetable waste a week    really good  makes fantastic compost. A couple of wormeries in there too. And actually one of the wormeries was a big wormery. I had a lot of worms in it. And I tried taking the dried food waste  putting it to the worms  going   There you go  dinner.  It was like vegetable jerky  and killed all of them. I don't know how many worms  were  in there  but I've got some heavy karma coming  I tell you. What you're seeing here is a water filtration system. This takes the water out of the restaurant  runs it through these stone beds    this is going to be mint in there    and I sort of water the garden with it. And I ultimately want to recycle that  put it back into the loos  maybe wash hands with it  I don't know. So  water is a very important aspect. I started meditating on that and created a restaurant called Waterhouse. If I could get Waterhouse to be a no carbon restaurant that is consuming no gas to start with  that would be great. I managed to do it. This restaurant looks a little bit like Acorn House    same chairs  same tables. They're all English and a little bit more sustainable. But this is an electrical restaurant. The whole thing is electric  the restaurant and the kitchen. And it's run on hydroelectricity  so I've gone from air to water. Now it's important to understand that this room is cooled by water  heated by water  filters its own water  and it's powered by water. It literally is Waterhouse. The air handling system inside it    I got rid of air conditioning because I thought there was too much consumption going on there. This is basically air handling. I'm taking the temperature of the canal outside  pumping it through the heat exchange mechanism  it's turning through these amazing sails on the roof  and that  in turn  is falling softly onto the people in the restaurant  cooling them  or heating them  as the need may be. And this is an English willow air diffuser  and that's softly moving that air current through the room. Very advanced  no air conditioning    I love it. In the canal  which is just outside the restaurant  there is hundreds of meters of coil piping. This takes the temperature of the canal and turns it into this four degrees of heat exchange. I have no idea how it works  but I paid a lot of money for it. And what's great is one of the chefs who works in that restaurant lives on this boat    it's off grid  it generates all its own power. He's growing all his own fruit  and that's fantastic. There's no accident in names of these restaurants. Acorn House is the element of wood  Waterhouse is the element of water  and I'm thinking  well  I'm going to be making five restaurants based on the five Chinese medicine acupuncture specialities. I've got water and wood. I'm just about to do fire. I've got metal and earth to come. So you've got to watch your space for that. Okay. So this is my next project. Five weeks old  it's my baby  and it's hurting real bad. The People's Supermarket. So basically  the restaurants only really hit people who believed in what I was doing anyway. What I needed to do was get food out to a broader spectrum of people. So people    i.e.  perhaps  more working class    or perhaps people who actually believe in a cooperative. This is a social enterprise  not for profit cooperative supermarket. It really is about the social disconnect between food  communities in urban settings and their relationship to rural growers    connecting communities in London to rural growers. Really important. So I'm committing to potatoes  I'm committing to milk  I'm committing to leeks and broccoli    all very important stuff. I've kept the tiles  I've kept the floors  I've kept the trunking  I've got in some recycled fridges  I've got some recycled tills  I've got some recycled trolleys. I mean  the whole thing is is super sustainable. In fact  I'm trying and I'm going to make this the most sustainable supermarket in the world. That's zero food waste. And no one's doing that just yet. In fact  Sainsbury's  if you're watching  let's have a go. Try it on. I'm going to get there before you. So nature doesn't create waste doesn't create waste as such. Everything in nature is used up in a closed continuous cycle with waste being the end of the beginning  and that's been something that's been nurturing me for some time  and it's an important statement to understand. If we don't stand up and make a difference and think about sustainable food  think about the sustainable nature of it  then we may fail. But  I wanted to get up and show you that we can do it if we're more responsible. Environmentally conscious businesses are doable. They're here. You can see I've done three so far  I've got a few more to go. The idea is embryonic. I think it's important. I think that if we reduce  reuse  refuse and recycle    right at the end there    recycling is the last point I want to make  but it's the four R's  rather than the three R's    then I think we're going to be on our way. So these three are not perfect    they're ideas. I think that there are many problems to come  but with help  I'm sure I'm going to find solutions. And I hope you all take part. Thank you very much.  Applause  It sure used to be a lot easier to be from Iceland  because until a couple of years ago  people knew hardly anything about us  and I could basically come out here and say only good things about us. But in the last couple of years we've become infamous for a couple of things. First  of course  the economic meltdown. It actually got so bad that somebody put our country up for sale on eBay. Ninety nine pence was the starting price and no reserve. Then there was the volcano that interrupted the travel plans of almost all of you and many of your friends  including President Obama. By the way  the pronunciation is  Eyjafjallajokull.  None of your media got it right. But I'm not here to share these stories about these two things exactly. I'm here to tell you the story of Audur Capital  which is a financial firm founded by me and Kristin    who you see in the picture    in the spring of       just over a year before the economic collapse hit. Why would two women who were enjoying successful careers in investment banking in the corporate sector leave to found a financial services firm  Well let it suffice to say that we felt a bit overwhelmed with testosterone. And I'm not here to say that men are to blame for the crisis and what happened in my country. But I can surely tell you that in my country  much like on Wall Street and the city of London and elsewhere  men were at the helm of the game of the financial sector  and that kind of lack of diversity and sameness leads to disastrous problems. So we decided  a bit fed up with this world and also with the strong feeling in our stomach that this wasn't sustainable  to found a financial services firm based on our values  and we decided to incorporate feminine values into the world of finance. Raised quite a few eyebrows in Iceland. We weren't known as the typical  women  women in Iceland up until then. So it was almost like coming out of the closet to actually talk about the fact that we were women and that we believed that we had a set of values and a way of doing business that would be more sustainable than what we had experienced until then. And we got a great group of people to join us    principled people with great skills  and investors with a vision and values to match ours. And together we got through the eye of the financial storm in Iceland without taking any direct losses to our equity or to the funds of our clients. And although I want to thank the talented people of our company foremost for that    and also there's a factor of luck and timing    we are absolutely convinced that we did this because of our values. So let me share with you our values. We believe in risk awareness. What does that mean  We believe that you should always understand the risks that you're taking  and we will not invest in things we don't understand. Not a complicated thing. But in       at the height of the sub prime and all the complicated financial structures  it was quite opposite to the reckless risk taking behaviors that we saw on the market. We also believe in straight talking  telling it as it is  using simple language that people understand  telling people about the downsides as well as the potential upsides  and even telling the bad news that no one wants to utter  like our lack of belief in the sustainability of the Icelandic financial sector that already we had months before the collapse hit us. And  although we do work in the financial sector  where Excel is king  we believe in emotional capital. And we believe that doing emotional due diligence is just as important as doing financial due diligence. It is actually people that make money and lose money  not Excel spreadsheets. Last  but not least  we believe in profit with principles. We care how we make our profit. So while we want to make economic profit for ourselves and our customers  we are willing to do it with a long term view  and we like to have a wider definition of profits than just the economic profit in the next quarter. So we like to see profits  plus positive social and environmental benefits  when we invest. But it wasn't just about the values  although we are convinced that they matter. It was also about a business opportunity. It's the female trend  and it's the sustainability trend  that are going to create some of the most interesting investment opportunities in the years to come. The whole thing about the female trend is not about women being better than men  it is actually about women being different from men  bringing different values and different ways to the table. So what do you get  You get better decision making  and you get less herd behavior  and both of those things hit your bottom line with very positive results. But one has to wonder  now that we've had this financial sector collapse upon us in Iceland    and by the way  Europe looks pretty bad right now  and many would say that you in America are heading for some more trouble as well. Now that we've had all that happen  and we have all this data out there telling us that it's much better to have diversity around the decision making tables  will we see business and finance change  Will government change  Well I'll give you my straight talk about this. I have days that I believe  but I have days that I'm full of doubt. Have you seen the incredible urge out there to rebuild the very things that failed us  Einstein said that this was the definition of insanity    to do the same things over and over again  hoping for a different outcome. So I guess the world is insane  because I see entirely too much of doing the same things over and over again  hoping that this time it's not going to collapse upon us. I want to see more revolutionary thinking  and I remain hopeful. Like TED  I believe in people. And I know that consumers are becoming more conscious  and they are going to start voting with their wallets  and they are going to change the face of business and finance from the outside  if they don't do it from the inside. But I'm more of the revolutionary  and I should be  I'm from Iceland. We have a long history of strong  courageous  independent women  ever since the Viking age. And I want to tell you when I first realized that women matter to the economy and to the society  I was seven    it happened to be my mother's birthday    October         . Women in Iceland took the day off. From work or from home  they took the day off  and nothing worked in Iceland. They marched into the center of Reykjavik  and they put women's issues onto the agenda. And some say this was the start of a global movement. For me it was the start of a long journey  but I decided that day to matter. Five years later  Iceland elected Vigdis Finnbogadottir as their president    first female to become head of state  single mom  a breast cancer survivor who had had one of her breasts removed. And at one of the campaign sessions  she had one of her male contenders allude to the fact that she couldn't become president    she was a woman  and even half a woman. That night she won the election  because she came back    not just because of his crappy behavior    but she came back and said   Well  I'm actually not going to breastfeed the Icelandic nation  I'm going to lead it.  So I've had incredibly many women role models that have influenced who I am and where I am today. But in spite of that  I went through the first    or    years of my career mostly in denial of being a woman. Started in corporate America  and I was absolutely convinced that it was just about the individual  that women and men would have just the same opportunities. But I've come to conclude lately that it isn't like that. We are not the same  and it's great. Because of our differences  we create and sustain life. So we should embrace our difference and aim for challenge. The final thought I want to leave with you is that I'm fed up with this tyranny of either or choices in life    either it's men or it's women. We need to start embracing the beauty of balance. So let's move away from thinking about business here and philanthropy there  and let's start thinking about doing good business. That's how we change the world. That's the only sustainable future. Thank you. I grew up in New York City  between Harlem and the Bronx. Growing up as a boy  we were taught that men had to be tough  had to be strong  had to be courageous  dominating    no pain  no emotions  with the exception of anger    and definitely no fear  that men are in charge  which means women are not  that men lead  and you should just follow and do what we say  that men are superior  women are inferior  that men are strong  women are weak  that women are of less value  property of men  and objects  particularly sexual objects. I've later come to know that to be the collective socialization of men  better known as the  man box.  See this man box has in it all the ingredients of how we define what it means to be a man. Now I also want to say  without a doubt  there are some wonderful  wonderful  absolutely wonderful things about being a man. But at the same time  there's some stuff that's just straight up twisted  and we really need to begin to challenge  look at it and really get in the process of deconstructing  redefining  what we come to know as manhood. This is my two at home  Kendall and Jay. They're    and   . Kendall's    months older than Jay. There was a period of time when my wife    her name is Tammie    and I  we just got real busy and whip  bam  boom  Kendall and Jay. And when they were about five and six  four and five  Jay could come to me  come to me crying. It didn't matter what she was crying about  she could get on my knee  she could snot my sleeve up  just cry  cry it out. Daddy's got you. That's all that's important. Now Kendall on the other hand    and like I said  he's only    months older than her    he'd come to me crying  it's like as soon as I would hear him cry  a clock would go off. I would give the boy probably about    seconds  which means  by the time he got to me  I was already saying things like   Why are you crying  Hold your head up. Look at me. Explain to me what's wrong. Tell me what's wrong. I can't understand you. Why are you crying   And out of my own frustration of my role and responsibility of building him up as a man to fit into these guidelines and these structures that are defining this man box  I would find myself saying things like   Just go in your room. Just go on  go on in your room. Sit down  get yourself together and come back and talk to me when you can talk to me like a     what  Like a man. And he's five years old. And as I grow in life  I would say to myself   My God  what's wrong with me  What am I doing  Why would I do this   And I think back. I think back to my father. There was a time in my life where we had a very troubled experience in our family. My brother  Henry  he died tragically when we were teenagers. We lived in New York City  as I said. We lived in the Bronx at the time  and the burial was in a place called Long Island  it was about two hours outside of the city. And as we were preparing to come back from the burial  the cars stopped at the bathroom to let folks take care of themselves before the long ride back to the city. And the limousine empties out. My mother  my sister  my auntie  they all get out  but my father and I stayed in the limousine  and no sooner than the women got out  he burst out crying. He didn't want cry in front of me  but he knew he wasn't going to make it back to the city  and it was better me than to allow himself to express these feelings and emotions in front of the women. And this is a man who     minutes ago  had just put his teenage son in the ground    something I just can't even imagine. The thing that sticks with me the most is that he was apologizing to me for crying in front of me  and at the same time  he was also giving me props  lifting me up  for not crying. I come to also look at this as this fear that we have as men  this fear that just has us paralyzed  holding us hostage to this man box. I can remember speaking to a    year old boy  a football player  and I asked him  I said   How would you feel if  in front of all the players  your coach told you you were playing like a girl   Now I expected him to say something like  I'd be sad  I'd be mad  I'd be angry  or something like that. No  the boy said to me    the boy said to me   It would destroy me.  And I said to myself   God  if it would destroy him to be called a girl  what are we then teaching him about girls   It took me back to a time when I was about    years old. I grew up in tenement buildings in the inner city. At this time we're living in the Bronx  and in the building next to where I lived there was a guy named Johnny. He was about    years old  and we were all about    years old    younger guys. And he was hanging out with all us younger guys. And this guy  he was up to a lot of no good. He was the kind of kid who parents would have to wonder   What is this    year old boy doing with these    year old boys   And he did spend a lot of time up to no good. He was a troubled kid. His mother had died from a heroin overdose. He was being raised by his grandmother. His father wasn't on the set. His grandmother had two jobs. He was home alone a lot. But I've got to tell you  we young guys  we looked up to this dude  man. He was cool. He was fine. That's what the sisters said   He was fine.  He was having sex. We all looked up to him. So one day  I'm out in front of the house doing something    just playing around  doing something    I don't know what. He looks out his window  he calls me upstairs  he said   Hey Anthony.  They called me Anthony growing up as a kid.  Hey Anthony  come on upstairs.  Johnny call  you go. So I run right upstairs. As he opens the door  he says to me   Do you want some   Now I immediately knew what he meant. Because for me growing up at that time  and our relationship with this man box   Do you want some   meant one of two things  sex or drugs    and we weren't doing drugs. Now my box  my card  my man box card  was immediately in jeopardy. Two things  One  I never had sex. We don't talk about that as men. You only tell your dearest  closest friend  sworn to secrecy for life  the first time you had sex. For everybody else  we go around like we've been having sex since we were two. There ain't no first time. The other thing I couldn't tell him is that I didn't want any. That's even worse. We're supposed to always be on the prowl. Women are objects  especially sexual objects. Anyway  so I couldn't tell him any of that. So  like my mother would say  make a long story short  I just simply said to Johnny   Yes.  He told me to go in his room. I go in his room. On his bed is a girl from the neighborhood named Sheila. She's    years old. She's nude. She's what I know today to be mentally ill  higher functioning at times than others. We had a whole choice of inappropriate names for her. Anyway  Johnny had just gotten through having sex with her. Well actually  he raped her  but he would say he had sex with her. Because  while Sheila never said no  she also never said yes. So he was offering me the opportunity to do the same. So when I go in the room  I close the door. Folks  I'm petrified. I stand with my back to the door so Johnny can't bust in the room and see that I'm not doing anything  and I stand there long enough that I could have actually done something. So now I'm no longer trying to figure out what I'm going to do  I'm trying to figure out how I'm going to get out of this room. So in my    years of wisdom  I zip my pants down  I walk out into the room  and lo and behold to me  while I was in the room with Sheila  Johnny was back at the window calling guys up. So now there's a living room full of guys. It was like the waiting room in the doctor's office. And they asked me how was it  and I say to them   It was good   and I zip my pants up in front of them  and I head for the door. Now I say this all with remorse  and I was feeling a tremendous amount of remorse at that time  but I was conflicted  because  while I was feeling remorse  I was excited  because I didn't get caught. But I knew I felt bad about what was happening. This fear  getting outside the man box  totally enveloped me. It was way more important to me  about me and my man box card than about Sheila and what was happening to her. See collectively  we as men are taught to have less value in women  to view them as property and the objects of men. We see that as an equation that equals violence against women. We as men  good men  the large majority of men  we operate on the foundation of this whole collective socialization. We kind of see ourselves separate  but we're very much a part of it. You see  we have to come to understand that less value  property and objectification is the foundation and the violence can't happen without it. So we're very much a part of the solution as well as the problem. The center for disease control says that men's violence against women is at epidemic proportions  is the number one health concern for women in this country and abroad. So quickly  I'd like to just say  this is the love of my life  my daughter Jay. The world I envision for her    how do I want men to be acting and behaving  I need you on board. I need you with me. I need you working with me and me working with you on how we raise our sons and teach them to be men    that it's okay to not be dominating  that it's okay to have feelings and emotions  that it's okay to promote equality  that it's okay to have women who are just friends and that's it  that it's okay to be whole  that my liberation as a man is tied to your liberation as a woman.  Applause  I remember asking a nine year old boy  I asked a nine year old boy   What would life be like for you  if you didn't have to adhere to this man box   He said to me   I would be free.  Thank you folks. Now I'm going to give you a story. It's an Indian story about an Indian woman and her journey. Let me begin with my parents. I'm a product of this visionary mother and father. Many years ago  when I was born in the '  s    '  s and '  s didn't belong to girls in India. They belonged to boys. They belonged to boys who would join business and inherit business from parents  and girls would be dolled up to get married. My family  in my city  and almost in the country  was unique. We were four of us  not one  and fortunately no boys. We were four girls and no boys. And my parents were part of a landed property family. My father defied his own grandfather  almost to the point of disinheritance  because he decided to educate all four of us. He sent us to one of the best schools in the city and gave us the best education. As I've said  when we're born  we don't choose our parents  and when we go to school  we don't choose our school. Children don't choose a school. They just get the school which parents choose for them. So this is the foundation time which I got. I grew up like this  and so did my other three sisters. And my father used to say at that time   I'm going to spread all my four daughters in four corners of the world.  I don't know if he really meant  that   but it happened. I'm the only one who's left in India. One is a British  another is an American and the third is a Canadian. So we are four of us in four corners of the world. And since I said they're my role models  I followed two things which my father and mother gave me. One  they said   Life is on an incline. You either go up  or you come down.  And the second thing  which has stayed with me  which became my philosophy of life  which made all the difference  is      things happen in your life  good or bad. Out of         are your creation. They're good. They're your creation. Enjoy it. If they're bad  they're your creation. Learn from it. Ten are nature sent over which you can't do a thing. It's like a death of a relative  or a cyclone  or a hurricane  or an earthquake. You can't do a thing about it. You've got to just respond to the situation. But that response comes out of those    points. Since I'm a product of this philosophy  of        and secondly   life on an incline   that's the way I grew up to be valuing what I got. I'm a product of opportunities  rare opportunities in the '  s and the '  s  which girls didn't get  and I was conscious of the fact that what my parents were giving me was something unique. Because all of my best school friends were getting dolled up to get married with a lot of dowry  and here I was with a tennis racket and going to school and doing all kinds of extracurricular activities. I thought I must tell you this. Why I said this  is the background. This is what comes next. I joined the Indian Police Service as a tough woman  a woman with indefatigable stamina  because I used to run for my tennis titles  etc. But I joined the Indian Police Service  and then it was a new pattern of policing. For me the policing stood for power to correct  power to prevent and power to detect. This is something like a new definition ever given in policing in India    the power to prevent. Because normally it was always said  power to detect  and that's it  or power to punish. But I decided no  it's a power to prevent  because that's what I learned when I was growing up. How do I prevent the    and never make it more than     So this was how it came into my service  and it was different from the men. I didn't want to make it different from the men  but it was different  because this was the way I was different. And I redefined policing concepts in India. I'm going to take you on two journeys  my policing journey and my prison journey. What you see  if you see the title called  PM's car held.  This was the first time a prime minister of India was given a parking ticket. That's the first time in India  and I can tell you  that's the last time you're hearing about it. It'll never happen again in India  because now it was once and forever. And the rule was  because I was sensitive  I was compassionate  I was very sensitive to injustice  and I was very pro justice. That's the reason  as a woman  I joined the Indian Police Service. I had other options  but I didn't choose them. So I'm going to move on. This is about tough policing  equal policing. Now I was known as  here's a woman that's not going to listen.  So I was sent to all indiscriminate postings  postings which others would say no. I now went to a prison assignment as a police officer. Normally police officers don't want to do prison. They sent me to prison to lock me up  thinking   Now there will be no cars and no VIPs to be given tickets to. Let's lock her up.  Here I got a prison assignment. This was a prison assignment which was one big den of criminals. Obviously  it was. But        men  of which only     were women                    plus about     were men. Terrorists  rapists  burglars  gangsters    some of them I'd sent to jail as a police officer outside. And then how did I deal with them  The first day when I went in  I didn't know how to look at them. And I said   Do you pray   When I looked at the group  I said   Do you pray   They saw me as a young  short woman wearing a pathan suit. I said   Do you pray   And they didn't say anything. I said   Do you pray  Do you want to pray   They said   Yes.  I said   All right  let's pray.  I prayed for them  and things started to change. This is a visual of education inside the prison. Friends  this has never happened  where everybody in the prison studies. I started this with community support. Government had no budget. It was one of the finest  largest volunteerism in any prison in the world. This was initiated in Delhi prison. You see one sample of a prisoner teaching a class. These are hundreds of classes. Nine to eleven  every prisoner went into the education program    the same den in which they thought they would put me behind the bar and things would be forgotten. We converted this into an ashram    from a prison to an ashram through education. I think that's the bigger change. It was the beginning of a change. Teachers were prisoners. Teachers were volunteers. Books came from donated schoolbooks. Stationery was donated. Everything was donated  because there was no budget of education for the prison. Now if I'd not done that  it would have been a hellhole. That's the second landmark. I want to show you some moments of history in my journey  which probably you would never ever get to see anywhere in the world. One  the numbers you'll never get to see. Secondly  this concept. This was a meditation program inside the prison of over       prisoners. One thousand prisoners who sat in meditation. This was one of the most courageous steps I took as a prison governor. And this is what transformed. You want to know more about this  go and see this film   Doing Time  Doing Vipassana.  You will hear about it  and you will love it. And write to me on KiranBedi.com  and I'll respond to you. Let me show you the next slide. I took the same concept of mindfulness  because  why did I bring meditation into the Indian prison  Because crime is a product of a distorted mind. It was distortion of mind which needed to be addressed to control. Not by preaching  not by telling  not by reading  but by addressing your mind. I took the same thing to the police  because police  equally  were prisoners of their minds  and they felt as if it was  we  and  they   and that the people don't cooperate. This worked. This is a feedback box called a petition box. This is a concept which I introduced to listen to complaints  listen to grievances. This was a magic box. This was a sensitive box. This is how a prisoner drew how they felt about the prison. If you see somebody in the blue    yeah  this guy    he was a prisoner  and he was a teacher. And you see  everybody's busy. There was no time to waste. Let me wrap it up. I'm currently into movements  movements of education of the under served children  which is thousands    India is all about thousands. Secondly is about the anti corruption movement in India. That's a big way we  as a small group of activists  have drafted an ombudsman bill for the government of India. Friends  you will hear a lot about it. That's the movement at the moment I'm driving  and that's the movement and ambition of my life. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We are now going through an amazing and unprecedented moment where the power dynamics between men and women are shifting very rapidly  and in many of the places where it counts the most  women are  in fact  taking control of everything. In my mother's day  she didn't go to college. Not a lot of women did. And now  for every two men who get a college degree  three women will do the same. Women  for the first time this year  became the majority of the American workforce. And they're starting to dominate lots of professions    doctors  lawyers  bankers  accountants. Over    percent of managers are women these days  and in the    professions projected to grow the most in the next decade  all but two of them are dominated by women. So the global economy is becoming a place where women are more successful than men  believe it or not  and these economic changes are starting to rapidly affect our culture    what our romantic comedies look like  what our marriages look like  what our dating lives look like  and our new set of superheroes. For a long time  this is the image of American manhood that dominated    tough  rugged  in control of his own environment. A few years ago  the Marlboro Man was retired and replaced by this much less impressive specimen  who is a parody of American manhood  and that's what we have in our commercials today. The phrase  first born son  is so deeply ingrained in our consciousness that this statistic alone shocked me. In American fertility clinics     percent of couples are requesting girls and not boys. And in places where you wouldn't think  such as South Korea  India and China  the very strict patriarchal societies are starting to break down a little  and families are no longer strongly preferring first born sons. If you think about this  if you just open your eyes to this possibility and start to connect the dots  you can see the evidence everywhere. You can see it in college graduation patterns  in job projections  in our marriage statistics  you can see it in the Icelandic elections  which you'll hear about later  and you can see it on South Korean surveys on son preference  that something amazing and unprecedented is happening with women. Certainly this is not the first time that we've had great progress with women. The '  s and the '  s also come to mind. But the difference is that  back then  it was driven by a very passionate feminist movement that was trying to project its own desires  whereas this time  it's not about passion  and it's not about any kind of movement. This is really just about the facts of this economic moment that we live in. The         year period in which men have been top dog is truly coming to an end  believe it or not  and that's why I talk about the  end of men.  Now all you men out there  this is not the moment where you tune out or throw some tomatoes  because the point is that this is happening to all of us. I myself have a husband and a father and two sons whom I dearly love. And this is why I like to talk about this  because if we don't acknowledge it  then the transition will be pretty painful. But if we do take account of it  then I think it will go much more smoothly. I first started thinking about this about a year and a half ago. I was reading headlines about the recession just like anyone else  and I started to notice a distinct pattern    that the recession was affecting men much more deeply than it was affecting women. And I remembered back to about    years ago when I read a book by Susan Faludi called  Stiffed  The Betrayal of the American Man   in which she described how hard the recession had hit men  and I started to think about whether it had gotten worse this time around in this recession. And I realized that two things were different this time around. The first was that these were no longer just temporary hits that the recession was giving men    that this was reflecting a deeper underlying shift in our global economy. And second  that the story was no longer just about the crisis of men  but it was also about what was happening to women. And now look at this second set of slides. These are headlines about what's been going on with women in the next few years. These are things we never could have imagined a few years ago. Women  a majority of the workplace. And labor statistics  women take up most managerial jobs. This second set of headlines    you can see that families and marriages are starting to shift. And look at that last headline    young women earning more than young men. That particular headline comes to me from a market research firm. They were basically asked by one of their clients who was going to buy houses in that neighborhood in the future. And they expected that it would be young families  or young men  just like it had always been. But in fact  they found something very surprising. It was young  single women who were the major purchasers of houses in the neighborhood. And so they decided  because they were intrigued by this finding  to do a nationwide survey. So they spread out all the census data  and what they found  the guy described to me as a shocker  which is that in       out of       communities  women  young women  were making more money than young men. So here you have a generation of young women who grow up thinking of themselves as being more powerful earners than the young men around them. Now  I've just laid out the picture for you  but I still haven't explained to you why this is happening. And in a moment  I'm going to show you a graph  and what you'll see on this graph    it begins in       just before women start flooding the workforce  and it brings us up to our current day. And basically what you'll see is what economists talk about as the polarization of the economy. Now what does that mean  It means that the economy is dividing into high skill  high wage jobs and low skill  low wage jobs    and that the middle  the middle skill jobs  and the middle earning jobs  are starting to drop out of the economy. This has been going on for    years now. But this process is affecting men very differently than it's affecting women. You'll see the women in red  and you'll see the men in blue. You'll watch them both drop out of the middle class  but see what happens to women and see what happens to men. There we go. So watch that. You see them both drop out of the middle class. Watch what happens to the women. Watch what happens to the men. The men sort of stagnate there  while the women zoom up in those high skill jobs. So what's that about  It looks like women got some power boost on a video game  or like they snuck in some secret serum into their birth control pills that lets them shoot up high. But of course  it's not about that. What it's about is that the economy has changed a lot. We used to have a manufacturing economy  which was about building goods and products  and now we have a service economy and an information and creative economy. Those two economies require very different skills  and as it happens  women have been much better at acquiring the new set of skills than men have been. It used to be that you were a guy who went to high school who didn't have a college degree  but you had a specific set of skills  and with the help of a union  you could make yourself a pretty good middle class life. But that really isn't true anymore. This new economy is pretty indifferent to size and strength  which is what's helped men along all these years. What the economy requires now is a whole different set of skills. You basically need intelligence  you need an ability to sit still and focus  to communicate openly  to be able to listen to people and to operate in a workplace that is much more fluid than it used to be  and those are things that women do extremely well  as we're seeing. If you look at management theory these days  it used to be that our ideal leader sounded something like General Patton  right  You would be issuing orders from above. You would be very hierarchical. You would tell everyone below you what to do. But that's not what an ideal leader is like now. If you read management books now  a leader is somebody who can foster creativity  who can get his    get the employees    see  I still say  his     who can get the employees to talk to each other  who can basically build teams and get them to be creative. And those are all things that women do very well. And then on top of that  that's created a kind of cascading effect. Women enter the workplace at the top  and then at the working class  all the new jobs that are created are the kinds of jobs that wives used to do for free at home. So that's childcare  elder care and food preparation. So those are all the jobs that are growing  and those are jobs that women tend to do. Now one day it might be that mothers will hire an out of work  middle aged  former steelworker guy to watch their children at home  and that would be good for the men  but that hasn't quite happened yet. To see what's going to happen  you can't just look at the workforce that is now  you have to look at our future workforce. And here the story is fairly simple. Women are getting college degrees at a faster rate than men. Why  This is a real mystery. People have asked men  why don't they just go back to college  to community college  say  and retool themselves  learn a new set of skills  Well it turns out that they're just very uncomfortable doing that. They're used to thinking of themselves as providers  and they can't seem to build the social networks that allow them to get through college. So for some reason men just don't end up going back to college. And what's even more disturbing is what's happening with younger boys. There's been about a decade of research about what people are calling the  boy crisis.  Now the boy crisis is this idea that very young boys  for whatever reason  are doing worse in school than very young girls  and people have theories about that. Is it because we have an excessively verbal curriculum  and little girls are better at that than little boys  Or that we require kids to sit still too much  and so boys initially feel like failures  And some people say it's because  in  th grade  boys start dropping out of school. Because I'm writing a book about all this  I'm still looking into it  so I don't have the answer. But in the mean time  I'm going to call on the worldwide education expert  who's my    year old daughter  Noa  to talk to you about why the boys in her class do worse. I mean they have much larger vocabulary. They learn much faster. They are more controlled. On the board today for losing recess tomorrow  only boys. Hanna Rosin  And why is that  Noa  Why  They were just not listening to the class while the girls sat there very nicely. HR  So there you go. This whole thesis really came home to me when I went to visit a college in Kansas City    working class college. Certainly  when I was in college  I had certain expectations about my life    that my husband and I would both work  and that we would equally raise the children. But these college girls had a completely different view of their future. Basically  the way they said it to me is that they would be working    hours a day  that their husband would maybe have a job  but that mostly he would be at home taking care of the kiddies. And this was kind of a shocker to me. And then here's my favorite quote from one of the girls   Men are the new ball and chain.  Now you laugh  but that quote has kind of a sting to it  right  And I think the reason it has a sting is because thousands of years of history don't reverse themselves without a lot of pain  and that's why I talk about us all going through this together. The night after I talked to these college girls  I also went to a men's group in Kansas  and these were exactly the kind of victims of the manufacturing economy which I spoke to you about earlier. They were men who had been contractors  or they had been building houses and they had lost their jobs after the housing boom  and they were in this group because they were failing to pay their child support. And the instructor was up there in the class explaining to them all the ways in which they had lost their identity in this new age. He was telling them they no longer had any moral authority  that nobody needed them for emotional support anymore  and they were not really the providers. So who were they  And this was very disheartening for them. And what he did was he wrote down on the board            and he said   That's her salary   and then he wrote down         .   That's your salary. So who's the man now   he asked them.  Who's the damn man  She's the man now.  And that really sent a shudder through the room. And that's part of the reason I like to talk about this  because I think it can be pretty painful  and we really have to work through it. And the other reason it's kind of urgent is because it's not just happening in the U.S. It's happening all over the world. In India  poor women are learning English faster than their male counterparts in order to staff the new call centers that are growing in India. In China  a lot of the opening up of private entrepreneurship is happening because women are starting businesses  small businesses  faster than men. And here's my favorite example  which is in South Korea. Over several decades  South Korea built one of the most patriarchal societies we know about. They basically enshrined the second class status of women in the civil code. And if women failed to birth male children  they were basically treated like domestic servants. And sometimes family would pray to the spirits to kill off a girl child so they could have a male child. But over the '  s and '  s  the South Korea government decided they wanted to rapidly industrialize  and so what they did was  they started to push women into the workforce. Now they've been asking a question since        How strongly do you prefer a first born son   And now look at the chart. That's from      to     . How much do you prefer a first born son  So you can see that these economic changes really do have a strong effect on our culture. Now because we haven't fully processed this information  it's kind of coming back to us in our pop culture in these kind of weird and exaggerated ways  where you can see that the stereotypes are changing. And so we have on the male side what one of my colleagues likes to call the  omega males  popping up  who are the males who are romantically challenged losers who can't find a job. And they come up in lots of different forms. So we have the perpetual adolescent. We have the charmless misanthrope. Then we have our Bud Light guy who's the happy couch potato. And then here's a shocker  even America's most sexiest man alive  the sexiest man alive gets romantically played these days in a movie. And then on the female side  you have the opposite  in which you have these crazy superhero women. You've got Lady Gaga. You've got our new James Bond  who's Angelina Jolie. And it's not just for the young  right  Even Helen Mirren can hold a gun these days. And so it feels like we have to move from this place where we've got these uber exaggerated images into something that feels a little more normal. So for a long time in the economic sphere  we've lived with the term  glass ceiling.  Now I've never really liked this term. For one thing  it puts men and women in a really antagonistic relationship with one another  because the men are these devious tricksters up there who've put up this glass ceiling. And we're always below the glass ceiling  the women. And we have a lot of skill and experience  but it's a trick  so how are you supposed to prepare to get through that glass ceiling  And also   shattering the glass ceiling  is a terrible phrase. What crazy person would pop their head through a glass ceiling  So the image that I like to think of  instead of glass ceiling  is the high bridge. It's definitely terrifying to stand at the foot of a high bridge  but it's also pretty exhilarating  because it's beautiful up there  and you're looking out on a beautiful view. And the great thing is there's no trick like with the glass ceiling. There's no man or woman standing in the middle about to cut the cables. There's no hole in the middle that you're going to fall through. And the great thing is that you can take anyone along with you. You can bring your husband along. You can bring your friends  or your colleagues  or your babysitter to walk along with you. And husbands can drag their wives across  if their wives don't feel ready. But the point about the high bridge is that you have to have the confidence to know that you deserve to be on that bridge  that you have all the skills and experience you need in order to walk across the high bridge  but you just have to make the decision to take the first step and do it. Thanks very much. I have been teaching for a long time  and in doing so have acquired a body of knowledge about kids and learning that I really wish more people would understand about the potential of students. In       my grandmother    bottom left for you guys over here    graduated from the eighth grade. She went to school to get the information because that's where the information lived. It was in the books  it was inside the teacher's head  and she needed to go there to get the information  because that's how you learned. Fast forward a generation  this is the one room schoolhouse  Oak Grove  where my father went to a one room schoolhouse. And he again had to travel to the school to get the information from the teacher  stored it in the only portable memory he has  which is inside his own head  and take it with him  because that is how information was being transported from teacher to student and then used in the world. When I was a kid  we had a set of encyclopedias at my house. It was purchased the year I was born  and it was extraordinary  because I did not have to wait to go to the library to get to the information. The information was inside my house and it was awesome. This was different than either generation had experienced before  and it changed the way I interacted with information even at just a small level. But the information was closer to me. I could get access to it. In the time that passes between when I was a kid in high school and when I started teaching  we really see the advent of the Internet. Right about the time that the Internet gets going as an educational tool  I take off from Wisconsin and move to Kansas  small town Kansas  where I had an opportunity to teach in a lovely  small town  rural Kansas school district  where I was teaching my favorite subject  American government. My first year    super gung ho    going to teach American government  loved the political system. Kids in the   th grade  not exactly all that enthusiastic about the American government system. Year two  learned a few things    had to change my tactic. And I put in front of them an authentic experience that allowed them to learn for themselves. I didn't tell them what to do or how to do it. I posed a problem in front of them  which was to put on an election forum for their own community. They produced flyers. They called offices. They checked schedules. They were meeting with secretaries. They produced an election forum booklet for the entire town to learn more about their candidates. They invited everyone into the school for an evening of conversation about government and politics and whether or not the streets were done well  and really had this robust experiential learning. The older teachers    more experienced    looked at me and went   Oh  there she is. That's so cute. She's trying to get that done.   She doesn't know what she's in for.  But I knew that the kids would show up  and I believed it  and I told them every week what I expected out of them. And that night  all    kids    dressed appropriately  doing their job  owning it. I had to just sit and watch. It was theirs. It was experiential. It was authentic. It meant something to them. And they will step up. From Kansas  I moved on to lovely Arizona  where I taught in Flagstaff for a number of years  this time with middle school students. Luckily  I didn't have to teach them American government. Could teach them the more exciting topic of geography. Again   thrilled  to learn. But what was interesting about this position I found myself in in Arizona  was I had this really extraordinarily eclectic group of kids to work with in a truly public school  and we got to have these moments where we would get these opportunities. And one opportunity was we got to go and meet Paul Rusesabagina  which is the gentleman that the movie  Hotel Rwanda  is based after. And he was going to speak at the high school next door to us. We could walk there. We didn't even have to pay for the buses. There was no expense cost. Perfect field trip. The problem then becomes how do you take seventh  and eighth graders to a talk about genocide and deal with the subject in a way that is responsible and respectful  and they know what to do with it. And so we chose to look at Paul Rusesabagina as an example of a gentleman who singularly used his life to do something positive. I then challenged the kids to identify someone in their own life  or in their own story  or in their own world  that they could identify that had done a similar thing. I asked them to produce a little movie about it. It's the first time we'd done this. Nobody really knew how to make these little movies on the computer  but they were into it. And I asked them to put their own voice over it. It was the most awesome moment of revelation that when you ask kids to use their own voice and ask them to speak for themselves  what they're willing to share. The last question of the assignment is  how do you plan to use your life to positively impact other people  The things that kids will say when you ask them and take the time to listen is extraordinary. Fast forward to Pennsylvania  where I find myself today. I teach at the Science Leadership Academy  which is a partnership school between the Franklin Institute and the school district of Philadelphia. We are a nine through    public school  but we do school quite differently. I moved there primarily to be part of a learning environment that validated the way that I knew that kids learned  and that really wanted to investigate what was possible when you are willing to let go of some of the paradigms of the past  of information scarcity when my grandmother was in school and when my father was in school and even when I was in school  and to a moment when we have information surplus. So what do you do when the information is all around you  Why do you have kids come to school if they no longer have to come there to get the information  In Philadelphia we have a one to one laptop program  so the kids are bringing in laptops with them everyday  taking them home  getting access to information. And here's the thing that you need to get comfortable with when you've given the tool to acquire information to students  is that you have to be comfortable with this idea of allowing kids to fail as part of the learning process. We deal right now in the educational landscape with an infatuation with the culture of one right answer that can be properly bubbled on the average multiple choice test  and I am here to share with you  it is not learning. That is the absolute wrong thing to ask  to tell kids to never be wrong. To ask them to always have the right answer doesn't allow them to learn. So we did this project  and this is one of the artifacts of the project. I almost never show them off because of the issue of the idea of failure. My students produced these info graphics as a result of a unit that we decided to do at the end of the year responding to the oil spill. I asked them to take the examples that we were seeing of the info graphics that existed in a lot of mass media  and take a look at what were the interesting components of it  and produce one for themselves of a different man made disaster from American history. And they had certain criteria to do it. They were a little uncomfortable with it  because we'd never done this before  and they didn't know exactly how to do it. They can talk    they're very smooth  and they can write very  very well  but asking them to communicate ideas in a different way was a little uncomfortable for them. But I gave them the room to just do the thing. Go create. Go figure it out. Let's see what we can do. And the student that persistently turns out the best visual product did not disappoint. This was done in like two or three days. And this is the work of the student that consistently did it. And when I sat the students down  I said   Who's got the best one   And they immediately went   There it is.  Didn't read anything.  There it is.  And I said   Well what makes it great   And they're like   Oh  the design's good  and he's using good color. And there's some ...   And they went through all that we processed out loud. And I said   Go read it.  And they're like   Oh  that one wasn't so awesome.  And then we went to another one    it didn't have great visuals  but it had great information    and spent an hour talking about the learning process  because it wasn't about whether or not it was perfect  or whether or not it was what I could create. It asked them to create for themselves  and it allowed them to fail  process  learn from. And when we do another round of this in my class this year  they will do better this time  because learning has to include an amount of failure  because failure is instructional in the process. There are a million pictures that I could click through here  and had to choose carefully    this is one of my favorites    of students learning  of what learning can look like in a landscape where we let go of the idea that kids have to come to school to get the information  but instead  ask them what they can do with it. Ask them really interesting questions. They will not disappoint. Ask them to go to places  to see things for themselves  to actually experience the learning  to play  to inquire. This is one of my favorite photos  because this was taken on Tuesday  when I asked the students to go to the polls. This is Robbie  and this was his first day of voting  and he wanted to share that with everybody and do that. But this is learning too  because we asked them to go out into real spaces. The main point is that  if we continue to look at education as if it's about coming to school to get the information and not about experiential learning  empowering student voice and embracing failure  we're missing the mark. And everything that everybody is talking about today isn't possible if we keep having an educational system that does not value these qualities  because we won't get there with a standardized test  and we won't get there with a culture of one right answer. We know how to do this better  and it's time to do better. Alisa Volkman  So this is where our story begins    the dramatic moments of the birth of our first son  Declan. Obviously a really profound moment  and it changed our lives in many ways. It also changed our lives in many unexpected ways  and those unexpected ways we later reflected on  that eventually spawned a business idea between the two of us  and a year later  we launched Babble  a website for parents. Rufus Griscom  Now I think of our story as starting a few years earlier. AV  That's true. RG  You may remember  we fell head over heels in love. AV  We did. RG  We were at the time running a very different kind of website. It was a website called Nerve.com  the tagline of which was  literate smut.  It was in theory  and hopefully in practice  a smart online magazine about sex and culture. AV  That spawned a dating site. But you can understand the jokes that we get. Sex begets babies. You follow instructions on Nerve and you should end up on Babble  which we did. And we might launch a geriatric site as our third. We'll see. RG  But for us  the continuity between Nerve and Babble was not just the life stage thing  which is  of course  relevant  but it was really more about our desire to speak very honestly about subjects that people have difficulty speaking honestly about. It seems to us that when people start dissembling  people start lying about things  that's when it gets really interesting. That's a subject that we want to dive into. And we've been surprised to find  as young parents  that there are almost more taboos around parenting than there are around sex. AV  It's true. So like we said  the early years were really wonderful  but they were also really difficult. And we feel like some of that difficulty was because of this false advertisement around parenting. We subscribed to a lot of magazines  did our homework  but really everywhere you look around  we were surrounded by images like this. And we went into parenting expecting our lives to look like this. The sun was always streaming in  and our children would never be crying. I would always be perfectly coiffed and well rested  and in fact  it was not like that at all. RG  When we lowered the glossy parenting magazine that we were looking at  with these beautiful images  and looked at the scene in our actual living room  it looked a little bit more like this. These are our three sons. And of course  they're not always crying and screaming  but with three boys  there's a decent probability that at least one of them will not be comporting himself exactly as he should. AV  Yes  you can see where the disconnect was happening for us. We really felt like what we went in expecting had nothing to do with what we were actually experiencing  and so we decided we really wanted to give it to parents straight. We really wanted to let them understand what the realities of parenting were in an honest way. RG  So today  what we would love to do is share with you four parenting taboos. And of course  there are many more than four things you can't say about parenting  but we would like to share with you today four that are particularly relevant for us personally. So the first  taboo number one  you can't say you didn't fall in love with your baby in the very first minute. I remember vividly  sitting there in the hospital. We were in the process of giving birth to our first child. AV  We  or I  RG  I'm sorry. Misuse of the pronoun. Alisa was very generously in the process of giving birth to our first child     AV  Thank you.     and I was there with a catcher's mitt. And I was there with my arms open. The nurse was coming at me with this beautiful  beautiful child  and I remember  as she was approaching me  the voices of friends saying   The moment they put the baby in your hands  you will feel a sense of love that will come over you that is  on  an order of magnitude more powerful than anything you've ever experienced in your entire life.  So I was bracing myself for the moment. The baby was coming  and I was ready for this Mack truck of love to just knock me off my feet. And instead  when the baby was placed in my hands  it was an extraordinary moment. This picture is from literally a few seconds after the baby was placed in my hands and I brought him over. And you can see  our eyes were glistening. I was overwhelmed with love and affection for my wife  with deep  deep gratitude that we had what appeared to be a healthy child. And it was also  of course  surreal. I mean  I had to check the tags and make sure. I was incredulous   Are you sure this is our child   And this was all quite remarkable. But what I felt towards the child at that moment was deep affection  but nothing like what I feel for him now  five years later. And so we've done something here that is heretical. We have charted our love for our child over time. This  as you know  is an act of heresy. You're not allowed to chart love. The reason you're not allowed to chart love is because we think of love as a binary thing. You're either in love  or you're not in love. You love  or you don't love. And I think the reality is that love is a process  and I think the problem with thinking of love as something that's binary is that it causes us to be unduly concerned that love is fraudulent  or inadequate  or what have you. And I think I'm speaking obviously here to the father's experience. But I think a lot of men do go through this sense in the early months  maybe their first year  that their emotional response is inadequate in some fashion. AV  Well  I'm glad Rufus is bringing this up  because you can notice where he dips in the first years where I think I was doing most of the work. But we like to joke  in the first few months of all of our children's lives  this is Uncle Rufus. RG  I'm a very affectionate uncle  very affectionate uncle. AV  Yes  and I often joke with Rufus when he comes home that I'm not sure he would actually be able to find our child in a line up amongst other babies. So I actually threw a pop quiz here onto Rufus. RG  Uh oh. AV  I don't want to embarrass him too much. But I am going to give him three seconds. RG  That is not fair. This is a trick question. He's not up there  is he  AV  Our eight week old son is somewhere in here  and I want to see if Rufus can actually quickly identify him. RG  The far left. AV  No  RG  Cruel. AV  Nothing more to be said. I'll move on to taboo number two. You can't talk about how lonely having a baby can be. I enjoyed being pregnant. I loved it. I felt incredibly connected to the community around me. I felt like everyone was participating in my pregnancy  all around me  tracking it down till the actual due date. I felt like I was a vessel of the future of humanity. That continued into the the hospital. It was really exhilarating. I was shower with gifts and flowers and visitors. It was a really wonderful experience  but when I got home  I suddenly felt very disconnected and suddenly shut in and shut out  and I was really surprised by those feelings. I did expect it to be difficult  have sleepless nights  constant feedings  but I did not expect the feelings of isolation and loneliness that I experienced  and I was really surprised that no one had talked to me  that I was going to be feeling this way. And I called my sister whom I'm very close to    and had three children    and I asked her   Why didn't you tell me I was going to be feeling this way  that I was going to have these    feeling incredibly isolated   And she said    I'll never forget     It's just not something you want to say to a mother that's having a baby for the first time.  RG  And of course  we think it's precisely what you really should be saying to mothers who have kids for the first time. And that this  of course  one of the themes for us is that we think that candor and brutal honesty is critical to us collectively being great parents. And it's hard not to think that part of what leads to this sense of isolation is our modern world. So Alisa's experience is not isolated. So your    percent of mothers surveyed report feelings of loneliness. Of those     percent are most lonely when their kids are zero to five    probably really zero to two. In the process of preparing this  we looked at how some other cultures around the world deal with this period of time  because here in the Western world  less than    percent of us live near our family members  which I think is part of why this is such a tough period. So to take one example among many  in Southern India there's a practice known as jholabhari  in which the pregnant woman  when she's seven or eight months pregnant  moves in with her mother and goes through a series of rituals and ceremonies  give birth and returns home to her nuclear family several months after the child is born. And this is one of many ways that we think other cultures offset this kind of lonely period. AV  So taboo number three  you can't talk about your miscarriage    but today I'll talk about mine. So after we had Declan  we kind of recalibrated our expectations. We thought we actually could go through this again and thought we knew what we would be up against. And we were grateful that I was able to get pregnant  and I soon learned that we were having a boy  and then when I was five months  we learned that we had lost our child. This is actually the last little image we have of him. And it was obviously a very difficult time    really painful. As I was working through that mourning process  I was amazed that I didn't want to see anybody. I really wanted to crawl into a hole  and I didn't really know how I was going to work my way back into my surrounding community. And I realize  I think  the way I was feeling that way  is on a really deep gut level  I was feeling a lot of shame and embarrassed  frankly  that  in some respects  I had failed at delivering what I'm genetically engineered to do. And of course  it made me question  if I wasn't able to have another child  what would that mean for my marriage  and just me as a woman. So it was a very difficult time. As I started working through it more  I started climbing out of that hole and talking with other people. I was really amazed by all the stories that started flooding in. People I interacted with daily  worked with  was friends with  family members that I had known a long time  had never shared with me their own stories. And I just remember feeling all these stories came out of the woodwork  and I felt like I happened upon this secret society of women that I now was a part of  which was reassuring and also really concerning. And I think  miscarriage is an invisible loss. There's not really a lot of community support around it. There's really no ceremony  rituals  or rites. And I think  with a death  you have a funeral  you celebrate the life  and there's a lot of community support  and it's something women don't have with miscarriage. RG  Which is too bad because  of course  it's a very common and very traumatic experience. Fifteen to    percent of all pregnancies result in miscarriage  and I find this astounding. In a survey     percent of women said that miscarriage  they felt  was partly their fault  which is awful. And astoundingly     percent said they would hide a miscarriage from their spouse. So taboo number four  you can't say that your average happiness has declined since having a child. The party line is that every single aspect of my life has just gotten dramatically better ever since I participated in the miracle that is childbirth and family. I'll never forget  I remember vividly to this day  our first son  Declan  was nine months old  and I was sitting there on the couch  and I was reading Daniel Gilbert's wonderful book   Stumbling on Happiness.  And I got about two thirds of the way through  and there was a chart on the right hand side    on the right hand page    that we've labeled here  The Most Terrifying Chart Imaginable for a New Parent.  This chart is comprised of four completely independent studies. Basically  there's this precipitous drop of marital satisfaction  which is closely aligned  we all know  with broader happiness  that doesn't rise again until your first child goes to college. So I'm sitting here looking at the next two decades of my life  this chasm of happiness that we're driving our proverbial convertible straight into. We were despondent. AV  So you can imagine  I mean again  the first few months were difficult  but we'd come out of it  and were really shocked to see this study. So we really wanted to take a deeper look at it in hopes that we would find a silver lining. RG  And that's when it's great to be running a website for parents  because we got this incredible reporter to go and interview all the scientists who conducted these four studies. We said  something is wrong here. There's something missing from these studies. It can't possibly be that bad. So Liz Mitchell did a wonderful job with this piece  and she interviewed four scientists  and she also interviewed Daniel Gilbert  and we did indeed find a silver lining. So this is our guess as to what this baseline of average happiness arguably looks like throughout life. Average happiness is  of course  inadequate  because it doesn't speak to the moment by moment experience  and so this is what we think it looks like when you layer in moment to moment experience. And so we all remember as children  the tiniest little thing    and we see it on the faces of our children    the teeniest little thing can just rocket them to these heights of just utter adulation  and then the next teeniest little thing can cause them just to plummet to the depths of despair. And it's just extraordinary to watch  and we remember it ourselves. And then  of course  as you get older  it's almost like age is a form of lithium. As you get older  you become more stable. And part of what happens  I think  in your '  s and '  s  is you start to learn to hedge your happiness. You start to realize that  Hey  I could go to this live music event and have an utterly transforming experience that will cover my entire body with goosebumps  but it's more likely that I'll feel claustrophobic and I won't be able to get a beer. So I'm not going to go. I've got a good stereo at home. So  I'm not going to go.  So your average happiness goes up  but you lose those transcendent moments. AV  Yeah  and then you have your first child  and then you really resubmit yourself to these highs and lows    the highs being the first steps  the first smile  your child reading to you for the first time    the lows being  our house  any time from six to seven every night. But you realize you resubmit yourself to losing control in a really wonderful way  which we think provides a lot of meaning to our lives and is quite gratifying. RG  And so in effect  we trade average happiness. We trade the sort of security and safety of a certain level of contentment for these transcendent moments. So where does that leave the two of us as a family with our three little boys in the thick of all this  There's another factor in our case. We have violated yet another taboo in our own lives  and this is a bonus taboo. AV  A quick bonus taboo for you  that we should not be working together  especially with three children    and we are. RG  And we had reservations about this on the front end. Everybody knows  you should absolutely not work with your spouse. In fact  when we first went out to raise money to start Babble  the venture capitalists said   We categorically don't invest in companies founded by husbands and wives  because there's an extra point of failure. It's a bad idea. Don't do it.  And we obviously went forward. We did. We raised the money  and we're thrilled that we did  because in this phase of one's life  the incredibly scarce resource is time. And if you're really passionate about what you do every day    which we are    and you're also passionate about your relationship  this is the only way we know how to do it. And so the final question that we would ask is  can we collectively bend that happiness chart upwards  It's great that we have these transcendent moments of joy  but they're sometimes pretty quick. And so how about that average baseline of happiness  Can we move that up a little bit  AV  And we kind of feel that the happiness gap  which we talked about  is really the result of walking into parenting    and really any long term partnership for that matter    with the wrong expectations. And if you have the right expectations and expectation management  we feel like it's going to be a pretty gratifying experience. RG  And so this is what    And we think that a lot of parents  when you get in there    in our case anyway    you pack your bags for a trip to Europe  and you're really excited to go. Get out of the airplane  it turns out you're trekking in Nepal. And trekking in Nepal is an extraordinary experience  particularly if you pack your bags properly and you know what you're getting in for and you're psyched. So the point of all this for us today is not just hopefully honesty for the sake of honesty  but a hope that by being more honest and candid about these experiences  that we can all collectively bend that happiness baseline up a little bit. RG   AV  Thank you. So today I'm going to talk to you about the rise of collaborative consumption. I'm going to explain what it is and try and convince you    in just    minutes    that this isn't a flimsy idea  or a short term trend  but a powerful cultural and economic force reinventing not just what we consume  but how we consume. Now I'm going to start with a deceptively simple example. Hands up    how many of you have books  CDs  DVDs  or videos lying around your house that you probably won't use again  but you can't quite bring yourself to throw away  Can't see all the hands  but it looks like all of you  right  On our shelves at home  we have a box set of the DVD series       season six to be precise. I think it was bought for us around three years ago for a Christmas present. Now my husband  Chris  and I love this show. But let's face it  when you've watched it once maybe  or twice  you don't really want to watch it again  because you know how Jack Bauer is going to defeat the terrorists. So there it sits on our shelves obsolete to us  but with immediate latent value to someone else. Now before we go on  I have a confession to make. I lived in New York for    years  and I am a big fan of  Sex and the City.  Now I'd love to watch the first movie again as sort of a warm up to the sequel coming out next week. So how easily could I swap our unwanted copy of      for a wanted copy of  Sex and the City   Now you may have noticed there's a new sector emerging called swap trading. Now the easiest analogy for swap trading is like an online dating service for all your unwanted media. What it does is use the Internet to create an infinite marketplace to match person A's  haves  with person C's  wants   whatever they may be. The other week  I went on one of these sites  appropriately called Swaptree  and there were over        items that I could instantly swap for my copy of    .  Lo and behold  there in Reseda  CA was Rondoron who wanted swap his or her  like new  copy of  Sex and the City  for my copy of    .  So in other words  what's happening here is that Swaptree solves my carrying company's sugar rush problem  a problem the economists call  the coincidence of wants   in approximately    seconds. What's even more amazing is it will print out a postage label on the spot  because it knows the way of the item. Now there are layers of technical wonder behind sites such as Swaptree  but that's not my interest  and nor is swap trading  per se. My passion  and what I've spent the last few years dedicated to researching  is the collaborative behaviors and trust mechanics inherent in these systems. When you think about it  it would have seemed like a crazy idea  even a few years ago  that I would swap my stuff with a total stranger whose real name I didn't know and without any money changing hands. Yet    percent of trades on Swaptree happen successfully  and the one percent that receive a negative rating  it's for relatively minor reasons  like the item didn't arrive on time. So what's happening here  An extremely powerful dynamic that has huge commercial and cultural implications is at play. Namely  that technology is enabling trust between strangers. We now live in a global village where we can mimic the ties that used to happen face to face  but on a scale and in ways that have never been possible before. So what's actually happening is that social networks and real time technologies are taking us back. We're bartering  trading  swapping  sharing  but they're being reinvented into dynamic and appealing forms. What I find fascinating is that we've actually wired our world to share  whether that's our neighborhood  our school  our office  or our Facebook network  and that's creating an economy of  what's mine is yours.  From the mighty eBay  the grandfather of exchange marketplaces  to car sharing companies such as GoGet  where you pay a monthly fee to rent cars by the hour  to social lending platforms such as Zopa  that will take anyone in this audience with     dollars to lend  and match them with a borrower anywhere in the world  we're sharing and collaborating again in ways that I believe are more hip than hippie. I call this  groundswell collaborative consumption.  Now before I dig into the different systems of collaborative consumption  I'd like to try and answer the question that every author rightfully gets asked  which is  where did this idea come from  Now I'd like to say I woke up one morning and said   I'm going to write about collaborative consumption   but actually it was a complicated web of seemingly disconnected ideas. Over the next minute  you're going to see a bit like a conceptual fireworks display of all the dots that went on in my head. The first thing I began to notice  how many big concepts were emerging    from the wisdom of crowds to smart mobs    around how ridiculously easy it is to form groups for a purpose. And linked to this crowd mania were examples all around the world    from the election of a president to the infamous Wikipedia  and everything in between    on what the power of numbers could achieve. Now  you know when you learn a new word  and then you start to see that word everywhere  That's what happened to me when I noticed that we are moving from passive consumers to creators  to highly enabled collaborators. What's happening is the Internet is removing the middleman  so that anyone from a T shirt designer to a knitter can make a living selling peer to peer. And the ubiquitous force of this peer to peer revolution means that sharing is happening at phenomenal rates. I mean  it's amazing to think that  in every single minute of this speech     hours of YouTube video will be loaded. Now what I find fascinating about these examples is how they're actually tapping into our primate instincts. I mean  we're monkeys  and we're born and bred to share and cooperate. And we were doing so for thousands of years  whether it's when we hunted in packs  or farmed in cooperatives  before this big system called hyper consumption came along and we built these fences and created out own little fiefdoms. But things are changing  and one of the reasons why is the digital natives  or Gen Y. They're growing up sharing    files  video games  knowledge. It's second nature to them. So we  the millennials    I am just a millennial    are like foot soldiers  moving us from a culture of  me  to a culture of  we.  The reason why it's happening so fast is because of mobile collaboration. We now live in a connected age where we can locate anyone  anytime  in real time  from a small device in our hands. All of this was going through my head towards the end of       when  of course  the great financial crash happened. Thomas Friedman is one of my favorite New York Times columnists  and he poignantly commented that      is when we hit a wall  when Mother Nature and the market both said   No more.  Now we rationally know that an economy built on hyper consumption is a Ponzi scheme. It's a house of cards. Yet  it's hard for us to individually know what to do. So all of this is a lot of twittering  right  Well it was a lot of noise and complexity in my head  until actually I realized it was happening because of four key drivers. One  a renewed belief in the importance of community  and a very redefinition of what friend and neighbor really means. A torrent of peer to peer social networks and real time technologies  fundamentally changing the way we behave. Three  pressing unresolved environmental concerns. And four  a global recession that has fundamentally shocked consumer behaviors. These four drivers are fusing together and creating the big shift    away from the   th century  defined by hyper consumption  towards the   st century  defined by collaborative consumption. I generally believe we're at an inflection point where the sharing behaviors    through sites such as Flickr and Twitter that are becoming second nature online    are being applied to offline areas of our everyday lives. From morning commutes to the way fashion is designed to the way we grow food  we are consuming and collaborating once again. So my co author  Roo Rogers  and I have actually gathered thousands of examples from all around the world of collaborative consumption. And although they vary enormously in scale  maturity and purpose  when we dived into them  we realized that they could actually be organized into three clear systems. The first is redistribution markets. Redistribution markets  just like Swaptree  are when you take a used  or pre owned  item and move it from where it's not needed to somewhere  or someone  where it is. They're increasingly thought of as the fifth 'R'    reduce  reuse  recycle  repair and redistribute    because they stretch the life cycle of a product and thereby reduce waste. The second is collaborative lifestyles. This is the sharing of resources of things like money  skills and time. I bet  in a couple of years  that phrases like  coworking  and  couchsurfing  and  time banks  are going to become a part of everyday vernacular. One of my favorite examples of collaborative lifestyles is called Landshare. It's a scheme in the U.K. that matches Mr. Jones  with some spare space in his back garden  with Mrs. Smith  a would be grower. Together they grow their own food. It's one of those ideas that's so simple  yet brilliant  you wonder why it's never been done before. Now  the third system is product service systems. This is where you pay for the benefit of the product    what it does for you    without needing to own the product outright. This idea is particularly powerful for things that have high idling capacity. And that can be anything from baby goods to fashions to    how many of you have a power drill  own a power drill  Right. That power drill will be used around    to    minutes in its entire lifetime. It's kind of ridiculous  right  Because what you need is the hole  not the drill. So why don't you rent the drill  or  even better  rent out your own drill to other people and make some money from it  These three systems are coming together  allowing people to share resources without sacrificing their lifestyles  or their cherished personal freedoms. I'm not asking people to share nicely in the sandpit. So I want to just give you an example of how powerful collaborative consumption can be to change behaviors. The average car costs       dollars a year to run. Yet  that car sits idle for    hours a day. So when you consider these two facts  it starts to make a little less sense that we have to own one outright. So this is where car sharing companies such as Zipcar and GoGet come in. In       Zipcar took     participants from across    cities    and they're all self confessed car addicts and car sharing rookies    and got them to surrender their keys for a month. Instead  these people had to walk  bike  take the train  or other forms of public transport. They could only use their Zipcar membership when absolutely necessary. The results of this challenge after just one month was staggering. It's amazing that     lbs were lost just from the extra exercise. But my favorite statistic is that     out of the     participants did not want their keys back. In other words  the car addicts had lost their urge to own. Now products service systems have been around for years. Just think of libraries and laundrettes. But I think they're entering a new age  because technology makes sharing frictionless and fun. There's a great quote that was written in the New York Times that said   Sharing is to ownership what the iPod is to the   track  what solar power is to the coal mine.  I believe also  our generation  our relationship to satisfying what we want is far less tangible than any other previous generation. I don't want the DVD  I want the movie it carries. I don't want a clunky answering machine  I want the message it saves. I don't want a CD  I want the music it plays. In other words  I don't want stuff  I want the needs or experiences it fulfills. This is fueling a massive shift from where usage trumps possessions    or as Kevin Kelly  the editor of Wired magazine  puts it   where access is better than ownership.  Now as our possessions dematerialize into the cloud  a blurry line is appearing between what's mine  what's yours  and what's ours. I want to give you one example that shows how fast this evolution is happening. This represents an eight year time span. We've gone from traditional car ownership to car sharing companies  such as Zipcar and GoGet  to ride sharing platforms that match rides to the newest entry  which is peer to peer car rental  where you can actually make money out of renting that car that sits idle for    hours a day to your neighbor. Now all of these systems require a degree of trust  and the cornerstone to this working is reputation. Now in the old consumer system  our reputation didn't matter so much  because our credit history was far more important that any kind of peer to peer review. But now with the Web  we leave a trail. With every spammer we flag  with every idea we post  comment we share  we're actually signaling how well we collaborate  and whether we can or can't be trusted. Let's go back to my first example  Swaptree. I can see that Rondoron has completed     trades with a     percent success rate. In other words  I can trust him or her. Now mark my words  it's only a matter of time before we're going to be able to perform a Google like search and see a cumulative picture of our reputation capital. And this reputation capital will determine our access to collaborative consumption. It's a new social currency  so to speak  that could become as powerful as our credit rating. Now as a closing thought  I believe we're actually in a period where we're waking up from this humongous hangover of emptiness and waste  and we're taking a leap to create a more sustainable system built to serve our innate needs for community and individual identity. I believe it will be referred to as a revolution  so to speak    when society  faced with great challenges  made a seismic shift from individual getting and spending towards a rediscovery of collective good. I'm on a mission to make sharing cool. I'm on a mission to make sharing hip. Because I really believe it can disrupt outdated modes of business  help us leapfrog over wasteful forms of hyper consumption and teach us when enough really is enough. Thank you very much. Beverly Joubert  We are truly passionate about the African wilderness and protecting the African wilderness  and so what we've done is we've focused on iconic cats. And I know  in the light of human suffering and poverty and even climate change  one would wonder  why worry about a few cats  Well today we're here to share with you a message that we have learned from a very important and special character    this leopard. Dereck Joubert  Well  our lives have basically been like a super long episode of  CSI     something like    years. In essence  what we've done is we've studied the science  we've looked at the behavior  we've seen over       kills by these amazing animals. But one of the things that science really lets us down on is that personality  that individual personality that these animals have. And here's a prime example. We found this leopard in a       year old baobab tree in Africa  the same tree that we found her mother in and her grandmother. And she took us on a journey and revealed something very special to us    her own daughter  eight days old. And the minute we found this leopard  we realized that we needed to move in  and so we basically stayed with this leopard for the next four and a half years    following her every day  getting to know her  that individual personality of hers  and really coming to know her. Now I'm destined to spend a lot of time with some unique  very  very special  individualistic and often seductive female characters. Beverly's clearly one of them  and this little leopard  Legadema  is another  and she changed our lives. BJ  Well we certainly did spend a lot of time with her    in fact  more time than even her mother did. When her mother would go off hunting  we would stay and film. And early on  a lightning bolt hit a tree    paces away from us. It was frightening  and it showered us with leaves and a pungent smell. And of course  we were stunned for a while  but when we managed to get our wits about us  we looked at it and said   My gosh  what's going to happen with that little cub  She's probably going to forever associate that deafening crash with us.  Well  we needn't have worried. She came charging out of the thicket straight towards us  sat next to us  shivering  with her back towards Dereck  and looking out. And actually from that day on  she's been comfortable with us. So we felt that that day was the day that she really earned her name. We called her Legadema  which means   light from the sky.  DJ  Now we've found these individualisms in all sorts of animals  in particular in the cats. This particular one is called Eetwidomayloh   he who greets with fire   and you can just see that about him  you know    that's his character. But only by getting up close to these animals and spending time with them can we actually even reach out and dig out these personal characters that they have. BJ  But through our investigation  we have to seek the wildest places in Africa. And right now this is in the Okavango Delta in Botswana. Yes  it is swamp. We live in the swamp in a tent  but I must tell you  every day is exhilarating. But also  our hearts are in our throats a huge amount of the time  because we're driving through water  and it's an unknown territory. But we're really there seeking and searching and filming the iconic cats. DJ  Now one of the big things  of course  everybody knows that cats hate water  and so this was a real revelation for us. And we could only find this by pushing ourselves  by going where no sane person should go    not without some prompting  by the way  from Beverly    and just pushing the envelope  going out there  pushing our vehicle  pushing ourselves. But we've managed to find that these lions are    percent bigger than any others  and they specialize in hunting buffalo in the water. BJ  And then of course  the challenge is knowing when to turn around. We don't always get that right  and on this particular day  we seriously underestimated the depth. We got deeper and deeper  until it was at Dereck's chest height. Well then we hit a deep depression  and we seriously submerged the vehicle. We actually managed to drown two million dollars' worth of camera gear. We drowned our pride  I must tell you  which was really serious  and we seized the engine. DJ  And of course  one of the rules that we have in the vehicle is that he who drowns the vehicle gets to swim with the crocodiles. You will notice also that all of these images here are taken from the top angle by Beverly    the dry top angle  by the way. But all the places we get stuck in really have great views. And it wasn't a moment  and these lions came back towards us  and Beverly was able to get a great photograph. BJ  But we truly do spend day and night trying to capture unique footage. And    years ago  we did a film called  Eternal Enemies  where we managed to capture this unusual disturbing behavior across two species    lions and hyenas. And surprisingly  it became a cult film. And we can only work that out as people were seeing parallels between the thuggish side of nature and gang warfare. DJ  It was amazing  because you can see that this lion is doing exactly what his name  Eetwidomayloh  represents. He's focused on this hyena  and he is going to get it. But that's  I think  what this is all about  is that these individuals have these personalities and characters. But for us to get them  not only do we push ourselves  but we live by certain rules of engagement  which mean we can't interfere. This sort of behavior has been going on for three  four  five million years  and we can't step in and say   That's wrong  and that's right.  But that's not always easy for us. BJ  So  as Dereck says  we have to work through extremes    extreme temperatures  push ourselves at night. Sleep deprivation is extreme. We're on the edge through a large part of the time. But  for    years  we tried to capture lions and elephants together    and never ever managed until this particular night. And I have to tell you that it was a disturbing night for me. I had tears rolling down my cheeks. I was shaking with anxiety  but I knew that  I had  to capture something that had never been seen before  had never been documented. And I do believe you should stay with us. DJ  The amazing thing about these moments    and this is probably a highlight of our career    is that you never know how it's going to end. Many people believe  in fact  that death begins in the eyes  not in the heart  not in the lungs  and that's when people give up hope  or when any life form gives up hope. And you can see the start of it here. This elephant  against overwhelming odds  simply gives up hope. But by the same token  you can get your hope back again. So just when you think it's all over  something else happens  some spark gets into you  some sort of will to fight    that iron will that we all have  that this elephant has  that conservation has  that big cats have. Everything has that will to survive  to fight  to push through that mental barrier and to keep going. And for us  in many ways  this elephant has become a symbol of inspiration for us  a symbol of that hope as we go forward in our work. Now back to the leopard. We were spending so much time with this leopard and getting to understand her individualism  her personal character  that maybe we were taking it a little bit far. We were perhaps taking her for granted  and maybe she didn't like that that much. This is about couples working together  and so I do need to say that within the vehicle we have quite strict territories  Beverly and I. Beverly sits on the one side where all her camera gear is  and I'm on the other side where my space is. These are precious to us  these divides. BJ  But when this little cub saw that I had vacated my seat and climbed to the back to get some camera gear  she came in like a curious cat to come and investigate. It was phenomenal  and we felt grateful that she trusted us to that extent. But at the same time  we were concerned that if she created this as a habit and jumped into somebody else's car  it might not turn out the same way    she might get shot for that. So we knew we had to react quickly. And the only way we thought we could without scaring her is to try and simulate a growl like her mother would make    a hiss and a sound. So Dereck turned on the heater fan in the car    very innovative. DJ  It was the only way for me to save the marriage  because Beverly felt she was being replaced  you see. But really and truly  this was how this little leopard was displaying her individual personality. But nothing prepared us for what happened next in our relationship with her  when she started hunting. BJ  And on this first hunt  we truly were excited. It was like watching a graduation ceremony. We felt like we were surrogate parents. And of course  we knew now that she was going to survive. But only when we saw the tiny baby baboon clinging to the mother's fur did we realize that something very unique was taking place here with Legadema. And of course  the baby baboon was so innocent  it didn't turn and run. So what we watched over the next couple of hours was very unique. It was absolutely amazing when she picked it up to safety  protecting it from the hyena. And over the next five hours  she took care of it. We realized that we actually don't know everything  and that nature is so unpredictable  we have to be open at all times. DJ  Okay  so she was a little bit rough. But in fact  what we were seeing here was interesting. Because she is a cub wanting to play  but she was also a predator needing to kill  and yet conflicted in some way  because she was also an emerging mother. She had this maternal instinct  much like a young girl on her way to womanhood  and so this really took us to this new level of understanding that personality. BJ  And of course  through the night  they lay together. They ended up sleeping for hours. But I have to tell you    everybody always asks   What happened to the baby baboon   It did die  and we suspect it was from the freezing winter nights. DJ  So at this stage  I guess  we had very  very firm ideas on what conservation meant. We had to deal with these individual personalities. We had to deal with them with respect and celebrate them. And so we  with the National Geographic  formed the Big Cats Initiative to march forward into conservation  taking care of the big cats that we loved    and then had an opportunity to look back over the last    years to see how well we had all collectively been doing. So when Beverly and I were born  there were         lions  and today there are       . Tigers haven't fared any better           down to maybe      . BJ  And then cheetahs have crashed all the way down to       . Leopards have plummeted from         down to a mere       . Now in the extraordinary time that we have worked with Legadema    which is really over a five year period           leopards were legally shot by safari hunters. And that's not the only leopards that were being killed through that period. There's an immense amount of poaching as well  and so possibly the same amount. It's simply not sustainable. We admire them  and we fear them  and yet  as man  we want to steal their power. It used to be the time where only kings wore a leopard skin  but now throughout rituals and ceremonies  traditional healers and ministers. And of course  looking at this lion paw that has been skinned  it eerily reminds me of a human hand  and that's ironic  because their fate is in our hands. DJ  There's a burgeoning bone trade. South Africa just released some lion bones onto the market. Lion bones and tiger bones look exactly the same  and so in a stroke  the lion bone industry is going to wipe out all the tigers. So we have a real problem here  no more so than the lions do  the male lions. So the        lion figure that you just saw is actually a red herring  because there may be       or       male lions  and they all are actually infected with the same disease. I call it complacency    our complacency. Because there's a sport  there's an activity going on that we're all aware of  that we condone. And that's probably because we haven't seen it like we are today. BJ  And you have to know that  when a male lion is killed  it completely disrupts the whole pride. A new male comes into the area and takes over the pride  and  of course  first of all kills all the cubs and possibly some of the females that are defending their cubs. So we've estimated that between     and     lions are killed when one lion is hanging on a wall somewhere in a far off place. DJ  So what our investigations have shown is that these lions are essential. They're essential to the habitat. If they disappear  whole ecosystems in Africa disappear. There's an    billion dollar a year ecotourism revenue stream into Africa. So this is not just a concern about lions  it's a concern about communities in Africa as well. If they disappear  all of that goes away. But what I'm more concerned about in many ways is that  as we de link ourselves from nature  as we de link ourselves spiritually from these animals  we lose hope  we lose that spiritual connection  our dignity  that thing within us that keeps us connected to the planet. BJ  So you have to know  looking into the eyes of lions and leopards right now  it is all about critical awareness. And so what we are doing  in February  we're bringing out a film called  The Last Lion   and  The Last Lion  is exactly what is happening right now. That is the situation we're in    the last lions. That is  if we don't take action and do something  these plains will be completely devoid of big cats  and then  in turn  everything else will disappear. And simply  if we can't protect them  we're going to have a job protecting ourselves as well. DJ  And in fact  that original thing that we spoke about and designed our lives by    that conservation was all about respect and celebration    is probably true. That's really what it needs. We need it. We respect and celebrate each other as a man and a woman  as a community and as part of this planet  and we need to continue that. And Legadema  Well we can report  in fact  that we're grandparents. BJ DJ  Thank you very much. So for any of us in this room today  let's start out by admitting we're lucky. We don't live in the world our mothers lived in  our grandmothers lived in  where career choices for women were so limited. And if you're in this room today  most of us grew up in a world where we have basic civil rights  and amazingly  we still live in a world where some women don't have them. But all that aside  we still have a problem  and it's a real problem. And the problem is this  Women are not making it to the top of any profession anywhere in the world. The numbers tell the story quite clearly.     heads of state    nine are women. Of all the people in parliament in the world     percent are women. In the corporate sector  women at the top  C level jobs  board seats    tops out at        percent. The numbers have not moved since      and are going in the wrong direction. And even in the non profit world  a world we sometimes think of as being led by more women  women at the top     percent. We also have another problem  which is that women face harder choices between professional success and personal fulfillment. A recent study in the U.S. showed that  of married senior managers  two thirds of the married men had children and only one third of the married women had children. A couple of years ago  I was in New York  and I was pitching a deal  and I was in one of those fancy New York private equity offices you can picture. And I'm in the meeting    it's about a three hour meeting    and two hours in  there needs to be that bio break  and everyone stands up  and the partner running the meeting starts looking really embarrassed. And I realized he doesn't know where the women's room is in his office. So I start looking around for moving boxes  figuring they just moved in  but I don't see any. And so I said   Did you just move into this office   And he said   No  we've been here about a year.  And I said   Are you telling me that I am the only woman to have pitched a deal in this office in a year   And he looked at me  and he said   Yeah. Or maybe you're the only one who had to go to the bathroom.  So the question is  how are we going to fix this  How do we change these numbers at the top  How do we make this different  I want to start out by saying  I talk about this    about keeping women in the workforce    because I really think that's the answer. In the high income part of our workforce  in the people who end up at the top    Fortune     CEO jobs  or the equivalent in other industries    the problem  I am convinced  is that women are dropping out. Now people talk about this a lot  and they talk about things like flextime and mentoring and programs companies should have to train women. I want to talk about none of that today  even though that's all really important. Today I want to focus on what we can do as individuals. What are the messages we need to tell ourselves  What are the messages we tell the women that work with and for us  What are the messages we tell our daughters  Now  at the outset  I want to be very clear that this speech comes with no judgments. I don't have the right answer. I don't even have it for myself. I left San Francisco  where I live  on Monday  and I was getting on the plane for this conference. And my daughter  who's three  when I dropped her off at preschool  did that whole hugging the leg  crying   Mommy  don't get on the plane  thing. This is hard. I feel guilty sometimes. I know no women  whether they're at home or whether they're in the workforce  who don't feel that sometimes. So I'm not saying that staying in the workforce is the right thing for everyone. My talk today is about what the messages are if you do want to stay in the workforce  and I think there are three. One  sit at the table. Two  make your partner a real partner. And three  don't leave before you leave. Number one  sit at the table. Just a couple weeks ago at Facebook  we hosted a very senior government official  and he came in to meet with senior execs from around Silicon Valley. And everyone kind of sat at the table. He had these two women who were traveling with him pretty senior in his department  and I kind of said to them   Sit at the table. Come on  sit at the table   and they sat on the side of the room. When I was in college  my senior year  I took a course called European Intellectual History. Don't you love that kind of thing from college  I wish I could do that now. And I took it with my roommate  Carrie  who was then a brilliant literary student    and went on to be a brilliant literary scholar    and my brother    smart guy  but a water polo playing pre med  who was a sophomore. The three of us take this class together. And then Carrie reads all the books in the original Greek and Latin  goes to all the lectures. I read all the books in English and go to most of the lectures. My brother is kind of busy. He reads one book of    and goes to a couple of lectures  marches himself up to our room a couple days before the exam to get himself tutored. The three of us go to the exam together  and we sit down. And we sit there for three hours    and our little blue notebooks    yes  I'm that old. We walk out  we look at each other  and we say   How did you do   And Carrie says   Boy  I feel like I didn't really draw out the main point on the Hegelian dialectic.  And I say   God  I really wish I had really connected John Locke's theory of property with the philosophers that follow.  And my brother says   I got the top grade in the class.   You got the top grade in the class  You don't know anything.  The problem with these stories is that they show what the data shows  women systematically underestimate their own abilities. If you test men and women  and you ask them questions on totally objective criteria like GPAs  men get it wrong slightly high  and women get it wrong slightly low. Women do not negotiate for themselves in the workforce. A study in the last two years of people entering the workforce out of college showed that    percent of boys entering  or men  I guess  are negotiating their first salary  and only seven percent of women. And most importantly  men attribute their success to themselves  and women attribute it to other external factors. If you ask men why they did a good job  they'll say   I'm awesome. Obviously. Why are you even asking   If you ask women why they did a good job  what they'll say is someone helped them  they got lucky  they worked really hard. Why does this matter  Boy  it matters a lot. Because no one gets to the corner office by sitting on the side  not at the table  and no one gets the promotion if they don't think they deserve their success  or they don't even understand their own success. I wish the answer were easy. I wish I could go tell all the young women I work for  these fabulous women   Believe in yourself and negotiate for yourself. Own your own success.  I wish I could tell that to my daughter. But it's not that simple. Because what the data shows  above all else  is one thing  which is that success and likeability are positively correlated for men and negatively correlated for women. And everyone's nodding  because we all know this to be true. There's a really good study that shows this really well. There's a famous Harvard Business School study on a woman named Heidi Roizen. And she's an operator in a company in Silicon Valley  and she uses her contacts to become a very successful venture capitalist. In         not so long ago    a professor who was then at Columbia University took that case and made it  Howard  Roizen. And he gave the case out  both of them  to two groups of students. He changed exactly one word   Heidi  to  Howard.  But that one word made a really big difference. He then surveyed the students  and the good news was the students  both men and women  thought Heidi and Howard were equally competent  and that's good. The bad news was that everyone liked Howard. He's a great guy. You want to work for him. You want to spend the day fishing with him. But Heidi  Not so sure. She's a little out for herself. She's a little political. You're not sure you'd want to work for her. This is the complication. We have to tell our daughters and our colleagues  we have to tell ourselves to believe we got the A  to reach for the promotion  to sit at the table  and we have to do it in a world where  for them  there are sacrifices they will make for that  even though for their brothers  there are not. The saddest thing about all of this is that it's really hard to remember this. And I'm about to tell a story which is truly embarrassing for me  but I think important. I gave this talk at Facebook not so long ago to about     employees  and a couple hours later  there was a young woman who works there sitting outside my little desk  and she wanted to talk to me. I said  okay  and she sat down  and we talked. And she said   I learned something today. I learned that I need to keep my hand up.   What do you mean   She said   You're giving this talk  and you said you would take two more questions. I had my hand up with many other people  and you took two more questions. I put my hand down  and I noticed all the women did the same  and then you took more questions  only from the men.  And I thought to myself   Wow  if it's me    who cares about this  obviously    giving this talk    and during this talk  I can't even notice that the men's hands are still raised  and the women's hands are still raised  how good are we as managers of our companies and our organizations at seeing that the men are reaching for opportunities more than women   We've got to get women to sit at the table. Message number two  Make your partner a real partner. I've become convinced that we've made more progress in the workforce than we have in the home. The data shows this very clearly. If a woman and a man work full time and have a child  the woman does twice the amount of housework the man does  and the woman does three times the amount of childcare the man does. So she's got three jobs or two jobs  and he's got one. Who do you think drops out when someone needs to be home more  The causes of this are really complicated  and I don't have time to go into them. And I don't think Sunday football watching and general laziness is the cause. I think the cause is more complicated. I think  as a society  we put more pressure on our boys to succeed than we do on our girls. I know men that stay home and work in the home to support wives with careers  and it's hard. When I go to the Mommy and Me stuff and I see the father there  I notice that the other mommies don't play with him. And that's a problem  because we have to make it as important a job  because it's the hardest job in the world to work inside the home  for people of both genders  if we're going to even things out and let women stay in the workforce. Studies show that households with equal earning and equal responsibility also have half the divorce rate. And if that wasn't good enough motivation for everyone out there  they also have more    how shall I say this on this stage  They know each other more in the biblical sense as well. Message number three  Don't leave before you leave. I think there's a really deep irony to the fact that actions women are taking    and I see this all the time    with the objective of staying in the workforce actually lead to their eventually leaving. Here's what happens  We're all busy. Everyone's busy. A woman's busy. And she starts thinking about having a child  and from the moment she starts thinking about having a child  she starts thinking about making room for that child.  How am I going to fit this into everything else I'm doing   And literally from that moment  she doesn't raise her hand anymore  she doesn't look for a promotion  she doesn't take on the new project  she doesn't say   Me. I want to do that.  She starts leaning back. The problem is that    let's say she got pregnant that day  that day    nine months of pregnancy  three months of maternity leave  six months to catch your breath    Fast forward two years  more often    and as I've seen it    women start thinking about this way earlier    when they get engaged  or married  when they start thinking about having a child  which can take a long time. One woman came to see me about this. She looked a little young. And I said   So are you and your husband thinking about having a baby   And she said   Oh no  I'm not married.  She didn't even have a boyfriend. I said   You're thinking about this just way too early.  But the point is that what happens once you start kind of quietly leaning back  Everyone who's been through this    and I'm here to tell you  once you have a child at home  your job better be really good to go back  because it's hard to leave that kid at home. Your job needs to be challenging. It needs to be rewarding. You need to feel like you're making a difference. And if two years ago you didn't take a promotion and some guy next to you did  if three years ago you stopped looking for new opportunities  you're going to be bored because you should have kept your foot on the gas pedal. Don't leave before you leave. Stay in. Keep your foot on the gas pedal  until the very day you need to leave to take a break for a child    and then make your decisions. Don't make decisions too far in advance  particularly ones you're not even conscious you're making. My generation really  sadly  is not going to change the numbers at the top. They're just not moving. We are not going to get to where    percent of the population    in my generation  there will not be    percent of  women  at the top of any industry. But I'm hopeful that future generations can. I think a world where half of our countries and our companies were run by women  would be a better world. It's not just because people would know where the women's bathrooms are  even though that would be very helpful. I think it would be a better world. I have two children. I have a five year old son and a two year old daughter. I want my son to have a choice to contribute fully in the workforce or at home  and I want my daughter to have the choice to not just succeed  but to be liked for her accomplishments. Thank you. So today  I'm going to tell you about some people who didn't move out of their neighborhoods. The first one is happening right here in Chicago. Brenda Palms Farber was hired to help ex convicts reenter society and keep them from going back into prison. Currently  taxpayers spend about        dollars per year sending a person to jail. We know that two thirds of them are going to go back. I find it interesting that  for every one dollar we spend  however  on early childhood education  like Head Start  we save    dollars on stuff like incarceration in the future. Or    think about it    that        dollars is more than what it costs to send one person to Harvard as well. But Brenda  not being phased by stuff like that  took a look at her challenge and came up with a not so obvious solution  create a business that produces skin care products from honey. Okay  it might be obvious to some of you  it wasn't to me. It's the basis of growing a form of social innovation that has real potential. She hired seemingly unemployable men and women to care for the bees  harvest the honey and make value added products that they marketed themselves  and that were later sold at Whole Foods. She combined employment experience and training with life skills they needed  like anger management and teamwork  and also how to talk to future employers about how their experiences actually demonstrated the lessons that they had learned and their eagerness to learn more. Less than four percent of the folks that went through her program actually go back to jail. So these young men and women learned job readiness and life skills through bee keeping and became productive citizens in the process. Talk about a sweet beginning. Now  I'm going to take you to Los Angeles  and lots of people know that L.A. has its issues. But I'm going to talk about L.A.'s water issues right now. They have not enough water on most days and too much to handle when it rains. Currently     percent of California's energy consumption is used to pump water into mostly Southern California. Their spending loads  loads  to channel that rainwater out into the ocean when it rains and floods as well. Now Andy Lipkis is working to help L.A. cut infrastructure costs associated with water management and urban heat island    linking trees  people and technology to create a more livable city. All that green stuff actually naturally absorbs storm water  also helps cool our cities. Because  come to think about it  do you really want air conditioning  or is it a cooler room that you want  How you get it shouldn't make that much of a difference. So a few years ago  L.A. County decided that they needed to spend  .  billion dollars to repair the city schools. And Andy and his team discovered that they were going to spend     million of those dollars on asphalt to surround the schools themselves. And by presenting a really strong economic case  they convinced the L.A. government that replacing that asphalt with trees and other greenery  that the schools themselves would save the system more on energy than they spend on horticultural infrastructure. So ultimately     million square feet of asphalt was replaced or avoided  and electrical consumption for air conditioning went down  while employment for people to maintain those grounds went up  resulting in a net savings to the system  but also healthier students and schools system employees as well. Now Judy Bonds is a coal miner's daughter. Her family has eight generations in a town called Whitesville  West Virginia. And if anyone should be clinging to the former glory of the coal mining history  and of the town  it should be Judy. But the way coal is mined right now is different from the deep mines that her father and her father's father would go down into and that employed essentially thousands and thousands of people. Now  two dozen men can tear down a mountain in several months  and only for about a few years' worth of coal. That kind of technology is called  mountaintop removal.  It can make a mountain go from this to this in a few short months. Just imagine that the air surrounding these places    it's filled with the residue of explosives and coal. When we visited  it gave some of the people we were with this strange little cough after being only there for just a few hours or so    not just miners  but everybody. And Judy saw her landscape being destroyed and her water poisoned. And the coal companies just move on after the mountain was emptied  leaving even more unemployment in their wake. But she also saw the difference in potential wind energy on an intact mountain  and one that was reduced in elevation by over       feet. Three years of dirty energy with not many jobs  or centuries of clean energy with the potential for developing expertise and improvements in efficiency based on technical skills  and developing local knowledge about how to get the most out of that region's wind. She calculated the up front cost and the payback over time  and it's a net plus on so many levels for the local  national and global economy. It's a longer payback than mountaintop removal  but the wind energy actually pays back forever. Now mountaintop removal pays very little money to the locals  and it gives them a lot of misery. The water is turned into goo. Most people are still unemployed  leading to most of the same kinds of social problems that unemployed people in inner cities also experience    drug and alcohol abuse  domestic abuse  teen pregnancy and poor heath  as well. Now Judy and I    I have to say    totally related to each other. Not quite an obvious alliance. I mean  literally  her hometown is called Whitesville  West Virginia. I mean  they are not    they ain't competing for the birthplace of hip hop title or anything like that. But the back of my T shirt  the one that she gave me  says   Save the endangered hillbillies.  So homegirls and hillbillies we got it together and totally understand that this is what it's all about. But just a few months ago  Judy was diagnosed with stage three lung cancer. Yeah. And it has since moved to her bones and her brain. And I just find it so bizarre that she's suffering from the same thing that she tried so hard to protect people from. But her dream of Coal River Mountain Wind is her legacy. And she might not get to see that mountaintop. But rather than writing yet some kind of manifesto or something  she's leaving behind a business plan to make it happen. That's what my homegirl is doing. So I'm so proud of that. But these three people don't know each other  but they do have an awful lot in common. They're all problem solvers  and they're just some of the many examples that I really am privileged to see  meet and learn from in the examples of the work that I do now. I was really lucky to have them all featured on my Corporation for Public Radio radio show called ThePromisedLand.org. Now they're all very practical visionaries. They take a look at the demands that are out there    beauty products  healthy schools  electricity    and how the money's flowing to meet those demands. And when the cheapest solutions involve reducing the number of jobs  you're left with unemployed people  and those people aren't cheap. In fact  they make up some of what I call the most expensive citizens  and they include generationally impoverished  traumatized vets returning from the Middle East  people coming out of jail. And for the veterans in particular  the V.A. said there's a six fold increase in mental health pharmaceuticals by vets since     . I think that number's probably going to go up. They're not the largest number of people  but they are some of the most expensive    and in terms of the likelihood for domestic abuse  drug and alcohol abuse  poor performance by their kids in schools and also poor health as a result of stress. So these three guys all understand how to productively channel dollars through our local economies to meet existing market demands  reduce the social problems that we have now and prevent new problems in the future. And there are plenty of other examples like that. One problem  waste handling and unemployment. Even when we think or talk about recycling  lots of recyclable stuff ends up getting incinerated or in landfills and leaving many municipalities  diversion rates    they leave much to be recycled. And where is this waste handled  Usually in poor communities. And we know that eco industrial business  these kinds of business models    there's a model in Europe called the eco industrial park  where either the waste of one company is the raw material for another  or you use recycled materials to make goods that you can actually use and sell. We can create these local markets and incentives for recycled materials to be used as raw materials for manufacturing. And in my hometown  we actually tried to do one of these in the Bronx  but our mayor decided what he wanted to see was a jail on that same spot. Fortunately    because we wanted to create hundreds of jobs    but after many years  the city wanted to build a jail. They've since abandoned that project  thank goodness. Another problem  unhealthy food systems and unemployment. Working class and poor urban Americans are not benefiting economically from our current food system. It relies too much on transportation  chemical fertilization  big use of water and also refrigeration. Mega agricultural operations often are responsible for poisoning our waterways and our land  and it produces this incredibly unhealthy product that costs us billions in healthcare and lost productivity. And so we know  urban ag  is a big buzz topic this time of the year  but it's mostly gardening  which has some value in community building    lots of it    but it's not in terms of creating jobs or for food production. The numbers just aren't there. Part of my work now is really laying the groundwork to integrate urban ag and rural food systems to hasten the demise of the       mile salad by creating a national brand of urban grown produce in every city  that uses regional growing power and augments it with indoor growing facilities  owned and operated by small growers  where now there are only consumers. This can support seasonal farmers around metro areas who are losing out because they really can't meet the year round demand for produce. It's not a competition with rural farm  it's actually reinforcements. It allies in a really positive and economically viable food system. The goal is to meet the cities' institutional demands for hospitals  senior centers  schools  daycare centers  and produce a network of regional jobs  as well. This is smart infrastructure. And how we manage our built environment affects the health and well being of people every single day. Our municipalities  rural and urban  play the operational course of infrastructure    things like waste disposal  energy demand  as well as social costs of unemployment  drop out rates  incarceration rates and the impacts of various public health costs. Smart infrastructure can provide cost saving ways for municipalities to handle both infrastructure and social needs. And we want to shift the systems that open the doors for people who were formerly tax burdens to become part of the tax base. And imagine a national business model that creates local jobs and smart infrastructure to improve local economic stability. So I'm hoping you can see a little theme here. These examples indicate a trend. I haven't created it  and it's not happening by accident. I'm noticing that it's happening all over the country  and the good news is that it's growing. And we all need to be invested in it. It is an essential pillar to this country's recovery. And I call it  hometown security.  The recession has us reeling and fearful  and there's something in the air these days that is also very empowering. It's a realization that we are the key to our own recovery. Now is the time for us to act in our own communities where we think local and we act local. And when we do that  our neighbors    be they next door  or in the next state  or in the next country    will be just fine. The sum of the local is the global. Hometown security means rebuilding our natural defenses  putting people to work  restoring our natural systems. Hometown security means creating wealth here at home  instead of destroying it overseas. Tackling social and environmental problems at the same time with the same solution yields great cost savings  wealth generation and national security. Many great and inspiring solutions have been generated across America. The challenge for us now is to identify and support countless more. Now  hometown security is about taking care of your own  but it's not like the old saying   charity begins at home.  I recently read a book called  Love Leadership  by John Hope Bryant. And it's about leading in a world that really does seem to be operating on the basis of fear. And reading that book made me reexamine that theory because I need to explain what I mean by that. See  my dad was a great  great man in many ways. He grew up in the segregated South  escaped lynching and all that during some really hard times  and he provided a really stable home for me and my siblings and a whole bunch of other people that fell on hard times. But  like all of us  he had some problems. And his was gambling  compulsively. To him that phrase   Charity begins at home   meant that my payday    or someone else's    would just happen to coincide with his lucky day. So you need to help him out. And sometimes I would loan him money from my after school or summer jobs  and he always had the great intention of paying me back with interest  of course  after he hit it big. And he did sometimes  believe it or not  at a racetrack in Los Angeles    one reason to love L.A.    back in the     s. He made        dollars cash and bought the house that I grew up in. So I'm not that unhappy about that. But listen  I did feel obligated to him  and I grew up    then I grew up. And I'm a grown woman now  and I have learned a few things along the way. To me  charity often is just about giving  because you're supposed to  or because it's what you've always done  or it's about giving until it hurts. I'm about providing the means to build something that will grow and intensify its original investment and not just require greater giving next year    I'm not trying to feed the habit. I spent some years watching how good intentions for community empowerment  that were supposed to be there to support the community and empower it  actually left people in the same  if not worse  position that they were in before. And over the past    years  we've spent record amounts of philanthropic dollars on social problems  yet educational outcomes  malnutrition  incarceration  obesity  diabetes  income disparity  they've all gone up with some exceptions    in particular  infant mortality among people in poverty    but it's a great world that we're bringing them into as well. And I know a little bit about these issues  because  for many years  I spent a long time in the non profit industrial complex  and I'm a recovering executive director  two years clean. But during that time  I realized that it was about projects and developing them on the local level that really was going to do the right thing for our communities. But I really did struggle for financial support. The greater our success  the less money came in from foundations. And I tell you  being on the TED stage and winning a MacArthur in the same exact year gave everyone the impression that I had arrived. And by the time I'd moved on  I was actually covering a third of my agency's budget deficit with speaking fees. And I think because early on  frankly  my programs were just a little bit ahead of their time. But since then  the park that was just a dump and was featured at a TED     Talk became this little thing. But I did in fact get married in it. Over here. There goes my dog who led me to the park in my wedding. The South Bronx Greenway was also just a drawing on the stage back in     . Since then  we got about    million dollars in stimulus package money to come and get here. And we love this  because I love construction now  because we're watching these things actually happen. So I want everyone to understand the critical importance of shifting charity into enterprise. I started my firm to help communities across the country realize their own potential to improve everything about the quality of life for their people. Hometown security is next on my to do list. What we need are people who see the value in investing in these types of local enterprises  who will partner with folks like me to identify the growth trends and climate adaptation as well as understand the growing social costs of business as usual. We need to work together to embrace and repair our land  repair our power systems and repair ourselves. It's time to stop building the shopping malls  the prisons  the stadiums and other tributes to all of our collective failures. It is time that we start building living monuments to hope and possibility. Thank you very much. So  I'll start with this  a couple years ago  an event planner called me because I was going to do a speaking event. And she called  and she said   I'm really struggling with how to write about you on the little flyer.  And I thought   Well  what's the struggle   And she said   Well  I saw you speak  and I'm going to call you a researcher  I think  but I'm afraid if I call you a researcher  no one will come  because they'll think you're boring and irrelevant.  And I was like   Okay.  And she said   But the thing I liked about your talk is you're a storyteller. So I think what I'll do is just call you a storyteller.  And of course  the academic  insecure part of me was like   You're going to call me a what   And she said   I'm going to call you a storyteller.  And I was like   Why not 'magic pixie'   I was like   Let me think about this for a second.  I tried to call deep on my courage. And I thought  you know  I am a storyteller. I'm a qualitative researcher. I collect stories  that's what I do. And maybe stories are just data with a soul. And maybe I'm just a storyteller. And so I said   You know what  Why don't you just say I'm a researcher storyteller.  And she went   Ha ha. There's no such thing.  So I'm a researcher storyteller  and I'm going to talk to you today    we're talking about expanding perception    and so I want to talk to you and tell some stories about a piece of my research that fundamentally expanded my perception and really actually changed the way that I live and love and work and parent. And this is where my story starts. When I was a young researcher  doctoral student  my first year  I had a research professor who said to us   Here's the thing  if you cannot measure it  it does not exist.  And I thought he was just sweet talking me. I was like   Really   and he was like   Absolutely.  And so you have to understand that I have a bachelor's and a master's in social work  and I was getting my Ph.D. in social work  so my entire academic career was surrounded by people who kind of believed in the  life's messy  love it.  And I'm more of the   life's messy  clean it up  organize it and put it into a bento box.  And so to think that I had found my way  to found a career that takes me    really  one of the big sayings in social work is   Lean into the discomfort of the work.  And I'm like  knock discomfort upside the head and move it over and get all A's. That was my mantra. So I was very excited about this. And so I thought  you know what  this is the career for me  because I am interested in some messy topics. But I want to be able to make them not messy. I want to understand them. I want to hack into these things that I know are important and lay the code out for everyone to see. So where I started was with connection. Because  by the time you're a social worker for    years  what you realize is that connection is why we're here. It's what gives purpose and meaning to our lives. This is what it's all about. It doesn't matter whether you talk to people who work in social justice  mental health and abuse and neglect  what we know is that connection  the ability to feel connected  is    neurobiologically that's how we're wired    it's why we're here. So I thought  you know what  I'm going to start with connection. Well  you know that situation where you get an evaluation from your boss  and she tells you    things that you do really awesome  and one  opportunity for growth   And all you can think about is that opportunity for growth  right  Well  apparently this is the way my work went as well  because  when you ask people about love  they tell you about heartbreak. When you ask people about belonging  they'll tell you their most excruciating experiences of being excluded. And when you ask people about connection  the stories they told me were about disconnection. So very quickly    really about six weeks into this research    I ran into this unnamed thing that absolutely unraveled connection in a way that I didn't understand or had never seen. And so I pulled back out of the research and thought  I need to figure out what this is. And it turned out to be shame. And shame is really easily understood as the fear of disconnection  Is there something about me that  if other people know it or see it  that I won't be worthy of connection  The things I can tell you about it  It's universal  we all have it. The only people who don't experience shame have no capacity for human empathy or connection. No one wants to talk about it  and the less you talk about it  the more you have it. What underpinned this shame  this  I'm not good enough      which  we all know that feeling   I'm not blank enough. I'm not thin enough  rich enough  beautiful enough  smart enough  promoted enough.  The thing that underpinned this was excruciating vulnerability. This idea of  in order for connection to happen  we have to allow ourselves to be seen  really seen. And you know how I feel about vulnerability. I hate vulnerability. And so I thought  this is my chance to beat it back with my measuring stick. I'm going in  I'm going to figure this stuff out  I'm going to spend a year  I'm going to totally deconstruct shame  I'm going to understand how vulnerability works  and I'm going to outsmart it. So I was ready  and I was really excited. As you know  it's not going to turn out well. You know this. So  I could tell you a lot about shame  but I'd have to borrow everyone else's time. But here's what I can tell you that it boils down to    and this may be one of the most important things that I've ever learned in the decade of doing this research. My one year turned into six years  Thousands of stories  hundreds of long interviews  focus groups. At one point  people were sending me journal pages and sending me their stories    thousands of pieces of data in six years. And I kind of got a handle on it. I kind of understood  this is what shame is  this is how it works. I wrote a book  I published a theory  but something was not okay    and what it was is that  if I roughly took the people I interviewed and divided them into people who really have a sense of worthiness    that's what this comes down to  a sense of worthiness    they have a strong sense of love and belonging    and folks who struggle for it  and folks who are always wondering if they're good enough. There was only one variable that separated the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging and the people who really struggle for it. And that was  the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging believe they're worthy of love and belonging. That's it. They believe they're worthy. And to me  the hard part of the one thing that keeps us out of connection is our fear that we're not worthy of connection  was something that  personally and professionally  I felt like I needed to understand better. So what I did is I took all of the interviews where I saw worthiness  where I saw people living that way  and just looked at those. What do these people have in common  I have a slight office supply addiction  but that's another talk. So I had a manila folder  and I had a Sharpie  and I was like  what am I going to call this research  And the first words that came to my mind were  whole hearted.  These are whole hearted people  living from this deep sense of worthiness. So I wrote at the top of the manila folder  and I started looking at the data. In fact  I did it first in a four day  very intensive data analysis  where I went back  pulled the interviews  the stories  pulled the incidents. What's the theme  What's the pattern  My husband left town with the kids because I always go into this Jackson Pollock crazy thing  where I'm just writing and in my researcher mode. And so here's what I found. What they had in common was a sense of courage. And I want to separate courage and bravery for you for a minute. Courage  the original definition of courage  when it first came into the English language    it's from the Latin word  cor   meaning  heart     and the original definition was to tell the story of who you are with your whole heart. And so these folks had  very simply  the courage to be imperfect. They had the compassion to be kind to themselves first and then to others  because  as it turns out  we can't practice compassion with other people if we can't treat ourselves kindly. And the last was they had connection  and    this was the hard part    as a result of authenticity  they were willing to let go of who they thought they should be in order to be who they were  which you have to absolutely do that for connection. The other thing that they had in common was this  They fully embraced vulnerability. They believed that what made them vulnerable made them beautiful. They didn't talk about vulnerability being comfortable  nor did they really talk about it being excruciating    as I had heard it earlier in the shame interviewing. They just talked about it being necessary. They talked about the willingness to say   I love you  first ... the willingness to do something where there are no guarantees ... the willingness to breathe through waiting for the doctor to call after your mammogram. They're willing to invest in a relationship that may or may not work out. They thought this was fundamental. I personally thought it was betrayal. I could not believe I had pledged allegiance to research  where our job    you know  the definition of research is to control and predict  to study phenomena for the explicit reason to control and predict. And now my mission to control and predict had turned up the answer that the way to live is with vulnerability and to stop controlling and predicting. This led to a little breakdown       which actually looked more like this. And it did. I call it a breakdown  my therapist calls it a spiritual awakening. A spiritual awakening sounds better than breakdown  but I assure you  it was a breakdown. And I had to put my data away and go find a therapist. Let me tell you something  you know who you are when you call your friends and say   I think I need to see somebody. Do you have any recommendations   Because about five of my friends were like   Wooo  I wouldn't want to be your therapist.  I was like   What does that mean   And they're like   I'm just saying  you know. Don't bring your measuring stick.  I was like   Okay.  So I found a therapist. My first meeting with her  Diana    I brought in my list of the way the whole hearted live  and I sat down. And she said   How are you   And I said   I'm great. I'm okay.  She said   What's going on   And this is a therapist who sees therapists  because we have to go to those  because their B.S. meters are good. And so I said   Here's the thing  I'm struggling.  And she said   What's the struggle   And I said   Well  I have a vulnerability issue. And I know that vulnerability is the core of shame and fear and our struggle for worthiness  but it appears that it's also the birthplace of joy  of creativity  of belonging  of love. And I think I have a problem  and I need some help.  And I said   But here's the thing  no family stuff  no childhood shit.   I just need some strategies.  Thank you. So she goes like this. And then I said   It's bad  right   And she said   It's neither good nor bad.   It just is what it is.  And I said   Oh my God  this is going to suck.  And it did  and it didn't. And it took about a year. And you know how there are people that  when they realize that vulnerability and tenderness are important  that they surrender and walk into it. A  that's not me  and B  I don't even hang out with people like that. For me  it was a yearlong street fight. It was a slugfest. Vulnerability pushed  I pushed back. I lost the fight  but probably won my life back. And so then I went back into the research and spent the next couple of years really trying to understand what they  the whole hearted  what choices they were making  and what we are doing with vulnerability. Why do we struggle with it so much  Am I alone in struggling with vulnerability  No. So this is what I learned. We numb vulnerability    when we're waiting for the call. It was funny  I sent something out on Twitter and on Facebook that says   How would you define vulnerability  What makes you feel vulnerable   And within an hour and a half  I had     responses. Because I wanted to know what's out there. Having to ask my husband for help because I'm sick  and we're newly married  initiating sex with my husband  initiating sex with my wife  being turned down  asking someone out  waiting for the doctor to call back  getting laid off  laying off people. This is the world we live in. We live in a vulnerable world. And one of the ways we deal with it is we numb vulnerability. And I think there's evidence    and it's not the only reason this evidence exists  but I think it's a huge cause    We are the most in debt ... obese ... addicted and medicated adult cohort in U.S. history. The problem is    and I learned this from the research    that you cannot selectively numb emotion. You can't say  here's the bad stuff. Here's vulnerability  here's grief  here's shame  here's fear  here's disappointment. I don't want to feel these. I'm going to have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin. I don't want to feel these. And I know that's knowing laughter. I hack into your lives for a living. God. You can't numb those hard feelings without numbing the other affects  our emotions. You cannot selectively numb. So when we numb those  we numb joy  we numb gratitude  we numb happiness. And then  we are miserable  and we are looking for purpose and meaning  and then we feel vulnerable  so then we have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin. And it becomes this dangerous cycle. One of the things that I think we need to think about is why and how we numb. And it doesn't just have to be addiction. The other thing we do is we make everything that's uncertain certain. Religion has gone from a belief in faith and mystery to certainty.  I'm right  you're wrong. Shut up.  That's it. Just certain. The more afraid we are  the more vulnerable we are  the more afraid we are. This is what politics looks like today. There's no discourse anymore. There's no conversation. There's just blame. You know how blame is described in the research  A way to discharge pain and discomfort. We perfect. If there's anyone who wants their life to look like this  it would be me  but it doesn't work. Because what we do is we take fat from our butts and put it in our cheeks. Which just  I hope in     years  people will look back and go   Wow.  And we perfect  most dangerously  our children. Let me tell you what we think about children. They're hardwired for struggle when they get here. And when you hold those perfect little babies in your hand  our job is not to say   Look at her  she's perfect. My job is just to keep her perfect    make sure she makes the tennis team by fifth grade and Yale by seventh.  That's not our job. Our job is to look and say   You know what  You're imperfect  and you're wired for struggle  but you are worthy of love and belonging.  That's our job. Show me a generation of kids raised like that  and we'll end the problems  I think  that we see today. We pretend that what we do doesn't have an effect on people. We do that in our personal lives. We do that corporate    whether it's a bailout  an oil spill ... a recall. We pretend like what we're doing doesn't have a huge impact on other people. I would say to companies  this is not our first rodeo  people. We just need you to be authentic and real and say ...  We're sorry. We'll fix it.  But there's another way  and I'll leave you with this. This is what I have found  To let ourselves be seen  deeply seen  vulnerably seen ... to love with our whole hearts  even though there's no guarantee    and that's really hard  and I can tell you as a parent  that's excruciatingly difficult    to practice gratitude and joy in those moments of terror  when we're wondering   Can I love you this much  Can I believe in this this passionately  Can I be this fierce about this   just to be able to stop and  instead of catastrophizing what might happen  to say   I'm just so grateful  because to feel this vulnerable means I'm alive.  And the last  which I think is probably the most important  is to believe that we're enough. Because when we work from a place  I believe  that says   I'm enough  ... then we stop screaming and start listening  we're kinder and gentler to the people around us  and we're kinder and gentler to ourselves. That's all I have. Thank you. The first thing I want to do is say thank you to all of you. The second thing I want to do is introduce my co author and dear friend and co teacher. Ken and I have been working together for almost    years. That's Ken Sharpe over there. So there is among many people    certainly me and most of the people I talk to    a kind of collective dissatisfaction with the way things are working  with the way our institutions run. Our kids' teachers seem to be failing them. Our doctors don't know who the hell we are  and they don't have enough time for us. We certainly can't trust the bankers  and we certainly can't trust the brokers. They almost brought the entire financial system down. And even as we do our own work  all too often  we find ourselves having to choose between doing what we think is the right thing and doing the expected thing  or the required thing  or the profitable thing. So everywhere we look  pretty much across the board  we worry that the people we depend on don't really have our interests at heart. Or if they do have our interests at heart  we worry that they don't know us well enough to figure out what they need to do in order to allow us to secure those interests. They don't understand us. They don't have the time to get to know us. There are two kinds of responses that we make to this sort of general dissatisfaction. If things aren't going right  the first response is  let's make more rules  let's set up a set of detailed procedures to make sure that people will do the right thing. Give teachers scripts to follow in the classroom  so even if they don't know what they're doing and don't care about the welfare of our kids  as long as they follow the scripts  our kids will get educated. Give judges a list of mandatory sentences to impose for crimes  so that you don't need to rely on judges using their judgment. Instead  all they have to do is look up on the list what kind of sentence goes with what kind of crime. Impose limits on what credit card companies can charge in interest and on what they can charge in fees. More and more rules to protect us against an indifferent  uncaring set of institutions we have to deal with. Or    or maybe and    in addition to rules  let's see if we can come up with some really clever incentives so that  even if the people we deal with don't particularly want to serve our interests  it is in their interest to serve our interest    the magic incentives that will get people to do the right thing even out of pure selfishness. So we offer teachers bonuses if the kids they teach score passing grades on these big test scores that are used to evaluate the quality of school systems. Rules and incentives     sticks  and  carrots.  We passed a bunch of rules to regulate the financial industry in response to the recent collapse. There's the Dodd Frank Act  there's the new Consumer Financial Protection Agency that is temporarily being headed through the backdoor by Elizabeth Warren. Maybe these rules will actually improve the way these financial services companies behave. We'll see. In addition  we are struggling to find some way to create incentives for people in the financial services industry that will have them more interested in serving the long term interests even of their own companies  rather than securing short term profits. So if we find just the right incentives  they'll do the right thing    as I said    selfishly  and if we come up with the right rules and regulations  they won't drive us all over a cliff. And Ken  Sharpe  and I certainly know that you need to reign in the bankers. If there is a lesson to be learned from the financial collapse it is that. But what we believe  and what we argue in the book  is that there is no set of rules  no matter how detailed  no matter how specific  no matter how carefully monitored and enforced  there is no set of rules that will get us what we need. Why  Because bankers are smart people. And  like water  they will find cracks in any set of rules. You design a set of rules that will make sure that the particular reason why the financial system  almost collapse  can't happen again. It is naive beyond description to think that having blocked this source of financial collapse  you have blocked all possible sources of financial collapse. So it's just a question of waiting for the next one and then marveling at how we could have been so stupid as not to protect ourselves against that. What we desperately need  beyond  or along with  better rules and reasonably smart incentives  is we need virtue. We need character. We need people who want to do the right thing. And in particular  the virtue that we need most of all is the virtue that Aristotle called  practical wisdom.  Practical wisdom is the moral will to do the right thing and the moral skill to figure out what the right thing is. So Aristotle was very interested in watching how the craftsmen around him worked. And he was impressed at how they would improvise novel solutions to novel problems    problems that they hadn't anticipated. So one example is he sees these stonemasons working on the Isle of Lesbos  and they need to measure out round columns. Well if you think about it  it's really hard to measure out round columns using a ruler. So what do they do  They fashion a novel solution to the problem. They created a ruler that bends  what we would call these days a tape measure    a flexible rule  a rule that bends. And Aristotle said   Hah  they appreciated that sometimes to design rounded columns  you need to bend the rule.  And Aristotle said often in dealing with other people  we need to bend the rules. Dealing with other people demands a kind of flexibility that no set of rules can encompass. Wise people know when and how to bend the rules. Wise people know how to improvise. The way my co author   Ken  and I talk about it  they are kind of like jazz musicians. The rules are like the notes on the page  and that gets you started  but then you dance around the notes on the page  coming up with just the right combination for this particular moment with this particular set of fellow players. So for Aristotle  the kind of rule bending  rule exception finding and improvisation that you see in skilled craftsmen is exactly what you need to be a skilled moral craftsman. And in interactions with people  almost all the time  it is this kind of flexibility that is required. A wise person knows when to bend the rules. A wise person knows when to improvise. And most important  a wise person does this improvising and rule bending in the service of the right aims. If you are a rule bender and an improviser mostly to serve yourself  what you get is ruthless manipulation of other people. So it matters that you do this wise practice in the service of others and not in the service of yourself. And so the will to do the right thing is just as important as the moral skill of improvisation and exception finding. Together they comprise practical wisdom  which Aristotle thought was the master virtue. So I'll give you an example of wise practice in action. It's the case of Michael. Michael's a young guy. He had a pretty low wage job. He was supporting his wife and a child  and the child was going to parochial school. Then he lost his job. He panicked about being able to support his family. One night  he drank a little too much  and he robbed a cab driver    stole    dollars. He robbed him at gunpoint. It was a toy gun. He got caught. He got tried. He got convicted. The Pennsylvania sentencing guidelines required a minimum sentence for a crime like this of two years     months. The judge on the case  Judge Lois Forer thought that this made no sense. He had never committed a crime before. He was a responsible husband and father. He had been faced with desperate circumstances. All this would do is wreck a family. And so she improvised a sentence       months  and not only that  but release every day to go to work. Spend your night in jail  spend your day holding down a job. He did. He served out his sentence. He made restitution and found himself a new job. And the family was united. And it seemed on the road to some sort of a decent life    a happy ending to a story involving wise improvisation from a wise judge. But it turned out the prosecutor was not happy that Judge Forer ignored the sentencing guidelines and sort of invented her own  and so he appealed. And he asked for the mandatory minimum sentence for armed robbery. He did after all have a toy gun. The mandatory minimum sentence for armed robbery is five years. He won the appeal. Michael was sentenced to five years in prison. Judge Forer had to follow the law. And by the way  this appeal went through after he had finished serving his sentence  so he was out and working at a job and taking care of his family and he had to go back into jail. Judge Forer did what she was required to do  and then she quit the bench. And Michael disappeared. So that is an example  both of wisdom in practice and the subversion of wisdom by rules that are meant  of course  to make things better. Now consider Ms. Dewey. Ms. Dewey's a teacher in a Texas elementary school. She found herself listening to a consultant one day who was trying to help teachers boost the test scores of the kids  so that the school would reach the elite category in percentage of kids passing big tests. All these schools in Texas compete with one another to achieve these milestones  and there are bonuses and various other treats that come if you beat the other schools. So here was the consultant's advice  first  don't waste your time on kids who are going to pass the test no matter what you do. Second  don't waste your time on kids who can't pass the test no matter what you do. Third  don't waste your time on kids who moved into the district too late for their scores to be counted. Focus all of your time and attention on the kids who are on the bubble  the so called  bubble kids     kids where your intervention can get them just maybe over the line from failing to passing. So Ms. Dewey heard this  and she shook her head in despair while fellow teachers were sort of cheering each other on and nodding approvingly. It's like they were about to go play a football game. For Ms. Dewey  this isn't why she became a teacher. Now Ken and I are not naive  and we understand that you need to have rules. You need to have incentives. People have to make a living. But the problem with relying on rules and incentives is that they demoralize professional activity  and they demoralize professional activity in two senses. First  they demoralize the people who are engaged in the activity. Judge Forer quits  and Ms. Dewey in completely disheartened. And second  they demoralize the activity itself. The very practice is demoralized  and the practitioners are demoralized. It creates people    when you manipulate incentives to get people to do the right thing    it creates people who are addicted to incentives. That is to say  it creates people who only do things for incentives. Now the striking thing about this is that psychologists have known this for    years. Psychologists have known about the negative consequences of incentivizing everything for    years. We know that if you reward kids for drawing pictures  they stop caring about the drawing and care only about the reward. If you reward kids for reading books  they stop caring about what's in the books and only care about how long they are. If you reward teachers for kids' test scores  they stop caring about educating and only care about test preparation. If you were to reward doctors for doing more procedures    which is the current system    they would do more. If instead you reward doctors for doing fewer procedures  they will do fewer. What we want  of course  is doctors who do just the right amount of procedures and do the right amount for the right reason    namely  to serve the welfare of their patients. Psychologists have known this for decades  and it's time for policymakers to start paying attention and listen to psychologists a little bit  instead of economists. And it doesn't have to be this way. We think  Ken and I  that there are real sources of hope. We identify one set of people in all of these practices who we call canny outlaws. These are people who  being forced to operate in a system that demands rule following and creates incentives  find away around the rules  find a way to subvert the rules. So there are teachers who have these scripts to follow  and they know that if they follow these scripts  the kids will learn nothing. And so what they do is they follow the scripts  but they follow the scripts at double time and squirrel away little bits of extra time during which they teach in the way that they actually know is effective. So these are little ordinary  everyday heroes  and they're incredibly admirable  but there's no way that they can sustain this kind of activity in the face of a system that either roots them out or grinds them down. So canny outlaws are better than nothing  but it's hard to imagine any canny outlaw sustaining that for an indefinite period of time. More hopeful are people we call system changers. These are people who are looking not to dodge the system's rules and regulations  but to transform the system  and we talk about several. One in particular is a judge named Robert Russell. And one day he was faced with the case of Gary Pettengill. Pettengill was a    year old vet who had planned to make the army a career  but then he got a severe back injury in Iraq  and that forced him to take a medical discharge. He was married  he had a third kid on the way  he suffered from PTSD  in addition to the bad back  and recurrent nightmares  and he had started using marijuana to ease some of the symptoms. He was only able to get part time work because of his back  and so he was unable to earn enough to put food on the table and take care of his family. So he started selling marijuana. He was busted in a drug sweep. His family was kicked out of their apartment  and the welfare system was threatening to take away his kids. Under normal sentencing procedures  Judge Russell would have had little choice but to sentence Pettengill to serious jail time as a drug felon. But Judge Russell did have an alternative. And that's because he was in a special court. He was in a court called the Veterans' Court. In the Veterans' Court    this was the first of its kind in the United States. Judge Russell created the Veterans' Court. It was a court only for veterans who had broken the law. And he had created it exactly because mandatory sentencing laws were taking the judgment out of judging. No one wanted non violent offenders    and especially non violent offenders who were veterans to boot    to be thrown into prison. They wanted to do something about what we all know  namely the revolving door of the criminal justice system. And what the Veterans' Court did  was it treated each criminal as an individual  tried to get inside their problems  tried to fashion responses to their crimes that helped them to rehabilitate themselves  and didn't forget about them once the judgment was made. Stayed with them  followed up on them  made sure that they were sticking to whatever plan had been jointly developed to get them over the hump. There are now    cities that have Veterans' Courts like this. Why has the idea spread  Well  one reason is that Judge Russell has now seen     vets in his Veterans' Court as of February of this year  and out of      guess how many have gone back through the revolving door of justice into prison. None. None. Anyone would glom onto a criminal justice system that has this kind of a record. So here's is a system changer  and it seems to be catching. There's a banker who created a for profit community bank that encouraged bankers    I know this is hard to believe    encouraged bankers who worked there to do well by doing good for their low income clients. The bank helped finance the rebuilding of what was otherwise a dying community. Though their loan recipients were high risk by ordinary standards  the default rate was extremely low. The bank was profitable. The bankers stayed with their loan recipients. They didn't make loans and then sell the loans. They serviced the loans. They made sure that their loan recipients were staying up with their payments. Banking hasn't always been the way we read about it now in the newspapers. Even Goldman Sachs once used to serve clients  before it turned into an institution that serves only itself. Banking wasn't always this way  and it doesn't have to be this way. So there are examples like this in medicine    doctors at Harvard who are trying to transform medical education  so that you don't get a kind of ethical erosion and loss of empathy  which characterizes most medical students in the course of their medical training. And the way they do it is to give third year medical students patients who they follow for an entire year. So the patients are not organ systems  and they're not diseases  they're people  people with lives. And in order to be an effective doctor  you need to treat people who have lives and not just disease. In addition to which there's an enormous amount of back and forth  mentoring of one student by another  of all the students by the doctors  and the result is a generation    we hope    of doctors who do have time for the people they treat. We'll see. So there are lots of examples like this that we talk about. Each of them shows that it is possible to build on and nurture character and keep a profession true to its proper mission    what Aristotle would have called its proper telos. And Ken and I believe that this is what practitioners actually want. People want to be allowed to be virtuous. They want to have permission to do the right thing. They don't want to feel like they need to take a shower to get the moral grime off their bodies everyday when they come home from work. Aristotle thought that practical wisdom was the key to happiness  and he was right. There's now a lot of research being done in psychology on what makes people happy  and the two things that jump out in study after study    I know this will come as a shock to all of you    the two things that matter most to happiness are love and work. Love  managing successfully relations with the people who are close to you and with the communities of which you are a part. Work  engaging in activities that are meaningful and satisfying. If you have that  good close relations with other people  work that's meaningful and fulfilling  you don't much need anything else. Well  to love well and to work well  you need wisdom. Rules and incentives don't tell you how to be a good friend  how to be a good parent  how to be a good spouse  or how to be a good doctor or a good lawyer or a good teacher. Rules and incentives are no substitutes for wisdom. Indeed  we argue  there is no substitute for wisdom. And so practical wisdom does not require heroic acts of self sacrifice on the part of practitioners. In giving us the will and the skill to do the right thing    to do right by others    practical wisdom also gives us the will and the skill to do right by ourselves. Thanks.
