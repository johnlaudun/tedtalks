Fifty four percent of the world's population lives in our cities. In developing countries  one third of that population is living in slums. Seventy five percent of global energy consumption occurs in our cities  and    percent of gas emissions that cause global warming come from our cities. So things that you and I might think about as global problems  like climate change  the energy crisis or poverty  are really  in many ways  city problems. They will not be solved unless people who live in cities  like most of us  actually start doing a better job  because right now  we are  not doing a very good one. And that becomes very clear when we look into three aspects of city life  first  our citizens' willingness to engage with democratic institutions  second  our cities' ability to really include all of their residents  and lastly  our own ability to live fulfilling and happy lives. When it comes to engagement  the data is very clear. Voter turnout around the world peaked in the late '  s  and it has been declining at a pace that we have never seen before  and if those numbers are bad at the national level  at the level of our cities  they are just dismal. In the last two years  two of the world's most consolidated  oldest democracies  the U.S. and France  held nationwide municipal elections. In France  voter turnout hit a record low. Almost    percent of voters decided not to show up. In the U.S.  the numbers were even scarier. In some American cities  voter turnout was close to five percent. I'll let that sink in for a second. We're talking about democratic cities in which    percent of people decided that it was not important to elect their leaders. The city of L.A.  a city of four million people  elected its mayor with just a bit over         votes. That was the lowest turnout the city had seen in     years. Right here  in my city of Rio  in spite of mandatory voting  almost    percent of the voting population chose to either annul their votes or stay home and pay a fine in the last mayoral elections. When it comes to inclusiveness  our cities are not the best cases of success either  and again  you don't need to look very far in order to find proof of that. The city of Rio is incredibly unequal. This is Leblon. Leblon is the city's richest neighborhood. And this is Complexo do Alem o. This is where over        of the city's poorest residents live. Leblon has an HDI  a Human Development Index  of .   . That is higher than Norway  Switzerland or Sweden. Complexo do Alem o has an HDI of .   . It sits somewhere in between the HDI of Algeria and Gabon. So Rio  like so many cities across the global South  is a place where you can go from northern Europe to sub Saharan Africa in the space of    minutes. If you drive  that is. If you take public transit  it's about two hours. And lastly  perhaps most importantly  cities  with the incredible wealth of relations that they enable  could be the ideal places for human happiness to flourish. We like being around people. We are social animals. Instead  countries where urbanization has already peaked seem to be the very countries in which cities have stopped making us happy. The United States population has suffered from a general decrease in happiness for the past three decades  and the main reason is this. The American way of building cities has caused good quality public spaces to virtually disappear in many  many American cities  and as a result  they have seen a decline of relations  of the things that make us happy. Many studies show an increase in solitude and a decrease in solidarity  honesty  and social and civic participation. So how do we start building cities that make us care  Cities that value their most important asset  the incredible diversity of the people who live in them  Cities that make us happy  Well  I believe that if we want to change what our cities look like  then we really have to change the decision making processes that have given us the results  that we have right now. We need a participation revolution  and we need it fast. The idea of voting as our  only exercise in citizenship does not make sense anymore. People are tired of only being treated as empowered individuals every few years when it's time to delegate that power to someone else. If the protests that swept Brazil in June      have taught us anything  it's that every time we try to exercise our power outside of an electoral context  we are beaten up  humiliated or arrested. And this needs to change  because when it does  not only will people re engage with the structures of representation  but also complement these structures with direct  effective  and  collective decision making  decision making of the kind that attacks inequality by its very inclusive nature  decision making of the kind that can change our cities into better places for us to live. But there is a catch  obviously  Enabling widespread participation and redistributing power can be a logistical nightmare  and there's where technology can play an incredibly helpful role  by making it easier for people to organize  communicate and make decisions without having to be in the same room at the same time. Unfortunately for us  when it comes to fostering democratic processes  our city governments have not used technology to its full potential. So far  most city governments have been effective at using tech to turn citizens into human sensors who serve authorities with data on the city  potholes  fallen trees or broken lamps. They have also  to a lesser extent  invited people to participate in improving the outcome of decisions that were already made for them  just like my mom when I was eight and she told me that I had a choice  I had to be in bed by   p.m.  but I could choose my pink pajamas or my blue pajamas. That's not participation  and in fact  governments have not been very good at using technology to enable participation on what matters   the way we allocate our budget  the way we occupy our land  and the way we manage our natural resources. Those are the kinds of decisions that can actually impact global problems that manifest themselves in our cities. The good news is  and I do have good news to share with you  we don't need to wait for governments to do this. I have reason to believe that it's possible for citizens to build their own structures of participation. Three years ago  I cofounded an organization called Meu Rio  and we make it easier for people in the city of Rio to organize around causes and places that they care about in their own city  and have an impact on those causes and places every day. In these past three years  Meu Rio grew to a network of         citizens of Rio. About    percent of those  members are young people aged    to   . That is one in every    young people of that age in Rio today. Amongst our members is this adorable little girl  Bia  to your right  and Bia was just    years old when she started a campaign using one of our tools to save her model public school from demolition. Her school actually ranks among the best public schools in the country  and it was going to be demolished by the Rio de Janeiro state government to build  I kid you not  a parking lot for the World Cup right before the event happened. Bia started a campaign  and we even watched her school      through webcam monitoring  and many months afterwards  the government changed their minds. Bia's school stayed in place. There's also Jovita. She's an amazing woman whose daughter went missing about    years ago  and since then  she has been looking for her daughter. In that process  she found out that first  she was not alone. In the last year alone              people disappeared in the state of Rio. But she also found out that in spite of that  Rio had no centralized intelligence system for solving missing persons cases. In other Brazilian cities  those systems have helped solve up to    percent of missing persons cases. She started a campaign  and after the secretary of  security got        emails from people asking him to do this  he responded  and started to build a police unit specializing in those cases. It was open to the public at the end of last month  and Jovita was there giving interviews and being very fancy. And then  there is Leandro. Leandro is an amazing guy in a slum in Rio  and he created a recycling project in the slum. At the end of last year  December     he received an eviction order by the Rio de Janeiro state government giving him two weeks to leave the space that he had been using for two years. The plan was to hand it over to a developer  who planned to turn it into a construction site. Leandro started a campaign using one of our tools  the Pressure Cooker  the same one that Bia and Jovita used  and the state government changed their minds before Christmas Eve. These stories make me happy  but not just because they have happy endings. They make me happy because they are happy beginnings. The teacher and parent community at Bia's school is looking for other ways they could improve that space even further. Leandro has ambitious plans to take his model to other low income communities in Rio  and Jovita is volunteering at the police unit that she helped created. Bia  Jovita and Leandro are living examples of something that citizens and city  governments around the world need to know  We are ready. As citizens  we are ready to decide on our common destinies  because we know that the way we distribute power says a lot about how we actually value everyone  and because we know that enabling and participating in local politics is a sign that we truly care about our relations to one another  and we are ready to do this in cities around the world right now. With the Our Cities network  the Meu Rio team hopes to share what we have learned with other people who want to create similar initiatives in their own cities. We have already started doing it in S o Paulo with incredible results  and want to take it to cities around the world through a network of citizen centric  citizen led organizations that can inspire us  challenge us  and remind us to demand real participation in our city lives. It is up to us to decide whether we want schools or parking lots  community driven recycling projects or construction sites  loneliness or solidarity  cars or buses  and it is our responsibility to do that now  for ourselves  for our families  for the people who make our lives worth living  and for the incredible creativity  beauty  and wonder that make our cities  in spite of all of their problems  the greatest invention of our time. Obrigado. Thank you. You know  it's a big privilege for me to be working in one of the biodiversity hotspots in the world  the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean. These islands   Mauritius  Rodrigues  and R union   along with the island of Madagascar  they are blessed with unique plants found nowhere else in the world. And today I will tell you  about five of them and their particular features and why these plants are so unique. Take a look at this plant. I call it benjoin in the local vernacular  and the botanical name  is Terminalia bentzoe  subspecies bentzoe. This subspecies is endemic to Mauritius  and its particular feature is its heterophylly. What do I mean by heterophylly  It's that the same plant has got leaves that are different shapes and sizes. Now  these plants have evolved very far away from the mainland  and within specific ecosystems. Often  these particular features have evolved as a response to the threat presented by the local fauna  in this case  grazing tortoises. Tortoises are known to have poor eyesight  and as such  they tend to avoid the plants they don't recognize. So this evolutionary  foil safeguards the plant against these rather cute animals  and protects it and of course  ensures its survival. Now the question you're  probably asking yourself is  why is she telling us all these stories  The reason for that is that we tend to overlook the diversity and the variety of the natural world. These particular habitats are unique and they are host to a whole lot of plants. We don't realize how valuable and how precious these resources are  and yet  through our insouciance  we keep on destroying them. We're all familiar with the macro impact of urbanization  climate change  resource exploitation  but when that one last plant   or animal for that matter   when that very last specimen has disappeared from the face of this Earth  we would have lost an entire subset of the Earth's biology  and with it  important plants  with medicinal potential or which could have ingredients that would speak to the cosmetic  nutrition  pharma  and even the ethno veterinary sectors  be gone forever. And here we have a very prime example of the iconic dodo  which comes from Mauritius  and  of course  we know is  now a symbol of extinction. We know plants have a  fundamental role to play. Well  first of all  they feed us and they also give us  the oxygen we breathe  but plants are also the source of important  biologically active ingredients that we should be studying very carefully  because human societies over the millennia  they have developed important knowledge  cultural traditions  and important plant based medicinal resources. Here's a data point   .  percent of the entire land surface is home to    percent of the species of higher plants     percent of the species of vertebrates  and this  .  percent represents the    biodiversity hotspots in the world  and this  .  percent of the entire land surface already provides for    percent of the ecosystem services that vulnerable people depend on. And as you can see  the island of Mauritius where I work and where I live  belongs to one such biodiversity hotspot  and I study the unique plants on the island for their  biomedical applications. Now  let's go back again to that first plant I showed you  the one  of course  with  different shaped leaves and different sizes  Terminalia bentzoe  subspecies bentzoe  a plant only found in Mauritius. Now  the local people  they used a decoction of the leaves against infectious diseases. Now our work  that is  the scientific validation of  this traditional information  has shown that precisely that leaf extract shows activity  potent activity  against a wide range of bacteria that could be pathogenic to humans. Now  could this plant be the answer to antibiotic resistance  You know  antibiotic resistance is proving to be a big challenge globally. While we may not be sure  one thing is certain  we will not want this plant to disappear. But the harsh reality is that this particular plant is in fact considered to be vulnerable in its natural habitat. This brings me to another example. This bush here is known as baume de l'ile plate in the local vernacular. The botanical name is Psiadia arguta. It's a plant which is rare  which is endemic to Mauritius. It used to grow on the mainland  but through the sheer  pressures of urbanization has been pushed out of the mainland  and we've managed to bring it back from the brink of extinction by developing in vitro plants which are now growing in the wild. Now  one thing I must  point out straightaway is that not all plants can be developed in vitro. While we humans  we are  happy in our comfort zone  these plants also need their ecosystem to be preserved  and they don't react   endemic plants don't react to very harsh  changes in their ecosystem  and yet we know what are the challenges that climate change  for example  is posing to these plants. Now  the local people again use the leaves in traditional medicine against respiratory problems. Now  our preliminary labwork on the leaf extract has shown that precisely these  leaves contain ingredients that are very close   in terms of structures  chemical structures  to those medicines which are sold in the chemist's shop against asthma. So who knows what humanity will benefit from should this plant decide  to reveal all its secrets. Now  I come from the developing world where we are forever being  challenged with this issue of population explosion. Africa is the continent  which is getting younger  and whenever one talks  about population explosion  one talks about the issue of food security as being the other side of the same coin. Now this plant here  the baobab  could be part of the answer. It's an underutilized  neglected food plant. It defines the landscape of West Africa  where it is known as the tree of life  and later on I will tell you why the Africans consider it to be the tree of life. Now interestingly  there are many legends which are associated with this plant. Because of its sheer size  it was meant to be lording over lesser plants  so God didn't like this arrogance  uprooted it  and planted it upside down  hence its particular shape. And if you look at this tree again within the African context  in West Africa  it's known  as the palaver tree  because it performs great social functions. Now if you have a problem in the community  meeting under the palaver tree with the chiefs or the tribesmen would be synonymous to trying to find a solution to that particular problem  and also to reinforce trust and respect among members of the community. From the scientific point of view  there are eight species of baobab in the world. There's one from Africa  one from Australia  and six are endemic to the island of Madagascar. The one I have showed you is the one from Africa  Adansonia digitata. Now  the flower  this  beautiful white flower  it opens at night  is pollinated by bats  and it gives rise to the fruit which is curiously known as the monkey apple. The monkeys are not stupid animals. They know what's good for them. Now  if you open the fruit of the baobab  you'll see a white  floury pulp  which is very rich in nutrients and has got protein  more protein than in human milk. Yes  you heard right  more protein than in human milk. And this is one of the reasons why the nutrition companies of this world  they are looking for this fruit to provide what we know as reinforced food. The seeds give an oil  a very stable oil which is sought after  by the cosmetic industry to give to produce body lotions  for example. And if you look at the trunk  the trunk  of course  safeguards water  which is often harvested by a thirsty traveler  and the leaves are used in traditional medicine against infectious disease. Now  you can see now why the Africans consider it to be the tree of life. It's a complete plant  and in fact  the sheer size of these trees is hiding a massive potential  not only for the pharma  nutrition  and the cosmetic industry. What I have showed you here is only the species from Africa  Adansonia digitata. We have six species yet in Madagascar  and we don't know what  is the potential of this plant  but one thing we know is that the flora is considered to be  threatened with extinction. Let me take you to Africa again  and introduce you to one of my very favorite  the resurrection plant. Now here you'll find that even Jesus has competition. Now  this plant here has developed remarkable tolerance to drought  which enables it to withstand up to    percent dehydration  over the period of a year without damage  and yet it can regenerate  itself almost completely overnight  over    hours  and flower. Now  us human beings  we're always on the lookout for the elixir of youth. We don't want to get old  and rightly so. Why should we  especially if you can afford it  And this gives you an indication of what the plant looks like before. Now  if you are an inexperienced gardener  the first thing you'll do  when you visit the garden is to uproot this plant because it's dead. But if you water it  this is what you get. Absolutely amazing. Now  if you look at our aging process  the aging process is in fact the loss of water from the upper epidermis  resulting in wrinkling as we know it  especially women  we are so conscious of this. And this plant  in fact  is giving  the cosmetic chemists very important ingredients that are actually finding ways to slow down the aging process and at the same time reinforce the cells against the onslaught of environmental toxins. Now  these four examples I have just given you are just a very tiny reminder as to how our health and our survival are closely linked to the health and the resilience of our ecosystem  and why we should be very careful about preserving biodiversity. Every time a forest is cut down  every time a marsh is filled in  it is a potential lab that goes with it  and which we will never  ever recover. And I know what I'm talking about  coming from Mauritius and missing the dodo. Let me finish with just one last example. Conservation issues are normally guided towards rare  endemic plants  but what we call exotic plants  that is  the ones which grow in many different habitats across the world  they also need to be considered. You know why  Because the environment plays a very important role in modifying the composition of that plant. So let's take a look at this plant here  Centella asiatica. It's a weed. We call it a weed. Now  Centella asiatica  grows across the world in many different habitats    in Africa  in Asia   and this plant has been instrumental in providing a solution  to that dreadful disease called leprosy in Madagascar in the     s. Now  while Centella  grows across the world   in Africa  in Asia    the best quality Centella comes from Madagascar  because that Centella contains the three vital ingredients which are sought after by the pharma and the cosmetic companies. And the cosmetic companies  are already using it to make regenerating cream. Now  there is an ancient saying that for every disease known to mankind  there is a plant to cure it. Now  you may not  believe in ancient sayings. You may think they're obsolete now that our science and  technology are so powerful. So you may look on Centella as being an insignificant  humble weed  which  if destroyed  won't be missed. But you know  there is no such thing as a weed. It's a plant. It's a living biological lab that may well have answers to the question that we may have  but we have to ensure that it has the right to live. Thank you. I grew up diagnosed as phobically shy  and  like at least    other people in a room of this size  I was a stutterer. Do you dare raise your hand  And it sticks with us. It really does stick with us  because when we are treated that way  we feel invisible sometimes  or talked around and at. And as I started to look at people  which is mostly all I did  I noticed that some people really wanted attention and recognition. Remember  I was young then. So what did they do  What we still do perhaps too often. We talk about ourselves. And yet there are other people I observed who had what I called a mutuality mindset. In each situation  they found a way to talk about us and create that  us  idea. So my idea to reimagine the world is to see it one where we all become greater opportunity makers with and for others. There's no greater opportunity or call for action for us now than to become opportunity makers who use best talents together more often for the greater good and accomplish things we couldn't have done on our own. And I want to talk to you about that  because even more than giving  even more than giving  is the capacity for us to do something smarter together for the greater good that lifts us both up and that can scale. That's why I'm sitting here. But I also want to point something else out  Each one of you is better than anybody else at something. That disproves that popular notion that if you're the smartest person in the room  you're in the wrong room. So let me tell you about a Hollywood party I went to a couple years back  and I met this up and coming actress  and we were soon talking about something that we both felt passionately about  public art. And she had the fervent belief that every new building in Los Angeles should have public art in it. She wanted a regulation for it  and she fervently started   who is here from Chicago    she fervently started talking about these bean shaped reflective sculptures in Millennium Park  and people would walk up to it and they'd smile in the reflection of it  and they'd pose and they'd vamp and they'd take selfies together  and they'd laugh. And as she was talking  a  thought came to my mind. I said   I know someone you ought to meet. He's getting out of San Quentin  in a couple of weeks     and he shares your fervent desire that art should engage and enable people to connect.  He spent five years in solitary  and I met him because I gave a speech at San Quentin  and he's articulate and he's rather easy on  the eyes because he's buff. He had workout regime he did every day. I think she was following me at that point. I said   He'd be an unexpected ally.  And not just that. There's James. He's an architect and he's a professor  and he loves place making  and place making is when you have those mini plazas and those urban walkways and where they're dotted with art  where people draw and  come up and talk sometimes. I think they'd make good allies. And indeed they were. They met together. They prepared. They spoke in front of the  Los Angeles City Council. And the council members not only passed the regulation  half of them came down and asked to pose with them afterwards. They were startling   compelling and credible. You can't buy that. What I'm asking you to consider is what kind of opportunity  makers we might become  because more than wealth or fancy titles or a lot of contacts  it's our capacity to connect around each other's  better side and bring it out. And I'm not saying this is easy  and I'm sure many of you have made the wrong moves too about who you wanted to connect with  but what I want to suggest is  this is an opportunity. I started thinking about it way back when I was a  Wall Street Journal reporter and I was in Europe and I was supposed to cover trends and trends that transcended business or politics or lifestyle. So I had to have contacts in different worlds very different than mine  because otherwise you couldn't spot the trends. And third  I had to write the story in a way stepping into the reader's shoes  so they could see how these  trends could affect their lives. That's what opportunity makers do. And here's a strange thing  Unlike an increasing number of Americans who are working and living  and playing with people who think exactly like them because we then become more rigid and extreme  opportunity makers are actively seeking situations with people unlike them  and they're building relationships  and because they do that  they have trusted relationships where they can bring the right team in and recruit them to solve a  problem better and faster and seize more opportunities. They're not affronted by differences  they're fascinated by them  and that is a huge shift in mindset  and once you feel it  you  want it to happen a lot more. This world is calling out for us  to have a collective mindset  and I believe in doing that. It's especially important now. Why is it important now  Because things can be devised like drones and drugs and data collection  and they can be devised by more people and cheaper ways for beneficial purposes and then  as we know from the news every day  they can be used for dangerous ones. It calls on us  each of us  to a higher calling. But here's the icing on the cake  It's not just the first opportunity that you do with somebody else that's probably your greatest  as an institution or an individual. It's after you've had that experience and you trust each other. It's the unexpected things that you devise later on you never could have predicted. For example  Marty is the husband  of that actress I mentioned  and he watched them  when they were practicing  and he was soon talking to Wally  my friend the ex con  about that exercise regime. And he thought  I have a set of racquetball courts. That guy could teach it. A lot of people who work there are members at my courts. They're frequent travelers. They could practice in their hotel room  no equipment provided. That's how Wally got hired. Not only that  years later he was also teaching racquetball. Years after that  he was teaching the racquetball teachers. What I'm suggesting is  when  you connect with people around a shared interest and action  you're accustomed to serendipitous things happening into the future  and I think that's what we're looking at. We open ourselves up to those opportunities  and in this room  are key players in technology  key players who are uniquely positioned to do this  to scale systems and projects together. So here's what I'm calling for you to do. Remember the three traits of opportunity makers. Opportunity makers keep honing their top strength and they become pattern seekers. They get involved in different  worlds than their worlds so they're trusted and they  can see those patterns  and they communicate to connect around sweet spots of shared interest. So what I'm asking you is  the world is hungry. I truly believe  in my firsthand experience  the world is hungry for us to unite together as opportunity makers and to emulate those behaviors as so many of you already do   I know that firsthand   and to reimagine a world where we use our best talents together more often to accomplish greater things together than we could on our own. Just remember  as Dave Liniger once said   You can't succeed coming to the potluck with only a fork.  Thank you very much. Thank you.  Applause  If there's any power in design  that's the power of synthesis. The more complex the problem  the more the need for simplicity. So allow me to share three cases where we tried to apply design's power of synthesis. Let's start with the global challenge of urbanization. It's a fact that people are moving towards cities. and even if counterintuitive  it's good news. Evidence shows that people are better off in cities. But there's a problem that I would call the   S  menace  The scale  speed  and scarcity of means with which we will have to respond to this phenomenon has no precedence in history. For you to have an idea  out of the three billion  people living in cities today  one billion are under the line of poverty. By       out of the five billion people that will be living in cities  two billion are going to  be under the line of poverty. That means that we will have to build a one million person city per week with        dollars per family during the next    years. A one million person city per week with        dollars per family. If we don't solve this equation  it is not that people  will stop coming to cities. They will come anyhow  but they will live in slums  favelas and informal settlements. So what to do  Well  an answer may come from favelas and slums themselves. A clue could be in this  question we were asked    years ago. We were asked to accommodate     families that had been occupying illegally half a hectare in the center of the city of Iquique  in the north of Chile using a         subsidy with which we had to buy the land  provide the infrastructure  and build the houses that   in the best of the cases  would be of around    square meters. And by the way  they said  the cost of the land  because it's in the center of the city  is three times more than what social housing can normally afford. Due to the difficulty of the question  we decided to include the families in the process of understanding the constraints  and we started a participatory design process  and testing what was  available there in the market. Detached houses     families could be accommodated. Row houses     families.       families   The only way to accommodate all of them was by building in height  and they threatened us to go on a hunger strike if we even dared to offer this as a solution  because they could not  make the tiny apartments expand. So the conclusion with the families   and this is important   not our conclusion   with the families  was that we had a problem. We had to innovate. So what did we do  Well  a middle class family lives reasonably well in around    square meters  but when there's no money  what the market does is to reduce the size of the house to    square meters. What we said was  what if  instead of thinking of    square meters as a small house  why don't we consider it half of a good one  When you rephrase the problem as half of a good house instead of a small one  the key question is  which half do we do  And we thought we had  to do with public money the half that families won't  be able to do individually. We identified five design conditions that belonged to the hard half of a house  and we went back to the  families to do two things  join forces and split tasks. Our design was something in between a building and a house. As a building  it could pay for expensive  well located land  and as a house  it could expand. If  in the process of not being expelled to the periphery while getting a house  families kept their  network and their jobs  we knew that the expansion  would begin right away. So we went from this initial social housing to a middle class unit achieved by families themselves within a couple of weeks. This was our first project in Iquique    years ago. This is our last project in Chile. Different designs  same principle  You provide the frame  and from then on  families take over. So the purpose of design  trying to understand and  trying to give an answer to the   S  menace  scale  speed  and scarcity  is to channel people's own building capacity. We won't solve the one million people per week equation unless we use people's own power for building. So  with the right design  slums and favelas may not be the problem but actually the only possible solution. The second case is how design can contribute to sustainability. In       we entered the competition for the Angelini Innovation Center  and the aim was to build the right environment for knowledge creation. It is accepted that for such an aim  knowledge creation  interaction among people   face to face contact  it's important  and we agreed on that. But for us  the question  of the right environment was a very literal question. We wanted to have a working space with the right light  with the right temperature  with the right air. So we asked ourselves  Does the typical office building help us in that sense  Well  how does that  building look  typically  It's a collection of floors  one on top of each other  with a core in the center with elevators  stairs   pipes  wires  everything  and then a glass skin on the outside that  due to direct sun radiation  creates a huge greenhouse effect inside. In addition to that  let's say a guy working on the seventh floor goes every single day  through the third floor  but has no idea what the guy on that floor is working on. So we thought  well  maybe  we have to turn this scheme inside out. And what we did was  let's have an open atrium  a hollowed core  the same collection of floors  but have the walls and the mass in the perimeter  so that when the sun hits  it's not impacting directly glass  but a wall. When you have an open atrium inside  you are able to see what others are doing from within the building  and you have a better way to control light  and when you place the mass and the walls in the perimeter  then you are preventing direct sun radiation. You may also open those windows and get cross ventilation. We just made those openings of such a scale that they could work as elevated squares  outdoor spaces throughout the entire height of the building. None of this is rocket science. You don't require sophisticated programming. It's not about technology. This is just archaic   primitive common sense  and by using common sense  we went from     kilowatts per square meter per year  which is the typical energy consumption for cooling a glass tower  to    kilowatts per square meter per year. So with the right design  sustainability is nothing but the rigorous use of common sense. Last case I would like  to share is how design can provide more comprehensive answers against natural disasters. You may know that Chile  in       was hit by an  .  Richter scale earthquake and tsunami  and we were called to work in the reconstruction of the Constituci n  in the southern part of the country. We were given     days  three months  to design almost everything  from public buildings to public space  street grid  transportation  housing  and mainly how to protect the city against future tsunamis. This was new in Chilean urban design  and there were in the  air a couple of alternatives. First one  Forbid installation on ground zero. Thirty million dollars spent mainly in land expropriation. This is exactly what's being discussed in Japan nowadays  and if you have a disciplined population like the Japanese  this may work  but we know that in Chile  this land is going to be  occupied illegally anyhow  so this alternative was  unrealistic and undesirable. Second alternative  build a big wall  heavy infrastructure to resist the energy of the waves. This alternative was conveniently lobbied by big building companies  because it meant    million  dollars in contracts  and was also politically preferred  because it required no land expropriation. But Japan proved that trying to resist the force of nature is useless. So this alternative was irresponsible. As in the housing process  we had to include the community in the way of finding a solution for this  and we started a participatory design process. Vote for Constituci n. Go to the Open House and express your options. Participate  Fisherman  I am a fisherman. Twenty five fishermen work for me. Where should I take them  To the forest  Man  So why can't we have a concrete defense  Done well  of course. Man    I am the history of Constituci n. And you come here to tell me that I cannot keep on living here  My whole family has lived here  I raised my children here  and my children will also  raise their children here. and my grandchildren  and everyone else will. But why are you imposing this on me  You  You are imposing this on me  In danger zone I am not authorized to build. He himself is saying that. Man    No  no  no  Nieves... Alejandro Aravena  I don't know if you were able to read the subtitles  but you can tell from the body language that participatory design is not a hippie  romantic  let's all dream together about  the future of the city kind of thing. It is actually    Applause  It is actually not even with the families trying to find the right answer. It is mainly trying to identify with precision what is the right question. There is nothing worse than answering well the wrong question. So it was pretty obvious after this process that  well  we chicken out here and go away because it's too tense  or we go even further in asking  what else is bothering you  What other problems do you have and you want us to take  care of now that the city will have to be rethought from scratch  And what they said was  look  fine to protect the city  against future tsunamis  we really appreciate  but the next one  is going to come in  what     years  But every single year  we have problems of flooding due to rain. In addition  we are in the middle of the forest region of the country  and our public space sucks. It's poor and it's scarce. And the origin of the city  our identity  is not really connected to the buildings that fell  it is connected to the river  but the river cannot be accessed publicly  because its shores are privately owned. So we thought that we had to produce a third alternative  and our approach was  against geographical threats  have geographical answers. What if  in between the city and the sea we have a forest  a forest that doesn't try to resist the energy of nature  but dissipates it by introducing friction  A forest that may be able to laminate the water and prevent the flooding  That may pay the historical debt of public space  and that may provide  finally  democratic access to the river. So as a conclusion of the participatory design  the alternative was validated politically and socially  but there was still the problem of the cost     million dollars. So what we did was a survey in the public investment system  and found out that there  were three ministries with three projects in  the exact same place  not knowing of the existence  of the other projects. The sum of them     million dollars. So design's power of synthesis is trying to make a more efficient use of the scarcest resource in cities  which is not money but coordination. By doing so  we were able to save four million dollars  and  that is why the forest is today under construction. So be it the force of self construction  the force of common sense  or the force of nature  all these forces need to be translated into form  and what that form is modeling and shaping is not cement  bricks  or wood. It is life itself. Design's power of synthesis is just an attempt to put at the innermost core of architecture the force of life. Thank you so much. Dre Urhahn  This theater  is built on Copacabana  which is the most famous  beach in the world  but    kilometers away from here in the North Zone of Rio lies a community called Vila Cruzeiro  and roughly        people live there. Now  the people here in Rio mostly know Vila Cruzeiro from the news  and unfortunately  news  from Vila Cruzeiro often is not good news. But Vila Cruzeiro is also the place where our story begins. Jeroen Koolhaas  Ten years  ago  we first came to Rio to shoot a documentary  about life in the favelas. Now  we learned that favelas  are informal communities. They emerged over the years when immigrants from the countryside came to the cities looking for work  like cities within the cities  known for problems like crime  poverty  and the violent drug war between police and the drug gangs. So what struck us was that these were communities that the people who lived there had built  with their own hands  without a master plan and like a giant work in progress. Where we're from  in Holland  everything is planned. We even have rules for  how to follow the rules. DU  So the last day of  filming  we ended up in Vila Cruzeiro  and  we were sitting down and we had a drink  and we were overlooking this hill with all these houses  and most of these houses looked unfinished  and they had walls of bare brick  but we saw some of these houses which were plastered and painted  and suddenly we had this idea  what would it look like if all these houses would be plastered and painted  And then we imagined one big design  one big work of art. Who would expect something like that in a place like this  So we thought  would that even be possible  So first we started to count the houses  but we soon lost count. But somehow the idea stuck. JK  We had a friend. He ran an NGO in Vila Cruzeiro. His name was Nanko  and he also liked the idea. He said   You know  everybody here would pretty much love  to have their houses plastered and painted. It's when a house is finished.  So he introduced us to the right people  and Vitor and Maurinho became our crew. We picked three houses in the center of the community and we start here. We made a few designs  and everybody liked this design of a boy flying a kite the best. So we started painting   and the first thing we did was to paint everything blue  and we thought that looked  already pretty good. But they hated it. The people who lived there really hated it. They said   What did you do  You painted our house in  exactly the same color as the police station.  In a favela  that is not a good thing. Also the same color as the prison cell. So we quickly went ahead  and we painted the boy  and then we thought we were finished  we were really happy  but still  it wasn't good because the little kids started coming up to us  and they said   You know   there's a boy flying the kite  but where is his kite   We said   Uh  it's art. You know  you have to imagine the kite.  And they said   No  no  no   we want to see the kite.  So we quickly installed a kite way up high on the hill  so that you could see  the boy flying the kite and you could actually see a kite. So the local news started writing about it  which was great  and then even The Guardian wrote about it   Notorious slum becomes open air gallery.  JK  So  encouraged by this success  we went back to Rio for a second project  and we stumbled upon this street. It was covered in concrete  to prevent mudslides  and somehow we saw a sort of river in it  and we imagined this river to be a river in Japanese style with koi carp swimming upstream. So we decided to paint that river  and we invited Rob Admiraal  who is a tattoo artist  and he specialized in the Japanese style. So little did we know that we would spend almost an entire year painting that river  together with Geovani and Robinho and Vitor  who lived nearby. And we even moved into the neighborhood when one of the guys that  lived on the street  Elias  told us that we could come  and live in his house  together with his family  which was fantastic. Unfortunately  during that time  another war broke out between the police and the drug gangs. We learned that during those times  people in communities  really stick together during these times of hardship  but we also learned a  very important element  the importance of barbecues.   Laughter  Because  when you throw a barbecue  it turns you from a guest into a host  so we decided to throw one almost every other week  and we got to know everybody  in the neighborhood. JK  We still had this  idea of the hill  though. DU  Yeah  yeah  we were talking about the scale of this  because this painting was incredibly big  and it was insanely detailed  and this process almost drove us completely insane ourselves. But we figured that maybe   during this process  all the time that we had  spent in the neighborhood was maybe actually even more important than the painting itself. JK  So after all that time  this hill  this idea was still there  and we started to make sketches  models  and we figured something out. We figured that our ideas  our designs had to be a little bit more simple than that last project so that we could paint with more people and cover more houses at the same time. And we had an opportunity to try that out in a community in the central part of Rio  which is called Santa Marta  and we made a design for this place which looked like this  and then we got people to go along with it because turns out that if  your idea is ridiculously big  it's easier to get people to  go along with this.  Laughter  And the people of Santa Marta got together and in a little over a month they turned that square into this. And this image somehow  went all over the world. DU  So then we received  an unexpected phone call from the Philadelphia Mural Arts Program  and they had this question if this idea  our approach  if this would actually  work in North Philly  which is one of the poorest neighborhoods in the United States. So we immediately said yes. We had no idea how  but it seemed like a very  interesting challenge  so we did exactly the  same as we did in Rio  and we moved into the neighborhood and started barbecuing. So the project took almost two years to complete  and we made individual designs for every single house on  the avenue that we painted  and we made these designs together with the local store owners   the building owners  and a team of about a dozen  young men and women. They were hired  and then they were trained as painters  and together they transformed their own neighborhood  the whole street  into a  giant patchwork of color. And at the end  the city of Philadelphia thanked every single one of them and gave them a merit for their accomplishment. JK  So now we had painted a whole street. How about we do this whole hill now  We started looking for funding  but instead  we just ran into questions  like  how many houses  are you going to paint  How many square meters is that  How much paint are you going to use  and how many people are you going to employ  And we did try for years to write plans for the funding and answer  all those questions  but then we thought  in order to answer all those questions  you have to know exactly  what you're going to do before you actually get there and start. And maybe it's a mistake  to think like that. It would lose some of the  magic that we had learned about that if you go somewhere and you spend time there  you can let the project grow organically and have a life of its own. DU  So what we did is we decided to take this  plan and strip it away from all the numbers and all the ideas and presumptions and just go back to the base idea  which was to transform this hill into a giant work of art. And instead of looking for funding  we started a crowdfunding campaign  and in a little over a month  more than       people put together and donated over         dollars. So for us  this was an amazing  moment  because now   because now we finally had the freedom to use all the lessons that we had learned and create a project that was built the same way that the favela was built  from the ground on up  bottom up  with no master plan. JK  So we went back   and we employed Angelo  and he's a local artist from Vila Cruzeiro  very talented guy  and he knows almost everybody there  and then we employed Elias  our former landlord who invited us into his house  and he's a master of construction. Together with them  we decided where to start. We picked this spot in Vila Cruzeiro  and houses are being plastered as we speak. And the good thing about them is that they are deciding which houses go next. They're even printing t shirts  they're putting up banners explaining everything to everybody  and talking to the press. This article about Angelo appeared. DU  So while this is happening  we are bringing this  idea all over the world. So  like the project we  did in Philadelphia  we are also invited to do workshops  for instance in Cura ao  and right now we're planning  a huge project in Haiti. JK  So the favela was not only the place where this idea started  it was also the place that made it possible to work without a master plan  because these communities are informal   this was the inspiration   and in a communal effort   together with the people  you can almost work like in an orchestra  where you can have a hundred instruments playing together to create a symphony. DU  So we want to thank everybody who wanted to become part of this dream and supported us along the way  and we are looking at continuing. JK  Yeah. And so one day pretty soon  when the colors start  going up on these walls  we hope more people will join us  and join this big dream  and maybe one day  the  whole of Vila Cruzeiro will be painted. DU  Thank you. The first patient to ever be  treated with an antibiotic was a policeman in Oxford. On his day off from work  he was scratched by a rose thorn while working in the garden. That small scratch became infected. Over the next few days   his head was swollen with abscesses  and in fact his eye was so infected that they had to take it out  and by February of       this poor man was on the verge of dying. He was at Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford  and fortunately for him  a small team of doctors led by a Dr. Howard Florey had managed to synthesize a very small amount of penicillin  a drug that had been discovered    years before by Alexander Fleming but had never actually been  used to treat a human  and indeed no one even  knew if the drug would work  if it was full of impurities  that would kill the patient  but Florey and his team figured if they had to use it   they might as well use it on someone who was going to die anyway. So they gave Albert Alexander  this Oxford policeman  the drug  and within    hours  he started getting better. His fever went down   his appetite came back. Second day  he was doing much better. They were starting to  run out of penicillin  so what they would do  was run with his urine across the road to re synthesize  the penicillin from his urine and give it back to him  and that worked. Day four  well on the way to recovery. This was a miracle. Day five  they ran out of penicillin  and the poor man died. So that story didn't end that well  but fortunately for  millions of other people  like this child who was treated  again in the early     s  who was again dying of a sepsis  and within just six days  you can see  recovered thanks to this  wonder drug  penicillin. Millions have lived  and global health has been transformed. Now  antibiotics have been used for patients like this  but they've also been  used rather frivolously in some instances  for treating someone  with just a cold or the flu  which they might not have  responded to an antibiotic  and they've also been  used in large quantities sub therapeutically  which means in small concentrations  to make chicken and hogs grow faster. Just to save a few pennies on the price of meat  we've spent a lot of  antibiotics on animals  not for treatment  not for sick animals  but primarily for growth promotion. Now  what did that lead us to  Basically  the massive use of antibiotics around the world has imposed such large selection pressure on bacteria that resistance is now a problem  because we've now selected for just the resistant bacteria. And I'm sure you've all read about this in the newspapers  you've seen this in every magazine that you come across  but I really want you to appreciate the significance of this problem. This is serious. The next slide I'm about to show you is  of carbapenem resistance in acinetobacter. Acinetobacter is a nasty hospital bug  and carbapenem is pretty much the strongest class of antibiotics that we can throw at this bug. And you can see in      this is the pattern of resistance  mostly under about    percent across the United States. Now watch what happens  when we play the video. So I don't know where you live  but wherever it is  it certainly is a lot worse now than it was in       and that is the problem of antibiotic resistance. It's a global issue affecting both rich and poor countries  and at the heart of it   you might say  well  isn't this really just a medical issue  If we taught doctors how not  to use antibiotics as much  if we taught patients how  not to demand antibiotics  perhaps this really wouldn't be an issue  and maybe the pharmaceutical companies should be working harder to develop more antibiotics. Now  it turns out that there's something  fundamental about antibiotics which makes it different from other drugs  which is that if I misuse antibiotics or I use antibiotics  not only am I affected but  others are affected as well  in the same way as if I  choose to drive to work or take a plane to go somewhere  that the costs I impose on others through global climate change go everywhere  and I don't necessarily take these costs into consideration. This is what economists might  call a problem of the commons  and the problem of the commons is exactly what we face in the case  of antibiotics as well  that we don't consider   and we  including individuals  patients  hospitals  entire health systems   do not consider the costs  that they impose on others by the way antibiotics are actually used. Now  that's a problem that's similar to another area that we all know about  which is of fuel use and energy  and of course energy use both depletes energy as well as leads to local pollution  and climate change. And typically  in the case of energy  there are two ways in which you can deal with the problem. One is  we can make better use of the oil that we have  and that's analogous to making better use of existing antibiotics  and we can do this in a number of ways that we'll talk about in a second  but the other option is the   drill  baby  drill  option  which in the case of antibiotics  is to go find new antibiotics. Now  these are not separate. They're related  because if we invest heavily in new oil wells  we reduce the incentives  for conservation of oil in the same way that's going  to happen for antibiotics. The reverse is also going  to happen  which is that if we use our antibiotics appropriately  we don't necessarily have  to make the investments in new drug development. And if you thought that these two were entirely  fully balanced between these two options  you might consider the fact that this is really a game that we're playing. The game is really one of coevolution  and coevolution is  in  this particular picture  between cheetahs and gazelles. Cheetahs have evolved to run faster  because if they didn't run faster  they wouldn't get any lunch. Gazelles have evolved to run faster because if they don't run faster  they would be lunch. Now  this is the game we're playing against the bacteria  except we're not the cheetahs  we're the gazelles  and the bacteria would  just in the course of this little talk  would have had kids and grandkids and figured out how to be resistant just by selection and trial and error  trying it over and over again. Whereas how do we stay  ahead of the bacteria  We have drug discovery processes  screening molecules  we have clinical trials  and then  when we think we have a drug  then we have the FDA regulatory process. And once we go through all of that  then we try to stay one step ahead of the bacteria. Now  this is clearly not a  game that can be sustained  or one that we can win by simply innovating to stay ahead. We've got to slow the pace of coevolution down  and there are ideas that we  can borrow from energy that are helpful in thinking about how we might want to do this in the case of antibiotics as well. Now  if you think about how we deal with energy pricing  for instance  we consider emissions taxes  which means we're imposing  the costs of pollution on people who actually use that energy. We might consider doing that for antibiotics as well  and perhaps that would make sure that antibiotics actually get used appropriately. There are clean energy subsidies  which are to switch to fuels which don't pollute as much or perhaps don't need fossil fuels. Now  the analogy here is  perhaps we need to move away from using antibiotics  and if you think about it  what are  good substitutes for antibiotics  Well  turns out that anything that reduces the need for the antibiotic would really work  so that could include improving hospital infection control or vaccinating people  particularly against  the seasonal influenza. And the seasonal flu is probably the biggest driver of antibiotic use  both in this country as well as in many other countries  and that could really help. A third option might include something like tradeable permits. And these seem like faraway scenarios  but if you consider the  fact that we might not have antibiotics for many  people who have infections  we might consider the fact that we might want to allocate who actually gets to use some of these antibiotics over others  and some of these might have to be on the basis of clinical need  but also on the basis of pricing. And certainly consumer education works. Very often  people overuse antibiotics or prescribe too much without necessarily knowing that they do so  and feedback mechanisms have been found to be useful  both on energy   When you tell someone that they're using a lot of energy during peak hour  they tend to cut back  and the same sort of example has been performed even in the case of antibiotics. A hospital in St. Louis basically would put up on a chart the names of surgeons in the ordering of how much antibiotics they'd used in the previous month  and this was purely an  informational feedback  there was no shaming  but essentially that provided  some information back to surgeons that maybe they could rethink how they were using antibiotics. Now  there's a lot that can be done on the supply side as well. If you look at the price of penicillin  the cost per day is about    cents. It's a fairly cheap drug. If you take drugs that have been introduced since then   linezolid or daptomycin   those are significantly more expensive  so to a world that has been used to paying    cents a day for antibiotics  the idea of paying     dollars per day seems like a lot. But what is that really telling us  That price is telling us that we should no longer take cheap  effective  antibiotics as a given into the foreseeable future  and that price is a signal to us that perhaps we need to be paying much more attention to conservation. That price is also a signal that maybe we need to start looking at other technologies  in the same way that  gasoline prices are a signal and an impetus  to  say  the development of electric cars. Prices are important signals and we need to pay attention  but we also need to consider the fact that although these high prices seem unusual for antibiotics  they're nothing compared to the price per day of some cancer drugs  which might save a patient's life only for a few months or perhaps a year  whereas antibiotics would potentially save a patient's life forever. So this is going to involve a whole new paradigm shift  and it's also a scary shift because in many parts of this country  in many parts of the world  the idea of paying     dollars for a day of antibiotic treatment is simply unimaginable. So we need to think about that. Now  there are backstop options  which is other alternative technologies that people are working on. It includes bacteriophages  probiotics  quorum sensing  synbiotics. Now  all of these are useful avenues to pursue  and they will become even more lucrative when the price of new  antibiotics starts going higher  and we've seen that the market does actually respond  and the government is now considering ways of subsidizing new  antibiotics and development. But there are challenges here. We don't want to just throw money at a problem. What we want to be able to do is invest in new antibiotics in ways that actually encourage appropriate use and sales of those antibiotics  and that really is the challenge here. Now  going back to these technologies  you all remember the line from that famous dinosaur film   Nature will find a way.  So it's not as if these are  permanent solutions. We really have to remember that  whatever the technology might be  that nature will find some  way to work around it. You might think  well   this is just a problem just with antibiotics and with bacteria  but it turns out that we  have the exact same identical problem in  many other fields as well  with multidrug resistant tuberculosis  which is a serious problem  in India and South Africa. Thousands of patients are dying because the second line drugs are so expensive  and in some instances  even those don't work and you have XDR TB. Viruses are becoming resistant. Agricultural pests. Malaria parasites. Right now  much of the world depends on one drug  artemisinin drugs  essentially to treat malaria. Resistance to artemisinin has already emerged  and if this were to become widespread  that puts at risk the single drug that we have to  treat malaria around the world in a way that's currently  safe and efficacious. Mosquitos develop resistance. If you have kids  you probably  know about head lice  and if you're from New York City  I understand that the  specialty there is bedbugs. So those are also resistant. And we have to bring an example from across the pond. Turns out that rats are  also resistant to poisons. Now  what's common  to all of these things is the idea that we've had these technologies to control nature only for  the last        or     years and essentially in a blink  we have squandered our ability to control  because we have not recognized that natural selection and  evolution was going to find a way to get back  and we need to completely rethink how we're going to use measures to control biological organisms  and rethink how we incentivize the development  introduction  in the case of antibiotics prescription  and use of these valuable resources. And we really now need to  start thinking about them as natural resources. And so we stand at a crossroads. An option is to go through that rethinking and carefully consider incentives to change how we do business. The alternative is a world in which even a blade of grass is a potentially lethal weapon. Thank you. On January          a young man delivered a report to the United States Congress that    years on  still shapes the lives of everyone in this room today  still shapes the lives of everyone on this planet. That young man wasn't a politician  he wasn't a businessman  a civil rights activist or a faith leader. He was that most unlikely of heroes  an economist. His name was Simon Kuznets and the report that  he delivered was called  National Income           .  Now  you might think this is a rather dry and dull report. And you're absolutely right. It's dry as a bone. But this report is the foundation of how  today  we judge the  success of countries  what we know best as Gross Domestic Product  GDP. GDP has defined and shaped our lives for the last    years. And today I want to talk about a different way to measure the success of countries  a different way to define  and shape our lives for the next    years. But first  we have to understand how GDP came to dominate our lives. Kuznets' report was delivered at a moment of crisis. The U.S. economy was plummeting into the Great Depression and policy makers were  struggling to respond. Struggling because they didn't know what was going on. They didn't have data and statistics. So what Kuznet's report gave them was reliable data on what  the U.S. economy was producing  updated year by year. And armed with this information  policy makers were  eventually  able to find a way out  of the slump. And because Kuznets' invention was found to be so useful  it spread around the world. And now today  every country produces GDP statistics. But  in that first report  Kuznets himself delivered a warning. It's in the introductory chapter. On page seven he says   The welfare of a nation can  therefore  scarcely be inferred from a measurement of  national income as defined above.  It's not the greatest sound  bite in the world  and it's dressed up in the cautious  language of the economist. But his message was clear  GDP is a tool to help us measure economic performance. It's not a measure of our well being. And it shouldn't be a guide  to all decision making. But we have ignored Kuznets' warning. We live in a world where GDP is the benchmark of success in a global economy. Our politicians boast when GDP goes up. Markets move and trillions of dollars of capital move around the world based on which countries are going up and which countries  are going down  all measured in GDP. Our societies have become engines to create more GDP. But we know that GDP is flawed. It ignores the environment. It counts bombs and prisons as progress. It can't count happiness or community. And it has nothing to say  about fairness or justice. Is it any surprise that our world  marching to the drumbeat of GDP  is teetering on the brink of environmental disaster and filled with anger and conflict  We need a better way to measure our societies  a measure based on the real  things that matter to real people. Do I have enough to eat  Can I read and write  Am I safe  Do I have rights  Do I live in a society where I'm not discriminated against  Is my future and the future of my children  prevented from environmental destruction  These are questions that GDP does not and cannot answer. There have  of course  been efforts in the past to move beyond GDP. But I believe that we're living in a moment when we are ready for a measurement revolution. We're ready because we've seen  in the financial crisis of       how our fetish for economic growth led us so far astray. We've seen  in the Arab Spring  how countries like Tunisia were supposedly economic superstars  but they were societies that were seething with discontentment. We're ready  because today we have the technology to gather and analyze data in ways that would have been unimaginable to Kuznets. Today  I'd like to introduce you  to the Social Progress Index. It's a measure of the  well being of society  completely separate from GDP. It's a whole new way of looking at the world. The Social Progress Index begins by defining what it means to be a good society based around three dimensions. The first is  does everyone have the basic needs for survival  food  water  shelter  safety  Secondly  does everyone have access to the building blocks  to improve their lives  education  information  health and sustainable environment  And then third  does every  individual have access to a chance to pursue their goals and dreams and ambitions free from obstacles  Do they have rights  freedom of choice  freedom from discrimination and access to the the world's most advanced knowledge  Together  these    components form the Social Progress framework. And for each of these    components  we have indicators to measure  how countries are performing. Not indicators of effort or intention  but real achievement. We don't measure how much a country spends on healthcare  we measure the length and  quality of people's lives. We don't measure whether governments pass laws against discrimination  we measure whether people  experience discrimination. But what you want to know is who's top  don't you   Laughter  I knew that  I knew that  I knew that. Okay  I'm going to show you. I'm going to show you on this chart. So here we are  what I've done here is put on the  vertical axis social progress. Higher is better. And then  just for comparison  just for fun  on the horizontal axis is GDP per capita. Further to the right is more. So the country in the world with the highest social progress  the number one country on social progress is New Zealand. Well done  Never been  must go. The country with the least social progress  I'm sorry to say  is Chad. I've never been  maybe next year. Or maybe the year after. Now  I know what you're thinking. You're thinking   Aha  but New Zealand has a higher GDP than Chad   It's a good point  well made. But let me show you two other countries. Here's the United States   considerably richer than New Zealand  but with a lower level of social progress. And then here's Senegal   it's got a higher level of  social progress than Chad  but the same level of GDP. So what's going on  Well  look. Let me bring in the rest of  the countries of the world  the     we've been able to measure  each one represented by a dot. There we go. Lots of dots. Now  obviously I can't do all of them  so a few highlights for you  The highest ranked G  country is Canada. My country  the United Kingdom  is sort of middling  sort of dull  but who cares   at least we beat the French. And then looking at the  emerging economies  top of the BRICS   pleased to say  is Brazil. Come on  cheer  Go  Brazil  Beating South Africa  then Russia  then China and then India. Tucked away on the right hand side  you will see a dot of a  country with a lot of GDP but not a huge amount  of social progress   that's Kuwait. Just above Brazil is a social progress superpower   that's Costa Rica. It's got a level of social progress the same  as some Western European countries  with a much lower GDP. Now  my slide is getting  a little cluttered and I'd like to step back a bit. So let me take away these countries  and then pop in the regression line. So this shows the average relationship between GDP and social progress. The first thing to notice  is that there's lots of noise around the trend line. And what this shows  what this empirically demonstrates  is that GDP is not destiny. At every level of GDP per capita  there are opportunities for more social progress  risks of less. The second thing to notice is that for poor countries  the curve is really steep. So what this tells us is that if poor countries can get a little bit of extra GDP  and if they reinvest that in doctors  nurses  water supplies  sanitation  etc.  there's a lot of social progress bang for your GDP buck. And that's good news  and that's what  we've seen over the last        years  with a lot of people lifted out of poverty by economic growth and good policies in poorer countries. But go on a bit further up the curve  and then we see it flattening out. Each extra dollar of GDP is buying less and less social progress. And with more and more of the world's population living on this part of the curve  it means GDP is becoming less and less useful as a guide to our development. I'll show you an example of Brazil. Here's Brazil  social progress of about    out of      GDP per capita about         dollars a year. And look  Brazil's above the line. Brazil is doing a reasonably good job of turning GDP into social progress. But where does Brazil go next  Let's say that Brazil adopts a bold economic plan to double GDP in the next decade. But that is only half a plan. It's less than half a plan  because where does Brazil want to go on social progress  Brazil  it's possible to increase your growth  increase your GDP  while stagnating or going backwards on social progress. We don't want Brazil to become like Russia. What you really want is for Brazil to get ever more efficient at creating  social progress from its GDP  so it becomes more like New Zealand. And what that means is that Brazil needs to prioritize social progress in its development plan and see that it's not just growth alone  it's growth with social progress. And that's what the Social  Progress Index does  It reframes the debate about development  not just about GDP alone  but inclusive  sustainable growth that brings real improvements  in people's lives. And it's not just about countries. Earlier this year  with our friends from the Imazon  nonprofit here in Brazil  we launched the first subnational  Social Progress Index. We did it for the Amazon region. It's an area the size of  Europe     million people  one of the most deprived  parts of the country. And here are the results  and this is broken down into nearly     different municipalities. And with this detailed information about the real quality of life in this part of the country  Imazon and other partners from government   business and civil society can work together to construct a development plan that will help really improve people's lives  while protecting that  precious global asset that is the Amazon Rainforest. And this is just the beginning  You can create a Social Progress Index for any state  region   city or municipality. We all know and love TEDx  this is Social Pogress x. This is a tool for anyone to come and use. Contrary to the way we  sometimes talk about it  GDP was not handed down from  God on tablets of stone.  Laughter  It's a measurement tool invented in the   th century to address the challenges of the   th century. In the   st century  we face new challenges  aging  obesity  climate change  and so on. To face those challenges  we need new tools of measurement  new ways of valuing progress. Imagine if we could measure what nonprofits  charities  volunteers  civil society organizations really contribute to our society. Imagine if businesses competed not just on the basis of their economic contribution  but on their contribution  to social progress. Imagine if we could hold  politicians to account for really improving people's lives. Imagine if we could work together   government  business   civil society  me  you   and make this century the  century of social progress. Thank you. What has the War on Drugs  done to the world  Look at the murder and mayhem in Mexico  Central America  so many  other parts of the planet  the global black market estimated at     billion dollars a year  prisons packed in the  United States and elsewhere  police and military drawn  into an unwinnable war that violates basic rights   and ordinary citizens just hope they don't get  caught in the crossfire  and meanwhile  more people using more drugs than ever. It's my country's history  with alcohol prohibition and Al Capone  times   . Which is why it's  particularly galling to me as an American that we've  been the driving force behind this global drug war. Ask why so many countries criminalize drugs they'd never heard of  why the U.N. drug treaties emphasize criminalization over health  even why most of the money worldwide for dealing with drug abuse goes not to helping agencies but those that punish  and you'll find the good old U.S. of A. Why did we do this  Some people  especially in Latin America  think it's not really about drugs. It's just a subterfuge for advancing the realpolitik interests of the U.S. But by and large  that's not it. We don't want gangsters and guerrillas funded with illegal drug money terrorizing and taking over other nations. No  the fact is  America really is crazy when it comes to drugs. I mean  don't forget  we're  the ones who thought that we could prohibit alcohol. So think about our global drug war not as any sort of rational policy  but as the international projection of a domestic psychosis. But here's the good news. Now it's the Russians leading the Drug War and not us. Most politicians in my country want to roll back the Drug War now  put fewer people behind bars  not more  and I'm proud to say as an American that we now lead the world in reforming marijuana policies. It's now legal for medical purposes in almost half our    states  millions of people can  purchase their marijuana  their medicine  in government  licensed dispensaries  and over half my fellow  citizens now say it's time to legally regulate and tax marijuana more or less like alcohol. That's what Colorado and  Washington are doing  and Uruguay  and others  are sure to follow. So that's what I do  work to end the Drug War. I think it all started growing up in a fairly religious  moral family  eldest son of a rabbi  going off to university where I smoked some marijuana and I liked it.  Laughter  And I liked drinking too  but it was obvious that alcohol was really the more dangerous of the two  but my friends and I could get busted for smoking a joint. Now  that hypocrisy kept bugging me  so I wrote my Ph.D dissertation on international drug control. I talked my way into the State Department. I got a security clearance. I interviewed hundreds of DEA and other law enforcement agents all around Europe and the Americas  and I'd ask them   What do you think the answer is   Well  in Latin America  they'd say to me   You can't really cut off the supply. The answer lies back in the U.S.  in cutting off the demand.  So then I go back home and I talk to people involved in anti drug efforts there  and they'd say   You know  Ethan  you can't  really cut off the demand. The answer lies over there. You've got to cut off the supply.  Then I'd go and talk  to the guys in customs trying to stop drugs at the borders  and they'd say   You're  not going to stop it here. The answer lies over there  in cutting off supply and demand.  And it hit me  Everybody involved in this thought the answer lay in that area about which they knew the least. So that's when I started  reading everything I could about psychoactive drugs   the history  the science  the politics  all of it  and the more one read  the more it hit you how a thoughtful  enlightened  intelligent  approach took you over here  whereas the politics and laws of my country were taking you over here. And that disparity struck me as this incredible intellectual and moral puzzle. There's probably never been a drug free society. Virtually every society has ingested psychoactive substances to deal with pain  increase  our energy  socialize  even commune with God. Our desire to alter our consciousness may be as fundamental as our desires for food  companionship and sex. So our true challenge is to learn how to live with drugs so they cause the least possible harm and in some cases the  greatest possible benefit. I'll tell you something else I learned  that the reason some drugs  are legal and others not has almost nothing to do  with science or health or the relative risk of drugs  and almost everything to do with who uses and who is perceived  to use particular drugs. In the late   th century  when most of the drugs that are now illegal were legal  the principal consumers  of opiates in my country and others were middle aged white women  using them to alleviate aches and pains when few other analgesics were available. And nobody thought about  criminalizing it back then because nobody wanted to  put Grandma behind bars. But when hundreds of thousands of Chinese started showing up in my country  working hard on the railroads and the mines and then kicking back in the evening just like they had in the old country with a few puffs on that opium pipe  that's when you saw the  first drug prohibition laws in California and Nevada  driven by racist fears of Chinese transforming white women into opium addicted sex slaves. The first cocaine prohibition  laws  similarly prompted by racist fears of black men  sniffing that white powder and forgetting their proper place in Southern society. And the first marijuana prohibition laws  all about fears of Mexican migrants in the West and the Southwest. And what was true in my country  is true in so many others as well  with both the origins of these laws and their implementation. Put it this way  and I exaggerate only slightly  If the principal smokers of cocaine were affluent older white men and the principal consumers of Viagra were poor young black men  then smokable cocaine would be easy to get with a prescription from your doctor and selling Viagra would get you  five to    years behind bars. I used to be a professor teaching about this. Now I'm an activist  a human rights activist  and what drives me is my shame at living in an otherwise great nation that has less than five percent of the world's population but almost    percent of the world's incarcerated population. It's the people I meet  who have lost someone they love to drug related  violence or prison or overdose or AIDS because our drug policies emphasize criminalization over health. It's good people who have lost their jobs  their homes  their freedom   even their children to the state  not because they hurt anyone but solely because they chose to use one drug instead of another. So is legalization the answer  On that  I'm torn  three days a week I think yes  three days a week I think no  and on Sundays I'm agnostic. But since today is Tuesday  let me just say that legally  regulating and taxing most of the drugs that  are now criminalized would radically reduce  the crime  violence  corruption and black markets  and the problems of adulterated and unregulated drugs  and improve public safety  and allow taxpayer resources to be developed to more useful purposes. I mean  look  the markets  in marijuana  cocaine  heroin and methamphetamine are global commodities markets just like the global markets  in alcohol  tobacco  coffee  sugar  and so many other things. Where there is a demand  there will be a supply. Knock out one source and another inevitably emerges. People tend to think of prohibition as the ultimate form of regulation when in fact it represents  the abdication of regulation with criminals filling the void. Which is why putting criminal laws and police front and center in trying to control a dynamic global commodities market is a recipe for disaster. And what we really need to do is to bring the underground drug markets as much as possible aboveground and regulate them as  intelligently as we can to minimize both the harms of drugs and the harms of prohibitionist policies. Now  with marijuana  that obviously means legally regulating and  taxing it like alcohol. The benefits of doing so are enormous  the risks minimal. Will more people use marijuana  Maybe  but it's not  going to be young people  because it's not going to  be legalized for them  and quite frankly  they already have the best access to marijuana. I think it's going to be older people. It's going to be people in their   s and   s and   s who find they prefer a little marijuana to that drink in the evening or the sleeping pill or that it helps with  their arthritis or diabetes or maybe helps spice up a  long term marriage.  Laughter  And that just might be a  net public health benefit. As for the other drugs  look at Portugal  where  nobody goes to jail for possessing drugs  and the government's made  a serious commitment to treating addiction as a health issue. Look at Switzerland   Germany  the Netherlands  Denmark  England  where people who have been addicted to heroin for many years and repeatedly tried to quit and failed can get pharmaceutical  heroin and helping services in medical clinics  and  the results are in  Illegal drug abuse and disease and overdoses and crime  and arrests all go down  health and well being improve  taxpayers benefit  and many drug users even put their addictions behind them. Look at New Zealand  which  recently enacted a law allowing certain recreational  drugs to be sold legally provided their safety had been established. Look here in Brazil  and some other countries  where a remarkable psychoactive substance  ayahuasca  can be legally  bought and consumed provided it's done so  within a religious context. Look in Bolivia and Peru  where all sorts of products  made from the coca leaf  the source of cocaine  are sold legally over the counter with no apparent harm to people's public health. I mean  don't forget  Coca Cola had cocaine in it until       and so far as we know was no more addictive than Coca Cola is today. Conversely  think about cigarettes  Nothing can both hook you  and kill you like cigarettes. When researchers ask heroin addicts what's the toughest drug to  quit  most say cigarettes. Yet in my country and many others  half of all the people who  were ever addicted to cigarettes have quit without anyone being  arrested or put in jail or sent to a  treatment program  by a prosecutor or a judge. What did it were higher taxes and time and place  restrictions on sale and use and effective anti smoking campaigns. Now  could we reduce smoking even more by making it totally illegal  Probably. But just imagine the drug war nightmare that would result. So the challenges we face today are twofold. The first is the policy challenge of designing and implementing alternatives to ineffective prohibitionist policies  even as we need to get  better at regulating and living with the drugs  that are now legal. But the second challenge is tougher  because it's about us. The obstacles to reform  lie not just out there in the power of the  prison industrial complex or other vested interests  that want to keep things the way they are  but within each and every one of us. It's our fears and our lack of knowledge and imagination that stands  in the way of real reform. And ultimately  I think that  boils down to the kids  and to every parent's desire to put our baby in a bubble  and the fear that somehow drugs will pierce that bubble and put our young ones at risk. In fact  sometimes it  seems like the entire War on Drugs gets justified as one great big child protection act  which any young person  can tell you it's not. So here's what I say to teenagers. First  don't do drugs. Second  don't do drugs. Third  if you do do drugs  there's some things I want you to know  because my bottom line as your parent is  come home safely at the end of the night and grow up and lead a  healthy and good adulthood. That's my drug education  mantra  Safety first. So this is what I've dedicated my life to  to building an organization and a movement of people who believe we  need to turn our backs on the failed prohibitions of the past and embrace new drug  policies grounded in science  compassion  health and human rights  where people who come from across the political spectrum and every other spectrum as well  where people who love our drugs  people who hate drugs  and people who don't give  a damn about drugs  but every one of us believes  that this War on Drugs  this backward  heartless   disastrous War on Drugs  has got to end. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Ethan  congrats   quite the reaction. That was a powerful talk. Not quite a complete standing O  though  and I'm guessing that some people here and maybe a few watching online  maybe someone knows a teenager or a friend or whatever who got sick  maybe died from some drug overdose. I'm sure you've had these people approach you before. What do you say to them  Ethan Nadelmann  Chris  the most amazing thing that's happened of late is that I've met a growing number of people who have actually  lost a sibling or a child to a drug overdose  and    years ago  those  people just wanted to say  let's line up all the drug  dealers and shoot them and that will solve it. And what they've come to understand is that the Drug War did  nothing to protect their kids. If anything  it made it more likely that those kids were put at risk. And so they're now becoming part of this drug policy reform movement. There's other people who have kids  one's addicted to alcohol  the other one's addicted to cocaine or heroin  and they ask themselves the question  Why does this kid get to  take one step at a time and try to get better and that one's got to deal with jail and police and criminals all the time  So everybody's understanding  the Drug War's not protecting anybody. CA  Certainly in the U.S.   you've got political gridlock on most issues. Is there any realistic chance of anything actually shifting on this  issue in the next five years  EN  I'd say it's quite remarkable.  I'm getting all these calls from journalists now who are saying to me   Ethan  it seems like the only two issues advancing politically in America right now are marijuana law reform and gay marriage. What are you doing right   And then you're looking at  bipartisanship breaking out with  actually  Republicans in the Congress and state legislatures  allowing bills to be enacted with majority Democratic support  so we've gone from being sort of the third rail  the most fearful issue of American politics  to becoming one of the most successful. CA  Ethan  thank you so much for coming to TEDGlobal. EN  Chris  thanks so much. CA  Thank you. EN  Thank you.  Applause  They told me that I'm a traitor to my own profession  that I should be fired  have my medical license taken away  that I should go back to my own country. My email got hacked. In a discussion forum for other doctors  someone took credit for  Twitter bombing  my account. Now  I didn't know if this was a good or bad thing  but then came the response   Too bad it wasn't a real bomb.  I never thought that I would do something that would provoke this level of anger among other doctors. Becoming a doctor was my dream. I grew up in China  and my earliest memories are of being rushed to the hospital because I had such bad asthma that I was there nearly every week. I had this one doctor  Dr. Sam  who always took care of me. She was about the same age as my mother. She had this wild  curly hair  and she always wore these bright yellow flowery dresses. She was one of those doctors who  if you fell and you broke your arm  she would ask you why you weren't laughing because it's your humerus. Get it  See  you'd groan  but she'd always make you feel better after having seen her. Well  we all have that childhood hero that we want to grow up to be just like  right  Well  I wanted to be just like Dr. Sam. When I was eight  my parents and I moved to the U.S.  and ours became the typical immigrant narrative. My parents cleaned hotel rooms and washed dishes and pumped gas so that I could pursue my dream. Well  eventually I learned enough English  and my parents were so happy the day that I got into medical school and took my oath of healing and service. But then one day  everything changed. My mother called me to tell me that she wasn't feeling well  she had a cough that wouldn't go away  she was short of breath and tired. Well  I knew that my mother was someone who never complained about anything. For her to tell me that something was the matter  I knew something had to be really wrong. And it was  We found out that she had stage IV breast cancer  cancer that by then had spread to her lungs  her bones  and her brain. My mother was brave  though  and she had hope. She went through surgery and radiation  and was on her third round of chemotherapy when she lost her address book. She tried to look up her oncologist's phone number on the Internet and she found it  but she found something else too. On several websites  he was listed as a highly paid speaker to a drug company  and in fact often spoke on behalf of the same chemo regimen that he had prescribed her. She called me in a panic  and I didn't know what to believe. Maybe this was the right chemo regimen for her  but maybe it wasn't. It made her scared and it made her doubt. When it comes to medicine  having that trust is a must  and when that trust is gone  then all that's left is fear. There's another side to this fear. As a medical student  I was taking care of this    year old who was biking back to his dorm when he got struck and hit  run over by an SUV. He had seven broken ribs  shattered hip bones  and he was bleeding inside his belly and inside his brain. Now  imagine being his parents who flew in from Seattle        miles away  to find their son in a coma. I mean  you'd want to find out what's going on with him  right  They asked to attend our bedside rounds where we discussed his condition and his plan  which I thought was a reasonable request  and also would give us a chance to show them how much we were trying and how much we cared. The head doctor  though  said no. He gave all kinds of reasons. Maybe they'll get in the nurse's way. Maybe they'll stop students from asking questions. He even said   What if they see mistakes and sue us   What I saw behind every excuse was deep fear  and what I learned was that to become a doctor  we have to put on our white coats  put up a wall  and hide behind it. There's a hidden epidemic in medicine. Of course  patients are scared when they come to the doctor. Imagine you wake up with this terrible bellyache  you go to the hospital  you're lying in this strange place  you're on this hospital gurney  you're wearing this flimsy gown  strangers are coming to poke and prod at you. You don't know what's going to happen. You don't even know if you're going to get the blanket you asked for    minutes ago. But it's not just patients who are scared  doctors are scared too. We're scared of patients finding out who we are and what medicine is all about. And so what do we do  We put on our white coats and we hide behind them. Of course  the more we hide  the more people want to know what it is that we're hiding. The more fear then spirals into mistrust and poor medical care. We don't just have a fear of sickness  we have a sickness of fear. Can we bridge this disconnect between what patients need and what doctors do  Can we overcome the sickness of fear  Let me ask you differently  If hiding isn't the answer  what if we did the opposite  What if doctors were to become totally transparent with their patients  Last fall  I conducted a research study to find out what it is that people want to know about their healthcare. I didn't just want to study patients in a hospital  but everyday people. So my two medical students  Suhavi Tucker and Laura Johns  literally took their research to the streets. They went to banks  coffee shops  senior centers  Chinese restaurants and train stations. What did they find  Well  when we asked people   What do you want to know about your healthcare   people responded with what they want to know about their doctors  because people understand health care to be the individual interaction between them and their doctors. When we asked   What do you want to know about your doctors   people gave three different answers. Some want to know that their doctor is competent and certified to practice medicine. Some want to be sure that their doctor is unbiased and is making decisions based on evidence and science  not on who pays them. Surprisingly to us  many people want to know something else about their doctors. Jonathan  a    year old law student  says he wants to find someone who is comfortable with LGBTQ patients and specializes in LGBT health. Serena  a    year old accountant  says that it's important to her for her doctor to share her values when it comes to reproductive choice and women's rights. Frank  a    year old hardware store owner  doesn't even like going to the doctor and wants to find someone who believes in prevention first  but who is comfortable with alternative treatments. One after another  our respondents told us that that doctor patient relationship is a deeply intimate one   that to show their doctors their bodies and tell them their deepest secrets  they want to first understand their doctor's values. Just because doctors have to see every patient doesn't mean that patients have to see every doctor. People want to know about their doctors first so that they can make an informed choice. As a result of this  I formed a campaign  Who's My Doctor  that calls for total transparency in medicine. Participating doctors voluntarily disclose on a public website not just information about where we went to medical school and what specialty we're in  but also our conflicts of interest. We go beyond the Government in the Sunshine Act about drug company affiliations  and we talk about how we're paid. Incentives matter. If you go to your doctor because of back pain  you might want to know he's getting paid       dollars to perform spine surgery versus    dollars to refer you to see a physical therapist  or if he's getting paid the same thing no matter what he recommends. Then  we go one step further. We add our values when it comes to women's health  LGBT health  alternative medicine  preventive health  and end of life decisions. We pledge to our patients that we are here to serve you  so you have a right to know who we are. We believe that transparency can be the cure for fear. I thought some doctors would sign on and others wouldn't  but I had no idea of the huge backlash that would ensue. Within one week of starting Who's My Doctor  Medscape's public forum and several online doctors' communities had thousands of posts about this topic. Here are a few. From a gastroenterologist in Portland   I devoted    years of my life to being a slave. I have loans and mortgages. I depend on lunches from drug companies to serve patients.  Well  times may be hard for everyone  but try telling your patient making        dollars a year to serve a family of four that you need the free lunch. From an orthopedic surgeon in Charlotte   I find it an invasion of my privacy to disclose where my income comes from. My patients don't disclose their incomes to me.  But your patients' sources of income don't affect your health. From a psychiatrist in New York City   Pretty soon we will have to disclose whether we prefer cats to dogs  what model of car we drive  and what toilet paper we use.  Well  how you feel about Toyotas or Cottonelle won't affect your patients' health  but your views on a woman's right to choose and preventive medicine and end of life decisions just might. And my favorite  from a Kansas City cardiologist   More government mandated stuff  Dr. Wen needs to move back to her own country.  Well  two pieces of good news. First of all  this is meant to be voluntary and not mandatory  and second of all  I'm American and I'm already here. Within a month  my employers were getting calls asking for me to be fired. I received mail at my undisclosed home address with threats to contact the medical board to sanction me. My friends and family urged me to quit this campaign. After the bomb threat  I was done. But then I heard from patients. Over social media  a TweetChat  which I'd learned what that was by then  generated  .  million impressions  and thousands of people wrote to encourage me to continue. They wrote with things like   If doctors are doing something they're that ashamed of  they shouldn't be doing it.   Elected officials have to disclose campaign contributions. Lawyers have to disclose conflicts of interests. Why shouldn't doctors   And finally  many people wrote and said   Let us patients decide what's important when we're choosing a doctor.  In our initial trial  over     doctors have taken the total transparency pledge. What a crazy new idea  right  But actually  this is not that new of a concept at all. Remember Dr. Sam  my doctor in China  with the goofy jokes and the wild hair  Well  she was my doctor  but she was also our neighbor who lived in the building across the street. I went to the same school as her daughter. My parents and I trusted her because we knew who she was and what she stood for  and she had no need to hide from us. Just one generation ago  this was the norm in the U.S. as well. You knew that your family doctor was the father of two teenage boys  that he quit smoking a few years ago  that he says he's a regular churchgoer  but you see him twice a year  once at Easter and once when his mother in law comes to town. You knew what he was about  and he had no need to hide from you. But the sickness of fear has taken over  and patients suffer the consequences. I know this firsthand. My mother fought her cancer for eight years. She was a planner  and she thought a lot about how she wanted to live and how she wanted to die. Not only did she sign advance directives  she wrote a    page document about how she had suffered enough  how it was time for her to go. One day  when I was a resident physician  I got a call to say that she was in the intensive care unit. By the time I got there  she was about to be intubated and put on a breathing machine.  But this is not what she wants   I said   and we have documents.  The ICU doctor looked at me in the eye  pointed at my then    year old sister  and said   Do you remember when you were that age  How would you have liked to grow up without your mother   Her oncologist was there too  and said   This is your mother. Can you really face yourself for the rest of your life if you don't do everything for her   I knew my mother so well. I understood what her directives meant so well  but I was a physician. That was the single hardest decision I ever made  to let her die in peace  and I carry those words of those doctors with me every single day. We can bridge the disconnect between what doctors do and what patients need. We can get there  because we've been there before  and we know that transparency gets us to that trust. Research has shown us that openness also helps doctors  that having open medical records  being willing to talk about medical errors  will increase patient trust  improve health outcomes  and reduce malpractice. That openness  that trust  is only going to be more important as we move from the infectious to the behavioral model of disease. Bacteria may not care so much about trust and intimacy  but for people to tackle the hard lifestyle choices  to address issues like smoking cessation  blood pressure management and diabetes control  well  that requires us to establish trust. Here's what other transparent doctors have said. Brandon Combs  an internist in Denver   This has brought me closer to my patients. The type of relationship I've developed   that's why I entered medicine.  Aaron Stupple  an internist in Denver   I tell my patients that I am totally open with them. I don't hide anything from them. This is me. Now tell me about you. We're in this together.  May Nguyen  a family physician in Houston   My colleagues are astounded by what I'm doing. They ask me how I could be so brave. I said  I'm not being brave  it's my job.  I leave you today with a final thought. Being totally transparent is scary. You feel naked  exposed and vulnerable  but that vulnerability  that humility  it can be an extraordinary benefit to the practice of medicine. When doctors are willing to step off our pedestals  take off our white coats  and show our patients who we are and what medicine is all about  that's when we begin to overcome the sickness of fear. That's when we establish trust. That's when we change the paradigm of medicine from one of secrecy and hiding to one that is fully open and engaged for our patients. Thank you. Vincent Moon  How can we use computers  cameras  microphones to represent the world in an alternative way  as much as possible  How  maybe  is it possible to use the Internet to create a new form of cinema  And actually  why do we record  Well  it is with such simple questions in mind that I started to make films    years ago  first with a friend  Christophe Abric. He had a website  La Blogoth que  dedicated to independent music. We were crazy about music. We wanted to represent  music in a different way  to film the music we love  the musicians we admired  as much as possible  far  from the music industry and far from the cliches attached to it. We started to publish every week sessions on the Internet. We are going to see a few extracts now. From Grizzly Bear in the shower to Sigur Ros playing in a Parisian cafe. From Phoenix playing by the Eiffel Tower to Tom Jones in his  hotel room in New York. From Arcade Fire in an elevator in the Olympia to Beirut going down a staircase in Brooklyn. From R.E.M. in a car to The National around a table at night in the south of France. From Bon Iver playing with some friends in an apartment in Montmartre to Yeasayer having a long night  and many  many  many more unknown or very famous bands. We published all those films for free on the Internet  and we wanted to share all those films and represent music in a different way. We wanted to create  another type of intimacy using all those new technologies. At the time     years ago actually  there was no such project on the Internet  and I guess that's why the project we  were making  the Take Away Shows  got quite successful  reaching millions of viewers. After a while  I got a bit   I wanted to go somewhere else. I felt the need to travel and to discover some other music  to explore the world  going to other corners  and actually it was also this idea of nomadic cinema  sort of  that I had in mind. How could the use of new technologies  and the road fit together  How could I edit my films in a bus crossing the Andes  So I went on five year travels around the globe. I started at the time in the digital film  and music label collection Petites Plan tes  which was also an homage to French filmmaker Chris Marker. We're going to see now a few more extracts of those new films. From the tecno brega diva of northern Brazil  Gaby Amarantos to a female ensemble in Chechnya. From experimental electronic music  in Singapore with One Man Nation to Brazilian icon Tom Z  singing on his rooftop in S o Paolo. From The Bambir  the great  rock band from Armenia to some traditional songs in a restaurant in Tbilisi  Georgia. From White Shoes  a great retro  pop band from Jakarta  Indonesia to DakhaBrakha  the revolutionary  band from Kiev  Ukraine. From Tomi Lebrero and his bandoneon and his friends in Buenos Aires  Argentina  to many other places and musicians around the world. My desire was to make it as a trek. To do all those films  it would have been impossible with a big company behind me  with a structure or anything. I was traveling alone with a backpack   computer  camera  microphones in it. Alone  actually  but  just with local people  meeting my team  which was absolutely not professional people  on the spot there  going from one place to another and to make cinema as a trek. I really believed that cinema could be this very simple thing  I want to make a film and you're going  to give me a place to stay for the night. I give you a moment of cinema and you offer me a capirinha. Well  or other drinks  depending on where you are. In Peru  they drink pisco sour. Well  when I arrived in Peru  actually  I had no idea about what I would do there. And I just had one phone number  actually  of one person. Three months later  after traveling all around the  country  I had recorded    films  only with the help of local people  only with the help of people that I was asking all the  time the same question  What is important to record here today  By living in such a way  by working without any structure  I was able to react to the moment and to decide  oh  this is  important to make now. This is important to  record that whole person. This is important to create this exchange. When I went to Chechnya  the first person I met looked at me and was like   What are you doing here  Are you a journalist  NGO  Politics  What kind of problems  are you going to study   Well  I was there to research on Sufi rituals in Chechnya  actually   incredible culture of Sufism in Chechnya  which is absolutely unknown  outside of the region. As soon as people understood that I would give them those films   I would publish them online for free under a Creative Commons license  but I would also really  give them to the people and I would let them do  what they want with it. I just want to represent  them in a beautiful light. I just want to portray them in a way that their grandchildren are going to look at their grandfather  and they're going to be like   Whoa  my grandfather is as  cool as Beyonc .   Laughter  It's a really important thing. It's really important  because that's the way people are going to look differently at  their own culture  at their own land. They're going to think about it differently. It may be a way to maintain  a certain diversity. Why you will record  Hmm. There's a really good quote by American thinker Hakim Bey which says   Every recording is a tombstone of a live performance.  It's a really good  sentence to keep in mind nowadays in an era saturated by images. What's the point of that  Where do we go with it  I was researching. I was still  keeping this idea in mind  What's the point  I was researching on music  trying to pull  trying to get closer to a certain origin of it. Where is this all coming from  I am French. I had no idea about what I would discover   which is a very simple thing  Everything was sacred  at first  and music was spiritual healing. How could I use my camera  my little tool  to get closer and maybe not only capture the trance but find an equivalent   a cine trance  maybe  something in complete harmony with the people  That is now my new research I'm doing on spirituality  on new  spirits around the world. Maybe a few more extracts now. From the Tana Toraja  funeral ritual in Indonesia to an Easter ceremony  in the north of Ethiopia. From jathilan  a popular trance ritual on the island of Java  to Umbanda in the north of Brazil. The Sufi rituals of Chechnya to a mass in the holiest  church of Armenia. Some Sufi songs in Harar  the holy city of Ethiopia  to an ayahuasca ceremony deep in the Amazon of  Peru with the Shipibo. Then to my new project   the one I'm doing now here in Brazil  named  H bridos.  I'm doing it with Priscilla Telmon. It's research on the new  spiritualities all around the country. This is my quest  my own little quest  of what I call experimental ethnography  trying to hybrid all  those different genres  trying to regain a certain complexity. Why do we record  I was still there. I really believe cinema teaches us to see. The way we show the world is going to change the  way we see this world  and we live in a moment where the mass media are doing a terrible  terrible job at representing the world  violence  extremists  only spectacular events  only simplifications of everyday life. I think we are recording to regain a certain complexity. To reinvent life today  we have to make new forms of images. And it's very simple. Muito obrigado. Bruno Giussani  Vincent  Vincent  Vincent. Merci. We have to prepare for the following performance  and I have a question for you  and the question is this  You show up in places like the  ones you just have shown us  and you are carrying a camera and I assume that you are welcome but you are not always absolutely welcome. You walk into sacred rituals  private moments in a village  a town  a group of people. How do you break the barrier when you show up with a lens  VM  I think you break it with your body  more than with your knowledge. That's what it taught me to travel  to trust the memory of the body more than the memory of the brain. The respect is stepping forward  not stepping backward  and I really think that by engaging your body in the moment  in the ceremony  in the places  people welcome you and understand your energy. BG  You told me that most of the videos you have made are  actually one single shot. You don't do much editing. I mean  you edited the ones for us at the beginning of the sessions because of the length  etc. Otherwise  you just go in and capture whatever happens in front of your eyes without much planning  and so is that the case  It's correct  VM  My idea is that I think that as long as we don't cut  in a way  as long as we let the viewer watch  more and more viewers  are going to feel closer  are going to get closer to the moment  to that moment and to that place. I really think of that as a matter  of respecting the viewer  to not cut all the time from one place to another  to just let the time go. BG  Tell me in a few words  about your new project   H bridos   here in Brazil. Just before coming to  TEDGlobal  you have actually been traveling around  the country for that. Tell us a couple of things. VM   H bridos  is    I really believe Brazil  far from the cliches  is the greatest religious country in the world  the greatest country  in terms of spirituality and in experimentations in spiritualities. And it's a big project I'm  doing over this year  which is researching in very different regions of Brazil  in very different forms of cults  and trying to understand  how people live together with spirituality nowadays. BG  The man who is going to  appear onstage momentarily  and Vincent's going to introduce him  is one of the subjects of  one of his past videos. When did you do a video with him  VM  I guess four years ago  four years in my first travel. BG  So it was one of  your first ones in Brazil. VM  It was amongst the  first ones in Brazil  yeah. I shot the film in Recife  in the place where he is from. BG  So let's introduce him.  Who are we waiting for  VM  I'll just make it very short. It's a very great honor for  me to welcome onstage one of the greatest Brazilian  musicians of all time. Please welcome Nan  Vasconcelos. BG  Nan  Vasconcelos  Nan  Vasconcelos  Let's go to the jungle. Picture this  It's Monday morning  you're at the office  you're settling in for the day at work  and this guy that you sort of  recognize from down the hall  walks right into your cubicle and he steals your chair. Doesn't say a word   just rolls away with it. Doesn't give you any information about why he took your chair out of all the other chairs  that are out there. Doesn't acknowledge the fact  that you might need your chair to get some work done today. You wouldn't stand for  it. You'd make a stink. You'd follow that guy back to his cubicle and you'd say   Why my chair   Okay  so now it's Tuesday morning and you're at the office  and a meeting invitation pops  up in your calendar. And it's from this woman who you  kind of know from down the hall  and the subject line references some  project that you heard a little bit about. But there's no agenda. There's no information about why you were invited to the meeting. And yet you accept the  meeting invitation  and you go. And when this highly  unproductive session is over  you go back to your desk  and you stand at your  desk and you say   Boy  I wish I had those two hours back  like I wish I had my chair back.  Every day  we allow our coworkers  who are otherwise very   very nice people  to steal from us. And I'm talking about something far  more valuable than office furniture. I'm talking about time. Your time. In fact  I believe that we are in the middle of a global epidemic of a terrible new illness known as MAS  Mindless Accept Syndrome. The primary symptom of  Mindless Accept Syndrome is just accepting a meeting invitation the minute it pops up in your calendar. It's an involuntary reflex   ding   click  bing   it's in your calendar   Gotta go  I'm already late  for a meeting.   Laughter  Meetings are important  right  And collaboration is key to  the success of any enterprise. And a well run meeting can yield  really positive  actionable results. But between globalization and pervasive information technology  the way that we work has really changed dramatically  over the last few years. And we're miserable.  Laughter  And we're miserable not because the  other guy can't run a good meeting  it's because of MAS  our  Mindless Accept Syndrome  which is a self inflicted wound. Actually  I have evidence to prove that MAS is a global epidemic. Let me tell you why. A couple of years ago  I put a video  on Youtube  and in the video  I acted out every terrible  conference call you've ever been on. It goes on for about five minutes  and it has all the things that we  hate about really bad meetings. There's the moderator who has  no idea how to run the meeting. There are the participants who  have no idea why they're there. The whole thing kind of collapses into this collaborative train wreck. And everybody leaves very angry. It's kind of funny. Let's take a quick look. As a group  we need to decide if   bloop bloop   Hi  who just joined  Hi  it's Joe. I'm working from home today. Hi  Joe. Thanks for  joining us today  great. I was just saying  we have a lot of people  on the call we'd like to get through  so let's skip the roll call and I'm gonna dive right in. Our goal today is to come to an  agreement on a very important proposal. As a group  we need to decide if   bloop bloop   Hi  who just joined  No  I thought I heard a beep.  Laughter  Sound familiar  Yeah  it sounds familiar  to me  too. A couple of weeks after I put that online          people in dozens of countries  I mean dozens of countries  watched this video. And three years later  it's still getting  thousands of views every month. It's close to about a million right now. And in fact  some of the biggest companies in the world  companies that you've  heard of but I won't name  have asked for my permission to use  this video in their new hire training to teach their new employees how  not to run a meeting at their company. And if the numbers   there are a million views and it's being used by all these companies   aren't enough proof that we have  a global problem with meetings  there are the many  many thousands of comments posted online after the video went up. Thousands of people wrote things like   OMG  that was my day today    That was my day every day    This is my life.  One guy wrote   It's funny because it's true. Eerily  sadly  depressingly true. It made me laugh until I cried. And cried. And I cried some more.  This poor guy said   My daily life until  retirement or death  sigh.  These are real quotes and it's real sad. A common theme running through all of these comments online is this fundamental belief  that we are powerless to do anything other  than go to meetings and suffer through these  poorly run meetings and live to meet another day. But the truth is  we're  not powerless at all. In fact  the cure for MAS is right here in our hands. It's right at our fingertips  literally. It's something that I call  No MAS  Which  if I remember my  high school Spanish  means something like    Enough already  make it stop   Here's how No MAS  works. It's very simple. First of all  the next time you  get a meeting invitation that doesn't have a lot  of information in it at all  click the tentative button  It's okay  you're allowed   that's why it's there. It's right next to the accept button. Or the maybe button  or whatever button  is there for you not to accept immediately. Then  get in touch with the person who asked you to the meeting. Tell them you're very excited  to support their work  ask them what the goal  of the meeting is  and tell them you're interested in learning  how you can help them achieve their goal. And if we do this often enough  and we do it respectfully  people might start to be  a little bit more thoughtful about the way they put together meeting invitations. And you can make more thoughtful  decisions about accepting it. People might actually start  sending out agendas. Imagine  Or they might not have a conference call with    people to talk about a status when they could just do a quick email and get it done with. People just might start to change their  behavior because you changed yours. And they just might bring your chair back  too.  Laughter  No MAS  Thank you. The Earth needs no introduction. It needs no introduction in part  because the Apollo    astronauts  when they were hurtling  around the moon in       took this iconic image. It galvanized a whole  generation of human beings to realize that we're on  Spaceship Earth  fragile and finite as it is  and that we need  to take care of it. But while this picture is beautiful  it's static  and the Earth is constantly changing. It's changing on days' time scales with human activity. And the satellite imagery we  have of it today is old. Typically  years old. And that's important because you can't fix what you can't see. What we'd ideally want is images of the whole planet every day. So  what's standing in our way  What's the problem  This is the problem  Satellites are big  expensive  and they're slow. This one weighs three tons. It's six meters tall  four meters wide. It took up the entire fairing of a rocket just to launch it. One satellite  one rocket. It cost     million dollars. Satellites like these have  done an amazing job at helping us to understand our planet. But if we want to understand  it much more regularly  we need lots of satellites  and this model isn't scalable. So me and my friends   we started Planet Labs to make satellites ultra compact and small and highly capable. I'm going to show you what  our satellite looks like  This is our satellite. This is not a scale model  this is the real size. It's    by    by    centimeters  it weighs four kilograms  and we've stuffed the latest  and greatest electronics and sensor systems into  this little package so that even though this is really small  this can take pictures    times the resolution of the big satellite here  even though it weighs one  thousandth of the mass. And we call this satellite   Dove    Thank you. We call this satellite  Dove   and we call it  Dove  because  satellites are typically named after birds  but normally birds of prey  like Eagle  Hawk  Swoop   Kill  I don't know  Kestrel  these sort of things. But ours have a  humanitarian mission  so we wanted to call them Doves. And we haven't just  built them  though. We've launched them. And not just one  but many. It all started in our garage. Yes  we built our first satellite prototype in our garage. Now  this is pretty normal for a Silicon Valley company that we are  but we believe it's the first time  for a space company. And that's not the only trick we learned from Silicon Valley. We rapidly prototype our satellites. We use  release early   release often  on our software. And we take a different  risk approach. We take them outside and test them. We even put satellites in space just to test the satellites  and we've learned to manufacture our satellites at scale. We've used modern production techniques so we can build large numbers of them  I think for the first time. We call it agile aerospace  and that's what's enabled us to put so much capability into this little box. Now  what has bonded  our team over the years is the idea of democratizing access to satellite information. In fact  the founders of our  company  Chris  Robbie and I  we met over    years ago  at the United Nations when they were hosting a conference  about exactly that question  How do you use satellites  to help humanity  How do you use satellites to help  people in developing countries or with climate change  And this is what has bonded us. Our entire team is passionate about using satellites to help humanity. You could say  we're space geeks  but not only do we care  about what's up there  we care about what's down here  too. I'm going to show you a video from just four weeks ago  of two of our satellites being launched from the International Space Station. This is not an animation  this is a video taken by the astronaut  looking out of the window. It gives you a bit of a sense of  scale of our two satellites. It's like some of the  smallest satellites ever are being launched from  the biggest satellite ever. And right at the end  the solar array glints in the sun. It's really cool. Wait for it. Boom  Yeah. It's the money shot. So we didn't just launch  two of them like this  we launched    of them. It's the largest constellation of Earth imaging satellites in human history  and it's going to provide a completely radical new data set about our changing planet. But that's just the beginning. You see  we're going to launch more than     of these satellites like these over the  course of the next year. It's going to be the largest constellation of satellites in human history. And this is what it's going to do  Acting in a single orbit plane that  stays fixed with respect to the sun  the Earth rotates underneath. They're all cameras pointed down  and they slowly scan across as  the Earth rotates underneath. The Earth rotates every    hours  so we scan every point on the  planet every    hours. It's a line scanner for the planet. We don't take a picture of  anywhere on the planet every day  we take a picture of every single place on the planet every day. Even though we launched these just a couple of weeks ago  we've already got some initial imagery from the satellites and I'm going to show it publicly for the first time right now. This is the very first picture taken by our satellite. It happened to be over  UC Davis' campus in California when we  turned the camera on. But what's even cooler is when we compare it to the previous latest image of that area  which was taken many months ago. And the image on the left  is from our satellite  and we see buildings are being built. The general point is that we will be able to track urban growth as it happens around the whole world in all cities  every day. Water as well. Thank you. We'll be able to see  the extent of all water bodies around the whole world every day and help water security. From water security  to food security. We'll see crops as they  grow in all the fields in every farmer's field around the planet every day. and help them to improve crop yield. This is a beautiful image that was taken just a few hours ago when the  satellite was flying over Argentina. The general point is there are probably hundreds and  thousands of applications of this data  I've mentioned a few  but there's others  deforestation  the ice caps melting. We can track all of these things  every tree on the planet every day. If you took the difference between today's image and yesterday's image  you'd see much of the world news   you'd see floods and fires and earthquakes. And we have decided  therefore  that the  best thing that we could do with our data is to ensure universal access to it. We want to ensure everyone can see it. Thank you.  Applause  We want to empower NGOs and  companies and scientists and journalists to be able to answer the questions that they have about the planet. We want to enable the developer community to run their apps on our data. In short  we want to democratize access to information about our planet. Which brings me back to this. You see  this will be an entirely new global data set. And we believe that together  we can help to take care  of our Spaceship Earth. And what I would like to leave you with is the following question  If you had access to imagery of the whole planet every single day  what would you do with that data  What problems would you solve  What exploration would you do  Well  I invite you to come and explore with us. Thank you very much. Well  good afternoon. How many of you took the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge  Woo hoo  Well  I have to tell you  from  the bottom of our hearts  thank you so very  very much. Do you know to date the ALS Association has raised     million dollars  Woo hoo   Applause  It takes me back to the summer of     . My family  my kids had all grown up. We were officially empty nesters  and we decided  let's  go on a family vacation. Jenn  my daughter  and my son in law came down from New York. My youngest  Andrew  he came down from his home in Charlestown where he was working in Boston  and my son Pete  who had played at  Boston College  baseball  had played baseball  professionally in Europe  and had now come home and was selling group insurance  he also joined us. And one night  I found myself having a beer with Pete  and Pete was looking at  me and he just said   You know  Mom  I don't know  selling group insurance  is just not my passion.  He said   I just don't feel  I'm living up to my potential. I don't feel this is my mission in life.  And he said   You know   oh by the way  Mom  I have to leave early from vacation because my inter city league team  that I play for made the playoffs  and I have to get back to Boston  because I can't let my team down. I'm just not as passionate about my job as I am about baseball.  So off Pete went  and  left the family vacation   break a mother's heart   and he went  and we  followed four days later to see the next playoff game. We're at the playoff game   Pete's at the plate  and a fastball's coming in  and it hits him on the wrist. Oh  Pete. His wrist went completely limp  like this. So for the next six months  Pete went back to his home in Southie  kept working that unpassionate job  and was going to doctors to see what was wrong with this wrist that never came back. Six months later  in March  he called my husband  and me  and he said   Oh  Mom and Dad  we have a doctor that found a diagnosis for that wrist. Do you want to come with the doctor's appointment with me   I said   Sure  we'll come in.  That morning  Pete  John and I all got up  got dressed  got in our cars   three separate cars because we were going to go to work after the doctor's appointment to find out what happened to the wrist. We walked into the  neurologist's office  sat down  four doctors walk in  and the head neurologist sits down. And he says   Well  Pete  we've been looking at all the tests  and I have to tell you   it's not a sprained wrist  it's not a broken wrist  it's not nerve damage in the wrist  it's not an infection  it's not Lyme disease.  And there was this deliberate  elimination going up  and I was thinking to myself  where is he going with this  Then he put his hands on his knees  he looked right at my     year old kid  and said   I don't know how to  tell a    year old this  Pete  you have ALS.  ALS  I had had a friend whose     year old father had ALS. I looked at my husband  he looked at me  and then we looked at the  doctor  and we said   ALS  Okay  what treatment  Let's go. What do we do  Let's go.  And he looked at us  and he said   Mr. and Mrs. Frates  I'm sorry to tell you this  but there's no treatment  and there's no cure.  We were the worst culprits. We didn't even understand that it had been    years since Lou Gehrig and nothing had been done  in the progress against ALS. So we all went home  and Jenn and Dan flew home from Wall Street  Andrew came home from Charlestown  and Pete went to B.C. to pick up his then girlfriend Julie  and brought her home  and six hours later after diagnosis  we're sitting around  having a family dinner  and we're having small chat. I don't even remember  cooking dinner that night. But then our leader  Pete  set the vision  and talked to us just like  we were his new team. He said   There will be  no wallowing  people.  He goes   We're not looking back  we're looking forward. What an amazing opportunity  we have to change the world. I'm going to change the face of this unacceptable situation of ALS. We're going to move the needle  and I'm going to get it in front of philanthropists like Bill Gates.  And that was it. We  were given our directive. So in the days and months that followed  within a week  we had  our brothers and sisters and our family come to us  that they were already  creating Team Frate Train. Uncle Dave  he was the webmaster  Uncle Artie  he was the accountant  Auntie Dana  she was the graphic artist  and my youngest son  Andrew  quit his job  left his  apartment in Charlestown and says   I'm going to take care  of Pete and be his caregiver.  Then all those people   classmates  teammates  coworkers that Pete had inspired throughout his whole life  the circles of Pete all started intersecting with one another  and made Team Frate Train. Six months after diagnosis  Pete was given an award at a  research summit for advocacy. He got up and gave a very eloquent speech  and at the end of the  speech  there was a panel  and on the panel were these pharmaceutical executives and biochemists and clinicians and I'm sitting there and  I'm listening to them and most of the content  went straight over my head. I avoided every science  class I ever could. But I was watching these people  and I was listening to them  and they were saying    I  I do this  I do that   and there was a real  unfamiliarity between them. So at the end of their talk  the panel  they had questions and answers  and boom  my hand went right up  and I get the microphone  and I look at them and I say   Thank you. Thank you so much for working in ALS. It means so very much to us.  I said   But I do have to tell you that I'm watching your body language and I'm listening to what you're saying. It just doesn't seem like there's a whole  lot of collaboration going on here. And not only that  where's the flip chart with the action items and the  follow up and the accountability  What are you going to do  after you leave this room   And then I turned around and there was about     pairs  of eyes just staring at me. And it was that point that I realized that I had talked about  the elephant in the room. Thus my mission had begun. So over the next couple of years  Pete   we've had our highs and our lows. Pete was put on a compassionate use drug. It was hope in a bottle for  the whole ALS community. It was in a phase III trial. Then six months later  the  data comes back  no efficacy. We were supposed to  have therapies overseas  and the rug was  pulled out from under us. So for the next two years  we just watched my son  be taken away from me  little by little every day. Two and a half years ago  Pete was hitting home  runs at baseball fields. Today  Pete's completely paralyzed. He can't hold his head up any longer. He's confined to a motorized wheelchair. He can no longer swallow or eat. He has a feeding tube. He can't speak. He talks with eye gaze technology and a speech generating device  and we're watching his lungs  because his diaphragm  eventually is going to give out and then the decision will be made to put him on a ventilator or not. ALS robs the human of all their physical  parts  but the brain stays intact. So July  th          th year of Lou Gehrig's  inspirational speech comes  and Pete is asked by MLB.com to write an article in the Bleacher Report. And it was very significant  because he  wrote it using his eye gaze technology. Twenty days later   the ice started to fall. On July   th  Pete's  roommate in New York City  wearing a Quinn For The Win shirt  signifying Pat Quinn  another  ALS patient known in New York  and B.C. shorts said   I'm taking the ALS  Ice Bucket Challenge   picked up the ice  put it over his head.  And I'm nominating ...   And he sent it up to Boston. And that was on July   th. Over the next couple  of days  our news feed was full of family and friends. If you haven't gone back  the nice thing about Facebook is that you have the dates  you can go back. You've got to see Uncle Artie's  human Bloody Mary. I'm telling you  it's one of the best ones  and that was probably in day two. By about day four  Uncle  Dave  the webmaster  he isn't on Facebook  and I get a text from him   and it says   Nancy  what the hell is going on   Uncle Dave gets a hit  every time Pete's website is gone onto  and his  phone was blowing up. So we all sat down and we realized  money is coming in   how amazing. So we knew awareness  would lead to funding  we just didn't know it would only take a couple of days. So we got together  put our best      c    s on Pete's website  and off we went. So week one  Boston media. Week two  national media. It was during week two  that our neighbor next door opened up our door and threw a pizza across the kitchen floor  saying   I think you people might  need food in there.  Week three  celebrities    Entertainment Tonight  Access Hollywood. Week four  global   BBC  Irish Radio. Did anyone see  Lost In Translation   My husband did Japanese television. It was interesting. And those videos  the popular ones. Paul Bissonnette's  glacier video  incredible. How about the redemption nuns of Dublin  Who's seen that one  It's absolutely fantastic. J.T.  Justin Timberlake. That's when we knew  that  was a real A list celebrity. I go back on my texts  and I can see  JT  JT   My sister texting me. Angela Merkel  the chancellor of Germany. Incredible. And the ALS patients  you know what their favorite ones are  and their families'  All of them. Because this misunderstood and  underfunded  rare  disease  they just sat and watched people  saying it over and over   ALS  ALS.  It was unbelievable. And those naysayers  let's just talk a couple  of stats  shall we  Okay  so the ALS Association  they think by year end  it'll be     million dollars. ALS TDI in Cambridge  they raised three million dollars. Well  guess what  They had a clinical trial for a drug that they've been developing. It was on a three year track for funding. Two months. It's coming out starting in two months. And YouTube has reported that over     countries have posted Ice Bucket Challenges for ALS. And Facebook   .  million videos  and I had the awesome adventure visiting the Facebook campus last week  and I said to them   I know what it was like in my house. I can't imagine what it  was like around here.  All she said was   Jaw dropping.  And my family's favorite video  Bill Gates. Because the night Pete was diagnosed  he told us that he was going to get ALS in front of philanthropists like Bill Gates  and he did it. Goal number one  check. Now on to the treatment and cure. So okay  after all of this ice  we know that it was much more than just pouring buckets of  ice water over your head  and I really would like to leave you with a couple of things that  I'd like you to remember. The first thing is  every morning when you wake up  you can choose to live your day in positivity. Would any of you blame me if I just was in the fetal position and pulled the covers  over my head every day  No  I don't think anybody would blame me  but Pete has inspired us to wake up every morning and be  positive and proactive. I actually had to ditch support groups because everybody was in there saying that spraying their lawns with chemicals  that's why they got ALS  and I was like   I don't think so   but I had to get away from the negativity. The second thing I want to leave you with is the person at the  middle of the challenge has to be willing to have  the mental toughness to put themselves out there. Pete still goes to baseball games and he still sits with his  teammates in the dugout  and he hangs his gravity feed bag right on the cages. You'll see the kids  they're  up there hanging it up.  Pete  is that okay    Yup.  And then they put it  right into his stomach. Because he wants them to see what the reality of this is  and how he's never  ever going to give up. And the third thing I  want to leave you with  If you ever come across a situation that you see as so unacceptable  I want you to dig down as deep as you can and find your best mother bear and go after it. Thank you. I know that I'm running over  but I've got to leave you with this  the gifts that my son has given me. I have had    years of having the honor of being the mother of Pete Frates. Pete Frates has been inspiring  and leading his whole life. He's thrown out kindness  and all that kindness  has come back to him. He walks the face of the Earth  right now and knows why he's here. What a gift. The second thing that my son has given me is he's given me my mission in life. Now I know why I'm here. I'm going to save my son  and if it doesn't happen in time for him  I'm going to work so that no other mother has to go through what I'm going through. And the third thing   and last but not least gift that my son has given me  as an exclamation point to the miraculous month of August       That girlfriend that he went to get on  the night of diagnosis is now his wife  and Pete and Julie have given me my  granddaughter  Lucy Fitzgerald Frates. Lucy Fitzgerald Frates came two weeks early as the exclamation point on August   st      . And so   And so let me leave you with  Pete's words of inspiration that he would use to classmates  coworkers and teammates. Be passionate. Be genuine. Be hardworking. And don't forget to be great. Thank you.  Applause  I want you guys to imagine  that you're a soldier running through the battlefield. Now  you're shot in the leg with a bullet  which severs your femoral artery. Now  this bleed is extremely traumatic and can kill you in less  than three minutes. Unfortunately  by the time that a medic actually gets to you  what the medic has on his or her belt can take five minutes or more  with the application of pressure  to stop that type of bleed. Now  this problem is  not only a huge problem for the military  but it's  also a huge problem that's epidemic throughout  the entire medical field  which is how do we actually look at wounds and how do we stop them quickly in a way that can work with the body  So now  what I've been working on for the last four years is to develop smart biomaterials  which are actually materials that will work with the body  helping it to heal and helping it to allow the  wounds to heal normally. So now  before we do this  we  have to take a much closer look at actually how does the body work. So now  everybody here knows that the body is made up of cells. So the cell is the most basic unit of life. But not many people know what else. But it actually turns out that your cells sit in this mesh of complicated fibers  proteins and sugars known as the extracellular matrix. So now  the ECM is actually this mesh that  holds the cells in place  provides structure for your tissues  but it also gives the cells a home. It allows them to feel what they're doing  where they are  and tells them how to act and how to behave. And it actually turns out that  the extracellular matrix is different from every  single part of the body. So the ECM in my skin is different than the ECM in my liver  and the ECM in different  parts of the same organ actually vary  so it's very difficult to be able to have a product that will react to the  local extracellular matrix  which is exactly what we're trying to do. So now  for example   think of the rainforest. You have the canopy   you have the understory  and you have the forest floor. Now  all of these parts of the forest are made up of different plants  and different animals call them home. So just like that  the extracellular matrix is incredibly diverse in three dimensions. On top of that  the extracellular matrix is responsible for all wound healing  so if you imagine cutting the body  you actually have to rebuild this very complex ECM in order to get it to form again  and a scar  in fact  is actually poorly formed extracellular matrix. So now  behind me is an animation of the extracellular matrix. So as you see  your cells sit  in this complicated mesh and as you move throughout the tissue  the extracellular matrix changes. So now every other piece  of technology on the market can only manage a two  dimensional approximation of the extracellular matrix  which means that it doesn't fit in with the tissue itself. So when I was a freshman at NYU  what I discovered was  you could actually take small pieces of plant derived polymers and reassemble them onto the wound. So if you have a bleeding  wound like the one behind me  you can actually put  our material onto this  and just like Lego blocks  it'll reassemble into the local tissue. So that means if you put it onto liver  it turns into something  that looks like liver  and if you put it onto skin  it turns into something  that looks just like skin. So when you put the gel on  it actually reassembles  into this local tissue. So now  this has a whole  bunch of applications  but basically the idea is  wherever you put this product  you're able to reassemble  into it immediately. Now  this is a simulated arterial bleed   blood warning   at twice human artery pressure. So now  this type of bleed  is incredibly traumatic  and like I said before   would actually take five minutes or more with pressure to be able to stop. Now  in the time that it takes me to introduce the bleed itself  our material is able to stop that bleed  and it's because it actually  goes on and works with the body to heal  so it reassembles into this piece of meat  and then the blood actually recognizes that that's happening   and produces fibrin  producing a very fast clot in less than    seconds. So now this technology   Thank you. So now this technology  by January  will be in the hands of veterinarians  and we're working very diligently to  try to get it into the hands of doctors  hopefully within the next year. But really  once again  I  want you guys to imagine that you are a soldier running  through a battlefield. Now  you get hit in the leg with a bullet  and instead of bleeding  out in three minutes  you pull a small pack  of gel out of your belt  and with the press of a button  you're able to stop your own bleed and you're on your way to recovery. Thank you very much. I haven't told many people this  but in my head  I've got thousands of secret worlds all going on all at the same time. I am also autistic. People tend to diagnose autism with really specific  check box descriptions  but in reality  it's a whole variation as to what we're like. For instance  my little brother  he's very severely autistic. He's nonverbal. He can't talk at all. But I love to talk. People often associate autism with liking maths and  science and nothing else  but I know so many autistic people who love being creative. But that is a stereotype  and the stereotypes of things are often  if not always  wrong. For instance  a lot of people think autism and think   Rain Man  immediately. That's the common belief  that every single autistic  person is Dustin Hoffman  and that's not true. But that's not just with  autistic people  either. I've seen it with LGBTQ people  with women  with POC people. People are so afraid of variety that they try to fit everything  into a tiny little box with really specific labels. This is something that actually happened to me in real life  I googled  autistic people are ...  and it comes up with suggestions as to what you're going to type. I googled  autistic people are ...  and the top result was  demons.  That is the first thing that people think when they think autism. They know. One of the things I can do  because I'm autistic   it's an ability rather than a disability   is I've got a very  very vivid imagination. Let me explain it to you a bit. It's like I'm walking in two  worlds most of the time. There's the real world   the world that we all share  and there's the world in my mind  and the world in my mind  is often so much more real than the real world. Like  it's very easy for  me to let my mind loose because I don't try and fit  myself into a tiny little box. That's one of the best  things about being autistic. You don't have the urge to do that. You find what you want to do  you find a way to do it   and you get on with it. If I was trying to fit myself into a box  I wouldn't be here  I  wouldn't have achieved half the things that I have now. There are problems  though. There are problems with being autistic  and there are problems with having too much imagination. School can be a problem in general  but having also to explain to a teacher on a daily basis that their lesson is inexplicably dull and you are secretly taking refuge in a world inside your head in  which you are not in that lesson  that adds to your list of problems. Also  when my imagination takes hold  my body takes on a life of its own. When something very exciting happens in my inner world  I've just got to run. I've got to rock backwards and forwards  or sometimes scream. This gives me so much energy  and I've got to have an  outlet for all that energy. But I've done that ever  since I was a child  ever since I was a tiny little girl. And my parents thought it was  cute  so they didn't bring it up  but when I got into school  they didn't really agree that it was cute. It can be that people  don't want to be friends with the girl that starts  screaming in an algebra lesson. And this doesn't normally  happen in this day and age  but it can be that people don't want  to be friends with the autistic girl. It can be that people  don't want to associate with anyone who won't  or can't fit themselves into a box that's labeled normal. But that's fine with me  because it sorts the wheat from the chaff  and I can find which people  are genuine and true and I can pick these people as my friends. But if you think about it  what is normal  What does it mean  Imagine if that was the best  compliment you ever received.  Wow  you are really normal.  But compliments are   you are extraordinary  or  you step outside the box.  It's  you're amazing.  So if people want to be these things  why are so many people  striving to be normal  Why are people pouring their  brilliant individual light into a mold  People are so afraid of variety  that they try and force everyone  even people who don't want  to or can't  to become normal. There are camps for LGBTQ people or autistic people to try and  make them this  normal   and that's terrifying that people  would do that in this day and age. All in all  I wouldn't trade my autism and my imagination for the world. Because I am autistic  I've presented documentaries to the BBC  I'm in the midst of writing a book  I'm doing this   this is fantastic   and one of the best  things that I've achieved  that I consider to have achieved  is I've found ways of communicating with my little brother and sister  who as I've said are nonverbal.  They can't speak. And people would often write off someone who's nonverbal  but that's silly  because  my little brother and sister are the best siblings that  you could ever hope for. They're just the best   and I love them so much and I care about them  more than anything else. I'm going to leave you with one question  If we can't get inside the person's minds  no matter if they're autistic or not  instead of punishing anything that strays from normal  why not celebrate uniqueness and cheer every time someone unleashes their imagination  Thank you. Now  I'm an ethnobotanist. That's a scientist who  works in the rainforest to document how people use local plants. I've been doing this for a long time  and I want to tell you  these people know these forests and these medicinal treasures better than we do and better than we ever will. But also  these cultures  these indigenous cultures  are disappearing much faster than the forests themselves. And the greatest and most endangered species in the Amazon Rainforest is not the jaguar  it's not the harpy eagle  it's the isolated and uncontacted tribes. Now four years ago  I injured my  foot in a climbing accident and I went to the doctor. She gave me heat  she gave me cold  aspirin  narcotic painkillers  anti inflammatories  cortisone shots. It didn't work. Several months later  I was in the northeast Amazon  walked into a village  and the shaman said   You're limping.  And I'll never forget this as long as I live. He looked me in the face and he said   Take off your shoe and give  me your machete.  He walked over to a palm tree and carved off a fern  threw it in the fire  applied it to my foot  threw it in a pot of water  and had me drink the tea. The pain disappeared for seven months. When it came back  I went to see the shaman again. He gave me the same treatment  and I've been cured for three years now. Who would you rather be treated by  Now  make no mistake   Western medicine is the most successful system of healing ever devised  but there's plenty of holes in it. Where's the cure for breast cancer  Where's the cure for schizophrenia  Where's the cure for acid reflux  Where's the cure for insomnia  The fact is that these people can sometimes  sometimes  sometimes cure things we cannot. Here you see a medicine man in the northeast Amazon treating leishmaniasis  a really nasty protozoal disease that afflicts    million people around the world. Western treatment are injections of antimony. They're painful  they're expensive  and they're probably not good for your heart  it's a heavy metal. This man cures it with three plants from the Amazon Rainforest. This is the magic frog. My colleague  the late great Loren McIntyre  discoverer of the source  lake of the Amazon  Laguna McIntyre in the Peruvian Andes  was lost on the Peru Brazil border about    years ago. He was rescued by a group of  isolated Indians called the Mats s. They beckoned for him to follow them into the forest  which he did. There  they took out palm leaf baskets. There  they took out these green monkey frogs   these are big suckers  they're like this   and they began licking them. It turns out  they're highly hallucinogenic. McIntyre wrote about this and it was read  by the editor of High Times magazine. You see that ethnobotanists have  friends in all sorts of strange cultures. This guy decided he would go down to the Amazon and give it a whirl  or give it a lick  and  he did  and he wrote   My blood pressure went through the roof  I lost full control of my bodily functions  I passed out in a heap  I woke up in a hammock six hours later  felt like God for two days.  An Italian chemist read this and said   I'm not really interested in the theological  aspects of the green monkey frog. What's this about the change in blood pressure   Now  this is an Italian chemist who's working on a new treatment for high blood pressure based on peptides in the skin of the green monkey frog  and other scientists are looking at a cure for drug resistant Staph aureus. How ironic if these isolated  Indians and their magic frog prove to be one of the cures. Here's an ayahuasca shaman in the northwest Amazon  in the middle of a yage ceremony. I took him to Los Angeles to meet a foundation officer looking for support for monies to protect their culture. This fellow looked at the medicine man  and he said   You didn't go to  medical school  did you   The shaman said   No  I did not.  He said   Well  then what can you know about healing   The shaman looked at him and he said   You know what  If you have  an infection  go to a doctor. But many human afflictions are diseases  of the heart  the mind and the spirit. Western medicine can't  touch those. I cure them.  But all is not rosy in learning from nature about new medicines. This is a viper from Brazil  the venom of which was studied at the Universidade de S o Paulo here. It was later developed into ACE inhibitors. This is a frontline treatment for hypertension. Hypertension causes over    percent of all deaths on the planet every day. This is a    billion industry based on venom from a Brazilian snake  and the Brazilians did not get a nickel. This is not an acceptable way of doing business. The rainforest has been called the  greatest expression of life on Earth. There's a saying in Suriname that I dearly love   The rainforests hold answers to questions we have yet to ask.  But as you all know  it's rapidly disappearing. Here in Brazil  in the Amazon  around the world. I took this picture from a small plane flying over the eastern border of the Xingu indigenous reserve in the state of Mato Grosso to the northwest of here. The top half of the picture  you see where the Indians live. The line through the middle is the eastern border of the reserve. Top half Indians  bottom half white guys. Top half wonder drugs  bottom half just a bunch of skinny ass cows. Top half carbon sequestered in the forest where it belongs  bottom half carbon in the atmosphere where it's driving climate change. In fact  the number two cause of carbon being released into the atmosphere is forest destruction. But in talking about destruction  it's important to keep in mind that the Amazon is the mightiest landscape of all. It's a place of beauty and wonder. The biggest anteater in the world lives in the rain forest  tips the scale at    pounds. The goliath bird eating spider is the world's largest spider. It's found in the Amazon as well. The harpy eagle wingspan is over seven feet. And the black cayman   these monsters can tip the scale at over half a ton. They're known to be man eaters. The anaconda  the largest snake  the capybara  the largest rodent. A specimen from here in Brazil tipped the scale at     pounds. Let's visit where these creatures live  the northeast Amazon  home to the Akuriyo tribe. Uncontacted peoples hold a  mystical and iconic role in our imagination. These are the people who  know nature best. These are the people who truly live in total harmony with nature. By our standards  some would dismiss these people as primitive.  They don't know how to make fire  or they didn't when they were first contacted.  But they know the forest far better than we do. The Akuriyos have    words for honey  and other Indians look up to them as being the true masters of the emerald realm. Here you see the face of my friend Pohnay. When I was a teenager rocking out to the Rolling Stones in my hometown of New Orleans  Pohnay was a forest nomad roaming the jungles of the northeast Amazon in a small band  looking for game  looking for medicinal plants  looking for a wife  in other small nomadic bands. But it's people like these that know things that we don't  and they have lots of  lessons to teach us. However  if you go into most of the forests of the Amazon  there are no indigenous peoples. This is what you find  rock carvings which indigenous peoples  uncontacted peoples  used to sharpen the edge of the stone axe. These cultures that once danced  made love  sang to the gods  worshipped the forest  all that's left is an imprint in stone  as you see here. Let's move to the western Amazon  which is really the epicenter of isolated peoples. Each of these dots represents a small  uncontacted tribe  and the big reveal today is we believe there are    or    isolated groups in the Colombian Amazon alone. Why are these people isolated  They know we exist  they know there's an outside world. This is a form of resistance. They have chosen to remain isolated  and I think it is their human right to remain so. Why are these the tribes that hide from man  Here's why. Obviously  some of this  was set off in     . But at the turn of the last century was the rubber trade. The demand for natural rubber  which came from the Amazon  set off the botanical equivalent of a gold rush. Rubber for bicycle tires  rubber for automobile tires  rubber for zeppelins. It was a mad race to get that rubber  and the man on the left  Julio Arana  is one of the true thugs of the story. His people  his company  and other companies like them killed  massacred  tortured  butchered Indians like the Witotos you see on the right hand side of the slide. Even today  when people come out of the forest  the story seldom has a happy ending. These are Nukaks. They were contacted in the '  s. Within a year  everybody over    was dead. And remember  these are preliterate societies. The elders are the libraries. Every time a shaman dies  it's as if a library has burned down. They have been forced off their lands. The drug traffickers have taken over the Nukak lands  and the Nukaks live as beggars in public parks in eastern Colombia. From the Nukak lands  I want to  take you to the southwest  to the most spectacular  landscape in the world  Chiribiquete National Park. It was surrounded by three isolated tribes and thanks to the Colombian government and Colombian colleagues  it has now expanded. It's bigger than the state of Maryland. It is a treasure trove of botanical diversity. It was first explored botanically in      by my mentor  Richard Schultes  seen here atop the Bell Mountain  the sacred mountains of the Karijonas. And let me show you what it looks like today. Flying over Chiribiquete  realize that these lost world mountains are still lost. No scientist has been atop them. In fact  nobody has been atop the Bell Mountain since Schultes in '  . And we'll end up here with the Bell Mountain just to the east of the picture. Let me show you what it looks like today. Not only is this a treasure trove of botanical diversity  not only is it home to three isolated tribes  but it's the greatest treasure trove of pre Colombian art in the world  over         paintings. The Dutch scientist Thomas van der Hammen described this as the Sistine Chapel of the Amazon Rainforest. But move from Chiribiquete down to the southeast  again in the Colombian Amazon. Remember  the Colombian Amazon is bigger than New England. The Amazon's a big forest  and Brazil's got a big part of it  but not all of it. Moving down to these two national parks  Cahuinari and Pur  in the Colombian Amazon   that's the Brazilian border to the right   it's home to several groups of isolated and uncontacted peoples. To the trained eye  you can look at the roofs of these malocas  these longhouses  and see that there's cultural diversity. These are  in fact  different tribes. As isolated as these areas are  let me show you how the  outside world is crowding in. Here we see trade and transport increased in Putumayo. With the diminishment of the Civil War in Colombia  the outside world is showing up. To the north  we have illegal gold mining  also from the east  from Brazil. There's increased hunting and fishing for commercial purposes. We see illegal logging coming from the south  and drug runners are trying to move through the park and get into Brazil. This  in the past  is why you didn't mess with isolated Indians. And if it looks like this picture is out of focus because it was taken in a hurry  here's why. This looks like    Applause  This looks like a hangar from the Brazilian Amazon. This is an art exhibit in Havana  Cuba. A group called Los Carpinteros. This is their perception of why you  shouldn't mess with uncontacted Indians. But the world is changing. These are Mashco Piros on the Brazil Peru border who stumbled out of the jungle because they were essentially chased out by drug runners and timber people. And in Peru  there's a very nasty business. It's called human safaris. They will take you in to isolated groups to take their picture. Of course  when you give them  clothes  when you give them tools  you also give them diseases. We call these  inhuman safaris.  These are Indians again  on the Peru border  who were overflown by flights sponsored by missionaries. They want to get in there and turn them into Christians. We know how that turns out. What's to be done  Introduce technology to the contacted tribes  not the uncontacted tribes  in a culturally sensitive way. This is the perfect marriage of  ancient shamanic wisdom and   st century technology. We've done this now with over    tribes  mapped  managed and increased protection of over    million acres of ancestral rainforest. So this allows the Indians to take control of their environmental and cultural destiny. They also then set up guard houses to keep outsiders out. These are Indians  trained as indigenous park rangers  patrolling the borders and keeping the outside world at bay. This is a picture of actual contact. These are Chitonahua Indians on the Brazil Peru border. They've come out of the jungle asking for help. They were shot at  their malocas  their  longhouses  were burned. Some of them were massacred. Using automatic weapons to  slaughter uncontacted peoples is the single most despicable and  disgusting human rights abuse on our planet today  and it has to stop. But let me conclude by saying  this work can be spiritually rewarding  but it's difficult and it can be dangerous. Two colleagues of mine passed away recently in the crash of a small plane. They were serving the forest to protect those uncontacted tribes. So the question is  in conclusion  is what the future holds. These are the Uray people in Brazil. What does the future hold for them  and what does the future hold for us  Let's think differently. Let's make a better world. If the climate's going to change  let's have a climate that changes for the better rather than the worse. Let's live on a planet full of luxuriant vegetation  in which isolated peoples can remain in isolation  can maintain that mystery and that knowledge if they so choose. Let's live in a world where the shamans live in these forests and heal themselves and us with their mystical plants and their sacred frogs. Thanks again. Vision is the most important and prioritized sense that we have. We are constantly looking at the world around us  and quickly we identify and make sense of what it is that we see. Let's just start with an example of that very fact. I'm going to show you a photograph of a person  just for a second or two  and I'd like for you to identify what emotion is on his face. Ready  Here you go. Go with your gut reaction. Okay. What did you see  Well  we actually surveyed over     individuals  and the results were mixed. People did not agree on what emotion they saw on his face. Maybe you saw discomfort. That was the most frequent response that we received. But if you asked the person on your left  they might have said regret or skepticism  and if you asked somebody on your right  they might have said something entirely different  like hope or empathy. So we are all looking at the very same face again. We might see something entirely different  because perception is subjective. What we think we see is actually filtered through our own mind's eye. Of course  there are many other examples of how we see the world through own mind's eye. I'm going to give you just a few. So dieters  for instance  see apples as larger than people who are not counting calories. Softball players see the ball as smaller if they've just come out of a slump  compared to people who  had a hot night at the plate. And actually  our political beliefs also can affect the way we see other people  including politicians. So my research team and I decided to test this question. In       Barack Obama was running for president for the very first time  and we surveyed hundreds of Americans one month before the election. What we found in this survey was that some people  some Americans  think photographs like these best reflect how Obama really looks. Of these people     percent voted for Obama in the actual election. Other people  though  thought photographs like these best reflect how Obama really looks.    percent of these people voted for McCain. We presented many photographs of Obama one at a time  so people did not realize that what we were changing from one photograph to the next was whether we had artificially lightened or darkened his skin tone. So how is that possible  How could it be that when I look at a person  an object  or an event  I see something very different than somebody else does  Well  the reasons are many  but one reason requires that we understand a little bit more about how our eyes work. So vision scientists know that the amount of information that we can see at any given point in time  what we can focus on  is actually relatively small. What we can see with great sharpness and clarity and accuracy is the equivalent of the surface area of our thumb on our outstretched arm. Everything else around that is blurry  rendering much of what is presented to our eyes as ambiguous. But we have to clarify and make sense of what it is that we see  and it's our mind that helps us fill in that gap. As a result  perception is a subjective experience  and that's how we end up seeing through our own mind's eye. So  I'm a social psychologist  and it's questions like these that really intrigue me. I am fascinated by those times when people do not see eye to eye. Why is it that somebody might literally see the glass as half full  and somebody literally sees it as half empty  What is it about what one person is thinking and feeling that leads them to see the world in an entirely different way  And does that even matter  So to begin to tackle these questions  my research team and I decided to delve deeply into an issue that has received international attention  our health and fitness. Across the world  people are struggling to manage their weight  and there is a variety of strategies that we have to help us keep the pounds off. For instance  we set the best of intentions to exercise after the holidays  but actually  the majority of Americans find that their New Year's resolutions are broken by Valentine's Day. We talk to ourselves in very encouraging ways  telling ourselves this is our year to get back into shape  but that is not enough to bring us back to our ideal weight. So why  Of course  there is no simple answer  but one reason  I argue  is that our mind's eye might work against us. Some people may literally see exercise as more difficult  and some people might literally see exercise as easier. So  as a first step to testing these questions  we gathered objective measurements of individuals' physical fitness. We measured the  circumference of their waist  compared to the  circumference of their hips. A higher waist to hip ratio is an indicator of being less physically fit than a lower waist to hip ratio. After gathering these measurements  we told our participants that they would walk to a finish line while carrying extra weight in a sort of race. But before they did that  we asked them to estimate the distance to the finish line. We thought that the physical states of their body might change how they perceived the distance. So what did we find  Well  waist to hip ratio predicted perceptions of distance. People who were out of shape and unfit actually saw the distance to the finish line as significantly greater than people who were in better shape. People's states of their own body changed how they perceived the environment. But so too can our mind. In fact  our bodies and our minds work in tandem to change how we see the world around us. That led us to think that maybe people with strong motivations and strong goals to exercise might actually see the finish line as closer than people who have weaker motivations. So to test whether motivations affect our perceptual experiences in this way  we conducted a second study. Again  we gathered objective measurements of people's physical fitness  measuring the circumference of their waist and the circumference of their hips  and we had them do a  few other tests of fitness. Based on feedback that we gave them  some of our participants told us they're not motivated to exercise any more. They felt like they already met their fitness goals and they weren't going to do anything else. These people were not motivated. Other people  though   based on our feedback  told us they were highly  motivated to exercise. They had a strong goal to make it to the finish line. But again  before we had them walk to the finish line  we had them estimate the distance. How far away was the finish line  And again  like the previous study  we found that waist to hip ratio predicted perceptions of distance. Unfit individuals saw the distance as farther  saw the finish line as farther away  than people who were in better shape. Importantly  though  this only happened for people who were not motivated to exercise. On the other hand  people who were highly motivated to exercise saw the distance as short. Even the most out of shape individuals saw the finish line as just as close  if not slightly closer  than people who were in better shape. So our bodies can change how far away that finish line looks  but people who had committed to a manageable goal that they could accomplish in the near future and who believed that they were capable of meeting that goal actually saw the exercise as easier. That led us to wonder  is there a strategy that we could use and teach people that would help change their perceptions of the distance  help them make exercise look easier  So we turned to the vision science literature to figure out what should we do  and based on what we read  we came up with a strategy that we called   Keep  your eyes on the prize.  So this is not the slogan from an inspirational poster. It's an actual directive for how to look around your environment. People that we trained in this strategy  we told them to focus their attention on the finish line  to avoid looking around  to imagine a spotlight was shining on that goal  and that everything around it was blurry and perhaps difficult to see. We thought that this strategy would help make the exercise look easier. We compared this group to a baseline group. To this group we said  just look around the environment as you naturally would. You will notice the finish line  but you might also notice the garbage can off to the right  or the people and the  lamp post off to the left. We thought that people who used this strategy would see the distance as farther. So what did we find  When we had them estimate the distance  was this strategy successful for changing their perceptual experience  Yes. People who kept their eyes on the prize saw the finish line as    percent closer than people who looked around as they naturally would. We thought this was great. We were really excited because it meant that this strategy helped make the exercise look easier  but the big question was  could this help make exercise actually better  Could it improve the quality of exercise as well  So next  we told our participants  you are going to walk to the finish line while wearing extra weight. We added weights to their ankles that amounted to    percent of their body weight. We told them to lift their knees up high and walk to the finish line quickly. We designed this exercise in particular to be moderately challenging but not impossible  like most exercises that actually improve our fitness. So the big question  then  Did keeping your eyes on the prize and narrowly focusing on the finish line change their experience of the exercise  It did. People who kept their eyes on the prize told us afterward that it required    percent less exertion for them to do this exercise than people who looked around naturally. It changed their subjective experience of the exercise. It also changed the objective nature of their exercise. People who kept their eyes on the prize actually moved    percent faster than people who looked around naturally. To put that in perspective  a    percent increase is like trading in your      Chevy Citation for a      Chevrolet Corvette. We were so excited by this  because this meant that a strategy that costs nothing  that is easy for people to use  regardless of whether they're in shape or struggling to get there  had a big effect. Keeping your eyes on the prize made the exercise look and feel easier even when people were working harder because they were moving faster. Now  I know there's more to good health than walking a little bit faster  but keeping your eyes on the prize might be one additional strategy that you can use to help promote a healthy lifestyle. If you're not convinced yet that we all see the world through our own mind's eye  let me leave you with one final example. Here's a photograph of a beautiful  street in Stockholm  with two cars. The car in the back looks much larger than the car in the front. However  in reality  these cars are the same size  but that's not how we see it. So does this mean that our eyes have gone haywire and that our brains are a mess  No  it doesn't mean that at all. It's just how our eyes work. We might see the world in a different way  and sometimes that might not line up with reality  but it doesn't mean that one of us is right and one of us is wrong. We all see the world through our mind's eye  but we can teach ourselves to see it differently. So I can think of days that have gone horribly wrong for me. I'm fed up  I'm grumpy  I'm tired  and I'm so behind  and there's a big black cloud hanging over my head  and on days like these  it looks like everyone around me is down in the dumps too. My colleague at work looks annoyed when I ask for an extension on a deadline  and my friend looks frustrated when I show up late for lunch because a meeting ran long  and at the end of the day  my husband looks disappointed because I'd rather go to  bed than go to the movies. And on days like these  when everybody looks upset and angry to me  I try to remind myself that there are other ways of seeing them. Perhaps my colleague was confused  perhaps my friend was concerned  and perhaps my husband was  feeling empathy instead. So we all see the world through our own mind's eye  and on some days  it might look like the world is a dangerous and challenging and insurmountable place  but it doesn't have to look that way all the time. We can teach ourselves to see it differently  and when we find a way to make the world look nicer and easier  it might actually become so. Thank you. I'm a lifelong traveler. Even as a little kid  I was actually working out that it would be cheaper to go to boarding school in England than just to the best school down the road from my parents' house in California. So  from the time I was nine years old I was flying alone several times a year over the North Pole  just to go to school. And of course the more I flew the more I came to love to fly  so the very week after I graduated from high school  I got a job mopping tables so that I could spend every season of my   th year on a different continent. And then  almost inevitably  I became a travel writer so my job and my joy could become one. And I really began to feel that if you were lucky enough to walk around the candlelit temples of Tibet or to wander along the seafronts in Havana with music passing all around you  you could bring those sounds  and the high cobalt skies and the flash of the blue ocean back to your friends at home  and really bring some magic and clarity to your own life. Except  as you all know  one of the first things you learn when you travel is that nowhere is magical unless you can bring the right eyes to it. You take an angry man to the Himalayas  he just starts complaining about the food. And I found that the best way that I could develop more attentive and more appreciative eyes was  oddly  by going nowhere  just by sitting still. And of course sitting still is how many of us get what we most crave and need in our accelerated lives  a break. But it was also the only way that I could find to sift through the slideshow of my experience and make sense of the future and the past. And so  to my great surprise  I found that going nowhere was at least as exciting as going to Tibet or to Cuba. And by going nowhere  I mean nothing more intimidating than taking a few minutes out of every day or a few days out of every season  or even  as some people do  a few years out of a life in order to sit still long enough to find out what moves you most  to recall where your truest happiness lies and to remember that sometimes making a living and making a life point in opposite directions. And of course  this is what wise beings through the centuries from every tradition have been telling us. It's an old idea. More than       years ago   the Stoics were reminding us it's not our experience that makes our lives  it's what we do with it. Imagine a hurricane suddenly  sweeps through your town and reduces every last thing to rubble. One man is traumatized for life. But another  maybe even his brother  almost feels liberated  and decides this is a great chance to start his life anew. It's exactly the same event  but radically different responses. There is nothing either good or bad  as Shakespeare told us in  Hamlet   but thinking makes it so. And this has certainly been my experience as a traveler. Twenty four years ago I took  the most mind bending trip across North Korea. But the trip lasted a few days. What I've done with it sitting still  going back to it in my head  trying to understand it  finding a place for it in my thinking  that's lasted    years already and will probably last a lifetime. The trip  in other words  gave me some amazing sights  but it's only sitting still that allows me to turn those into lasting insights. And I sometimes think that so much of our life takes place inside our heads  in memory or imagination or interpretation or speculation  that if I really want to change my life I might best begin by changing my mind. Again  none of this is new  that's why Shakespeare and the Stoics were telling us this centuries ago  but Shakespeare never had to face     emails in a day. The Stoics  as far as I know  were not on Facebook. We all know that in our on demand lives  one of the things that's most on demand is ourselves. Wherever we are  any time of night or day  our bosses  junk mailers  our parents can get to us. Sociologists have actually found that in recent years Americans are working fewer hours than    years ago  but we feel as if we're working more. We have more and more time saving devices  but sometimes  it seems  less and less time. We can more and more easily  make contact with people on the furthest corners of the planet  but sometimes in that process we lose contact with ourselves. And one of my biggest surprises  as a traveler has been to find that often it's exactly the people who have most enabled us to get anywhere who are intent on going nowhere. In other words  precisely those beings who have created the technologies that override so many of the limits of old  are the ones wisest about the need for limits  even when it comes to technology. I once went to the Google headquarters and I saw all the things many of you have heard about  the indoor tree houses  the trampolines  workers at that time enjoying    percent of their paid time free so that they could just let their imaginations go wandering. But what impressed me even more was that as I was waiting for my digital I.D.  one Googler was telling me about the program that he was about to start to teach the many  many Googlers who practice yoga to become trainers in it  and the other Googler was telling me about the book that he was about to write on the inner search engine  and the ways in which science has empirically shown that sitting still  or meditation  can lead not just to better  health or to clearer thinking  but even to emotional intelligence. I have another friend in Silicon Valley who is really one  of the most eloquent spokesmen for the latest technologies  and in fact was one of the founders of Wired magazine  Kevin Kelly. And Kevin wrote his last book on fresh technologies without a smartphone or a laptop or a TV in his home. And like many in Silicon Valley  he tries really hard to observe what they call an Internet sabbath  whereby for    or    hours every week they go completely offline in order to gather the sense of direction and proportion they'll need  when they go online again. The one thing perhaps that technology hasn't always given us is a sense of how to make the wisest use of technology. And when you speak of the sabbath  look at the Ten Commandments    there's only one word there for which the adjective  holy  is used  and that's the Sabbath. I pick up the Jewish holy book of the Torah    its longest chapter  it's on the Sabbath. And we all know that it's really one of our greatest luxuries  the empty space. In many a piece of music   it's the pause or the rest that gives the piece its beauty and its shape. And I know I as a writer will often try to include a lot of empty space on the page so that the reader can complete my thoughts and sentences and so that her imagination has room to breathe. Now  in the physical domain   of course  many people  if they have the resources  will try to get a place in the country  a second home. I've never begun to have those resources  but I sometimes remember that any time I want  I can get a second home in time  if not in space  just by taking a day off. And it's never easy because  of course   whenever I do I spend much of it worried about all the extra stuff that's going to crash down on me the following day. I sometimes think I'd rather give up meat or sex or wine than the chance to check on my emails. And every season I do try to take three days off on retreat but a part of me still feels guilty to be leaving my poor wife behind and to be ignoring all those seemingly urgent emails from my bosses and maybe to be missing a friend's birthday party. But as soon as I get to a place of real quiet  I realize that it's only by going there that I'll have anything fresh or creative or joyful to share with my wife or bosses or friends. Otherwise  really  I'm just foisting on them my exhaustion or my distractedness  which is no blessing at all. And so when I was     I decided to remake my entire life in the light of going nowhere. One evening I was coming back from the office  it was after midnight  I was in a taxi driving through Times Square  and I suddenly realized that I was racing around so much I could never catch up with my life. And my life then  as it happened  was pretty much the one I might have dreamed of as a little boy. I had really interesting friends and colleagues  I had a nice apartment on Park Avenue and   th Street. I had  to me  a fascinating job  writing about world affairs  but I could never separate myself enough from them to hear myself think    or really  to understand if I was truly happy. And so  I abandoned my dream life for a single room on the backstreets of Kyoto  Japan  which was the place that had long exerted a strong  really mysterious gravitational pull on me. Even as a child I would just look at a painting of Kyoto and feel I recognized it  I knew it before I ever laid eyes on it. But it's also  as you all know  a beautiful city encircled by hills  filled with more than       temples and shrines  where people have been sitting still for     years or more. And quite soon after I moved there  I ended up where I still am with my wife  formerly our kids  in a two room apartment in the middle of nowhere where we have no bicycle  no car  no TV I can understand  and I still have to support my loved ones as a travel writer and a journalist  so clearly this is not ideal for job advancement or for cultural excitement or for social diversion. But I realized that it gives me what I prize most  which is days and hours. I have never once had to use a cell phone there. I almost never have to look at the time  and every morning when I wake up  really the day stretches in front of me like an open meadow. And when life throws up one of its nasty surprises  as it will  more than once  when a doctor comes into my room wearing a grave expression  or a car suddenly veers in front of mine on the freeway  I know  in my bones  that it's the time I've spent going nowhere that is going to sustain me much more than all the time I've spent racing around to Bhutan or Easter Island. I'll always be a traveler    my livelihood depends on it    but one of the beauties of travel is that it allows you to bring stillness into the motion and the commotion of the world. I once got on a plane in Frankfurt  Germany  and a young German woman  came down and sat next to me and engaged me in a very friendly conversation for about    minutes  and then she just turned around and sat still for    hours. She didn't once turn on her video monitor  she never pulled out a book  she didn't even go to sleep  she just sat still  and something of her clarity and calm really imparted itself to me. I've noticed more and more people taking conscious measures these days to try to open up a space inside their lives. Some people go to black hole resorts where they'll spend hundreds of dollars a night in order to hand over their cell phone and their laptop to the front desk on arrival. Some people I know  just before they go to sleep  instead of scrolling through their messages or checking out YouTube  just turn out the lights and listen to some music  and notice that they sleep much better and wake up much refreshed. I was once fortunate enough to drive into the high  dark mountains behind Los Angeles  where the great poet and singer and international heartthrob Leonard Cohen was living and working for many years as a full time monk in the Mount Baldy Zen Center. And I wasn't entirely surprised when the record that he released at the age of     to which he gave the deliberately  unsexy title of  Old Ideas   went to number one in the charts  in    nations in the world  hit the top five in nine others. Something in us  I think  is crying out for the sense of intimacy and depth that we get from people like that. who take the time and trouble to sit still. And I think many of us have the sensation  I certainly do  that we're standing about two inches away from a huge screen  and it's noisy and it's crowded and it's changing with every second  and that screen is our lives. And it's only by stepping back  and then further back  and holding still  that we can begin to see what the canvas means and to catch the larger picture. And a few people do that for us by going nowhere. So  in an age of acceleration  nothing can be more exhilarating than going slow. And in an age of distraction  nothing is so luxurious as paying attention. And in an age of constant movement  nothing is so urgent as sitting still. So you can go on your next vacation to Paris or Hawaii  or New Orleans  I bet you'll have a wonderful time. But  if you want to come back home alive and full of fresh hope  in love with the world  I think you might want to try considering going nowhere. Thank you. I would like to start with the story of Mary  a woman from an African village. Her first memories are of her family fleeing violent riots orchestrated by  the ruling political party. Her brother was murdered by the state sponsored militia  and she was raped more than once just because she belonged to the wrong party. One morning  a month before the election  Mary's village was called  to another intimidation meeting. In this meeting  there is a man standing in front of them  telling them   We know who you are  we know who you will vote for  and if you're not going to drop the right paper  we're going to take revenge.  But for Mary  this meeting is different. She feels different. This time  she's waiting for this meeting  because this time  she's carrying a small hidden camera in her dress  a camera that nobody else can see. Nobody is allowed to film in these meetings. You risk your life if you do. Mary knows that  but she also knows that the only way to stop them and to protect herself and her community is to expose their intimidation  to make sure they understand somebody is following them  to break the impunity they feel. Mary and her friends were filming for months  undercover  the intimidation of the ruling political party. Man  We are now going to speak about the upcoming elections. Nothing can stop us  from doing what we want. If we hear you are with  The Opposition  we will not forgive you.   Militia intimidation rally    The Party  can torture you at any time. The youth can beat you.   Disruption of political meeting   For those who lie  saying they  are back with  The Party   your time is running out.   Party youth militia   Some have died because they rebelled. Some have lost their homes. If you don't work together  with  The Party   you will lead a very bad life. Oren Yakobovich  These images were broadcast all over the world  but more importantly  they have been broadcast back to the community. The perpetrators saw them too. They understood somebody is following them. They got scared. Impunity was broken. Mary and her friends forced the ruling political party not to use violence during the election  and saved hundreds of lives. Mary is just one of hundreds of people that my organization had helped  to document human rights violations using cameras. My background should have led me to a different direction. I was born in Israel to a right wing family  and as long as I remember myself  I wanted to join the Israeli army to serve my country and prove what I believed  was our right for the whole land. I joined the Israeli army  just after the first intifada  the first Palestinian uprising  and I served in one of the hard minded  toughest  aggressive infantry units  and I got the biggest gun in my platoon. Quite fast  I became an officer and got soldiers under my command  and as time passed  I started serving in the West Bank  and I saw these images. I didn't like what I saw. It took me a while  but eventually I refused to serve in the West Bank and had to spend time in jail. It was a bit   It was not that bad  I have to say. It was a bit like being in a hotel  but with very shitty food. In jail  I kept thinking  that I need people to know. I need people to understand what the reality in the West Bank looks like. I need them to hear what I heard  I need them to see what I saw  but I also understood  we need  the Palestinians themselves  the people that are suffering  to be able to tell their own stories  not journalists or filmmakers that are coming outside of the situation. I joined a human rights organization  an Israeli human rights  organization called B'Tselem. Together  we analyzed the West Bank and picked     families that are living in the most risky places  close to checkpoints  near army bases  side by side with settlers. We gave them cameras and training. Quite fast  we started getting very disturbing images about how the settlers  and the soldiers are abusing them. I would like to share with you two clips from this project. Both of them were broadcast in Israel  and it created a massive debate. And I have to warn you  some of you might  find them quite explicit. The masked men you  will see in the first clips are Jewish settlers. Minutes before the camera was turned on  they approached a Palestinian family that was working their land and told them that they have to leave the land  because this land belongs to the Jewish settlers. The Palestinians refused. Let's see what happened. The masked men that are approaching are Jewish settlers. They are approaching the Palestinian family. This is a demonstration in the West Bank. The guy in green is Palestinian. He will be arrested in a second. Here you see him blindfolded and handcuffed. In a few seconds  he regrets  he came to this demonstration. He's been shot in the foot with a rubber bullet. He is okay. Not all the settlers and the soldiers are acting this way. We're talking about a tiny minority  but they have to be brought to justice. These clips  and others like them  forced the army and the police to start investigations. They've been shown in Israel  of course  and the Israeli public was exposed to them also. This project redefined the struggle for human rights in the occupied territories  and we managed to reduce the number  of violent attacks in the West Bank. The success of this project got me thinking how I can take the same methodology to other places in the world. Now  we tend to believe that today  with all of the technology  the smartphones and the Internet  we are able to see and understand most of what's happening in the world  and people are able to tell their story   but it's only partly true. Still today  with all the technology we have  less than half of the world's population has access to the Internet  and more than three billion people   I'm repeating the number   three billion people are consuming news that is censored by those in power. More or less around the same time  I'm approached by a great guy named Uri Fruchtmann. He's a filmmaker and an activist. We understood we were thinking along the same lines  and we decided to establish Videre  our organization  together. While building the organization in London  we've been traveling undercover to places where a community  was suffering from abuses  where mass atrocities were happening  and there was a lack of reporting. We tried to understand how we can help. There were four things that I learned. The first thing is that we have to engage with communities that are living in rural areas  where violations are happening far from the public eye. We need to partner with them  and we need to understand which images are not making it out there and help them to document them. The second thing I learned is that we have to enable them  to film in a safe way. Security has to be the priority. Where I used to work before  in the West Bank  one can take a camera out  most likely not going to get shot  but in places we wanted to work  just try to pull a phone out  and you're dead   literally dead. This is why we decided to take the operation undercover when necessary  and use mostly hidden cameras. Unfortunately  I can't show you the hidden cameras we're using today   for obvious reasons   but these are cameras we used before. You can buy them off the shelf. Today  we're building  a custom made hidden camera  like the one that Mary was wearing in her dress to film the intimidation meeting of the ruling political party. It's a camera that nobody can see  that blends into the environment  into the surroundings. Now  filming securities go beyond using hidden cameras. Being secure starts way before the activist is turning the camera on. To keep our partners safe  we work to understand the risk of every location and of every shot before it's happened  building a backup plan if something goes wrong  and making sure  we have everything in place before our operations start. The third thing I learned is the importance of verification. You can have an amazing shot of atrocity  but if you can't verify it  it's worth nothing. Recently  like in the ongoing war  in Syria or the war in Gaza  we've seen images that are staged  or brought from a different conflict. This misinformation destroyed the credibility of the source  and it's harmed the credibility of other reliable and trustworthy sources. We use a variety of ways to make sure we can verify the information and we can trust the material. It starts with vetting the partners  understanding who they are  and working with them very intensively. How do you film a location  You film road signs  you film watches  you film newspapers. We are checking maps  looking at maps  double checking the information  and looking also at  the metadata of the material. Now  the fourth and the most important thing I learned is how you use images  to create a positive change. To have an effect  the key thing is how you use the material. Today  we're working with hundreds of activists filming undercover. We work with them both to understand  the situation on the ground and which images  are missing to describe it  who are the ones that are  influencing the situation  and when to release the material to advance the struggle. Sometimes  it's about putting it in the media  mostly local ones  to create awareness. Sometimes it's working with decision makers  to change laws. Sometimes  it's working with lawyers to use as evidence in court. But more than often  the most effective way to create a social change is to work within the community. I want to give you one example. Fatuma is part of a network of women that are fighting abuses in Kenya. Women in her community have been harassed constantly on their way to school and on their way to work. They are trying to change  the behavior of the community from inside. In the next clip  Fatuma is taking us with her on her journey to work. Her voice is superimposed on images that she filmed herself using hidden cameras. I'm    years old  a mother  And Ziwa La Ng'Ombe is my home. Each morning  I ride the mini bus Number   . But instead of a peaceful journey to work  each day begins with fear. Come with me now and use my eyes to feel what I feel. As I walk  I think to myself  Will I be touched  Grabbed  Violated by this conductor again  Even the men inside the way they look at me touch my body  rub against me  grab me  and now  as I sit in my seat I only wish my mind was full of thoughts for my day  my dreams  my children at school  but instead I worry about the moment when we will arrive and I will be violated again. OY  Today  there is a new front in the fight for human rights. I used to carry a big gun. Now  I am carrying this. This is a much more powerful and much  much more effective weapon. But we have to use its power wisely. By putting the right images in the right hands at the right time  we can truly create an impact. Thank you. Thank you. So in the oasis of  intelligentsia that is TED  I stand here before you this evening as an expert in dragging heavy stuff around cold places. I've been leading polar expeditions  for most of my adult life  and last month  my teammate  Tarka L'Herpiniere and I finished the most ambitious  expedition I've ever attempted. In fact  it feels like I've been transported straight here from four months in the middle of nowhere  mostly grunting and swearing   straight to the TED stage. So you can imagine that's a transition that hasn't been entirely seamless. One of the interesting side effects seems to be that my short term memory is entirely shot. So I've had to write some notes to avoid too much grunting and swearing in the next    minutes. This is the first talk I've given about this expedition  and while we weren't sequencing genomes or building space telescopes  this is a story about giving everything we had to achieve something that hadn't been done before. So I hope in that you might  find some food for thought. It was a journey  an  expedition in Antarctica  the coldest  windiest  driest and highest altitude continent on Earth. It's a fascinating place. It's a huge place. It's twice the size of Australia  a continent that is the same size as China and India put together. As an aside  I have experienced an interesting phenomenon in the last few days  something that I expect Chris Hadfield may get at TED in a few years' time  conversations that go something like this   Oh  Antarctica. Awesome. My husband and I did Antarctica with Lindblad for our anniversary.  Or   Oh cool  did you go there for the marathon   Our journey was  in fact     marathons back to back in     days  an       mile round trip on foot from the coast of Antarctica to the South Pole and back again. In the process  we broke the record for the longest human powered polar journey in history by more than     miles. For those of you from the Bay Area  it was the same as walking from  here to San Francisco  then turning around and walking back again. So as camping trips go  it was a long one  and one I've seen summarized  most succinctly here on the hallowed pages  of Business Insider Malaysia.   Two Explorers Just Completed A Polar Expedition  That Killed Everyone The Last Time It Was Attempted   Chris Hadfield talked so eloquently about fear and about the odds of success  and indeed the odds of survival. Of the nine people in history that had attempted this journey before us  none had made it to the pole and back  and five had died in the process. This is Captain Robert Falcon Scott. He led the last team to attempt this expedition. Scott and his rival Sir Ernest Shackleton  over the space of a decade  both led expeditions battling to become the first to reach the South Pole  to chart and map the interior of Antarctica  a place we knew less about  at the time  than the surface of the moon  because we could see the moon through telescopes. Antarctica was  for the most part  a century ago  uncharted. Some of you may know the story. Scott's last expedition  the  Terra Nova Expedition in       started as a giant siege style approach. He had a big team using ponies  using dogs  using petrol driven tractors  dropping multiple  pre positioned depots of food and fuel through which Scott's final team of five would travel to the Pole  where they would turn around and ski  back to the coast again on foot. Scott and his final team of five arrived at the South Pole  in January      to find they had been beaten to it by a Norwegian team led by Roald Amundsen  who rode on dogsled. Scott's team ended up on foot. And for more than a century this journey has remained unfinished. Scott's team of five died  on the return journey. And for the last decade  I've been asking myself why that is. How come this has remained  the high water mark  Scott's team covered       miles on foot. No one's come close to that ever since. So this is the high water mark  of human endurance  human endeavor   human athletic achievement in arguably the harshest climate on Earth. It was as if the marathon record has remained unbroken since     . And of course some strange and  predictable combination of curiosity  stubbornness  and probably hubris led me to thinking I might be the man to try to finish the job. Unlike Scott's expedition  there were just two of us  and we set off from the coast of Antarctica in October last year  dragging everything ourselves  a process Scott called  man hauling.  When I say it was like walking from here to San Francisco and back  I actually mean it was like dragging something that weighs a shade more than the heaviest ever NFL player. Our sledges weighed     kilos  or     pounds each at the start  the same weights that the weakest of Scott's ponies pulled. Early on  we averaged  .  miles per hour. Perhaps the reason no one had  attempted this journey until now  in more than a century  was that no one had been quite stupid enough to try. And while I can't claim we were exploring in the genuine Edwardian sense of the word   we weren't naming any mountains or mapping any uncharted valleys   I think we were stepping into uncharted territory in a human sense. Certainly  if in the future we learn there is an area of the human brain that lights up when one curses oneself  I won't be at all surprised. You've heard that the average American spends    percent of their time indoors. We didn't go indoors for nearly four months. We didn't see a sunset either. It was    hour daylight. Living conditions were quite spartan. I changed my underwear  three times in     days and Tarka and I shared     square feet on the canvas. Though we did have some technology that Scott could never have imagined. And we blogged live every evening from the tent via a laptop and a custom made satellite transmitter  all of which were solar powered  we had a flexible photovoltaic panel over the tent. And the writing was important to me. As a kid  I was inspired by the  literature of adventure and exploration  and I think we've all seen here this week the importance and  the power of storytelling. So we had some   st century gear  but the reality is that the  challenges that Scott faced were the same that we faced  those of the weather and of  what Scott called glide  the amount of friction between the sledges and the snow. The lowest wind chill  we experienced was in the    s  and we had zero visibility  what's called white out  for much of our journey. We traveled up and down one of the largest and most dangerous glaciers in the world  the Beardmore glacier. It's     miles long  most of its surface is what's called blue ice. You can see it's a beautiful   shimmering steel hard blue surface covered with thousands  and thousands of crevasses  these deep cracks in the glacial ice  up to     feet deep. Planes can't land here  so we were at the most risk  technically  when we had the slimmest chance of being rescued. We got to the South Pole after    days on foot  with one day off for bad weather  and I'm sad to say  it was something of an anticlimax. There's a permanent American base  the Amundsen Scott South Pole Station at the South Pole. They have an airstrip  they have a canteen  they have hot showers  they have a post office  a tourist shop  a basketball court that doubles as a movie theater. So it's a bit different these days  and there are also acres of junk. I think it's a marvelous thing that humans can exist     days of the year with hamburgers and hot showers and movie theaters  but it does seem to produce a lot of empty cardboard boxes. You can see on the left of  this photograph  several square acres of junk waiting to be flown out from the South Pole. But there is also a pole at the South Pole  and we got there on foot  unassisted  unsupported  by the hardest route      miles in record time  dragging more weight than anyone in history. And if we'd stopped there  and flown home  which would have been the eminently sensible thing to do  then my talk would end here and it would end something like this. If you have the right team around you  the right tools  the right technology  and if you have enough self belief and enough determination  then anything is possible. But then we turned around  and this is where things get interesting. High on the Antarctic plateau  over        feet  it's very windy  very cold  very dry  we were exhausted. We'd covered    marathons  we were only halfway  and we had a safety net  of course  of ski planes and satellite phones and live     hour tracking beacons that didn't exist for Scott  but in hindsight  rather than making our lives easier  the safety net actually allowed us to cut things very fine indeed  to sail very close to our absolute limits as human beings. And it is an exquisite form of torture to exhaust yourself to the point of starvation day after day while dragging a sledge full of food. For years  I'd been writing glib lines in sponsorship proposals about pushing the limits of human endurance  but in reality  that was  a very frightening place to be indeed. We had  before we'd got to the Pole  two weeks of almost permanent headwind  which slowed us down. As a result  we'd had several days of eating half rations. We had a finite amount of food in the sledges to make this journey  so we were trying to string that out by reducing our intake to half  the calories we should have been eating. As a result  we both became increasingly hypoglycemic   we had low blood sugar  levels day after day   and increasingly susceptible to the extreme cold. Tarka took this photo of me one evening after I'd nearly passed out with hypothermia. We both had repeated bouts of hypothermia  something I hadn't experienced before  and it was very humbling indeed. As much as you might like to think  as I do  that you're the kind of person who doesn't quit  that you'll go down swinging  hypothermia doesn't leave you much choice. You become utterly incapacitated. It's like being a drunk toddler. You become pathetic. I remember just wanting to lie down and quit. It was a peculiar  peculiar feeling  and a real surprise to me to be debilitated to that degree. And then we ran out of food completely     miles short of the first of the depots that we'd laid on our outward journey. We'd laid    depots of food  literally burying food and fuel  for our return journey   the fuel was for a cooker so you could melt snow to get water   and I was forced to make the decision to call for a resupply flight  a ski plane carrying eight days of food to tide us over that gap. They took    hours to reach us from the other side of Antarctica. Calling for that plane was one of  the toughest decisions of my life. And I sound like a bit of a fraud standing here now with a sort of belly. I've put on    pounds in the last three weeks. Being that hungry has left an interesting mental scar  which is that I've been hoovering up every hotel buffet that I can find. But we were genuinely quite hungry  and in quite a bad way. I don't regret calling for that plane for a second  because I'm still standing here alive  with all digits intact   telling this story. But getting external assistance like that was never part of the plan  and it's something my ego is still struggling with. This was the biggest dream I've ever had  and it was so nearly perfect. On the way back down to the coast  our crampons   they're  the spikes on our boots that we have for traveling over this blue ice on the glacier   broke on the top of the Beardmore. We still had     miles to go downhill on very slippery rock hard blue ice. They needed repairing almost every hour. To give you an idea of scale  this is looking down towards the mouth of the Beardmore Glacier. You could fit the entirety of Manhattan in the gap on the horizon. That's    miles between Mount Hope and Mount Kiffin. I've never felt as small  as I did in Antarctica. When we got down to the mouth of the glacier  we found fresh snow had obscured the dozens of deep crevasses. One of Shackleton's men described crossing this sort of terrain as like walking over the glass roof of a railway station. We fell through more times than I can remember  usually just putting a ski or a boot through the snow. Occasionally we went in all  the way up to our armpits  but thankfully never deeper than that. And less than five weeks ago  after     days  we crossed this oddly  inauspicious finish line  the coast of Ross Island  on the New Zealand side of Antarctica. You can see the ice in the foreground and the sort of rubbly rock behind that. Behind us lay an unbroken  ski trail of nearly       miles. We'd made the longest ever polar journey on foot  something I'd been dreaming  of doing for a decade. And looking back  I still stand by all the things I've been saying for years about the importance of goals and determination and self belief  but I'll also admit that I hadn't given much thought to what happens when you reach the all consuming goal that you've dedicated  most of your adult life to  and the reality is that I'm  still figuring that bit out. As I said  there are very few superficial signs that I've been away. I've put on    pounds. I've got some very faint  probably  covered in makeup now  frostbite scars. I've got one on my nose  one on  each cheek  from where the goggles are  but inside I am a very  different person indeed. If I'm honest  Antarctica challenged me and humbled me so deeply that I'm not sure I'll ever be able to put it into words. I'm still struggling to piece together my thoughts. That I'm standing here  telling this story is proof that we all can  accomplish great things  through ambition  through passion  through sheer stubbornness  by refusing to quit  that if you dream something  hard enough  as Sting said  it does indeed come to pass. But I'm also standing here  saying  you know what  that cliche about the journey being  more important than the destination  There's something in that. The closer I got to my finish line  that rubbly  rocky coast of Ross Island  the more I started to realize that the biggest lesson that this very long  very hard walk might be teaching me is that happiness is not a finish line  that for us humans  the perfection that so many of us seem to dream of might not ever be truly attainable  and that if we can't feel content here  today  now  on our journeys amidst the mess and the striving that we all inhabit  the open loops   the half finished to do lists  the could do better next times  then we might never feel it. A lot of people have asked me  what next  Right now  I am very happy just recovering and in front of hotel buffets. But as Bob Hope put it  I feel very humble  but I think I have the strength of character to fight it.  Laughter  Thank you.      is a very special year for me     years as a consultant     years of marriage  and I'm turning    in one month. That means I was born in      in a small town in Germany. It was a gray November day  and I was overdue. The hospital's maternity ward was really stressed out because a lot of babies were born on this gray November day. As a matter of fact       was the year with the highest birth rate ever in Germany  more than  .  million. Last year  we just hit over          so half of my number. What you can see here is the German age pyramid  and there  the small black point at the top  that's me. In red  you can see the potential working age population  so people over    and under     and I'm actually only interested in this red area. Now  let's do a simple simulation of how this age structure will develop over the next couple of years. As you can see  the peak is moving to the right  and I  with many other baby boomers  will retire in     . By the way  I don't need any forecasts of birth rates for predicting this red area. The red area  so the potential working age population in       is already set in stone today  except for much higher migration rates. And if you compare this red area in      with the red area in       it is much  much smaller. So before I show you the rest of the world  what does this mean for Germany  So what we know from this picture is that the labor supply  so people who provide labor  will go down in Germany  and will go down significantly. Now  what about labor demand  That's where it gets tricky. As you might know  the consultant's favorite answer to any question is   It depends.  So I would say it depends. We didn't want to forecast the future. Highly speculative. We did something else. We looked at the GDP and productivity growth of Germany over the last    years  and calculated the following scenario  if Germany wants to continue this GDP and productivity growth  we could directly calculate how many people Germany would need to support this growth. And this is the green line  labor demand. So Germany will run into a major talent shortage very quickly. Eight million people are missing  which is more than    percent of our current workforce  so big numbers  really big numbers. And we calculated several scenarios  and the picture always looked like this. Now  to close the gap  Germany has to significantly increase migration  get many more women in the workforce  increase retirement age   by the way  we just lowered it this year   and all these measures at once. If Germany fails here  Germany will stagnate. We won't grow anymore. Why  Because the workers are not there who can generate this growth. And companies will look for talents somewhere else. But where  Now  we simulated labor supply and labor demand for the largest    economies in the world  representing more than    percent of world GDP  and the overall picture looks like this by     . Blue indicates a labor surplus  red indicates a labor shortfall  and gray are those countries which are borderline. So by       we still see a labor surplus in some countries  like Italy  France  the U.S.  but this picture will change dramatically by     . By       we will face a global workforce crisis in most of our largest economies  including three out of the four BRIC countries. China  with its former one child policy  will be hit  as well as Brazil and Russia. Now  to tell the truth  in reality  the situation will be even more challenging. What you can see here are average numbers. We de averaged them and broke them down into different skill levels  and what we found were even higher shortfalls for high skilled people and a partial surplus for low skilled workers. So on top of an overall labor shortage  we will face a big skill mismatch in the future  and this means huge challenges in terms of education  qualification  upskilling for governments and companies. Now  the next thing we looked into was robots  automation  technology. Will technology change this picture and boost productivity  Now  the short answer would be that our numbers already include a significant growth in productivity driven by technology. A long answer would go like this. Let's take Germany again. The Germans have a certain reputation in the world when it comes to productivity. In the '  s  I worked in our Boston office for almost two years  and when I left  an old senior partner told me  literally   Send me more of these Germans  they work like machines.  That was     . Sixteen years later  you'd probably say the opposite.  Send me more of these machines. They work like Germans.  Technology will replace a lot of jobs  regular jobs. Not only in the production industry  but even office workers are in jeopardy and might be replaced by robots  artificial intelligence  big data  or automation. So the key question is not if technology replaces some of these jobs  but when  how fast  and to what extent  Or in other words  will technology help us to solve this global workforce crisis  Yes and no. This is a more sophisticated version of  it depends.  Let's take the automotive industry as an example  because there  more than    percent of industrial robots are already working and automation has already taken place. In       less than    percent of the production cost of a car was caused by electronic parts. Today  this number is more than    percent and it will grow to more than    percent by     . And these new electronic parts and applications require new skills and have created a lot of new jobs  like the cognitive systems engineer who optimizes the interaction between driver and electronic system. In       no one had the slightest clue that such a job would ever exist. As a matter of fact  the overall number of people involved in the production of a car has only changed slightly in the last decades  in spite of robots and automation. So what does this mean  Yes  technology will replace a lot of jobs  but we will also see a lot of new jobs and new skills on the horizon  and that means technology will worsen our overall skill mismatch. And this kind of de averaging reveals the crucial challenge for governments and businesses. So people  high skilled people  talents  will be the big thing in the next decade. If they are the scarce resource  we have to understand them much better. Are they actually willing to work abroad  What are their job preferences  To find out  this year we conducted a global survey among more than         job seekers from     countries. Migration is certainly one key measure to close a gap  at least in the short term  so we asked about mobility. More than    percent of these         job seekers are willing to work abroad. For me  a surprisingly high number. If you look at the employees aged    to     this number is even higher. If you split this number up by country  yes  the world is mobile  but only partly. The least mobile countries are Russia  Germany and the U.S. Now where would these people like to move  Number seven is Australia  where    percent could imagine moving. Then France  Switzerland  Germany  Canada  U.K.  and the top choice worldwide is the U.S. Now  what are the job preferences of these         people  So  what are they looking for  Out of a list of    topics  salary is only number eight. The top four topics are all around culture. Number four  having a great relationship with the boss  three  enjoying a great work life balance  two  having a great relationship with colleagues  and the top priority worldwide is being appreciated for your work. So  do I get a thank you  Not only once a year with the annual bonus payment  but every day. And now  our global workforce crisis becomes very personal. People are looking for recognition. Aren't we all looking for recognition in our jobs  Now  let me connect the dots. We will face a global workforce crisis which consists of an overall labor shortage plus a huge skill mismatch  plus a big cultural challenge. And this global workforce crisis is approaching very fast. Right now  we are just at the turning point. So what can we  what can governments  what can companies do  Every company  but also every country  needs a people strategy  and to act on it immediately  and such a people strategy consists of four parts. Number one  a plan for how to forecast supply and demand for different jobs and different skills. Workforce planning will become  more important than financial planning. Two  a plan for how to attract great people  generation Y  women  but also retirees. Three  a plan for how to educate and upskill them. There's a huge upskilling challenge ahead of us. And four  for how to retain the best people  or in other words  how to realize an appreciation and relationship culture. However  one crucial underlying factor is to change our attitudes. Employees are resources  are assets  not costs  not head counts  not machines  not even the Germans. Thank you. Ten years ago  I got a phone call that changed my life. At the time  I was  cardiologist at UCLA  specializing in cardiac  imaging techniques. The call came from a veterinarian at the Los Angeles Zoo. An elderly female chimpanzee had woken up with a facial droop and the veterinarians were worried that she'd had a stroke. They asked if I'd  come to the zoo and image the animal's heart to look for a possible cardiac cause. Now  to be clear  North American zoos are staffed by highly qualified   board certified veterinarians who take outstanding  care of their animal patients. But occasionally  they do reach into  the human medical community  particularly for some  speciality consultation  and I was one of the lucky physicians who was invited in to help. I had a chance to rule out a stroke in this chimpanzee and make sure that this gorilla  didn't have a torn aorta  evaluate this macaw for a heart murmur  make sure that this California sea lion's paricardium wasn't inflamed  and in this picture  I'm listening to the heart of a lion after a lifesaving   collaborative procedure with veterinarians and physicians where we drained     cc's of  fluid from the sac in which this lion's  heart was contained. And this procedure  which I have done on many human patients  was identical  with the exception of that paw and that tail. Now most of the time  I was working at UCLA Medical Center with physicians  discussing symptoms and diagnoses and treatments for my human patients  but some of the time  I was working at the Los Angeles Zoo with veterinarians  discussing  symptoms and diagnoses and treatments for their animal patients. And occasionally  on  the very same day  I went on rounds at  UCLA Medical Center and at the Los Angeles Zoo. And here's what started coming into very clear focus for me. Physicians and veterinarians were essentially taking care of the same disorders in their  animal and human patients  congestive heart failure  brain tumors  leukemia  diabetes   arthritis  ALS  breast cancer  even psychiatric syndromes like depression  anxiety  compulsions  eating disorders and self injury. Now  I've got a confession to make. Even though I studied comparative physiology and evolutionary biology as an undergrad    I had even written my senior  thesis on Darwinian theory    learning about the  significant overlap between the disorders of  animals and humans  it came as a much needed  wake up call for me. So I started wondering  with all of these overlaps  how was it that I had never thought to ask a veterinarian  or consult the veterinary literature  for insights into one  of my human patients  Why had I never  nor had any of my  physician friends and colleagues whom I asked  ever attended  a veterinary conference  For that matter  why was  any of this a surprise  I mean  look  every single physician accepts some biological connection between animals and humans. Every medication that we prescribe or that we've taken ourselves or we've given to our families has first been tested on an animal. But there's something very different about giving an animal a  medication or a human disease and the animal developing  congestive heart failure or diabetes or breast cancer  on their own. Now  maybe some of the surprise comes from the increasing separation in our world between the urban and the nonurban. You know  we hear about these city kids who think that wool grows on trees or that cheese comes from a plant. Well  today's human hospitals  increasingly  are turning into these gleaming cathedrals of technology. And this creates a psychological distance between the human patients who are being treated there and animal patients who are living in oceans and farms and jungles. But I think there's an  even deeper reason. Physicians and scientists  we accept intellectually that our species  Homo sapiens  is merely  one species  no more unique or special than any other. But in our hearts  we don't  completely believe that. I feel it myself when I'm  listening to Mozart or looking at pictures of the  Mars Rover on my MacBook. I feel that tug of  human exceptionalism  even as I recognize the  scientifically isolating cost of seeing ourselves as a superior species  apart. Well  I'm trying these days. When I see a human patient now  I always ask  what do the animal doctors know about this problem that I don't know  And  might I be taking better  care of my human patient if I saw them as a human animal patient  Here are a few examples of the  kind of exciting connections that this kind of  thinking has led me to. Fear induced heart failure. Around the year       human cardiologists  discovered  emotionally induced heart failure. It was described in a gambling father  who had lost his life's savings with a roll of the dice  in a bride who'd been left at the alter. But it turns out  this   new  human diagnosis was neither new  nor was it uniquely human. Veterinarians had been diagnosing   treating and even preventing emotionally induced symptoms in animals ranging from monkeys to flamingos  from to deer to rabbits  since the     s. How many human lives  might have been saved if this veterinary knowledge had been put into the hands of E.R. docs and cardiologists  Self injury. Some human patients  harm themselves. Some pluck out patches of hair  others actually cut themselves. Some animal patients  also harm themselves. There are birds that  pluck out feathers. There are stallions that repetitively bite their flanks until they bleed. But veterinarians have very specific and very effective ways of treating and even preventing self injury in their self injuring animals. Shouldn't this veterinary knowledge be put into the hands of psychotherapists and  parents and patients struggling with self injury  Postpartum depression and  postpartum psychosis. Sometimes  soon after giving birth  some women become depressed  and sometimes they become seriously  depressed and even psychotic. They may neglect their newborn  and in some extreme cases  even harm the child. Equine veterinarians also know that occasionally  a mare  soon after giving birth  will neglect the foal  refusing to nurse  and in some instances  kick the foal  even to death. But veterinarians have devised an intervention to deal with this foal rejection syndrome that involves increasing  oxytocin in the mare. Oxytocin is the bonding hormone  and this leads to renewed interest  on the part of the mare  in her foal. Shouldn't this information be put into the hands of ob gyn's and family doctors and patients who are struggling with postpartum depression and psychosis  Well  despite all of this promise  unfortunately the gulf between our fields remains large. To explain it  I'm afraid I'm going  to have to air some dirty laundry. Some physicians can be real snobs about doctors who are not M.D.'s. I'm talking about dentists and  optometrists and psychologists  but maybe especially animal doctors. Of course  most physicians don't realize that it is harder to get into vet school these days than medical school  and that when we go  to medical school  we learn everything  there is to know about one species  Homo sapiens  but veterinarians need to learn about health and disease in mammals  amphibians  reptiles  fish and birds. So I don't blame the vets for feeling annoyed by my profession's condescension and ignorance. But here's one from the vets  What do you call a veterinarian who can only take  care of one species  A physician.  Laughter  Closing the gap has become  a passion for me  and I'm doing this  through programs like Darwin on Rounds at UCLA  where we're bringing animal experts  and evolutionary biologists and embedding them on our medical teams with our interns and our residents. And through Zoobiquity conferences  where we bring medical schools  together with veterinary schools for collabortive discussions of the shared diseases and disorders of animal and human patients. At Zoobiquity conferences  participants learn how treating breast cancer in a tiger can help us better treat breast cancer in a kindergarten teacher  how understanding polycystic overies in a Holstein cow can help us better take care of a dance instructor  with painful periods  and how better understanding the  treatment of separation anxiety in a high strung Sheltie can help an anxious young child struggling with his first days of school. In the United States and now  internationally  at Zoobiquity conferences physicians and veterinarians check  their attitudes and their preconceptions at the door and come  together as colleagues  as peers  as doctors. After all  we humans  are animals  too  and it's time for us physicians to embrace our patients' and our own animal natures and join veterinarians in a species spanning approach to health. Because it turns out  some of the best and  most humanistic medicine is being practiced by doctors whose patients aren't human. And one of the best ways  we can take care of the human patient is by  paying close attention to how all the other  patients on the planet live  grow  get sick and heal. Thank you. So  I thought a lot about the first word I'd say today  and I decided to say  Colombia.  And the reason  I don't know how many of you have visited Colombia  but Colombia is just north of the border with Brazil. It's a beautiful country with extraordinary people  like me and others     Laughter     and it's populated with incredible fauna  flora. It's got water  it's got everything to be the perfect place. But we have a few problems. You may have heard of some of them. We have the oldest standing guerrilla in the world. It's been around for over    years  which means that in my lifetime  I have never lived one day  of peace in my country. This guerrilla    and the main group is the FARC guerrillas  Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia    they have financed their war by kidnapping  by extortion  by getting into the drug trade  by illegal mining. There has been terrorism. There have been random bombs. So it's not good. It's not really good. And if you look at the human cost of this war over    years  we have had more than  .  million displaced population. It's one of the biggest displaced populations in the world  and this conflict has cost over         lives. So it's a little bit like the Bol var wars again. It's a lot of people who have died unnecessarily. We are now in the middle of peace talks  and we've been trying to help resolve this problem peacefully  and as part of that  we decided to try something completely lateral and different  Christmas lights. So Christmas lights  and you're saying  what the hell is this guy going to talk about  I am going to talk about gigantic trees that we put in nine strategic  pathways in the jungle covered with Christmas lights. These trees helped us  demobilize     guerrillas  roughly five percent of the guerrilla force at the time. These trees were lit up at night  and they had a sign beside them that said   If Christmas can come to the jungle  you can come home. Demobilize. At Christmas  everything is possible.  So how do we know these trees worked  Well  we got      which is okay  but we also know that not a lot of guerrillas saw them  but we know that a lot of guerrillas heard about them  and we know this because we are constantly talking to demobilized guerrillas. So let me take you back four years before the trees. Four years before the trees  we were approached by the government to help them come up with a communications strategy to get as many guerrillas as we could out of the jungle. The government had a military strategy  it had a legal strategy  it had a political strategy  but it said   We don't really have a communications strategy  and it probably would be a good thing to have   so we decided to immediately jump into this  because it is an opportunity to affect the outcome of the conflict with the things that we do  with the tools that we have. But we didn't know very much about it. We didn't understand in Colombia   if you live in the cities  you're very far away from where  the war is actually happening  so you don't really understand it  and we asked the government  to give us access to as many demobilized guerrillas as possible. And we talked to about    of them before we felt we fully understood the problem. We talked about    they told us why  they had joined the guerrillas  why the left the guerrillas  what their dreams were  what their frustrations were  and from those conversations came the underlying insight that has guided this whole campaign  which is that guerrillas are as much prisoners of their organizations as the people they hold hostage. And at the beginning  we were so touched by these stories  we were so amazed by these stories  that we thought that maybe  the best way to talk to the guerrillas was to have them talk to themselves  so we recorded about a hundred different stories during the first year  and we put them on the radio and television so that the guerrillas in the jungle could hear stories  their stories  or stories similar to theirs  and when they heard them  they decided to go out. I want to tell you one of these stories. This person you see here  is Giovanni Andres. Giovanni Andres is    when we took that picture. He had been seven years in the guerrilla  and he had demobilized very recently. His story is the following  He was recruited when he was     and sometime later  in his squadron  if you will  this beautiful girl was recruited  and they fell in love. Their conversations were about what their family was going to be like  what their kids' names would be  how their life would be when they left the guerrilla. But it turns out that love is very strictly forbidden in the lower ranks of the guerrilla  so their romance was discovered and they were separated. He was sent very far away  and she was left behind. She was very familiar with the territory  so one night  when she was on guard  she just left  and she went to the army  she demobilized  and she was one of the persons that we had the fortune to talk to  and we were really touched by this story  so we made a radio spot  and it turns out  by chance  that far away  many   many kilometers north  he heard her on the radio  and when he heard her on the radio  he said   What am I doing here  She had the balls to get out. I need to do the same thing.  And he did. He walked for two days and two nights  and he risked his life and he got out  and the only thing he wanted was to see her. The only thing that was in his mind was to see her. The story was  they did meet. I know you're wondering if they did meet. They did meet. She had been recruited when she was     and she left when she was     so there were a lot of other complications  but they did eventually meet. I don't know if they're together now  but I can find out.  Laughter  But what I can tell you is that our radio strategy was working. The problem is that it was working in the lower ranks of the guerrilla. It was not working with the commanders  the people that are more difficult to replace  because you can easily recruit but you can't get the older commanders. So we thought  well  we'll use the same strategy. We'll have commanders talking to commanders. And we even went as far as asking ex commanders of the guerrilla to fly on helicopters with microphones telling the people that used to fight with them   There is a better life out there    I'm doing good    This is not worth it   etc. But  as you can all imagine  it was very easy to counteract  because what was the guerrilla going to say   Yeah  right  if he doesn't do that  he's going to get killed.  So it was easy  so we were suddenly left with nothing  because the guerrilla were spreading the word that all of those things are done because if they don't do it   they're in danger. And somebody  some brilliant person in our team  came back and said   You know what I noticed  I noticed that around Christmastime  there have been peaks of demobilization since this war has started.  And that was incredible  because that led us to think  that we needed to talk to the human being and not to the soldier. We needed to step away from talking from government to army  from army to army  and we needed to talk about the universal values  and we needed to talk about humanity. And that was when the Christmas tree happened. This picture that I have here  you see this is the planning of the Christmas trees  and that man you see there with the three stars  he's Captain Juan Manuel Valdez. Captain Valdez was the first  high ranking official to give us the helicopters  and the support we needed to put these Christmas trees up  and he said in that meeting something that I will never forget. He said   I want to do this because being generous makes me stronger  makes my men feel stronger.  And I get very emotional when I remember him because he was killed later in combat and we really miss him  but I wanted you all to see him  because he was really  really important. He gave us all the support to put up the first Christmas trees. What happened later is that the guerrillas who came out during the Christmas tree  operation and all of that said   That's really good  Christmas trees are really cool  but you know what  We really don't walk anymore. We use rivers.  So rivers are the highways of the jungle  and this is something we learned  and most of the recruiting was being done in and around the river villages. So we went to these river villages  and we asked the people  and probably some of them were direct acquaintances of the guerrillas. We asked them   Can you send guerrillas a message   We collected over       messages. Some of them were notes saying  get out. Some of them were toys. Some of them were candy. Even people took off their jewelry  their little crosses and religious things  and put them in these floating balls that we sent down the rivers so that they could be picked up at night. And we sent thousands of these down the rivers  and then picked them up later if they weren't. But lots of them were picked up. This generated  on average  a demobilization every six hours  so this was incredible and it was about  Come home at Christmas. Then came the peace process  and when the peace process started  the whole mindset of the guerrilla changed. And it changed because it makes you think   Well  if there's a peace process  this is probably going to be over. At some point I'm going to get out.  And their fears completely changed  and their fears were not about   Am I going to get killed   Their fears were   Am I going to be rejected  When I get out of this  am I going to be rejected   So the past Christmas   what we did was we asked    we found    mothers of guerrillas  and we asked them to give us  pictures of their children  when they only could recognize themselves  so as not to put their lives in danger  and we asked them to give the most motherly message you can get  which is   Before you were a guerrilla  you were my child  so come home  I'm waiting for you.  You can see the pictures here. I'll show you a couple. Thank you. And these pictures were placed in many different places  and a lot of them came back  and it was really  really beautiful. And then we decided to work with society. So we did mothers around Christmastime. Now let's talk about the rest of the people. And you may be aware of this or not  but there was a World Cup this year  and Colombia played really well  and it was a unifying moment for Colombia. And what we did was tell the guerrillas   Come  get out of the jungle. We're saving a place for you.  So this was television  this was  all different types of media saying   We are saving a place for you.  The soldier here in the commercial says   I'm saving a place for you right here in this helicopter so that you can get out of this jungle and go enjoy the World Cup.  Ex football players  radio announcers  everybody was saving a place for the guerrilla. So since we started this work a little over eight years ago         guerrillas have demobilized. I do not     Applause  Thank you. I don't want to say in any way that it only has to do with what we do  but what I do know is that our work and the work that we do may have helped a lot of them start thinking about demobilization  and it may have helped a lot of them take the final decision. If that is true  advertising is still one of the most powerful tools of change that we have available. And I speak not only my behalf  but on behalf of all the colleagues I see here who work in advertising  and of all the team that has worked with me to do this  that if you want to change the world  or if you want to achieve  peace  please call us. We'd love to help. Thank you. When I arrived in Kiev  on February   this year  Independence Square was under siege  surrounded by police loyal to the government. The protesters who occupied Maidan  as the square is known  prepared for battle  stockpiling homemade weapons and mass producing improvised body armor. The Euromaidan protests began peacefully at the end of       after the president of Ukraine  Viktor Yanukovych  rejected a far reaching accord with the European Union in favor of stronger ties with Russia. In response  tens of thousands of dissatisfied citizens poured into central Kiev to demonstrate against this allegiance. As the months passed  confrontations between police and civilians intensified. I set up a makeshift portrait studio by the barricades on Hrushevsky Street. There  I photographed the fighters against a black curtain  a curtain that obscured the highly seductive and visual backdrop of fire  ice and smoke. In order to tell the individual human stories here  I felt that I needed to remove the dramatic visuals that had become so familiar and repetitive within the mainstream media. What I was witnessing was not only news  but also history. With this realization  I was free from the photojournalistic conventions of the newspaper and the magazine. Oleg  Vasiliy and Maxim were all ordinary men  with ordinary lives from ordinary towns. But the elaborate costumes that they had bedecked themselves in were quite extraordinary. I say the word  costume  because these were not clothes that had been issued or coordinated by anyone. They were improvised uniforms made up of decommissioned military equipment  irregular combat fatigues and trophies taken from the police. I became interested in the way they were choosing to represent themselves  this outward expression of masculinity  the ideal of the warrior. I worked slowly  using an analog film camera with a manual focusing loop and a handheld light meter. The process is old fashioned. It gives me time to speak with each person and to look at them  in silence  while they look back at me. Rising tensions culminated in the worst day of violence on February     which became known as Bloody Thursday. Snipers  loyal to the government  started firing on the civilians and protesters on Institutskaya Street. Many were killed in a very short space of time. The reception of the Hotel Ukraine became a makeshift morgue. There were lines of bodies laid in the street. And there was blood all over the pavements. The following day  President Yanukovych fled Ukraine. In all  three months of protests resulted in more than     confirmed dead and many more missing. History unfolded quickly  but celebration remained elusive in Maidan. As the days passed in Kiev's central square  streams of armed fighters were joined by tens of thousands of ordinary people  filling the streets in an act of collective mourning. Many were women who often carried flowers that they had brought to lay as marks of respect for the dead. They came day after day and they covered the square with millions of flowers. Sadness enveloped Maidan. It was quiet and I could hear the birds singing. I hadn't heard that before. I stopped women as they approached the barricades to lay their tributes and asked to make their picture. Most women cried when I photographed them. On the first day  my fixer  Emine  and I cried with almost every woman who visited our studio. There had been such a noticeable absence of women up until that point. And the color of their pastel coats  their shiny handbags  and the bunches of red carnations  white tulips and yellow roses that they carried jarred with the blackened square and the blackened men who were encamped there. It is clear to me that these two sets of pictures don't make much sense without the other. They are about men and women and the way we are    not the way we look  but the way we are. They speak about different gender roles in conflict  not only in Maidan  and not only in Ukraine. Men fight most wars and women mourn them. If the men showed the ideal of the warrior  then the women showed the implications of such violence. When I made these pictures  I believed that I was documenting the end of violent events in Ukraine. But now I understand that it is a record of the beginning. Today  the death toll stands around        while hundreds of thousands have been displaced. I was in Ukraine again six weeks ago. In Maidan  the barricades have been dismantled  and the paving stones which were used as weapons during the protests replaced  so that traffic flows freely through the center of the square. The fighters  the women and the flowers are gone. A huge billboard depicting geese flying over a wheat field covers the burned out shell of the trade union's building and proclaims   Glory to Ukraine. Glory to heroes.  Thank you. Thank you. I have only got    minutes to explain something  that lasts for hours and days  so I'd better get started. Let's start with a clip from Al Jazeera's Listening Post. Richard Gizbert  Norway is a country that  gets relatively little media coverage. Even the elections this past week passed without much drama. And that's the Norwegian media in a nutshell  not much drama. A few years back  Norway's public TV channel NRK decided to broadcast live coverage of a seven hour train ride    seven hours of simple footage  a train rolling down the tracks. Norwegians  more than a million of them according to the ratings  loved it. A new kind of reality TV show was born  and it goes against all the rules of TV engagement. There is no story line  no script  no drama  no climax  and it's called Slow TV. For the past two months  Norwegians have been watching  a cruise ship's journey up the coast  and there's a lot of fog on that coast. Executives at Norway's National Broadcasting Service are now considering broadcasting a night of knitting nationwide. On the surface  it sounds boring  because it is  but something about this TV experiment has gripped Norwegians. So we sent the Listening Post's Marcela Pizarro to Oslo to find out what it is  but first a warning  Viewers may find some of the images in the following report disappointing. Thomas Hellum  And then follows an eight minute story on Al Jazeera about some strange TV programs in little Norway. Al Jazeera. CNN. How did we get there  We have to go back to       when one of my colleagues got a great idea. Where do you get your ideas  In the lunchroom. So he said  why don't we make a radio program marking the day of the German invasion of Norway in     . We tell the story at the exact time during the night. Wow. Brilliant idea  except this was just a couple of weeks before the invasion day. So we sat in our lunchroom and discussed what other stories can you tell as they evolve  What other things take a really long time  So one of us came up with a train. The Bergen Railway had its      year anniversary that year It goes from western Norway to eastern Norway  and it takes exactly the same time as it did    years ago  over seven hours.  Laughter  So we caught our commissioning editors  in Oslo  and we said  we want to make a documentary about the Bergen Railway  and we want to make it in full length  and the answer was   Yes  but how long will the program be    Oh   we said   full length.   Yes  but we mean the program.  And back and forth. Luckily for us  they met us with laughter  very  very good laughter  so one bright day in September  we started a program that we thought should be seven hours and four minutes. Actually  it turned out to be seven hours and    minutes due to a signal failure at the last station. We had four cameras  three of them pointing out to the beautiful nature. Some talking to the guests  some information. TH  And that's about it  but of course  also the     tunnels gave us the opportunity to do some archives. Narrator  in Norwegian   Then a bit of flirting while the food is digested. The last downhill stretch before we reach our destination. We pass Mj lfjell Station. Then a new tunnel. TH  And now we thought  yes  we have a brilliant program. It will fit for the       train spotters in Norway. We brought it on air in November     . But no  this was far more attractive. This is the five biggest TV channels in Norway on a normal Friday  and if you look at NRK  over here  look what happened when they put on the Bergen Railway show   .  million Norwegians watched part of this program. And another funny thing  When the host on our main channel  after they have got news for you  she said   And on our second channel  the train has now nearly reached Myrdal station.  Thousands of people just jumped on the train on our second channel like this.  Laughter  This was also a huge success in terms of social media. It was so nice to see all the thousands of Facebook and Twitter users discussing the same view  talking to each other as if they were on the same train together. And especially  I like this one. It's a    year old man. He's watched all the program  and at the end station  he rises up to pick up what he thinks is his luggage  and his head hit the curtain rod  and he realized he is in his own living room. So that's strong and living TV. Four hundred and thirty six minute by minute on a Friday night  and during that first night  the first Twitter message came  Why be a chicken  Why stop at     when you can expand that to        minute by minute  and do the iconic journey in Norway  the coastal ship journey Hurtigruten from Bergen to Kirkenes  almost       kilometers  covering most of our coast. It has     year old  very interesting history  and literally takes part in life and death along the coast. So just a week after the Bergen Railway  we called the Hurtigruten company and we started planning for our next show. We wanted to do something different. The Bergen Railway was a recorded program. So when we sat in our editing room  we watched this picture    it's all  l Station    we saw this journalist. We had called him  we had spoken to him  and when we left the station  he took this picture of us and he waved to the camera  and we thought  what if more people knew that we were on board that train  Would more people show up  What would it look like  So we decided our next project  it should be live. We wanted this picture of us on the fjord and on the screen at the same time. So this is not the first time NRK had been on board a ship. This is back in       when the technical managers have suits and ties and NRK rolled all its equipment on board a ship  and     meters out of the shore  transmitting the signal back  and in the machine room  they talked to the machine guy  and on the deck  they have splendid entertainment. So being on a ship   it's not the first time. But five and a half days in a row  and live  we wanted some help. And we asked our viewers out there  what do you want to see  What do you want us to film  How do you want this to look  Do you want us to make a website  What do you want on it  And we got some answers from you out there  and it helped us a very lot to build the program. So in June          of us went on board the Hurtigruten coastal ship and we set off. I have some really strong memories from that week  and it's all about people. This guy  for instance  he's head of research at the University in Troms  And I will show you a piece of cloth  this one. It's the other strong memory. It belongs to a guy called Erik Hansen. And it's people like those two who took a firm grip of our program  and together with thousands of others along the route  they made the program what it became. They made all the stories. This is Karl. He's in the ninth grade. It says   I will be a little late for school tomorrow.  He was supposed to be in the school at   a.m. He came at   a.m.  and he didn't get a note from his teacher  because the teacher had watched the program. How did we do this  Yes  we took a conference room on board the Hurtigruten. We turned it into a complete TV control room. We made it all work  of course  and then we took along    cameras. This is one of them. This is my sketch from February  and when you give this sketch to professional people in the Norwegian broadcasting company NRK  you get some cool stuff back. And with some very creative solutions. This is Norway's most important drill right now. It regulates the height of a bow camera in NRK's live production  one of    that capture great shots from the MS Nord Norge. Eight wires keep the camera stable. Cameraman  I work  on different camera solutions. They're just tools used in a different context. TH  Another camera is this one. It's normally used for sports. It made it possible for us to take close up pictures of people     kilomteres away  like this one.  Laughter  People called us and asked  how is this man doing  He's doing fine. Everything went well. We also could take pictures of people waving at us  people along the route  thousands of them  and they all had a phone in their hand. And when you take a picture of them  and they get the message   Now we are on TV  dad   they start waving back. This was waving TV  for five and a half days  and people get so extremely happy when they can send a warm message to their loved ones. It was also a great success on social media. On the last day  we met Her Majesty the Queen of Norway  and Twitter couldn't quite handle it. And we also  on the web  during this week we streamed more than     years of video to     nations  and the websites are still there and they will be forever  actually  because Hurtigruten was selected to be part of the Norwegian UNESCO list of documents  and it's also in the Guinness Book of Records as the longest documentary ever. Thank you. But it's a long program  so some watched part of it  like the Prime Minister. Some watched a little bit more. It says   I haven't used my bed for five days.  And he's    years old  and he hardly slept. He kept watching because something might happen  though it probably won't.  Laughter  This is the number of viewers along the route. You can see the famous Trollfjord and a day after  all time high for NRK . If you see the four biggest channels in Norway during June       they will look like this  and as a TV producer  it's a pleasure to put Hurtigruten on top of it. It looks like this   .  million Norwegians watched part of this program  and we are only five million here. Even the passengers on board the Hurtigruten coastal ship    they chose to watched the telly instead of turning    degrees and watching out the window. So we were allowed to be  part of people's living room with this strange TV program  with music  nature  people. And Slow TV was now a buzzword  and we started looking for other things we could make Slow TV about. So we could either take something long and make it a topic  like with the railway and the Hurtigruten  or we could take a topic and make it long. This is the last project. It's the peep show. It's    hours of birdwatching on a TV screen  actually    days on the web. We have made    hours of live salmon fishing. It actually took three hours before we got the first fish  and that's quite slow. We have made    hours of boat ride into the beautiful Telemark Canal  and we have made another train ride with the northern railway  and because this we couldn't do live  we did it in four seasons just to give the viewer another experience on the way. So our next project got us some attention outside Norway. This is from the Colbert Report on Comedy Central. called  National Firewood Night   which consisted of mostly people in parkas chatting and chopping in the woods  and then eight hours of a fire  burning in a fireplace.  Laughter  It destroyed the other  top Norwegian shows  like  So You Think You Can Watch Paint Dry  and  The Amazing Glacier Race.  And get this  almost    percent of the Norwegian population tuned in     percent. TH  So  when wood fire and wood chopping can be that interesting  why not knitting  So on our next project  we used more than eight hours to go live from a sheep to a sweater  and Jimmy Kimmel in the ABC show  he liked that. and after all that  the knitters actually failed to break the world record. They did not succeed  but remember the old Norwegian saying  it's not whether you win or lose that counts. In fact  nothing counts   and death is coming for us all. TH  Exactly. So why does this stand out  This is so completely different to other TV programming. We take the viewer on a journey that happens right now in real time  and the viewer gets the feeling of actually being there  actually being on the train  on the boat  and knitting together with others  and the reason I think why they're doing that is because we don't edit the timeline. It's important that we don't edit the timeline  and it's also important that what we make Slow TV about is something that we all can relate to  that the viewer can relate to  and that somehow has  a root in our culture. This is a picture from last summer when we traveled the coast again for seven weeks. And of course this is a lot of planning  this is a lot of logistics. So this is the working plan for     people last summer  but more important is what you don't plan. You don't plan what's going to happen. You have to just take your cameras with you. It's like a sports event. You rig them and you see what's happening. So this is actually the whole running order for Hurtigruten      hours  just written on one page. We didn't know anything more when we left Bergen. So you have to let the viewers make the stories themselves  and I'll give you an example of that. This is from last summer  and as a TV producer  it's a nice picture  but now you can cut to the next one. But this is Slow TV  so you have to keep this picture until  it really starts hurting your stomach  and then you keep it a little bit longer  and when you keep it that long  I'm sure some of you now have noticed the cow. Some of you have seen the flag. Some of you start wondering  is the farmer at home  Has he left  Is he watching the cow  And where is that cow going  So my point is  the longer you keep a picture like this  and we kept it for    minutes  you start making the stories in your own head. That's Slow TV. So we think that Slow TV is one nice way of telling a TV story  and we think that we can continue doing it  not too often  once or twice a year  so we keep the feeling of an event  and we also think that the good Slow TV idea  that's the idea when people say   Oh no  you can't put that on TV.  When people smile  it might be a very good slow idea  so after all  life is best when it's a bit strange. Thank you. The shocking police crackdown on protestors in Ferguson  Missouri  in the wake of the police  shooting of Michael Brown  underscored the extent to which advanced military weapons and equipment  designed for the battlefield  are making their way to small town police departments across the United States. Although much tougher to observe  this same thing is happening  with surveillance equipment. NSA style mass  surveillance is enabling local police departments  to gather vast quantities of sensitive information about each and every one of us in a way that was never previously possible. Location information can  be very sensitive. If you drive your car around the United States  it can reveal if you go  to a therapist  attend an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting  if you go to church  or if you don't go to church. And when that  information about you is combined with the same information about everyone else  the government can gain  a detailed portrait of how private citizens interact. This information used to be private. Thanks to modern technology  the government knows far too much about what happens behind closed doors. And local police departments make decisions about who they think you are based on this information. One of the key technologies  driving mass location tracking is the innocuous sounding Automatic License Plate Reader. If you haven't seen one  it's probably because you didn't know what to look for    they're everywhere. Mounted on roads or  on police cars  Automatic License Plate Readers capture images of every passing car and convert the license plate into machine readable text so that they can be checked against hot lists of cars potentially wanted for wrongdoing. But more than that  increasingly  local police departments  are keeping records not just of people wanted for wrongdoing  but of every plate that  passes them by  resulting in the collection of mass quantities of data about where Americans have gone. Did you know this was happening  When Mike Katz Lacabe asked his local police department for information about the plate reader data they had on him  this is what they got  in addition to the date   time and location  the police department had  photographs that captured where he was going and  often who he was with. The second photo from the top is a picture of Mike and his two daughters getting out of their car in their own driveway. The government has  hundreds of photos like this about Mike going about his daily life. And if you drive a car  in the United States  I would bet money  that they have photographs like this of you going about your daily life. Mike hasn't done anything wrong. Why is it okay that the government is keeping all of this information  The reason it's happening is because  as the cost of storing this data has plummeted  the police departments simply hang on to it  just in case it could be useful someday. The issue is not just that one police department is gathering this information in isolation or even that multiple police  departments are doing it. At the same time  the federal government is collecting all of these individual pots of data  and pooling them together  into one vast database with hundreds of millions of hits  showing where Americans have traveled. This document from the  Federal Drug Enforcement Administration  which is one of the agencies primarily interested in this  is one of several that reveal  the existence of this database. Meanwhile  in New York City  the NYPD has driven police cars equipped with license plate readers past mosques in order to figure out who is attending. The uses and abuses of this technology aren't limited to the United States. In the U.K.  the police department put    year old John Kat on a plate reader watch list after he had attended dozens of lawful political demonstrations where he liked to sit on a bench and sketch the attendees. License plate readers aren't the only mass location tracking technology available to law enforcement agents today. Through a technique known as a cell tower dump  law enforcement agents can uncover who was using one or more cell towers at a particular time  a technique which has been known to reveal the location of tens of thousands and even hundreds of thousands of people. Also  using a device known as a StingRay  law enforcement agents can send tracking signals inside people's houses to identify the cell phones located there. And if they don't know which house to target  they've been known  to drive this technology around through whole neighborhoods. Just as the police in Ferguson possess high tech military weapons and equipment  so too do police departments across the United States possess high tech surveillance gear. Just because you don't see it  doesn't mean it's not there. The question is  what should we do about this  I think this poses a serious civil liberties threat. History has shown that once the police  have massive quantities of data  tracking the movements of innocent people  it gets abused  maybe for blackmail  maybe for political advantage  or maybe for simple voyeurism. Fortunately  there are steps we can take. Local police departments can  be governed by the city councils  which can pass laws requiring the police to dispose of the data  about innocent people while allowing the legitimate uses of the technology to go forward. Thank you. When we think about mapping cities  we tend to think about roads and streets and buildings  and the settlement narrative that led to their creation  or you might think about the bold vision of an urban designer  but there's other ways to think about mapping cities and how they got to be made. Today  I want to show you a new kind of map. This is not a geographic map. This is a map of the relationships  between people in my hometown of Baltimore  Maryland  and what you can see here is that each dot represents a person  each line represents a relationship between those people  and each color represents a community within the network. Now  I'm here on the green side  down on the far right where the geeks are  and TEDx also is down  on the far right.  Laughter  Now  on the other side of the network  you tend to have primarily African American and Latino folks who are really concerned about somewhat different things than the geeks are  but just to give some sense  the green part of the network  we call Smalltimore  for those of us that inhabit it  because it seems as though we're living in a very small town. We see the same people over and over again  but that's because we're not really exploring the full depth and breadth of the city. On the other end of the network  you have folks who are interested in things like hip hop music and they even identify with living in the DC Maryland Virginia area over  say  the Baltimore city designation proper. But in the middle  you see that there's something that connects the two communities together  and that's sports. We have the Baltimore Orioles  the Baltimore Ravens football team  Michael Phelps  the Olympian. Under Armour  you may have heard of  is a Baltimore company  and that community of sports acts as the only bridge between these two ends of the network. Let's take a look at San Francisco. You see something a little bit different happening in San Francisco. On the one hand  you do have the media  politics and news lobe that tends to exist in Baltimore and other cities  but you also have this very predominant group of geeks and techies that are sort of taking over the top half of the network  and there's even a group that's so distinct and clear that we can identify it as Twitter employees  next to the geeks  in between the gamers and the geeks  at the opposite end of the hip hop spectrum. So you can see  though  that the tensions that we've heard about in San Francisco in terms of people being concerned about gentrification and all the new tech companies that are bringing new wealth and settlement into the city are real  and you can actually see that documented here. You can see the LGBT community is not really getting along with the geek community that well  the arts community  the music community. And so it leads to things like this.   Evict Twitter   Somebody sent me this photo a few weeks ago  and it shows what is happening on the ground in San Francisco  and I think you can actually try to understand that through looking at a map like this. Let's take a look at Rio de Janeiro. I spent the last few weeks gathering data about Rio  and one of the things that stood out to me about this city is that everything's really kind of mixed up. It's a very heterogenous city in a way  that Baltimore or San Francisco is not. You still have the lobe of people involved with government  newspapers  politics  columnists. TEDxRio is down in the lower right  right next to bloggers and writers. But then you also have this tremendous diversity of people that are interested in different kinds of music. Even Justin Bieber fans are represented here. Other boy bands  country singers  gospel music  funk and rap and stand up comedy  and there's even a whole section around drugs and jokes. How cool is that  And then the Flamengo football team is also represented here. So you have that same kind of spread of sports and civics and the arts and music  but it's represented in a very different way  and I think that maybe fits with our understanding of Rio as being a very multicultural  musically diverse city. So we have all this data. It's an incredibly rich set of data that we have about cities now  maybe even richer than any data set that we've ever had before. So what can we do with it  Well  I think the first thing that we can try to understand is that segregation is a social construct. It's something that we choose to do  and we could choose not to do it  and if you kind of think about it  what we're doing with this data is aiming a space telescope at a city and looking at it as if was a giant high school cafeteria  and seeing how everybody arranged themselves in a seating chart. Well maybe it's time to shake up the seating chart a little bit. The other thing that we start to realize is that race is a really poor proxy for diversity. We've got people represented from all different types of races across the entire map here    only looking at race doesn't really contribute to our development of diversity. So if we're trying to use diversity as a way to tackle some of our more intractable problems  we need to start to think  about diversity in a new way. And lastly  we have the ability to create interventions to start to reshape our cities in a new way  and I believe that if we have that capability  we may even bear some responsibility to do so. So what is a city  I think some might say that it is a geographical area or a collection of streets and buildings  but I believe that a city  is the sum of the relationships of the people that live there  and I believe that if we can start to document those relationships in a real way then maybe we have a real shot at creating those kinds of cities that we'd like to have. Thank you. I was on a long road trip this summer  and I was having a wonderful time listening to the amazing Isabel Wilkerson's  The Warmth of Other Suns.  It documents six million black folks fleeing the South from      to      looking for a respite from all the brutality and trying to get to a better opportunity up North  and it was filled with stories of the resilience and the brilliance of African Americans  and it was also really hard to hear all the stories of the horrors and the humility  and all the humiliations. It was especially hard to hear about the beatings and the burnings and the lynchings of black men. And I said   You know  this is a little deep. I need a break. I'm going to turn on the radio.  I turned it on  and there it was  Ferguson  Missouri  Michael Brown     year old black man  unarmed  shot by a white police officer  laid on the ground dead  blood running for four hours while his grandmother and little children and his neighbors watched in horror  and I thought  here it is again. This violence  this brutality against black men has been going on for centuries. I mean  it's the same story. It's just different names. It could have been Amadou Diallo. It could have been Sean Bell. It could have been Oscar Grant. It could have been Trayvon Martin. This violence  this brutality  is really something that's part of our national psyche. It's part of our collective history. What are we going to do about it  You know that part of us that still crosses the street  locks the doors  clutches the purses  when we see young black men  That part. I mean  I know we're not shooting people down in the street  but I'm saying that the same stereotypes and prejudices that fuel those kinds of tragic incidents are in us. We've been schooled in them as well. I believe that we can stop these types of incidents  these Fergusons from happening  by looking within and being willing to change ourselves. So I have a call to action for you. There are three things that I want to offer us today to think about as ways to stop Ferguson from happening again  three things that I think will help us reform our images of young black men  three things that I'm hoping will not only protect them but will open the world so that they can thrive. Can you imagine that  Can you imagine our country embracing young black men  seeing them as part of our future  giving them that kind of openness  that kind of grace we give to people we love  How much better would our lives be  How much better would our country be  Let me just start with number one. We gotta get out of denial. Stop trying to be good people. We need real people. You know  I do a lot of diversity work  and people will come up to me at the beginning of the workshop. They're like   Oh  Ms. Diversity Lady  we're so glad you're here      but we don't have a biased bone  in our body.  And I'm like   Really  Because I do this work every day  and I see all my biases.  I mean  not too long ago  I was on a plane and I heard the voice of a woman pilot coming over the P.A. system  and I was just so excited  so thrilled. I was like   Yes  women  we are rocking it. We are now in the stratosphere.  It was all good  and then it started getting turbulent and bumpy  and I was like   I hope she can drive.  I know. Right. But it's not even like I knew that was a bias until I was coming back on the other leg and there's always a guy driving and it's often turbulent and bumpy  and I've never questioned the confidence of the male driver. The pilot is good. Now  here's the problem. If you ask me explicitly  I would say   Female pilot  awesome.  But it appears that when things get funky and a little troublesome  a little risky  I lean on a bias that I didn't even know that I had. You know  fast moving planes in the sky  I want a guy. That's my default. Men are my default. Who is your default  Who do you trust  Who are you afraid of  Who do you implicitly feel connected to  Who do you run away from  I'm going to tell you what we have learned. The implicit association test  which measures unconscious bias  you can go online and take it. Five million people have taken it. Turns out  our default is white. We like white people. We prefer white. What do I mean by that  When people are shown images  of black men and white men  we are more quickly able to associate that picture with a positive word  that white person with a positive word  than we are when we are  trying to associate positive with a black face  and vice versa. When we see a black face  it is easier for us to connect black with negative than it is white with negative. Seventy percent of white people taking that test prefer white. Fifty percent of black people taking that test prefer white. You see  we were all outside when the contamination came down. What do we do about the fact that our brain automatically associates  You know  one of the things that you probably are thinking about  and you're probably like  you know what  I'm just going to double down on my color blindness. Yes  I'm going to recommit to that. I'm going to suggest to you  no. We've gone about as far as we can go trying to make a difference trying to not see color. The problem was never that we saw color. It was what we did when we saw the color. It's a false ideal. And while we're busy  pretending not to see  we are not being aware of the ways in which racial difference is changing people's possibilities  that's keeping them from thriving  and sometimes it's causing them an early death. So in fact  what the scientists are telling us is  no way. Don't even think about color blindness. In fact  what they're suggesting is  stare at awesome black people. Look at them directly in their faces and memorize them  because when we look at awesome folks who are black  it helps to dissociate the association that happens automatically in our brain. Why do you think I'm showing you these beautiful black men behind me  There were so many  I had to cut them. Okay  so here's the thing  I'm trying to reset your automatic associations about who black men are. I'm trying to remind you that young black men grow up to be amazing human beings who have changed our lives and made them better. So here's the thing. The other possibility in science  and it's only temporarily changing our automatic assumptions  but one thing we know is that if you take a white person who is odious that you know  and stick it up next to a person of color  a black person  who is fabulous  then that sometimes actually causes us to disassociate too. So think Jeffrey Dahmer and Colin Powell. Just stare at them  right   Laughter  But these are the things. So go looking for your bias. Please  please  just get out of denial and go looking for disconfirming data that will prove that in fact your old stereotypes are wrong. Okay  so that's number one  number two  what I'm going to say is move toward young black men instead of away from them. It's not the hardest thing to do  but it's also one of these things where you have to be conscious  and intentional about it. You know  I was in a Wall Street area  one time several years ago when I was with a colleague of mine  and she's really wonderful and she does diversity work with me and she's a woman of color  she's Korean. And we were outside  it was late at night  and we were sort of wondering where we were going  we were lost. And I saw this person across the street  and I was thinking   Oh great  black guy.  I was going toward him without even thinking about it. And she was like   Oh  that's interesting.  The guy across the street  he was a black guy. I think black guys generally know where they're going. I don't know why exactly I think that  but that's what I think. So she was saying   Oh  you were going  'Yay  a black guy'   She said   I was going  'Ooh  a black guy.'  Other direction. Same need  same guy  same clothes  same time  same street  different reaction. And she said   I feel so bad. I'm a diversity consultant. I did the black guy thing. I'm a woman of color. Oh my God   And I said   You know what  Please. We really need to relax about this.  I mean  you've got to realize I go way back with black guys. My dad is a black guy. You see what I'm saying  I've got a  '   black guy son. I was married to a black guy. My black guy thing is so wide and so deep that I can pretty much sort and figure out who that black guy is  and he was my black guy. He said   Yes  ladies  I know where you're going. I'll take you there.  You know  biases are the stories we make up about people before we know who they actually are. But how are we going to know who they are when we've been told to avoid and be afraid of them  So I'm going to tell you to walk toward your discomfort. And I'm not asking you to take any crazy risks. I'm saying  just do an inventory  expand your social and professional circles. Who's in your circle  Who's missing  How many authentic relationships do you have with young black people  folks  men  women  Or any other major difference from who you are and how you roll  so to speak  Because  you know what  Just look around your periphery. There may be somebody at work  in your classroom  in your house of worship  somewhere  there's some black young guy there. And you're nice. You say hi. I'm saying go deeper  closer  further  and build the kinds of relationships  the kinds of friendships that actually cause you to see the holistic person and to really go against the stereotypes. I know some of you are out there  I know because I have some white friends in particular that will say   You have no idea how awkward I am. Like  I don't think this is going to work for me. I'm sure I'm going to blow this.  Okay  maybe  but this thing is not  about perfection. It's about connection. And you're not going to get comfortable before you get uncomfortable. I mean  you just have to do it. And young black men  what I'm saying is if someone comes your way  genuinely and authentically  take the invitation. Not everyone is out to get you. Go looking for those people who can see your humanity. You know  it's the empathy and the compassion that comes out of having relationships with people who are different from you. Something really powerful and beautiful happens  you start to realize that they are you  that they are part of you  that they are you in your family  and then we cease to be bystanders and we become actors  we become advocates  and we become allies. So go away from your comfort into a bigger  brighter thing  because that is how we will stop another Ferguson from happening. That's how we create a community where everybody  especially young black men  can thrive. So this last thing is going to be harder  and I know it  but I'm just going to put it out there anyway. When we see something  we have to have the courage to say something  even to the people we love. You know  it's holidays and it's going to be a time when we're sitting around the table and having a good time. Many of us  anyways  will be in holidays  and you've got to listen to the conversations around the table. You start to say things like   Grandma's a bigot.   Uncle Joe is racist.  And you know  we love Grandma and we love Uncle Joe. We do. We know they're good people  but what they're saying is wrong. And we need to be able to say something  because you know who else is at the table  The children are at the table. And we wonder why these biases don't die  and move from generation to generation  Because we're not saying anything. We've got to be willing to say   Grandma  we don't call people that anymore.   Uncle Joe  it isn't true that he deserved that. No one deserves that.  And we've got to be willing to not shelter our children from the ugliness of racism when black parents don't have the luxury to do so  especially those who have  young black sons. We've got to take  our lovely darlings  our future  and we've got to tell them we have  an amazing country with incredible ideals  we have worked incredibly hard  and we have made some progress  but we are not done. We still have in us this old stuff about superiority and it is causing us to embed those further into our institutions and our society and generations  and it is making for despair and disparities and a devastating devaluing of young black men. We still struggle  you have to tell them  with seeing both the color and the character of young black men  but that you  and you expect them  to be part of the forces of change in this society that will stand against injustice and is willing  above all other things  to make a society where young black men  can be seen for all of who they are. So many amazing black men  those who are the most amazing statesmen that have ever lived  brave soldiers  awesome  hardworking laborers. These are people who are powerful preachers. They are incredible scientists and artists and writers. They are dynamic comedians. They are doting grandpas  caring sons. They are strong fathers  and they are young men with dreams of their own. Thank you. It used to be that if you wanted to get a computer to do something new  you would have to program it. Now  programming  for those of you here that haven't done it yourself  requires laying out in excruciating detail every single step that you want the computer to do in order to achieve your goal. Now  if you want to do something that you don't know how to do yourself  then this is going to be a great challenge. So this was the challenge faced by this man  Arthur Samuel. In       he wanted to get this computer to be able to beat him at checkers. How can you write a program  lay out in excruciating detail  how to be better than you at checkers  So he came up with an idea  he had the computer play against itself thousands of times and learn how to play checkers. And indeed it worked  and in fact  by       this computer had beaten the Connecticut state champion. So Arthur Samuel was the father of machine learning  and I have a great debt to him  because I am a machine learning practitioner. I was the president of Kaggle  a community of over         machine learning practictioners. Kaggle puts up competitions to try and get them to solve previously unsolved problems  and it's been successful  hundreds of times. So from this vantage point  I was able to find out a lot about what machine learning can do in the past  can do today  and what it could do in the future. Perhaps the first big success of  machine learning commercially was Google. Google showed that it is possible to find information by using a computer algorithm  and this algorithm is based on machine learning. Since that time  there have been many commercial successes of machine learning. Companies like Amazon and Netflix use machine learning to suggest products that you might like to buy  movies that you might like to watch. Sometimes  it's almost creepy. Companies like LinkedIn and Facebook sometimes will tell you about who your friends might be and you have no idea how it did it  and this is because it's using the power of machine learning. These are algorithms that have learned how to do this from data rather than being programmed by hand. This is also how IBM was successful in getting Watson to beat the two world champions at  Jeopardy   answering incredibly subtle and complex questions like this one.   The ancient 'Lion of Nimrud' went missing from this city's national museum in        along with a lot of other stuff    This is also why we are now able to see the first self driving cars. If you want to be able to tell the difference between  say  a tree and a pedestrian  well  that's pretty important. We don't know how to write those programs by hand  but with machine learning  this is now possible. And in fact  this car has driven  over a million miles without any accidents on regular roads. So we now know that computers can learn  and computers can learn to do things that we actually sometimes don't know how to do ourselves  or maybe can do them better than us. One of the most amazing examples I've seen of machine learning happened on a project that I ran at Kaggle where a team run by a guy called Geoffrey Hinton from the University of Toronto won a competition for automatic drug discovery. Now  what was extraordinary here is not just that they beat all of the algorithms developed by Merck or the international academic community  but nobody on the team had any background in chemistry or biology or life sciences  and they did it in two weeks. How did they do this  They used an extraordinary algorithm called deep learning. So important was this that in fact the success was covered in The New York Times in a front page article a few weeks later. This is Geoffrey Hinton here on the left hand side. Deep learning is an algorithm inspired by how the human brain works  and as a result it's an algorithm which has no theoretical limitations on what it can do. The more data you give it and the more computation time you give it  the better it gets. The New York Times also showed in this article another extraordinary result of deep learning which I'm going to show you now. It shows that computers  can listen and understand. that I want to be able to take in this process is to actually speak to you in Chinese. Now the key thing there is  we've been able to take a large amount  of information from many Chinese speakers and produce a text to speech system that takes Chinese text and converts it into Chinese language  and then we've taken an hour or so of my own voice and we've used that to modulate the standard text to speech system so that it would sound like me. Again  the result's not perfect. There are in fact quite a few errors. There's much work to be done in this area. Jeremy Howard  Well  that was at a machine learning conference in China. It's not often  actually  at academic conferences that you do hear spontaneous applause  although of course sometimes at TEDx conferences  feel free. Everything you saw there was happening with deep learning. The transcription in English was deep learning. The translation to Chinese and the text in the top right  deep learning  and the construction of the voice was deep learning as well. So deep learning is this extraordinary thing. It's a single algorithm that can seem to do almost anything  and I discovered that a year earlier  it had also learned to see. In this obscure competition from Germany called the German Traffic Sign  Recognition Benchmark  deep learning had learned to recognize traffic signs like this one. Not only could it recognize the traffic signs better than any other algorithm  the leaderboard actually showed it was better than people  about twice as good as people. So by       we had the first example of computers that can see better than people. Since that time  a lot has happened. In       Google announced that they had a deep learning algorithm watch YouTube videos and crunched the data on        computers for a month  and the computer independently learned about concepts such as people and cats just by watching the videos. This is much like the way that humans learn. Humans don't learn by being told what they see  but by learning for themselves what these things are. Also in       Geoffrey Hinton  who we saw earlier  won the very popular ImageNet competition  looking to try to figure out  from one and a half million images what they're pictures of. As of       we're now down to a six percent error rate in image recognition. This is better than people  again. So machines really are doing an extraordinarily good job of this  and it is now being used in industry. For example  Google announced last year that they had mapped every single location in France in two hours  and the way they did it was that they fed street view images into a deep learning algorithm to recognize and read street numbers. Imagine how long it would have taken before  dozens of people  many years. This is also happening in China. Baidu is kind of  the Chinese Google  I guess  and what you see here in the top left is an example of a picture that I uploaded to Baidu's deep learning system  and underneath you can see that the system has understood what that picture is and found similar images. The similar images actually have similar backgrounds  similar directions of the faces  even some with their tongue out. This is not clearly looking at the text of a web page. All I uploaded was an image. So we now have computers which really understand what they see and can therefore search databases of hundreds of millions of images in real time. So what does it mean now that computers can see  Well  it's not just  that computers can see. In fact  deep learning has done more than that. Complex  nuanced sentences like this one are now understandable with deep learning algorithms. As you can see here  this Stanford based system showing the red dot at the top has figured out that this sentence is expressing negative sentiment. Deep learning now in fact is near human performance at understanding what sentences are about and what it is saying about those things. Also  deep learning has been used to read Chinese  again at about native Chinese speaker level. This algorithm developed out of Switzerland by people  none of whom speak or understand any Chinese. As I say  using deep learning is about the best system in the world for this  even compared to native human understanding. This is a system that we put together at my company which shows putting all this stuff together. These are pictures which have no text attached  and as I'm typing in here sentences  in real time it's understanding these pictures and figuring out what they're about and finding pictures that are similar to the text that I'm writing. So you can see  it's actually understanding my sentences and actually understanding these pictures. I know that you've seen something like this on Google  where you can type in things and it will show you pictures  but actually what it's doing is it's searching the webpage for the text. This is very different from actually understanding the images. This is something that computers have only been able to do for the first time in the last few months. So we can see now that computers can not only see but they can also read  and  of course  we've shown that they can understand what they hear. Perhaps not surprising now that I'm going to tell you they can write. Here is some text that I generated using a deep learning algorithm yesterday. And here is some text that an algorithm out of Stanford generated. Each of these sentences was generated by a deep learning algorithm to describe each of those pictures. This algorithm before has never seen a man in a black shirt playing a guitar. It's seen a man before  it's seen black before  it's seen a guitar before  but it has independently generated this novel description of this picture. We're still not quite at human performance here  but we're close. In tests  humans prefer the computer generated caption one out of four times. Now this system is now only two weeks old  so probably within the next year  the computer algorithm will be well past human performance at the rate things are going. So computers can also write. So we put all this together and it leads to very exciting opportunities. For example  in medicine  a team in Boston announced that they had discovered dozens of new clinically relevant features of tumors which help doctors make a prognosis of a cancer. Very similarly  in Stanford  a group there announced that  looking at tissues under magnification  they've developed  a machine learning based system which in fact is better than human pathologists at predicting survival rates for cancer sufferers. In both of these cases  not only were the predictions more accurate  but they generated new insightful science. In the radiology case  they were new clinical indicators that humans can understand. In this pathology case  the computer system actually discovered that the cells around the cancer are as important as the cancer cells themselves in making a diagnosis. This is the opposite of what pathologists had been taught for decades. In each of those two cases  they were systems developed by a combination of medical experts and machine learning experts  but as of last year  we're now beyond that too. This is an example of identifying cancerous areas of human tissue under a microscope. The system being shown here can identify those areas more accurately  or about as accurately  as human pathologists  but was built entirely with deep learning using no medical expertise by people who have no background in the field. Similarly  here  this neuron segmentation. We can now segment neurons about as accurately as humans can  but this system was developed with deep learning using people with no previous  background in medicine. So myself  as somebody with no previous background in medicine  I seem to be entirely well qualified to start a new medical company  which I did. I was kind of terrified of doing it  but the theory seemed to suggest that it ought to be possible to do very useful medicine using just these data analytic techniques. And thankfully  the feedback has been fantastic  not just from the media but from the medical community  who have been very supportive. The theory is that we can take the middle part of the medical process and turn that into data analysis as much as possible  leaving doctors to do what they're best at. I want to give you an example. It now takes us about    minutes to generate a new medical diagnostic test and I'll show you that in real time now  but I've compressed it down to  three minutes by cutting some pieces out. Rather than showing you creating a medical diagnostic test  I'm going to show you  a diagnostic test of car images  because that's something we can all understand. So here we're starting with  about  .  million car images  and I want to create something that can split them into the angle of the photo that's being taken. So these images are entirely unlabeled  so I have to start from scratch. With our deep learning algorithm  it can automatically identify areas of structure in these images. So the nice thing is that the human and the computer can now work together. So the human  as you can see here  is telling the computer about areas of interest which it wants the computer then to try and use to improve its algorithm. Now  these deep learning systems actually are in        dimensional space  so you can see here the computer rotating this through that space  trying to find new areas of structure. And when it does so successfully  the human who is driving it can then point out the areas that are interesting. So here  the computer has successfully found areas  for example  angles. So as we go through this process  we're gradually telling the computer more and more about the kinds of structures we're looking for. You can imagine in a diagnostic test this would be a pathologist identifying areas of pathosis  for example  or a radiologist indicating potentially troublesome nodules. And sometimes it can be difficult for the algorithm. In this case  it got kind of confused. The fronts and the backs of the cars are all mixed up. So here we have to be a bit more careful  manually selecting these fronts as opposed to the backs  then telling the computer that this is a type of group that we're interested in. So we do that for a while  we skip over a little bit  and then we train the machine learning algorithm based on these couple of hundred things  and we hope that it's gotten a lot better. You can see  it's now started to fade some of these pictures out  showing us that it already is recognizing how to understand some of these itself. We can then use this concept of similar images  and using similar images  you can now see  the computer at this point is able to entirely find just the fronts of cars. So at this point  the human can tell the computer  okay  yes  you've done a good job of that. Sometimes  of course  even at this point it's still difficult to separate out groups. In this case  even after we let the computer try to rotate this for a while  we still find that the left sides and the right sides pictures are all mixed up together. So we can again give the computer some hints  and we say  okay  try and find a projection that separates out the left sides and the right sides as much as possible using this deep learning algorithm. And giving it that hint    ah  okay  it's been successful. It's managed to find a way of thinking about these objects that's separated out these together. So you get the idea here. This is a case not where the human is being replaced by a computer  but where they're working together. What we're doing here is we're replacing something that used to take a team of five or six people about seven years and replacing it with something that takes    minutes for one person acting alone. So this process takes about four or five iterations. You can see we now have    percent of our  .  million images  classified correctly. And at this point  we can start to quite quickly grab whole big sections  check through them to make sure that there's no mistakes. Where there are mistakes  we can let the computer know about them. And using this kind of process for each of the different groups  we are now up to an    percent success rate in classifying the  .  million images. And at this point  it's just a case of finding the small number that aren't classified correctly  and trying to understand why. And using that approach  by    minutes we get to    percent classification rates. So this kind of technique could allow us to fix a major problem  which is that there's a lack of medical expertise in the world. The World Economic Forum says that there's between a   x and a   x shortage of physicians in the developing world  and it would take about     years to train enough people to fix that problem. So imagine if we can help enhance their efficiency using these deep learning approaches  So I'm very excited about the opportunities. I'm also concerned about the problems. The problem here is that every area in blue on this map is somewhere where services are over    percent of employment. What are services  These are services. These are also the exact things that computers have just learned how to do. So    percent of the world's employment in the developed world is stuff that computers  have just learned how to do. What does that mean  Well  it'll be fine. They'll be replaced by other jobs. For example  there will be more jobs for data scientists. Well  not really. It doesn't take data scientists  very long to build these things. For example  these four algorithms were all built by the same guy. So if you think  oh   it's all happened before  we've seen the results in the past of when new things come along and they get replaced by new jobs  what are these new jobs going to be  It's very hard for us to estimate this  because human performance grows at this gradual rate  but we now have a system  deep learning  that we know actually grows in capability exponentially. And we're here. So currently  we see the things around us and we say   Oh  computers are still pretty dumb.  Right  But in five years' time  computers will be off this chart. So we need to be starting to think about this capability right now. We have seen this once before  of course. In the Industrial Revolution  we saw a step change in capability thanks to engines. The thing is  though  that after a while  things flattened out. There was social disruption  but once engines were used  to generate power in all the situations  things really settled down. The Machine Learning Revolution is going to be very different from the Industrial Revolution  because the Machine Learning Revolution  it never settles down. The better computers get at intellectual activities  the more they can build better computers to be better at intellectual capabilities  so this is going to be a kind of change that the world has actually never experienced before  so your previous understanding of what's possible is different. This is already impacting us. In the last    years  as capital productivity has increased  labor productivity has been flat  in fact even a little bit down. So I want us to start having this discussion now. I know that when I often tell people about this situation  people can be quite dismissive. Well  computers can't really think  they don't emote  they don't understand poetry  we don't really understand how they work. So what  Computers right now can do the things that humans spend most of their time being paid to do  so now's the time to start thinking about how we're going to adjust our social structures and economic structures to be aware of this new reality. Thank you. The power of yet. I heard about a high school in Chicago where students had to pass a certain number of courses to graduate  and if they didn't pass a course  they got the grade  Not Yet.  And I thought that was fantastic  because if you get a failing grade  you think  I'm nothing  I'm nowhere. But if you get the grade  Not Yet  you understand that you're on a learning curve. It gives you a path into the future.  Not Yet  also gave me insight into a critical event early in my career  a real turning point. I wanted to see how children coped  with challenge and difficulty  so I gave    year olds problems that were slightly too hard for them. Some of them reacted in a shockingly positive way. They said things like   I love a challenge   or   You know  I was hoping this would be informative.  They understood that their abilities could be developed. They had what I call a growth mindset. But other students felt it was tragic  catastrophic. From their more fixed mindset perspective  their intelligence had been  up for judgment and they failed. Instead of luxuriating in the power of yet  they were gripped in the tyranny of now. So what do they do next  I'll tell you what they do next. In one study  they told us they would probably cheat the next time instead of studying more if they failed a test. In another study  after a failure  they looked for someone who did worse than they did so they could feel really good about themselves. And in study after study  they have run from difficulty. Scientists measured the electrical activity from the brain as students confronted an error. On the left  you see the fixed mindset students. There's hardly any activity. They run from the error. They don't engage with it. But on the right  you have the students with the growth mindset  the idea that abilities can be developed. They engage deeply. Their brain is on fire with yet. They engage deeply. They process the error. They learn from it and they correct it. How are we raising our children  Are we raising them for now instead of yet  Are we raising kids who are obsessed with getting A's  Are we raising kids who don't know how to dream big dreams  Their biggest goal is getting the next A or the next test score  And are they carrying this need for constant validation with them into their future lives  Maybe  because employers are coming to me and saying  we have already raised a generation of young workers who can't get through the day without an award. So what can we do  How can we build that bridge to yet  Here are some things we can do. First of all  we can praise wisely  not praising intelligence or talent. That has failed. Don't do that anymore. But praising the process that kids engage in  their effort  their strategies  their focus  their perseverance  their improvement. This process praise creates kids who are hardy and resilient. There are other ways to reward yet. We recently teamed up with game scientists from the University of Washington to create a new online math game that rewarded yet. In this game  students were rewarded for effort  strategy and progress. The usual math game rewards you for getting answers right right now  but this game rewarded process. And we got more effort  more strategies  more engagement over longer periods of time  and more perseverance when they hit really  really hard problems. Just the words  yet  or  not yet   we're finding  give kids greater confidence  give them a path into the future that creates greater persistence. And we can actually change students' mindsets. In one study  we taught them that every time they push out of their comfort zone to learn something new and difficult  the neurons in their brain can form new  stronger connections  and over time they can get smarter. Look what happened  in this study  students who were not taught this growth mindset continued to show declining grades over this difficult school transition  but those who were taught this lesson showed a sharp rebound in their grades. We have shown this now  this kind of improvement  with thousands and thousands of kids  especially struggling students. So let's talk about equality. In our country  there are groups of students who chronically underperform  for example  children in inner cities  or children on  Native American reservations. And they've done so poorly for so long that many people think it's inevitable. But when educators create growth mindset classrooms steeped in yet  equality happens. And here are just a few examples. In one year  a kindergarten class in Harlem  New York scored in the   th percentile on the National Achievement Test. Many of those kids could not hold a pencil when they arrived at school. In one year  fourth grade students  in the South Bronx  way behind  became the number one fourth grade class in the state of New York on the state math test. In a year to a year and a half  Native American students in a school on a reservation went from the bottom of their district to the top  and that district included affluent sections of Seattle. So the native kids outdid the Microsoft kids. This happened because the meaning of effort and difficulty were transformed. Before  effort and difficulty made them feel dumb  made them feel like giving up  but now  effort and difficulty  that's when their neurons are making new connections  stronger connections. That's when they're getting smarter. I received a letter recently from a    year old boy. He said   Dear Professor Dweck  I appreciate that your writing is based on solid scientific research  and that's why I decided to put it into practice. I put more effort into my schoolwork  into my relationship with my family  and into my relationship with kids at school  and I experienced great improvement in all of those areas. I now realize I've wasted most of my life.  Let's not waste any more lives  because once we know that abilities are capable of such growth  it becomes a basic human right for children  all children  to live in places that create that growth  to live in places filled with yet. Thank you. Has anyone among you ever been exposed to tear gas  Tear gas  Anyone  I'm sorry to hear that  so you might know that it's a very toxic substance  but you might not know that it's a very simple molecule with an unpronouncable name  it's called chlorobenzalmalononitrile. I made it. It's decades old  but it's becoming very trendy among police forces around the planet lately  it seems  and according to my experience as a non voluntary breather of it  tear gas has two main but quite opposite effects. One  it can really burn your eyes  and two  it can also help you to open them. Tear gas definitely helped to open mine to something that I want to share with you this afternoon  that livestreaming the power of independent broadcasts through the web can be a game changer in journalism  in activism  and as I see it  in the political discourse as well. That idea started  to dawn on me in early      when I was covering a protest in S o Paulo. It was the marijuana march  a gathering of people asking for the legalization of cannabis. When that group started to move  the riot police came from the back with rubber bullets  bombs  and then the gas. But to make a long story short  I had entered that protest as the editor in chief of a well established printed magazine where I'd worked for    years  and thanks to this unsolicited effects of tear gas  I left it as a journalist that was now committed to new ways of sharing the raw experience of what it's like to be there  actually. So in the following week  I was back in the streets  but that time  I wasn't a member of any media outlet anymore. I was there as an independent livestreamer  and all I had with me was basically borrowed equipment. I had a very simple camera and a backpack with  G modems. And I had this weblink that could be shared through social media  could be put in any website  and that time  the protest went along fine. There was no violence. There was no action scenes. But there was something really exciting  because I could see at a distance the TV channels covering it  and they had these big vans and the teams and the cameras  and I was basically doing the same thing and all I had was a backpack. And that was really exciting to a journalist  but the most interesting part was when I got back home  actually  because I learned that I had been watched by more than        people  and I got hundreds of emails and messages of people asking me  basically  how did I do it  how it was possible to do such a thing. And I learned something else  that that was actually the first time that somebody had ever done a livestreaming in a street protest in the country. And that really shocked me  because I was no geek  I was no technology guy  and all the equipment needed was already there  was easily available. And I realized that we had a frontier here  a very important one  that it was just a matter of changing the perspective  and the web could be actually used  already used  as a colossal and uncontrollable and highly anarchical TV channel  TV network  and anyone with very basic skills and very basic equipment  even someone like me who had this little stuttering issue  so if it happens  bear with me please  even someone like me could become a broadcaster. And that sounded revolutionary in my mind. So for the next couple of years  I started to experiment with livestreaming in different ways  not only in the streets but mostly in studios and in homes  until the beginning of       last year  when I became the cofounder of a group called M dia NINJA. NINJA is an acronym that stands for Narrativas Independentes  Jornalismo e A  o  or in English  independent narratives  journalism  and action. It was a media group that had little media plan. We didn't have any financial structure. We were not planning to make money out of this  which was wise  because you shouldn't try to make money out of journalism now. But we had a very solid and clear conviction  that we knew that the hyperconnected environment of social media could maybe allow us to consolidate a network of experimental journalists throughout the country. So we launched a Facebook page first  and then a manifesto  and started to cover the streets in a very simple way. But then something happened  something that wasn't predicted  that no one could have anticipated. Street protests started to erupt in S o Paulo. They began as very local and specific. They were against the bus fare hike that had just happened in the city. This is a bus. It's written there   Theft.  But those kind of manifestations started to grow  and they kept happening. So the police violence against them started to grow as well. But there was another conflict  the one I believe that's more important here to make my point that it was a narrative conflict. There was this mainstream media version of the facts that anyone who was on the streets could easily challenge if they presented their own vision of what was actually happening there. And it was this clash of visions  this clash of narratives  that I think turned those protests into a long period in the country of political reckoning where hundreds of thousands of people  probably more than a million people took to the streets in the whole country. But it wasn't about the bus fare hike anymore. It was about everything. The people's demands  their expectations  the reasons why they were on the streets could be as diverse as they could be contradictory in many cases. If you could read it  you would understand me. But it was in this environment of political catharsis that the country was going through that it had to do with politics  indeed  but it had to do also with a new way of organizing  through a new way of communicating. It was in that environment that M dia NINJA emerged from almost anonymity to become a national phenomenon  because we did have the right equipment. We are not using big cameras. We are using basically this. We are using smartphones. And that  actually  allowed us to become invisible in the middle of the protests  but it allowed us to do something else  to show what it was like to be in the protests  to present to people at home a subjective perspective. But there was something that is more important  I think  than the equipment. It was our mindset  because we are not behaving as a media outlet. We are not competing for news. We are trying to encourage people  to invite people  and to actually teach people how to do this  how they also could become broadcasters. And that was crucial to turn M dia NINJA from a small group of people  and in a matter of weeks  we multiplied and we grew exponentially throughout the country. So in a matter of a week or two  as the protests kept happening  we were hundreds of young people connected in this network throughout the country. We were covering more than    cities at the same time. That's something that no TV channel could ever do. That was responsible for turning us suddenly  actually  into kind of the mainstream media of social media. So we had a couple of thousands of followers on our Facebook page  and soon we had a quarter of a million followers. Our posts and our videos were being seen by more than    million timelines a week. It was way more than any newspaper or any magazine could ever do. And that turned M dia NINJA into something else  more than a media outlet  than a media project. It became almost like a public service to the citizen  to the protester  to the activist  because they had a very simple and efficient and peaceful tool to confront both police and media authority. Many of our images started  to be used in regular TV channels. Our livestreams started to be broadcast even in regular televisions when things got really rough. Some our images were responsible to take some people out of jail  people who were being arrested unfairly under false accusations  and we could prove them innocent. And that also turned M dia NINJA very soon to be seen as almost an enemy of cops  unfortunately  and we started to be severely beaten  and eventually arrested on the streets. It happened in many cases. But that was also useful  because we were still at the web  so that helped to trigger an important debate in the country on the role of the media itself and the state of the freedom of the press in the country. So M dia NINJA now evolved and finally consolidated itself in what we hoped it would become  a national network of hundreds of young people  self organizing themselves locally to cover social  human rights issues  and expressing themselves not only politically but journalistically. What I started to do in the beginning of this year  as M dia NINJA is already a self organizing network  I'm dedicating myself to another project. It's called Fluxo  which is Portuguese for  stream.  It's a journalism studio in S o Paulo downtown  where I used livestream to experiment with what I call post television formats. But I'm also trying to come up with ways to finance independent journalism through a direct relationship with an audience  with an active audience  because now I really want to try to make a living out of my tear gas resolution back then. But there's something more significant here  something that I believe is more important and more crucial than my personal example. I said that livestream could turn the web into a colossal TV network  but I believe it does something else  because after watching people using it  not only to cover things but to express  to organize themselves politically  I believe livestream can turn cyberspace into a global political arena where everyone might have a voice  a proper voice  because livestream takes the monopoly of the broadcast political discourse  of the verbal aspect of the political dialogue out of the mouths of just politicians and political pundits alone  and it empowers the citizen through this direct and non mediated power of exchanging experiences and dialogue  empowers them to question and to influence authorities in ways in which we are about to see. And I believe it does something else that might be even more important  that the simplicity of the technology can merge objectivity and subjectivity in a very political way  as I see it  because it really helps the audience  the citizen  to see the world through somebody else's eye  so it helps the citizen to put him  or herself in other people's place. And that idea  I think   should be the intention  should be the goal of any good journalism  any good activism  but most of all  any good politics. Thank you very much. It was an honor. Our world has many superheroes. But they have the worst of all superpowers  invisibility. For example  the catadores  workers who collect recyclable  materials for a living. Catadores emerged from  social inequality  unemployment  and the abundance of solid waste from the deficiency of the  waste collection system. Catadores provide a heavy   honest and essential work that benefits the entire population. But they are not acknowledged for it. Here in Brazil  they collect    percent of all the waste that's actually recycled. Most of the catadores work independently  picking waste from the streets and  selling to junk yards at very low prices. They may collect over     kilos in their bags  shopping carts   bicycles and carro as. Carro as are carts built from wood or metal and found in several streets in Brazil  much like graffiti and street art. And this is how I first met these  marginalized superheroes. I am a graffiti artist and activist and my art is social  environmental  and political in nature. In       I took my work beyond walls and onto the carro as  as a new urban support for my message. But at this time   giving voice to the catadores. By adding art and humor to the cause  it became more appealing  which helped call attention  to the catadores and improve their self esteem. And also  they are famous now  on the streets  on mass media and social. So  the thing is  I plunged into this universe  and have not stopped working since. I have painted over      carro as in many cities and have been invited to do exhibitions  and trips worldwide. And then I realized that catadores  in their invisibility  are not exclusive to Brazil. I met them in Argentina  Chile  Bolivia  South Africa  Turkey and even in developed countries such as the United States and Japan. And this was when I realized that I needed to have more people join the cause because it's a big challenge. And then  I created a collaborative  movement called Pimp My Carro a    Thank you. So Pimp My Carro a is a large  crowdfunded event to help catadores and their carro as. Catadores are assisted by well being  professionals and healthcare  like physicians  dentists  podiatrists   hair stylists  massage therapists and much more. But also  they also receive safety shirts  gloves  raincoats and eyeglasses to see in high definition the city  while their carro as are renovated by our incredible volunteers. And then they receive safety items  too  reflective tapes  horns and mirrors. Then  finally  painted by a street artist and become part of part of this huge   amazing mobile art exhibition. Pimp My Carro a took to the streets of S o Paulo  Rio de Janeiro and Curitiba. But to meet the demand in other cities  including outside of Brazil  we have created Pimpx  which is inspired by TEDx  and it's a simplified  do it yourself  crowdfunded edition of Pimp My Carro a. So now everybody can join. In two years  over     catadores      volunteers and     street artists and more than       donors have been involved in the  Pimp My Carro a movement  whose actions have even been used in teaching recycling at a local school. So catadores are leaving  invisibility behind and becoming increasingly respected and valued. Because of their pimped carro as  they are able to fight back to prejudice  increase their income and  their interaction with society. So now  I'd like to challenge you  to start looking at and acknowledging the catadores and other  invisible superheroes from your city. Try to see the world as one   without boundaries or frontiers. Believe it or not  there are over    million  catadores worldwide. So next time you see one  recognize them as a vital part of our society. Muito obrigado  thank you. I'm a lexicographer. I make dictionaries. And my job as a lexicographer is to try to put all the words possible  into the dictionary. My job is not to decide what a word is  that is your job. Everybody who speaks English  decides together what's a word and what's not a word. Every language is just a group of people who agree to understand each other. Now  sometimes when people are trying  to decide whether a word is good or bad  they don't really have a good reason. So they say something like   Because grammar   I don't actually really care about grammar too much    don't tell anybody. But the word  grammar   actually  there are two kinds of grammar. There's the kind of grammar that lives inside your brain  and if you're a native  speaker of a language or a good speaker of a language  it's the unconscious rules that you follow when you speak that language. And this is what you learn when you learn a language as a child. And here's an example  This is a wug  right  It's a wug. Now there is another one. There are two of these. There are two ... Audience  Wugs. Erin McKean  Exactly  You know  how to make the plural of wug. That rule lives in your brain. You never had to be taught this rule   you just understand it. This is an experiment that was invented by a professor at  Boston University  named Jean Berko Gleason back in     . So we've been talking about this  for a long time. Now  these kinds of natural rules  that exist in your brain  they're not like traffic laws  they're more like laws of nature. And nobody has to remind you to obey  a law of nature  right  When you leave the house in the morning   your mom doesn't say   Hey  honey  I think it's going to be cold  take a hoodie  don't forget to obey the law of gravity.  Nobody says this. Now  there are other rules that are more about manners than they are about nature. So you can think of a word as like a hat. Once you know how hats work  nobody has to tell you    Don't wear hats on your feet.  What they have to tell you is    Can you wear hats inside  Who gets to wear a hat  What are the kinds of hats you get to wear   Those are more of the second kind  of grammar  which linguists often call usage   as opposed to grammar. Now  sometimes people use this kind of  rules based grammar to discourage people from making up words. And I think that is  well  stupid. So  for example   people are always telling you   Be creative  make new music  do art   invent things  science and technology.  But when it comes to  words  they're like   Don't  No. Creativity stops right here  whippersnappers. Give it a rest.  But that makes no sense to me. Words are great. We should have more of them. I want you to make as many new words as possible. And I'm going to tell you six ways that you can use to make new words in English. The first way is the simplest way. Basically  steal them from other  languages.   Go rob other people    Laughter  Linguists call this borrowing  but we never give the words back   so I'm just going to be honest and call it stealing. We usually take words for things  that we like  like delicious food. We took  kumquat  from Chinese  we took  caramel  from French. We also take words  for cool things like  ninja   right  We took that from Japanese  which is kind of a cool trick because  ninjas are hard to steal from. So another way that you  can make words in English is by squishing two  other English words together. This is called compounding. Words in English are like Lego  If you use enough force   you can put any two of them together. We do this all the time in English  Words like  heartbroken    bookworm     sandcastle  all are compounds. So go ahead and make words like  duckface   just don't make duckface. Another way that you can make words  in English is kind of like compounding  but instead you use so much force when you squish the words together that some parts fall off. So these are blend words  like  brunch  is a blend  of  breakfast  and  lunch.   Motel  is a blend of  motor  and  hotel.  Who here knew that  motel   was a blend word  Yeah  that word is so old in English that lots of people don't know that  there are parts missing.  Edutainment  is a blend  of  education  and  entertainment.  And of course   electrocute  is a blend of  electric  and  execute.  You can also make words by changing how they operate. This is called functional shift. You take a word that acts  as one part of speech  and you change it into another  part of speech. Okay  who here knew that  friend  hasn't always been a verb   Friend  used to be noun  and then we verbed it. Almost any word in English can be verbed. You can also take adjectives  and make them into nouns.  Commercial  used to be an adjective  and now it's a noun. And of course  you can  green  things. Another way to make words in English is back formation. You can take a word and you can kind of squish it down a little bit. So for example  in English we had the word  editor  before we had the word  edit.   Edit  was formed from  editor.  Sometimes these back formations  sound a little silly  Bulldozers bulldoze  butlers butle  and burglers burgle. Another way to make words in English is to take the first letters of something and squish them together. So National Aeronautics and Space  Administration becomes NASA. And of course you can do this  with anything  OMG  So it doesn't matter how silly  the words are. They can be really good words of English.  Absquatulate  is a perfectly  good word of English.  Mugwump  is a perfectly  good word of English. So the words don't have have to sound  normal  they can sound really silly. Why should you make words  You should make words because every word is a chance to express your idea and get  your meaning across. And new words grab people's attention. They get people to focus on what  you're saying and that gives you a better chance to get  your meaning across. A lot of people  on this stage today have said   In the future  you can do this  you can help with this  you can  help us explore  you can help us invent.  You can make a new word right now. English has no age limit. Go ahead  start making words today  send them to me  and I will put them  in my online dictionary  Wordnik. Thank you so much. So over the past few centuries  microscopes have revolutionized our world. They revealed to us a tiny world of objects  life and structures that are too small for us to see with our naked eyes. They are a tremendous contribution to science and technology. Today I'd like to introduce you to a new type of microscope  a microscope for changes. It doesn't use optics like a regular microscope to make small objects bigger  but instead it uses a video camera and image processing to reveal to us the tiniest motions and color changes in objects and people  changes that are impossible for us to see with our naked eyes. And it lets us look at our world in a completely new way. So what do I mean by color changes  Our skin  for example  changes its color very slightly when the blood flows under it. That change is incredibly subtle  which is why  when you look at other people  when you look at the person sitting next to you  you don't see their skin or their face changing color. When we look at this video of Steve here  it appears to us like a static picture  but once we look at this video through our new  special microscope  suddenly we see a completely different image. What you see here are small changes in the color of Steve's skin  magnified     times so that they become visible. We can actually see a human pulse. We can see how fast Steve's heart is beating  but we can also see the actual way that the blood flows in his face. And we can do that not just to visualize the pulse  but also to actually  recover our heart rates  and measure our heart rates. And we can do it with regular cameras and without touching the patients. So here you see the pulse and heart rate we extracted from a neonatal baby from a video we took with a regular DSLR camera  and the heart rate measurement we get is as accurate as the one you'd get with a standard monitor in a hospital. And it doesn't even have to be a video we recorded. We can do it essentially with other videos as well. So I just took a short clip from  Batman Begins  here just to show Christian Bale's pulse. And you know  presumably he's wearing makeup  the lighting here is kind of challenging  but still  just from the video  we're able to extract his pulse and show it quite well. So how do we do all that  We basically analyze the changes in the light that are recorded at every pixel in the video over time  and then we crank up those changes. We make them bigger so that we can see them. The tricky part is that those signals  those changes that we're after  are extremely subtle  so we have to be very careful when you try to separate them from noise that always exists in videos. So we use some clever image processing techniques to get a very accurate measurement of the color at each pixel in the video  and then the way the color changes over time  and then we amplify those changes. We make them bigger to create those types of enhanced videos  or magnified videos  that actually show us those changes. But it turns out we can do that not just to show tiny changes in color  but also tiny motions  and that's because the light that gets recorded in our cameras will change not only if the color of the object changes  but also if the object moves. So this is my daughter when she was about two months old. It's a video I recorded about three years ago. And as new parents  we all want to make sure our babies are healthy  that they're breathing  that they're alive  of course. So I too got one of those baby monitors so that I could see my daughter when she was asleep. And this is pretty much what you'll see with a standard baby monitor. You can see the baby's sleeping  but  there's not too much information there. There's not too much we can see. Wouldn't it be better  or more informative  or more useful  if instead we could look at the view like this. So here I took the motions and I magnified them    times  and then I could clearly see that my daughter was indeed alive and breathing. Here is a side by side comparison. So again  in the source video  in the original video  there's not too much we can see  but once we magnify the motions  the breathing becomes much more visible. And it turns out  there's a lot of phenomena we can reveal and magnify with our new motion microscope. We can see how our veins and arteries are pulsing in our bodies. We can see that our eyes are constantly moving in this wobbly motion. And that's actually my eye  and again this video was taken right after my daughter was born  so you can see I wasn't getting too much sleep.  Laughter  Even when a person is sitting still  there's a lot of information we can extract about their breathing patterns  small facial expressions. Maybe we could use those motions to tell us something about our thoughts or our emotions. We can also magnify small mechanical movements  like vibrations in engines  that can help engineers detect and diagnose machinery problems  or see how our buildings and structures sway in the wind and react to forces. Those are all things that our society knows how to measure in various ways  but measuring those motions is one thing  and actually seeing those motions as they happen is a whole different thing. And ever since we discovered this new technology  we made our code available online so that  others could use and experiment with it. It's very simple to use. It can work on your own videos. Our collaborators at Quanta Research even created this nice website where you can upload your videos and process them online  so even if you don't have any experience in computer science or programming  you can still very easily experiment with this new microscope. And I'd like to show you just a couple of examples of what others have done with it. So this video was made by a YouTube user called Tamez  . I don't know who that user is  but he  or she  used our code to magnify small belly movements during pregnancy. It's kind of creepy. People have used it to magnify pulsing veins in their hands. And you know it's not real science unless you use guinea pigs  and apparently this guinea pig is called Tiffany  and this YouTube user claims it is the first rodent on Earth that was motion magnified. You can also do some art with it. So this video was sent to me by a design student at Yale. She wanted to see if there's any difference in the way her classmates move. She made them all stand still  and then magnified their motions. It's like seeing  still pictures come to life. And the nice thing with  all those examples is that we had nothing to do with them. We just provided this new tool  a new way to look at the world  and then people find other interesting  new and creative ways of using it. But we didn't stop there. This tool not only allows us to look at the world in a new way  it also redefines what we can do and pushes the limits of what we can do with our cameras. So as scientists  we started wondering  what other types of physical phenomena produce tiny motions that we could now use our cameras to measure  And one such phenomenon that we focused on recently is sound. Sound  as we all know  is basically changes in air pressure that travel through the air. Those pressure waves hit objects and they create small vibrations in them  which is how we hear and how we record sound. But it turns out that sound also produces visual motions. Those are motions that are not visible to us but are visible to a camera with the right processing. So here are two examples. This is me demonstrating my great singing skills. And I took a high speed video of my throat while I was humming. Again  if you stare at that video  there's not too much you'll be able to see  but once we magnify the motions     times  we can see all the motions and ripples in the neck that are involved in producing the sound. That signal is there in that video. We also know that singers can break a wine glass if they hit the correct note. So here  we're going to play a note that's in the resonance frequency of that glass through a loudspeaker that's next to it. Once we play that note and magnify the motions     times  we can very clearly see  how the glass vibrates and resonates in response to the sound. It's not something you're used to seeing every day. But this made us think. It gave us this crazy idea. Can we actually invert this process and recover sound from video by analyzing the tiny vibrations that sound waves create in objects  and essentially convert those back into the sounds that produced them. In this way  we can turn everyday objects into microphones. So that's exactly what we did. So here's an empty bag of chips that was lying on a table  and we're going to turn that  bag of chips into a microphone by filming it with a video camera and analyzing the tiny motions that sound waves create in it. So here's the sound that we played in the room. And this is a high speed video we recorded of that bag of chips. Again it's playing. There's no chance you'll be able to see anything going on in that video just by looking at it  but here's the sound we were able to recover just by analyzing the tiny motions in that video. I call it    Thank you. I call it the visual microphone. We actually extract audio signals from video signals. And just to give you a sense of the scale of the motions here  a pretty loud sound will cause that bag of chips to move less than a micrometer. That's one thousandth of a millimeter. That's how tiny the motions are that we are now able to pull out just by observing how light bounces off objects and gets recorded by our cameras. We can recover sounds from other objects  like plants. And we can recover speech as well. So here's a person speaking in a room. Voice  Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow  and everywhere that Mary went  that lamb was sure to go. Michael Rubinstein  And here's that speech again recovered just from this video of that same bag of chips. Voice  Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow  and everywhere that Mary went  that lamb was sure to go. MR  We used  Mary Had a Little Lamb  because those are said to be the first words that Thomas Edison spoke  into his phonograph in     . It was one of the first sound recording devices in history. It basically directed the sounds onto a diaphragm that vibrated a needle that essentially engraved the sound on tinfoil that was wrapped around the cylinder. Here's a demonstration of recording and  replaying sound with Edison's phonograph. Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow  and everywhere that Mary went  the lamb was sure to go. Testing  testing  one two three. Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow  and everywhere that Mary went  the lamb was sure to go. MR  And now      years later  we're able to get sound in pretty much similar quality but by just watching objects vibrate to sound with cameras  and we can even do that when the camera is    feet away from the object  behind soundproof glass. So this is the sound that we were  able to recover in that case. Voice  Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow  and everywhere that Mary went  the lamb was sure to go. MR  And of course  surveillance is the first application that comes to mind. But it might actually be useful for other things as well. Maybe in the future  we'll be able to use it  for example  to recover sound across space  because sound can't travel in space  but light can. We've only just begun exploring other possible uses for this new technology. It lets us see physical processes that we know are there but that we've never been able to see with our own eyes until now. This is our team. Everything I showed you today is a result of a collaboration with this great group of people you see here  and I encourage you and welcome you to check out our website  try it out yourself  and join us in exploring this world of tiny motions. Thank you. In the     s  there were so many right whales in Cape Cod Bay off the east coast of the U.S. that apparently you could walk across their backs from one end of the bay to the other. Today  they number in the hundreds  and they're endangered. Like them  many species of whales saw their numbers drastically reduced by     years of whaling  where they were hunted and killed for their whale meat  oil and whale bone. We only have whales in our waters today because of the Save the Whales movement of the '  s. It was instrumental in stopping commercial whaling  and was built on the idea that if we couldn't save whales  what could we save  It was ultimately a test of our political ability to halt environmental destruction. So in the early '  s  there was a ban on commercial whaling that came into force as a result of this campaign. Whales in our waters are still low in numbers  however  because they do face a range of other human induced threats. Unfortunately  many people still think that whale conservationists like myself do what we do only because these creatures are charismatic and beautiful. This is actually a disservice  because whales are ecosystem engineers. They help maintain the stability and health of the oceans  and even provide services to human society. So let's talk about why saving whales is critical to the resiliency of the oceans. It boils down to two main things  whale poop and rotting carcasses. As whales dive to the depths to feed and come up to the surface to breathe  they actually release these enormous fecal plumes. This whale pump  as it's called  actually brings essential limiting  nutrients from the depths to the surface waters where they  stimulate the growth of phytoplankton  which forms the base of all marine food chains. So really  having more whales in the oceans pooping is really beneficial to the entire ecosystem. Whales are also known to undertake some  of the longest migrations of all mammals. Gray whales off America migrate        kilometers between productive feeding areas and less productive calving  or birthing  areas and back every year. As they do so  they transport fertilizer in the form of their feces from places that have it to places that need it. So clearly  whales are really important in nutrient cycling  both horizontally and vertically  through the oceans. But what's really cool is that they're  also really important after they're dead. Whale carcasses are some of  the largest form of detritus to fall from the ocean's surface   and they're called whale fall. As these carcasses sink  they provide a feast to some     odd species  including the eel shaped  slime producing  hagfish. So over the     years of whaling  when we were busy killing and removing these carcasses from the oceans  we likely altered the rate and geographic  distribution of these whale falls that would descend into deep oceans  and as a result  probably led to a number of extinctions of species that were most specialized and dependent on these carcasses for their survival. Whale carcasses are also known to transport about         tons of carbon  which is the equivalent of that produced by        cars per year from the atmosphere to the deep oceans  and the deep oceans are what we call  carbon sinks   because they trap and hold excess carbon from the atmosphere  and therefore help to delay global warming. Sometimes these carcasses also wash up on beaches and provide a meal to a number of predatory species on land. The     years of whaling was clearly detrimental and caused a reduction in the populations of whales between    to    percent. Clearly  the Save the Whales movement was instrumental in preventing commercial whaling from going on  but we need to revise this. We need to address the more modern  pressing problems that these whales face in our waters today. Amongst other things  we need to stop them from getting plowed down by container  ships when they're in their feeding areas  and stop them from getting entangled in fishing nets as they float around in the ocean. We also need to learn to contextualize our conservation messages  so people really understand the true  ecosystem value of these creatures. So  let's save the whales again  but this time  let's not just  do it for their sake. Let's also do it for ours. Thank you. I have a confession to make. As a scientist and engineer  I've focused on efficiency for many years. But efficiency can be a cult  and today I'd like to tell you about a journey that moved me out of the cult and back to a far richer reality. A few years ago  after finishing my Ph.D.  in London  I moved to Boston. I lived in Boston and worked in Cambridge. I bought a racing bicycle that summer  and I bicycled every day to work. To find my way  I used my phone. It sent me over Mass. Ave.  Massachusetts Avenue  the shortest route from Boston to Cambridge. But after a month that I was cycling every day on the car packed Mass. Ave.  I took a different route one day. I'm not entirely sure why I took a different route that day  a detour. I just remember a feeling of surprise  surprise at finding a street with no cars  as opposed to the nearby Mass. Ave. full of cars  surprise at finding a street  draped by leaves and surrounded by trees. But after the feeling  of surprise  I felt shame. How could I have been so blind  For an entire month  I was so trapped in my mobile app that a journey to work became one thing only  the shortest path. In this single journey  there was no thought of enjoying the road  no pleasure in connecting with nature  no possibility of looking people in the eyes. And why  Because I was saving a minute out of my commute. Now let me ask you  Am I alone here  How many of you have never used a mapping app for finding directions  Most of you  if not all  have. And don't get me wrong    mapping apps are the greatest game changer for encouraging people to explore the city. You take your phone out and you know immediately where to go. However  the app also assumes there are only a handful of directions to the destination. It has the power to make those handful of directions the definitive direction to that destination. After that experience  I changed. I changed my research from traditional data mining to understanding how people experience the city. I used computer science tools to replicate social science experiments at scale  at web scale. I became captivated by the beauty and genius of traditional social science experiments done by Jane Jacobs  Stanley Milgram  Kevin Lynch. The result of that research has been the creation of new maps  maps where you don't only find the shortest path  the blue one  but also the most enjoyable path  the red one. How was that possible  Einstein once said   Logic will get you from A to B. Imagination will take you everywhere.  So with a bit of imagination  we needed to understand which parts of the city people find beautiful. At the University of Cambridge  with colleagues  we thought about this simple experiment. If I were to show you these two urban scenes  and I were to ask you which one is more beautiful  which one would you say  Don't be shy. Who says A  Who says B  Brilliant. Based on that idea  we built a crowdsourcing platform  a web game. Players are shown pairs of urban scenes  and they're asked to choose which one  is more beautiful  quiet and happy. Based on thousands of user votes  then we are able to see where consensus emerges. We are able to see which are the urban scenes that make people happy. After that work  I joined Yahoo Labs  and I teamed up with Luca and Rossano  and together  we aggregated those winning locations in London to build a new map of the city  a cartography weighted for human emotions. On this cartography  you're not only able to see and connect from point A to point B  the shortest segments  but you're also able to see the happy segment  the beautiful path  the quiet path. In tests  participants found the happy  the beautiful  the quiet path far more enjoyable than the shortest one  and that just by adding a few minutes to travel time. Participants also love to attach memories to places. Shared memories    that's where the old BBC building was  and personal memories    that's where I gave my first kiss. They also recalled how some paths smelled and sounded. So what if we had a mapping tool that would return the most enjoyable routes based not only on aesthetics but also based on smell  sound   and memories  That's where our research is going right now. More generally  my research  what it tries to do is avoid the danger of the single path  to avoid robbing people of fully experiencing the city in which they live. Walk the path through the park  not through the car park  and you have an entirely different path. Walk the path full of people you love and not full of cars  and you have an entirely different path. It's that simple. I would like to end with this thought  do you remember  The Truman Show   It's a media satire in which a real person doesn't know he's living in a fabricated world. Perhaps we live in a world fabricated for efficiency. Look at some of your daily habits  and as Truman did in the movie  escape the fabricated world. Why  Well  if you think that adventure is dangerous  try routine. It's deadly. Thank you. I'm a tourism entrepreneur and a peacebuilder  but this is not how I started. When I was seven years old  I remember watching television and seeing people throwing rocks  and thinking  this must be a fun thing to do. So I got out to the street and threw rocks  not realizing I was supposed to throw rocks at Israeli cars. Instead  I ended up stoning my neighbors' cars.  Laughter  They were not enthusiastic about my patriotism. This is my picture with my brother. This is me  the little one  and I know what you're thinking   You used to look cute  what the heck happened to you   But my brother  who is older than me  was arrested when he was     taken to prison on charges of throwing stones. He was beaten up when he refused to confess that he threw stones  and as a result  had internal injuries that caused his death soon after he was released from prison. I was angry  I was bitter  and all I wanted was revenge. But that changed when I was   . I decided that I needed Hebrew to get a job  and going to study Hebrew in that classroom was the first time I ever met Jews who were not soldiers. And we connected over really small things  like the fact that I love country music  which is really strange for Palestinians. But it was then that I realized also that we have a wall of anger  of hatred and of ignorance that separates us. I decided that it doesn't matter what happens to me. What really matters is how I deal with it. And therefore  I decided to dedicate my life to bringing down the walls that separate people. I do so through many ways. Tourism is one of them  but also media and education  and you might be wondering  really  can tourism change things  Can it bring down walls  Yes. Tourism is the best sustainable way to bring down those walls and to create a sustainable way of connecting with each other and creating friendships. In       I cofounded Mejdi Tours  a social enterprise that aims to connect people  with two Jewish friends  by the way  and what we'll do  the model we did  for example  in Jerusalem  we would have two tour guides  one Israeli and one Palestinian  guiding the trips together  telling history and narrative and archaeology and conflict from totally different perspectives. I remember running a trip together with a friend named Kobi    Jewish congregation from Chicago  the trip was in Jerusalem    and we took them to a refugee camp  a Palestinian refugee camp  and there we had this amazing food. By the way  this is my mother. She's cool. And that's the Palestinian food called maqluba. It means  upside down.  You cook it with rice and chicken  and you flip it upside down. It's the best meal ever. And we'll eat together. Then we had a joint band  Israeli and Palestinian musicians  and we did some belly dancing. If you don't know any  I'll teach you later. But when we left  both sides  they were crying because they did not want to leave. Three years later  those relationships still exist. Imagine with me if the one billion people who travel internationally  every year travel like this  not being taken in the bus from one side to another  from one hotel to another  taking pictures from the windows of their buses of people and cultures  but actually connecting with people. You know  I remember having a Muslim group from the U.K. going to the house of an Orthodox Jewish family  and having their first Friday night dinners  that Sabbath dinner  and eating together hamin  which is a Jewish food  a stew  just having the connection of realizing  after a while  that a hundred years ago  their families came out of the same place in Northern Africa. This is not a photo profile for your Facebook. This is not disaster tourism. This is the future of travel  and I invite you to join me to do that  to change your travel. We're doing it all over the world now  from Ireland to Iran to Turkey  and we see ourselves going everywhere to change the world. Thank you. Guatemala is recovering from a    year armed conflict. A conflict that was fought during the Cold War. It was really just  a small leftist insurgency and a devastating response by the state. What we have as a result is         civilian victims          of those killed in the communities  small children  men  women   the elderly even. And then we have  about        others  the missing  the ones we're still looking for today. We call them the Desaparecidos. Now     percent of the victims  are Mayan victims  victims that are the descendants of the original inhabitants of  Central America. And only about    percent are of  European descent. But the most important thing here is that the very people who are supposed to  defend us  the police  the military  are the ones that committed most of the crimes. Now the families  they want information. They want to know what happened. They want the bodies of their loved ones. But most of all  what they want is they want you  they want everyone to know that their loved ones did nothing wrong. Now  my case was that my father received death threats in     . And we left. We left Guatemala and we came here. So I grew up in New York  I grew up in Brooklyn as a matter of fact  and I went to New Utrecht High School and I graduated from Brooklyn College. The only thing was that I really didn't know what  was happening in Guatemala. I didn't care for it  it was too painful. But it wasn't till      that I decided to do something about it. So I went back. I went back to Guatemala   to look for the bodies  to understand what happened and to look for part of myself as well. The way we work is that we give people information. We talk to the family members and we let them choose. We let them decide to tell us the stories  to tell us what they saw  to tell us about their loved ones. And even more important  we let them choose to give us a piece of themselves. A piece  an essence  of who they are. And that DNA is what we're  going to compare to the DNA that comes from the skeletons. While we're doing that  though  we're looking for the bodies. And these are skeletons by now  most of these crimes  happened    years ago. When we find the grave  we take out the dirt and eventually clean  the body  document it  and exhume it. We literally bring the  skeleton out of the ground. Once we have those bodies  though  we take them back to the city  to our lab  and we begin a process of trying to understand mainly two things  One is how people died. So here you see a gunshot wound to the back of the head or a machete wound  for example. The other thing we want to understand is who they are. Whether it's a baby  or an adult. Whether it's a woman or a man. But when we're done with that analysis what we'll do is we'll take a small  fragment of the bone and we'll extract DNA from it. We'll take that DNA and then we'll compare it with the DNA of the families  of course. The best way to explain this to you is by showing you two cases. The first is the case  of the military diary. Now this is a document that was smuggled out of somewhere in     . And what you see there is the state following individuals  people that  like you   wanted to change their country  and they jotted everything down. And one of the things that they wrote  down is when they executed them. Inside that yellow rectangle   you see a code  it's a secret code     . And then you see a date. The     means  executed  and the date  means when they were executed. Now that's going to come into play in a second. What we did is we conducted an exhumation in       where we exhumed     bodies from    graves in a military base. Grave    though  matched the family of Sergio Saul Linares. Now Sergio was a professor at the university. He graduted from Iowa State University and went back to Guatemala to change his country. And he was captured on  February         . And if you can see there  he was  executed on March           which was incredible. We had the body  we had the family's  information and their DNA  and now we have documents that told us exactly what happened. But most important is about two weeks later  we go another hit  another match from the same grave to Amancio Villatoro. The DNA of that body also matched the DNA of that family. And then we noticed that he was also in the diary. But it was amazing to see that he was  also executed on March         . So that led us to think  hmm   how many bodies were in the grave  Six. So then we said  how many people were executed on March           That's right  six as well. So we have Juan de Dios  Hugo  Moises and Zoilo. All of them executed on the same date   all captured at different locations and at different moments. All put in that grave. The only thing we needed now was the DNA of those four families So we went and we looked for them and we found them. And we identified those six bodies and gave them back to the families. The other case I want to tell you about is that of a military base  called CREOMPAZ. It actually means   to believe in peace   but the acronym really means Regional Command Center for Peacekeeping Operations. And this is where the Guatemalan military trains peacekeepers from other countries  the ones that serve with the U.N. and go to countries like Haiti and the Congo. Well  we have testimony that said that within this military base  there were bodies  there were graves. So we went in there with a search warrant and about two hours after we went in  we found the first of    graves   a total of     bodies. Now  if you think about that  peacekeepers being trained on top of bodies. It's very ironic. But the bodies    face down  most of them  hands tied behind their backs  blindfolded  all types of trauma    these were people who were defenseless who were being executed. People that     families are looking for. So we're going to focus on Grave   . Grave     what we noticed  was a grave full of women and children     of them. And that immediately made us think  my goodness  where is there a case like this  When I got to Guatemala in       I heard of a case of a massacre that happened on May           where the army came in  killed the men  and took the women and children  in helicopters to an unknown location. Well  guess what  The clothing from this grave matched the  clothing from the region where these people were taken from  where these women and children  were taken from. So we conducted some DNA analysis  and guess what  We identified Martina Rojas  and Manuel Chen. Both of them disappeared in that case  and now we could prove it. We have physical evidence that proves that this happened and that those people  were taken to this base. Now  Manuel Chen was three years old. His mother went to the river to wash  clothes  and she left him with a neighbor. That's when the army came and that's when he was taken away in  a helicopter and never seen again until we found him in Grave   . So now with science  with archaeology   with anthropology  with genetics  what we're doing is  we're giving a voice to the voiceless. But we're doing more than that. We're actually providing  evidence for trials  like the genocide trial that happened  last year in Guatemala where General R os Montt was found guilty of genocide and sentenced to    years. So I came here to tell you today that this is happening everywhere    it's happening in Mexico right in front of us today    and we can't let it go on anymore. We have to now come together and decide that we're not going to have  any more missing. So no more missing  guys. Okay  No more missing. Thank you. When the Portuguese arrived in Latin America about     years ago  they obviously found this amazing tropical forest. And among all this biodiversity that they had never seen before  they found one species that caught their attention very quickly. This species  when you cut the bark  you find a very dark red resin that was very good to paint and dye fabric to make clothes. The indigenous people called this species pau brasil  and that's the reason why this land became  land of Brasil   and later on  Brazil. That's the only country in the world that has the name of a tree. So you can imagine that it's very cool to be a forester in Brazil  among other reasons. Forest products are all around us. Apart from all those products  the forest is very important for climate regulation. In Brazil  almost    percent of the evaporation that makes rain actually comes from the forest. Just the Amazon pumps to the atmosphere    billion tons of water every day. This is more than what the Amazon River  which is the largest river in the world  puts in the sea per day  which is    billion tons. If we had to boil water to get the same effect as evapotranspiration  we would need six months of the entire power generation capacity of the world. So it's a hell of a service for all of us. We have in the world about four billion hectares of forests. This is more or less China  U.S.  Canada and Brazil all together  in terms of size  to have an idea. Three quarters of that is in the temperate zone  and just one quarter is in the tropics  but this one quarter  one billion hectares  holds most of the biodiversity  and very importantly     percent of the living biomass  the carbon. Now  we used to have six billion hectares of forest       percent more than what we have          years ago. We've actually lost two billion hectares in the last       years. But in the last     years  we lost half of that. That was when we shifted from deforestation of temperate forests to deforestation of tropical forests. So think of this  In     years  we lost the same amount of forest in the tropics that we lost in       years in temperate forests. That's the speed of the destruction that we are having. Now  Brazil is an important piece of this puzzle. We have the second largest forest in the world  just after Russia. It means    percent of all the world's forests are in Brazil  most of that in the Amazon. It's the largest piece of forest we have. It's a very big  large area. You can see that you could fit many of the European countries there. We still have    percent of the forest cover. That's the good news. But we lost    percent in just    years. So if you go with that speed  very soon  we will loose this powerful pump that we have in the Amazon that regulates our climate. Deforestation was growing fast and accelerating at the end of the '  s and the beginning of the     s. Twenty seven thousand square kilometers in one year. This is  .  million hectares. It's almost like half of Costa Rica every year. So at this moment    this is               I happened to be coming to work in the government. And together with other teammates in the National Forest Department  we were assigned a task to join a team and find out the causes of deforestation  and make a plan to combat that at a national level  involving the local governments  the civil society  business  local communities  in an effort that could tackle those causes. So we came up with this plan with     actions in different areas. Now I will go through all of them one by one    no  just giving some examples of what we had done in the next few years. So the first thing  we set up a system with the national space agency that could actually see where deforestation is happening  almost in real time. So now in Brazil   we have this system  DETER  where every month  or every two months  we get information on where deforestation is happening so we can actually act when it's happening. And all the information is fully transparent so others can replicate that in independent systems. This allows us  among other things  to apprehend  .  million cubic meters of logs that were illegally taken. Part of that we saw and sell  and all the revenue becomes a fund that now funds conservation projects of local communities as an endowment fund. This also allows us to make a big operation to seize corruption and illegal activities that ended up having     people in prison  including a lot of public servants. Then we made the connection that areas that have been doing illegal deforestation should not get any kind of credit or finance. So we cut this through the bank system and then linked this to the end users. So supermarkets  the slaughterhouses  and so on that buy products from illegal clear cut areas  they also can be liable for the deforestation. So making all these connections to help to push the problem down. And also we work a lot on land tenure issues. It's very important for conflicts. Fifty million hectares of protected areas were created  which is an area the size of Spain. And of those  eight million were indigenous lands. Now we start to see results. So in the last    years  deforestation came down in Brazil    percent. So if we compare it with the average deforestation that we had in the last decade  we saved  .  million hectares  which is the size of Austria. But more importantly  it avoided the emission of three billion tons of CO  in the atmosphere. This is by far the largest contribution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions  until today  as a positive action. One may think that when you do these kinds of actions to decrease  to push down deforestation  you will have an economic impact because you will not have economic activity or something like that. But it's interesting to know that it's quite the opposite. In fact  in the period when we have the deepest decline of deforestation  the economy grew  on average  double from the previous decade  when deforestation was actually going up. So it's a good lesson for us. Maybe this is completely disconnected  as we just learned by having deforestation come down. Now this is all good news  and it's quite an achievement  and we obviously should be very proud about that. But it's not even close to sufficient. In fact  if you think about the deforestation in the Amazon in       that was over half a million hectares  which means that every minute  an area the size of two soccer fields is being cut in the Amazon last year  just last year. If we sum up the deforestation we have in the other biomes in Brazil  we are talking about still the largest deforestation rate in the world. It's more or less like we are forest heroes  but still deforestation champions. So we can't be satisfied  not even close to satisfied. So the next step  I think  is to fight to have zero loss of forest cover in Brazil and to have that as a goal for     . That's our next step. Now I've always been interested in the relationship between climate change and forests. First  because    percent of greenhouse gas emissions come from deforestation  so it's a big part of the problem. But also  forests can be a big part of the solution since that's the best way we know to sink  capture and store carbon. Now  there is another relationship of climate and forests that really stuck me in      and made me change my career from forests to working with climate change. I went to visit Canada  in British Columbia  together with the chiefs of the forest services of other countries that we have a kind of alliance of them  like Canada  Russia  India  China  U.S. And when we were there we learned about this pine beetle that is literally eating the forests in Canada. What we see here  those brown trees  these are really dead trees. They are standing dead trees because of the larvae of the beetle. What happens is that this beetle is controlled by the cold weather in the winter. For many years now  they don't have the sufficient cold weather to actually control the population of this beetle. And it became a disease that is really killing billions of trees. So I came back with this notion that the forest is actually one of the earliest and most affected victims of climate change. So I was thinking  if I succeed in working with all my colleagues to actually help to stop deforestation  maybe we will lose the battle later on for climate change by floods  heat  fires and so on. So I decided to leave the forest service and start to work directly on climate change  find a way to think and understand the challenge  and go from there. Now  the challenge of climate change is pretty straightforward. The goal is very clear. We want to limit the increase of the average temperature of the planet to two degrees. There are several reasons for that. I will not get into that now. But in order to get to this limit of two degrees  which is possible for us to survive  the IPCC  the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  defines that we have a budget of emissions of       billion tons of CO  from now until the end of the century. So if we divide this by the number of years  what we have is an average budget of    billion tons of CO  per year. Now what is one ton of CO   It's more or less what one small car  running    kilometers a day  will emit in one year. Or it's one flight  one way  from S o Paulo to Johannesburg or to London  one way. Two ways  two tons. So    billion tons is twice that. Now the emissions today are    billion tons  and it's growing. It's growing and maybe it will be    by     . Now we need to go down to    by     . And while this happens  the population will grow from seven to nine billion people  the economy will grow from    trillion dollars in      to     trillion dollars. And so what we need to do is to be much more efficient in a way that we can go from seven tons of carbon per capita per person  per year  into something like one. You have to choose. You take the airplane or you have a car. So the question is  can we make it  And that's the exactly the same question I got when I was developing a plan to combat deforestation. It's such a big problem  so complex. Can we really do it  I think so. Think of this  Deforestation means    percent of the greenhouse gas emissions in Brazil in the last decade. Now it's a little bit less than    percent. In the world     percent is energy. So if we can tackle directly the energy  the same way we could tackle deforestation  maybe we can have a chance. So there are five things that I think we should do. First  we need to disconnect development from carbon emissions. We don't need to clear cut all the forests to actually get more jobs and agriculture and have more economy. That's what we proved when we decreased deforestation and the economy continued to grow. Same thing could happen in the energy sector. Second  we have to move the incentives to the right place. Today      billion dollars a year goes into subsidies for fossil fuels. Why don't we put a price on carbon and transfer this to the renewable energy  Third  we need to measure and make it transparent where  when and who is emitting greenhouse gases so we can have actions specifically for each one of those opportunities. Fourth  we need to leapfrog the routes of development  which means  you don't need to go to the landline telephone before you get to the mobile phones. Same way we don't need to go to fossil fuels to the one billion people who don't have access to energy before we get to the clean energy. And fifth and last  we need to share responsibility between governments  business and civil society. There is work to do for everybody  and we need to have everybody on board. So to finalize  I think the future is not like a fate that you have to just go as business as usual goes. We need to have the courage to actually change the route  invest in something new  think that we can actually change the route. I think we are doing this with deforestation in Brazil  and I hope we can do it also with climate change in the world. Thank you. When you grow up in a developing country like India  as I did  you instantly learn to get more value from limited resources and find creative ways to reuse what you already have. Take Mansukh Prajapati  a potter in India. He has created a fridge made entirely of clay that consumes no electricity. He can keep fruits and vegetables fresh for many days. That's a cool invention  literally. In Africa  if you run out of your cell phone battery  don't panic. You will find some resourceful entrepreneurs who can recharge your  cell phone using bicycles. And since we are in South America  let's go to Lima in Peru  a region with high humidity that receives only one inch of rainfall each year. An engineering college in Lima designed a giant advertising billboard that absorbs air humidity and converts it into purified water  generating over    liters of water every day. The Peruvians are amazing. They can literally create water out of thin air. For the past seven years  I have met and studied hundreds of entrepreneurs in India  China  Africa and South America  and they keep amazing me. Many of them did not go to school. They don't invent stuff in big R D labs. The street is the lab. Why do they do that  Because they don't have the kind of basic resources we take for granted  like capital and energy  and basic services like healthcare and education are also scarce in those regions. When external resources are scarce  you have to go within yourself to tap the most abundant resource  human ingenuity  and use that ingenuity to find clever ways to solve problems with limited resources. In India  we call it Jugaad. Jugaad is a Hindi word that means an improvised fix  a clever solution born in adversity. Jugaad solutions are not sophisticated or perfect  but they create more value at lower cost. For me  the entrepreneurs who will create Jugaad solutions are like alchemists. They can magically transform adversity into opportunity  and turn something of less value into something of high value. In other words  they mastered the art of doing more with less  which is the essence of frugal innovation. Frugal innovation is the ability  to create more economic and social value using fewer resources. Frugal innovation is not about making do  it's about making things better. Now I want to show you how  across emerging markets  entrepreneurs and companies are adopting  frugal innovation on a larger scale to cost effectively deliver healthcare and energy to billions of people who may have little income but very high aspirations. Let's first go to China  where the country's largest I.T. service provider  Neusoft  has developed a telemedicine solution to help doctors in cities remotely treat old and poor patients in Chinese villages. This solution is based on simple to use medical devices that less qualified health workers like nurses can use in rural clinics. China desperately needs these frugal medical solutions because by      it will be home to over half a billion senior citizens. Now let's go to Kenya  a country where half the population uses M Pesa  a mobile payment solution. This is a great solution for the African continent because    percent of Africans don't have a bank account  but what is exciting is that M Pesa is now becoming the source of other disruptive business models in sectors like energy. Take M KOPA  the home solar solution that comes literally in a box that has a solar rooftop panel  three LED lights  a solar radio  and a cell phone charger. The whole kit  though  costs     dollars  which is too expensive for most Kenyans  and this is where mobile telephony can make the solution more affordable. Today  you can buy this kit by making an initial deposit of just    dollars  and then pay off the rest by making a daily micro payment of    cents using your mobile phone. Once you've made     micro payments  the system is unlocked  and you own the product and you start  receiving clean  free electricity. This is an amazing solution for Kenya  where    percent of people live off the grid. This shows that with frugal innovation what matters is that you take what is most abundant  mobile connectivity  to deal with what is scarce  which is energy. With frugal innovation  the global South is actually catching up and in some cases  even leap frogging the North. Instead of building expensive hospitals  China is using telemedicine to cost effectively treat millions of patients  and Africa  instead of building banks and electricity grids  is going straight to mobile payments and distributed clean energy. Frugal innovation is diametrically opposed to the way we innovate in the North. I live in Silicon Valley  where we keep chasing the next big technology thing. Think of the iPhone       then     . Companies in the West spend billions of dollars investing in R D  and use tons of natural resources to create ever more complex products  to differentiate their brands from competition  and they charge customers more money for new features. So the conventional business model  in the West is more for more. But sadly  this more for more model is running out of gas  for three reasons  First  a big portion of customers in the West because of the diminishing purchasing power  can no longer afford these expensive products. Second  we are running out of natural water and oil. In California  where I live  water scarcity is becoming a big problem. And third  most importantly  because of the growing income disparity between the rich  and the middle class in the West  there is a big disconnect between existing products and services and basic needs of customers. Do you know that today  there are over    million Americans today who are underbanked  because existing banking services are not designed to address their basic needs. The prolonged economic crisis in the West is making people think that they are about to lose the high standard of living and face deprivation. I believe that the only way we can sustain growth and prosperity in the West is if we learn to do more with less. The good news is  that's starting to happen. Several Western companies are now adopting frugal innovation to create affordable products for Western consumers. Let me give you two examples. When I first saw this building  I told myself it's some kind of postmodern house. Actually  it's a small manufacturing plant set up by Grameen Danone  a joint venture between  Grameen Bank of Muhammad Yunus and the food multinational Danone to make high quality yogurt in Bangladesh. This factory is    percent the size of existing Danone factories and cost much less to build. I guess you can call it a low fat factory. Now this factory  unlike Western factories that are highly automated  relies a lot on manual processes in order  to generate jobs for local communities. Danone was so inspired by this model that combines economic efficiency and social sustainability  they are planning to roll it out in other parts of the world as well. Now  when you see this example  you might be thinking   Well  frugal innovation is low tech.  Actually  no. Frugal innovation is also about making high tech more affordable and more accessible to more people. Let me give you an example. In China  the R D engineers of Siemens Healthcare have designed a C.T. scanner that is easy enough to be used by less qualified health workers  like nurses and technicians. This device can scan more patients on a daily basis  and yet consumes less energy  which is great for hospitals  but it's also great for patients because it reduces the cost of treatment by    percent and radiation dosage by up to    percent. This solution was initially designed for the Chinese market  but now it's selling like hotcakes in the U.S. and Europe  where hospitals are pressured to deliver quality care at lower cost. But the frugal innovation revolution in the West is actually led by creative entrepreneurs who are coming up with amazing solutions to address basic needs in the U.S. and Europe. Let me quickly give you three examples of startups that personally inspire me. The first one happens to be launched by my neighbor in Silicon Valley. It's called gThrive. They make these wireless sensors designed like plastic rulers that farmers can stick in different parts of the field and start collecting detailed information like soil conditions. This dynamic data allows farmers to optimize use of water energy while improving quality of the products and the yields  which is a great solution for California  which faces major water shortage. It pays for itself within one year. Second example is Be Bound  also in Silicon Valley  that enables you to connect to the Internet even in no bandwidth areas where there's no wi fi or  G or  G. How do they do that  They simply use SMS  a basic technology  but that happens to be the most reliable and most widely available around the world. Three billion people today with  cell phones can't access the Internet. This solution can connect them to the Internet in a frugal way. And in France  there is a startup calle Compte Nickel  which is revolutionizing the banking sector. It allows thousands of people to walk into a Mom and Pop store and in just five minutes activate the service that gives them two products  an international bank account number and an international debit card. They charge a flat annual  maintenance fee of just    Euros. That means you can do all banking transactions    send and receive money  pay with your debit card    all with no additional charge. This is what I call low cost banking without the bank. Amazingly     percent of the customers using this service are the middle class French who can't afford high banking fees. Now  I talked about frugal innovation  initially pioneered in the South  now being adopted in the North. Ultimately  we would like to see developed countries and developing countries come together and co create frugal solutions that benefit the entire humanity. The exciting news is that's starting to happen. Let's go to Nairobi to find that out. Nairobi has horrendous traffic jams. When I first saw them  I thought   Holy cow.  Literally  because you have to dodge cows as well when you drive in Nairobi. To ease the situation  the engineers at the IBM lab in Kenya are piloting a solution called Megaffic  which initially was designed by the Japanese engineers. Unlike in the West  Megaffic doesn't rely on roadside sensors  which are very expensive to install in Nairobi. Instead they process images  traffic data  collected from a small number of low resolution webcams in Nairobi streets  and then they use analytic software to predict congestion points  and they can SMS drivers alternate routes to take. Granted  Megaffic is not as sexy as self driving cars  but it promises to take Nairobi drivers from point A to point B at least    percent faster. And earlier this year  UCLA Health launched its Global Lab for Innovation  which seeks to identify frugal healthcare  solutions anywhere in the world that will be at least    percent cheaper than existing solutions in the U.S. and yet more effective. It also tries to bring together innovators from North and South to cocreate affordable healthcare solutions for all of humanity. I gave tons of examples of frugal innovators from around the world  but the question is  how do you go about adopting frugal innovation  Well  I gleaned out three principles from frugal innovators around the world that I want to share with you that you can apply in your own organization to do more with less. The first principle is  Keep it simple. Don't create solutions to impress customers. Make them easy enough to use and widely accessible  like the C.T. scanner we saw in China. Second principle   Do not reinvent the wheel. Try to leverage existing resources and assets that are widely available  like using mobile telephony to offer clean energy or Mom and Pop stores to offer banking services. Third principle is  Think and act horizontally. Companies tend to scale up vertically by centralizing operations in big factories and warehouses  but if you want to be agile and deal with immense customer diversity  you need to scale out horizontally using a distributed supply chain with smaller manufacturing and distribution units  like Grameen Bank has shown. The South pioneered frugal innovation out of sheer necessity. The North is now learning to do more and better with less as it faces resource constraints. As an Indian born French national who lives in the United States  my hope is that we transcend this artificial North South divide so that we can harness the collective ingenuity of innovators from around the world to cocreate frugal solutions that will improve the quality of life of everyone in the world  while preserving our precious planet. Thank you very much. Let's go south. All of you are actually going south. This is the direction of south  this way  and if you go       kilometers out of the back of this room  you will come to as far south as you can go anywhere on Earth  the Pole itself. Now  I am not an explorer. I'm not an environmentalist. I'm actually just a survivor  and these photographs that I'm showing you here are dangerous. They are the ice melt of the South and North Poles. And ladies and gentlemen  we need to listen to what these places are telling us  and if we don't  we will end up with our own survival situation here on planet Earth. I have faced head on these places  and to walk across a melting ocean of ice is without doubt the most frightening thing that's ever happened to me. Antarctica is such a hopeful place. It is protected by  the Antarctic Treaty  signed in     . In       a    year agreement was entered into that stops any exploitation in Antarctica  and this agreement could be altered  changed  modified  or even abandoned starting in the year     . Ladies and gentlemen  people already far up north from here in the Arctic are already taking advantage of this ice melt  taking out resources from areas already that have been covered in ice for the last                         years. Can they not join the dots and think   Why is the ice actually melting   This is such an amazing place  the Antarctic  and I have worked hard for the last    years on this mission to make sure that what's happening up here in the North does never happen   cannot happen in the South. Where did this all begin  It began for me at the age of   . Check out that haircut.  It's a bit odd.  Laughter  And at the age of      I was inspired by the real explorers to want to try to be the first to walk to both Poles. I found it incredibly inspiring that the idea of becoming a polar traveler went down pretty well with girls  at parties when I was at university. That was a bit more inspiring. And after years  seven years of fundraising  seven years of being told no  seven years of being told by my family to seek counseling and psychiatric help  eventually three of us found ourselves marching to the South Geographic Pole on the longest unassisted march ever made anywhere on Earth in history. In this photograph  we are standing in an area the size of the United States of America  and we're on our own. We have no radio  communications  no backup. Beneath our feet     percent of all the world's ice     percent of all the world's fresh water. We're standing on it. This is the power of Antarctica. On this journey  we faced the danger of crevasses  intense cold  so cold that sweat turns to ice inside your clothing  your teeth can crack  water can freeze in your eyes. Let's just say it's a bit chilly.  Laughter  And after    desperate days  we arrive at the South Pole. We had done it. But something happened to me on that    day journey in      that brought me here  and it hurt. My eyes changed color in    days through damage. Our faces blistered out. The skin ripped off and we wondered why. And when we got home  we were told by NASA that a hole in the ozone had been discovered above the South Pole  and we'd walked underneath it the same year it had been discovered. Ultraviolet rays down  hit the ice  bounced back  fried out the eyes  ripped off our faces. It was a bit of a shock     Laughter     and it started me thinking. In       we now head north. Sixty days  every step away from the safety of land across a frozen ocean. It was desperately cold again. Here's me coming in from washing naked at     Celsius. And if anybody ever says to you   I am cold      Laughter     if they look like this   they are cold  definitely. And       kilometers away from the safety of land  disaster strikes. The Arctic Ocean melts beneath our feet four months before it ever had in history  and we're       kilometers from safety. The ice is crashing around us  grinding  and I'm thinking   Are we going to die   But something clicked in my head on this day  as I realized we  as a world  are in a survival situation  and that feeling has never gone away for    long years. Back then  we had to march or die. And we're not some TV survivor program. When things go wrong for us  it's life or death  and our brave African American Daryl  who would become the first American to walk to the North Pole  his heel dropped off  from frostbite     klicks out. He must keep going  he does  and after    days on the ice  we stood at the North Pole. We had done it. Yes  I became the first person in history stupid enough to walk to both Poles  but it was our success. And sadly  on return home  it was not all fun. I became very low. To succeed at something is often harder than actually making it happen. I was empty  lonely  financially destroyed. I was without hope  but hope came in the form of the great Jacques Cousteau  and he inspired me to take on  the      mission. Being Jacques  he gave me clear instructions  Engage the world leaders  talk to industry and business  and above all  Rob  inspire young people  because they will choose the future of the preservation of Antarctica. For the world leaders  we've been to every world Earth Summit  all three of them  with our brave yacht        twice to Rio  once in '    once in       and for the Earth Summit in Johannesburg  we made the longest overland voyage ever made with a yacht         kilometers around the whole of Southern Africa doing our best to inspire over a million young people in person about      and about their environment. For the last    years  we have taken over       people  people from industry and business  women and men from companies  students from all over the world  down to Antarctica  and during those missions  we've managed to pull out over       tons of twisted metal left in Antarctica. That took eight years  and I'm so proud of it because we recycled all of it  back here in South America. I have been inspired ever since I could walk to recycle by my mum. Here she is  and my mum    my mum is still recycling  and as she is in her    th year  isn't that fantastic  And when    I love my mum. But when Mum was born  the population of our planet was only  .  billion people  and talking in terms of billions  we have taken young people from industry and business from India  from China. These are game changing nations  and will be hugely important in the decision about the preservation of the Antarctic. Unbelievably  we've engaged and inspired women to come from the Middle East  often for the first time they've  represented their nations in Antarctica. Fantastic people  so inspired. To look after Antarctica  you've got to first engage people with this extraordinary place  form a relationship  form a bond  form some love. It is such a privilege to go to Antarctica  I can't tell you. I feel so lucky  and I've been    times in my life  and all those people who come with us return home as great champions  not only for Antarctica  but for local issues back in their own nations. Let's go back to where we began  the ice melt of the North and South Poles. And it's not good news. NASA informed us six months ago that the Western Antarctic Ice Shelf is now disintegrating. Huge areas of ice    look how big Antarctica is even compared to here    Huge areas of ice  are breaking off from Antarctica  the size of small nations. And NASA have calculated that the sea level will rise  it is definite  by one meter in the next     years  the same time that my mum has been on planet Earth. It's going to happen  and I've realized that  the preservation of Antarctica and our survival here on Earth are linked. And there is a very simple solution. If we are using more renewable energy in the real world  if we are being more efficient with the energy here  running our energy mix in a cleaner way  there will be no financial reason to go and exploit Antarctica. It won't make financial sense  and if we manage our energy better  we also may be able to slow down  maybe even stop  this great ice melt that threatens us. It's a big challenge  and what is our response to it  We've got to go back one last time  and at the end of next year  we will go back to the South Geographic Pole  where we arrived    years ago on foot  and retrace our steps of       kilometers  but this time only using renewable energy to survive. We will walk across those icecaps  which far down below are melting  hopefully inspiring some solutions on that issue. This is my son  Barney. He is coming with me. He is committed to walking side by side with his father  and what he will do is to translate these messages and inspire these messages to the minds of future young leaders. I'm extremely proud of him. Good on him  Barney. Ladies and gentlemen   a survivor    and I'm good    a survivor sees a problem and doesn't go   Whatever.  A survivor sees a problem and deals with that problem before it becomes a threat. We have    years to preserve the Antarctic. We all own it. We all have responsibility. The fact that nobody owns it  maybe means that we can succeed. Antarctica is a moral line in the snow  and on one side of that line we should fight  fight hard for this one beautiful  pristine place left alone on Earth. I know it's possible. We are going to do it. And I'll leave you with these words from Goethe. I've tried to live by them.  If you can do  or dream you can  begin it now  for boldness has genius  power and magic in it.  Good luck to you all. Thank you very much. We can cut violent deaths around the world by    percent in the next three decades. All we have to do is drop killing by  .  percent a year  and we'll hit that target. You don't believe me  Well  the leading epidemiologists and criminologists around the world seem to think we can  and so do I  but only if we focus on our cities  especially the most fragile ones. You see  I've been thinking about this a lot. For the last    years  I've been working in countries and cities ripped apart by conflict  violence  terrorism  or some insidious combination of all. I've tracked gun smugglers from Russia to Somalia  I've worked with warlords in Afghanistan and the Congo  I've counted cadavers in Colombia  in  Haiti  in Sri Lanka  in Papua New Guinea. You don't need to be on the front line  though  to get a sense that our planet is spinning out of control  right  There's this feeling that international instability is the new normal. But I want you to take a closer look  and I think you'll see that the geography of violence is changing  because it's not so much our nation states that are gripped by conflict and crime as our cities  Aleppo  Bamako  Caracas   Erbil  Mosul  Tripoli  Salvador. Violence is migrating to the metropole. And maybe this is to be expected  right  After all  most people today  they live in cities  not the countryside. Just     cities  including    megacities  account for two thirds of global GDP. But when it comes to cities  the conversation is dominated by the North  that is  North America  Western Europe  Australia and Japan  where violence is  actually at historic lows. As a result  city enthusiasts  they talk about the triumph of the city  of the creative classes  and the mayors that will rule the world. Now  I hope that mayors do one day rule the world  but  you know  the fact is  we don't hear any conversation  really  about what is happening in the South. And by South  I mean Latin America  Africa  Asia  where violence in some cases is accelerating  where infrastructure is overstretched  and where governance is sometimes an aspiration and not a reality. Now  some diplomats and development experts and specialists  they talk about    to    fragile states that will shape security in the   st century. I think it's fragile cities which will define the future of order and disorder. That's because warfare and humanitarian action are going to be concentrated in our cities  and the fight for development  whether you define that as eradicating poverty  universal healthcare  beating back climate change  will be won or lost in the shantytowns  slums and favelas of our cities. I want to talk to you about four megarisks that I think will define fragility in our time  and if we can get to grips with these  I think we can do something with that lethal violence problem. So let me start with some good news. Fact is  we're living in the most peaceful moment in human history. Steven Pinker and others have shown how the intensity and frequency of conflict is actually at an all time low. Now  Gaza  Syria  Sudan  Ukraine  as ghastly as these conflicts are  and they are horrific  they represent a relatively small blip upwards in a    year long secular decline. What's more  we're seeing a dramatic reduction in homicide. Manuel Eisner and others have shown that for centuries  we've seen this incredible drop in murder  especially in the West. Most Northern cities today are     times safer than they were just     years ago. These two facts    the decline in armed  conflict and the decline in murder    are amongst the most extraordinary  if unheralded  accomplishments of human history  and we should be really excited  right  Well  yeah  we should. There's just one problem  These two scourges are still with us. You see          people    men  women  boys and girls    die violently every single year. Research I've been doing with Keith Krause and others has shown that between        and        people are dying in war zones violently. The rest  almost         people  are dying outside of conflict zones. In other words     times more people are dying outside of war than inside war. What's more  violence is moving south  to Latin America and the Caribbean  to parts of Central and Southern Africa  and to bits of the Middle East and Central Asia. Forty of the    most dangerous  cities in the world are right here in Latin America     in Brazil  and the most dangerous of all  it's  San Pedro Sula  Honduras' second city  with a staggering homicide rate of     murders per         people. That's    times the global average. Now  if violence is re concentrating geographically  it's also being reconfigured to the world's new topography  because when it comes to cities  the world ain't flat  like Thomas Friedman likes to say. It's spiky. The dominance of the city as the primary mode of urban living is one of the most extraordinary demographic reversals in history  and it all happened so fast. You all know the figures  right  There's  .  billion people in the world today  there will be  .  billion by     . But consider this one fact  In the     s  one in    people lived in cities  today it's one in two  and tomorrow virtually everyone is going to be there. And this expansion in urbanization is going to be neither even nor equitable. The vast majority     percent  will be happening in the South  in cities of the South. So urban geographers and demographers  they tell us that it's not necessarily the size or even the density of cities that predicts violence  no. Tokyo  with    million people  is one of the largest  and some might say safest  urban metropolises in the world. No  it's the speed of urbanization that matters. I call this turbo urbanization  and it's  one of the key drivers of fragility. When you think about the incredible expansion of these cities  and you think about turbo urbanization  think about Karachi. Karachi was about         people in       a hustling  bustling city. Today  it's    million people  and apart from accounting for three quarters of Pakistan's GDP  it's also one of the most violent cities in South Asia. Dhaka  Lagos  Kinshasa  these cities are now    times larger than they were in the     s. Now take a look at New York. The Big Apple  it took     years to get to eight million people. S o Paulo  Mexico City  took    to reach that same interval. Now  what do these medium  large  mega   and hypercities look like  What is their profile  Well  for one thing  they're young. What we're seeing in many of them is the rise of the youth bulge. Now  this is actually a good news story. It's a function of reductions in child mortality rates. But the youth bulge is something we've got to watch. What it basically means is the proportion of young people living in our fragile cities is much larger than those living  in our healthier and wealthier ones. In some fragile cities     percent of the population is under the age of   . Think about that  Three in four people are under   . It's like Palo Alto on steroids. Now  if you look at Mogadishu for example  in Mogadishu the mean age is    years old. Ditto for Dhaka  Dili and Kabul. And Tokyo  It's   . Same for most Western European cities. Now  it's not just youth that necessarily predicts violence. That's one factor among many  but youthfulness combined with unemployment  lack of education  and    this is the kicker     being male  is a deadly proposition. They're statistically correlated  all those risk factors  with youth  and they tend to relate to increases in violence. Now  for those of you who are parents of teenage sons  you know what I'm talking about  right  Just imagine your boy without any structure with those unruly friends of his  out there cavorting about. Now  take away the parents  take away the education  limit the education possibilities  sprinkle in a little bit of drugs  alcohol and guns  and sit back and watch the fireworks. The implications are disconcerting. Right here in Brazil  the life expectancy is   .  years. If you live in Rio  I'm sorry  shave off two right there. But if you're young  you're uneducated  you lack employment  you're black  and you're male  your life expectancy drops to less than    years old. There's a reason why youthfulness and violence are the number one killers in this country. Okay  so it's not all doom and gloom in our cities. After all  cities are hubs of innovation  dynamism  prosperity   excitement  connectivity. They're where the smart people gather. And those young people I just mentioned  they're more digitally savvy and tech aware than ever before. And this explosion  the Internet  and mobile technology  means that the digital divide separating the North and the South between countries and within them  is shrinking. But as we've heard so many times  these new technologies are dual edged  right  Take the case of law enforcement. Police around the world are starting to use remote sensing and big data to anticipate crime. Some cops are able to predict criminal violence before it even happens. The future crime scenario  it's here today  and we've got to be careful. We have to manage the issues of the public safety against rights to individual privacy. But it's not just the cops who are innovating. We've heard extraordinary activities of civil society groups who are engaging in local  and global collective action  and this is leading to digital protest and real revolution. But most worrying of all are criminal gangs who are going online and starting to colonize cyberspace. In Ciudad Ju rez in Mexico  where I've been working  groups like the Zetas and the Sinaloa cartel are hijacking social media. They're using it to recruit  to sell their products  to coerce  to intimidate and to kill. Violence is going virtual. So this is just a partial sketch of a fast moving and dynamic and complex situation. I mean  there are many other megarisks that are going to define fragility in our time  not least income inequality  poverty  climate change  impunity. But we're facing a stark dilemma where some cities are going to thrive and drive global growth and others are going to stumble and pull it backwards. If we're going to change course  we need to start a conversation. We can't only focus on those cities that work  the Singapores  the Kuala Lumpurs  the Dubais  the Shanghais. We've got to bring those fragile cities into the conversation. One way to do this might be to start twinning our fragile cities with our healthier and wealthier ones  kickstarting a process of learning and collaboration and sharing of practices  of what works and what doesn't. A wonderful example of this is coming from El Salvador and Los Angeles  where the mayors in San Salvador and Los Angeles are collaborating on getting ex gang members to work with current gang members  offering tutoring  education  and in the process are helping incubate cease fires and truces  and we've seen homicide rates go down in San Salvador  once the world's most violent city  by    percent. We can also focus  on hot cities  but also hot spots. Place and location matter fundamentally in shaping violence in our cities. Did you know that between one and two percent of street addresses in any fragile city can predict up to    percent of violent crime  Take the case of S o Paulo  where I've been working. It's gone from being Brazil's most dangerous city to one of its safest  and it did this by doubling down on information collection  hot spot mapping  and police reform  and in the process  it dropped homicide by    percent in just over    years. We also got to focus on those hot people. It's tragic  but being young  unemployed  uneducated  male  increases the risks of being killed and killing. We have to break this cycle of violence and get in there early with our children  our youngest children  and valorize them  not stigmatize them. There's wonderful work that's happening that I've been involved with in Kingston  Jamaica and right here in Rio  which is putting education  employment  recreation up front for these high risk groups  and as a result  we're seeing violence going down in their communities. We've also got to make our cities safer  more inclusive  and livable for all. The fact is  social cohesion matters. Mobility matters in our cities. We've got to get away from this model of segregation  exclusion  and cities with walls. My favorite example of how to do this comes from Medell n. When I lived in Colombia in the late     s  Medell n was the murder capital  of the world  but it changed course  and it did this by deliberately investing in its low income and most violent areas and integrating them with the middle class ones through a network of cable cars  of public transport  and first class infrastructure  and in the process  it dropped homicide by    percent in just under two decades. And finally  there's technology. Technology has enormous promise but also peril. We've seen examples here of extraordinary innovation  and much of it coming from this room  The police are engaging  in predictive analytics. Citizens are engaging in new crowdsourcing solutions. Even my own group is involved in developing applications to provide more accountability over police and increase safety among citizens. But we need to be careful. If I have one single message for you  it's this  There is nothing inevitable about lethal violence  and we can make our cities safer. Folks  we have the opportunity of a lifetime to drop homicidal violence in half within our lifetime. So I have just one question  What are we waiting for  Thank you. It's said that to be a poet you have to go to hell and back. The first time I visited the prison  I was not surprised by the noise of the padlocks  or the closing doors  or the cell bars  or by any of the things I had imagined. Maybe because the prison is in a quite open space. You can see the sky. Seagulls fly overhead  and you feel like you're next to the sea  that you're really close to the beach. But in fact  the gulls are looking for food in the dump near the prison. I went farther inside and I suddenly saw inmates moving across the corridors. Then it was as if I stepped back and thought that I could have very well been one of them. If I had another story  another context  different luck. Because nobody   nobody   can choose where they're born. In       I was invited to join a project that San Mart n National University conducted at the Unit    penitentiary  to coordinate a writing workshop. The prison service ceded some land at the end of the prison  which is where they constructed the University Center building. The first time I met with the prisoners  I asked them why they were asking for a writing workshop and they told me they wanted  to put on paper all that they couldn't say and do. Right then I decided that I wanted poetry to enter the prison. So I said to them why don't we work with poetry  if they knew what poetry was. But nobody had a clue what poetry really was. They also suggested to me that the workshop should be not just for the inmates taking university classes   but for all the inmates. And so I said that to start this workshop  I needed to find a tool that we all had in common. That tool was language. We had language  we had the workshop. We could have poetry. But what I hadn't considered was that inequality exists in prison  too. Many of the prisoners hadn't even completed grammar school. Many couldn't use cursive  could barely print. They didn't write fluently  either. So we started looking for short poems. Very short  but very powerful. And we started to read  and we'd read one author  then another author  and by reading such short poems  they all began to realize that what the poetic language did was to break a certain logic  and create another system. Breaking the logic of language also breaks the logic of the system under which they've learned to respond. So a new system appeared  new rules that made them understand very quickly    very quickly   that with poetic language they would be able to say absolutely whatever they wanted. It's said that to be a poet you have to go to hell and back. And they have plenty of hell. Plenty of hell. One of them once said   In prison you never sleep. You can never sleep in jail. You can never close your eyelids.  And so  like I m doing now  I gave them a moment of silence  then said   That's what poetry is  you guys. It's in this prison universe that you have all around you. Everything you say about how you never sleep  it exudes fear. All the things that go unwritten    all of that is poetry.  So we started appropriating that hell  we plunged ourselves  headfirst  into the seventh circle. And in that seventh circle of hell  our very own  beloved circle  they learned that they could make the walls invisible  that they could make the windows yell  and that we could hide inside the shadows. When the first year of the workshop had ended  we organized a little closing party  like you do when a job is done with so much love  and you want to celebrate with a party. We called family  friends   the university authorities. The only thing the inmates had to do was read a poem  and receive their diplomas and applause. That was our simple party. The only thing I want to leave you with is the moment in which those men  some of them just huge when standing next to me  or the young boys   so young  but with an enormous pride  held their papers and trembled like little kids and sweated  and read their poems with their voices completely broken. That moment made me think a lot that for most of them  it was surely the very first time that someone applauded them for something they had done. In prison there are things that can't be done. In prison  you can't dream. In prison  you can't cry. There are words that are virtually forbidden  like the word  time   the word  future   the word  wish . But we dared to dream  and to dream a lot. We decided that they were going to write a book. Not only did they write a book  but they also bound it themselves. That was at the end of     . Then  we doubled the bet and wrote another book. And we bound that one  too. That was a short time ago  at the end of last year. What I see week after week  is how they're turning into different people  how they're being transformed. How words are empowering them with a dignity they had never known  that they couldn't even imagine. They had no idea such dignity could come from them. At the workshop  in that beloved hell we share  we all give something. We open our hands and hearts and give what we have  what we can. All of us  all of us equally. And so you feel that at least in a small way you're repairing that huge social fracture which makes it so that for many of them  prison is their only destination. I remember a verse by a tremendous poet  a great poet  from our Unit    workshop  Nicol s Dorado   I will need an infinite thread to sew up this huge wound.  Poetry does that  it sews up the wounds of exclusion. It opens doors.  Poetry works as a mirror. It creates a mirror  which is the poem. They recognize themselves  they look at themselves in the poem and write from who they are  and are from what they write. In order to write  they need to appropriate the moment of writing which is a moment of extraordinary freedom. They have to get into their heads  search for that bit of freedom that can never be taken away when they write and that is also useful to realize that freedom is possible even inside a prison  and that the only bars we have in our wonderful space is the word  bars   and that all of us in our hell burn with happiness when we light the wick of the word. I told you a lot about the prison  a lot about what I experience every week  and how I enjoy it and transform myself with the inmates. But you don't know how much I'd like it if you could feel  live  experience  even for a few seconds  what I enjoy every week and what makes me who I am. Mart n Bustamante   The heart chews tears of time  blinded by that light  it hides the speed of existence where the images go rowing by. It fights  it hangs on. The heart cracks under sad gazes  rides on storms that spread fire  lifts chests lowered by shame  knows that it's not just reading and going on  it also wishes to see the infinite blue. The heart sits down to think about things  fights to avoid being ordinary  tries to love without hurting  breathes the sun  giving courage to itself  surrenders  travels toward reason. The heart fights among the swamps  skirts the edge of the underworld  falls exhausted  but won't give in to what's easy  while irregular steps of intoxication wake up  wake the stillness. I'm Mart n Bustamante  I'm a prisoner in Unit    of San Mart n  today is my day of temporary release. And for me  poetry and literature have changed my life. Thank you very much  Cristina Domenech  Thank you  So we humans have an extraordinary potential for goodness  but also an immense power to do harm. Any tool can be used to build or to destroy. That all depends on our motivation. Therefore  it is all the more important to foster an altruistic motivation rather than a selfish one. So now we indeed are facing  many challenges in our times. Those could be personal challenges. Our own mind can be our best friend or our worst enemy. There's also societal challenges  poverty in the midst of plenty  inequalities  conflict  injustice. And then there are the new challenges  which we don't expect. Ten thousand years ago  there were about five million human beings on Earth. Whatever they could do  the Earth's resilience  would soon heal human activities. After the Industrial and Technological Revolutions  that's not the same anymore. We are now the major agent of impact on our Earth. We enter the Anthropocene  the era of human beings. So in a way  if we were to say we need to continue this endless growth  endless use of material resources  it's like if this man was saying    and I heard a former head of state  I won't mention who  saying     Five years ago  we were at the edge of the precipice. Today we made a big step forward.  So this edge is the same that has been defined by scientists as the planetary boundaries. And within those boundaries  they can carry a number of factors. We can still prosper  humanity can still prosper for         years if we keep the same stability of climate as in the Holocene for the last        years. But this depends on choosing a voluntary simplicity  growing qualitatively  not quantitatively. So in       as you can see  we were well within the limits of safety. Now  in      came the great acceleration. Now hold your breath  not too long  to imagine what comes next. Now we have vastly overrun some of the planetary boundaries. Just to take biodiversity   at the current rate  by          percent of all species  on Earth will have disappeared. Even if we keep their DNA in some fridge  that's not going to be reversible. So here I am sitting in front of a       meter high          foot glacier in Bhutan. At the Third Pole        glaciers are melting fast  faster than the Arctic. So what can we do in that situation  Well  however complex politically  economically  scientifically the question of the environment is  it simply boils down to a question of altruism versus selfishness. I'm a Marxist of the Groucho tendency. Groucho Marx said   Why should I care about future generations  What have they ever done for me   Unfortunately  I heard the billionaire Steve Forbes  on Fox News  saying exactly  the same thing  but seriously. He was told about the rise of the ocean  and he said   I find it absurd to change my behavior today for something that will happen  in a hundred years.  So if you don't care for future generations  just go for it. So one of the main challenges of our times is to reconcile three time scales  the short term of the economy  the ups and downs of the stock market  the end of the year accounts  the midterm of the quality of life    what is the quality every moment of our  life  over    years and    years     and the long term of the environment. When the environmentalists speak with economists  it's like a schizophrenic dialogue  completely incoherent. They don't speak the same language. Now  for the last    years  I went around the world meeting economists  scientists  neuroscientists  environmentalists  philosophers  thinkers  in the Himalayas  all over the place. It seems to me  there's only one concept that can reconcile those three time scales. It is simply having more consideration for others. If you have more consideration for others  you will have a caring economics  where finance is at the service of society and not society at the service of finance. You will not play at the casino with the resources that people have entrusted you with. If you have more consideration for others  you will make sure that you remedy inequality  that you bring some kind  of well being within society  in education  at the workplace. Otherwise  a nation that is the most powerful and the richest but everyone is miserable  what's the point  And if you have more consideration for others  you are not going to ransack that planet that we have and at the current rate  we don't have three planets to continue that way. So the question is  okay  altruism is the answer  it's not just a novel ideal  but can it be a real  pragmatic solution  And first of all  does it exist  true altruism  or are we so selfish  So some philosophers thought we were irredeemably selfish. But are we really all just like rascals  That's good news  isn't it  Many philosophers   like Hobbes  have said so. But not everyone looks like a rascal. Or is man a wolf for man  But this guy doesn't seem too bad. He's one of my friends in Tibet. He's very kind. So now  we love cooperation. There's no better joy  than working together  is there  And then not only humans. Then  of course  there's the struggle for life  the survival of the fittest  social Darwinism. But in evolution  cooperation    though competition exists  of course    cooperation has to be much more creative to go to increased levels of complexity. We are super cooperators  and we should even go further. So now  on top of that  the quality of human relationships. The OECD did a survey among    factors  including income  everything. The first one that people said  that's the main thing for my happiness  is quality of social relationships. Not only in humans. And look at those great grandmothers. So now  this idea  that if we go deep within  we are irredeemably selfish  this is armchair science. There is not a single sociological study  psychological study  that's ever shown that. Rather  the opposite. My friend  Daniel Batson   spent a whole life putting people in the lab in very complex situations. And of course we are sometimes selfish  and some people more than others. But he found that systematically  no matter what  there's a significant number of people who do behave altruistically  no matter what. If you see someone deeply wounded  great suffering  you might just help out of empathic distress    you can't stand it  so it's better to help than to keep on looking at that person. So we tested all that  and in the end   he said  clearly people can be altruistic. So that's good news. And even further  we should look at the banality of goodness. Now look at here. When we come out  we aren't  going to say   That's so nice. There was no fistfight while this mob  was thinking about altruism.  No  that's expected  isn't it  If there was a fistfight  we would speak of that for months. So the banality of goodness is something that doesn't attract your attention  but it exists. Now  look at this. So some psychologists said  when I tell them I run     humanitarian  projects in the Himalayas that give me so much joy  they said   Oh  I see  you work for the warm glow. That is not altruistic. You just feel good.  You think this guy  when he jumped in front of the train  he thought   I'm going to feel so good when this is over   But that's not the end of it. They say  well  but when you interviewed him  he said   I had no choice. I had to jump  of course.  He has no choice. Automatic behavior. It's neither selfish nor altruistic. No choice  Well of course  this guy's not going to think for half an hour   Should I give my hand  Not give my hand   He does it. There is a choice  but it's obvious  it's immediate. And then  also  there he had a choice. There are people who had choice  like Pastor Andr  Trocm  and his wife  and the whole village of Le Chambon sur Lignon in France. For the whole Second World War  they saved       Jews  gave them shelter  brought them to Switzerland  against all odds  at the risk of their lives and those of their family. So altruism does exist. So what is altruism  It is the wish  May others be happy and find the cause of happiness. Now  empathy is the affective resonance or cognitive resonance that tells you  this person is joyful  this person suffers. But empathy alone is not sufficient. If you keep on being confronted with suffering  you might have empathic distress  burnout  so you need the greater sphere of loving kindness. With Tania Singer at the Max Planck  Institute of Leipzig  we showed that the brain networks for empathy and loving kindness are different. Now  that's all well done  so we got that from evolution  from maternal care  parental love  but we need to extend that. It can be extended even to other species. Now  if we want a more altruistic society  we need two things  individual change and societal change. So is individual change possible  Two thousand years of contemplative study said yes  it is. Now     years of collaboration with neuroscience and epigenetics said yes  our brains change when you train in altruism. So I spent     hours in an MRI machine. This is the first time I went after two and a half hours. And then the result has been published in many scientific papers. It shows without ambiguity that there is structural change and functional change in the brain when you train the altruistic love. Just to give you an idea  this is the meditator at rest on the left  meditator in compassion meditation  you see all the activity  and then the control group at rest  nothing happened  in meditation  nothing happened. They have not been trained. So do you need        hours  of meditation  No  you don't. Four weeks     minutes a day  of caring  mindfulness meditation already brings a structural change in the brain compared to a control group. That's only    minutes a day for four weeks. Even with preschoolers    Richard Davidson did that in Madison. An eight week program  gratitude  loving  kindness  cooperation  mindful breathing. You would say    Oh  they're just preschoolers.  Look after eight weeks  the pro social behavior  that's the blue line. And then comes the ultimate scientific test  the stickers test. Before  you determine for each child who is their best friend in the class  their least favorite child  an unknown child  and the sick child  and they have to give stickers away. So before the intervention  they give most of it to their best friend. Four  five years old      minutes three times a week. After the intervention  no more discrimination  the same amount of stickers to their  best friend and the least favorite child. That's something we should do in all the schools in the world. Now where do we go from there  When the Dalai Lama heard that  he told Richard Davidson   You go to    schools      schools  the U.N.  the whole world.  So now where do we go from there  Individual change is possible. Now do we have to wait for an altruistic  gene to be in the human race  That will take        years  too much for the environment. Fortunately  there is the evolution of culture. Cultures  as specialists have shown  change faster than genes. That's the good news. Look  attitude towards war has dramatically changed over the years. So now individual change and cultural  change mutually fashion each other  and yes  we can achieve a more altruistic society. So where do we go from there  Myself  I will go back to the East. Now we treat         patients a year in our projects. We have        kids in school  four percent overhead. Some people say   Well  your stuff works in practice  but does it work in theory   There's always positive deviance. So I will also go back to my hermitage to find the inner resources to better serve others. But on the more global level  what can we do  We need three things. Enhancing cooperation  Cooperative learning in the school instead of competitive learning  Unconditional cooperation within corporations    there can be some competition between corporations  but not within. We need sustainable harmony. I love this term. Not sustainable growth anymore. Sustainable harmony means now we will reduce inequality. In the future  we do more with less  and we continue to grow qualitatively  not quantitatively. We need caring economics. The Homo economicus cannot deal with poverty in the midst of plenty  cannot deal with the problem of the common goods of the atmosphere  of the oceans. We need a caring economics. If you say economics should be compassionate  they say   That's not our job.  But if you say they don't care  that looks bad. We need local commitment  global responsibility. We need to extend altruism to the other  .  million species. Sentient beings  are co citizens in this world. and we need to dare altruism. So  long live the altruistic revolution. Viva la revoluci n de altruismo. Thank you. My students and I work on very tiny robots. Now  you can think of these as robotic versions of something that you're all very familiar with  an ant. We all know that ants and other insects at this size scale can do some pretty incredible things. We've all seen a group of ants  or some version of that  carting off your potato chip at a picnic  for example. But what are the real challenges of engineering these ants  Well  first of all  how do we get the capabilities of an ant in a robot at the same size scale  Well  first we need to figure out how to make them move when they're so small. We need mechanisms like legs and efficient motors in order to support that locomotion  and we need the sensors  power and control in order to pull everything together in a semi intelligent ant robot. And finally  to make these things really functional  we want a lot of them working together in order to do bigger things. So I'll start with mobility. Insects move around amazingly well. This video is from UC Berkeley. It shows a cockroach moving over incredibly rough terrain without tipping over  and it's able to do this because its legs are a combination of rigid materials  which is what we traditionally use to make robots  and soft materials. Jumping is another really interesting way to get around when you're very small. So these insects store energy in a spring and release that really quickly to get the high power they need to jump out of water  for example. So one of the big contributions from my lab has been to combine rigid and soft materials in very  very small mechanisms. So this jumping mechanism is about four millimeters on a side  so really tiny. The hard material here is silicon  and the soft material is silicone rubber. And the basic idea is that we're going to compress this  store energy in the springs  and then release it to jump. So there's no motors on board this right now  no power. This is actuated with a method that we call in my lab  graduate student with tweezers.   Laughter  So what you'll see in the next video is this guy doing amazingly well for its jumps. So this is Aaron  the graduate student in question  with the tweezers  and what you see is this  four millimeter sized mechanism jumping almost    centimeters high. That's almost     times its own length. And it survives  bounces on the table  it's incredibly robust  and of course survives quite well until we lose it because it's very tiny. Ultimately  though  we want to add motors to this too  and we have students in the lab working on millimeter sized motors to eventually integrate onto small  autonomous robots. But in order to look at mobility and locomotion at this size scale to start  we're cheating and using magnets. So this shows what would eventually be part of a micro robot leg  and you can see the silicone rubber joints and there's an embedded magnet that's being moved around by an external magnetic field. So this leads to the robot that I showed you earlier. The really interesting thing that this robot can help us figure out is how insects move at this scale. We have a really good model for how everything from a cockroach up to an elephant moves. We all move in this  kind of bouncy way when we run. But when I'm really small   the forces between my feet and the ground are going to affect my locomotion a lot more than my mass  which is what causes that bouncy motion. So this guy doesn't work quite yet  but we do have slightly larger versions that do run around. So this is about a centimeter cubed  a centimeter on a side  so very tiny  and we've gotten this to run about    body lengths per second  so    centimeters per second. It's pretty quick for a little  small guy  and that's really only limited  by our test setup. But this gives you some idea of how it works right now. We can also make  D printed versions  of this that can climb over obstacles  a lot like the cockroach that you saw earlier. But ultimately we want to add everything onboard the robot. We want sensing  power  control  actuation all together  and not everything needs to be bio inspired. So this robot's about the size of a Tic Tac. And in this case  instead of magnets or muscles to move this around  we use rockets. So this is a micro fabricated energetic material  and we can create tiny pixels of this  and we can put one of these pixels on the belly of this robot  and this robot  then  is going to jump when it senses an increase in light. So the next video is one of my favorites. So you have this     milligram robot jumping about eight centimeters in the air. It's only four by four by seven millimeters in size. And you'll see a big flash at the beginning when the energetic is set off  and the robot tumbling through the air. So there was that big flash  and you can see the robot jumping up through the air. So there's no tethers on this  no wires connecting to this. Everything is onboard  and it jumped in response to the student just flicking on a desk lamp next to it. So I think you can imagine all the cool things that we could do with robots that can run and crawl and jump and roll at this size scale. Imagine the rubble that you get after  a natural disaster like an earthquake. Imagine these small robots running through that rubble to look for survivors. Or imagine a lot of small robots running around a bridge in order to inspect it and make sure it's safe so you don't get collapses like this  which happened outside of  Minneapolis in     . Or just imagine what you could do if you had robots that could swim through your blood. Right   Fantastic Voyage   Isaac Asimov. Or they could operate without having to cut you open in the first place. Or we could radically change the way we build things if we have our tiny robots work the same way that termites do  and they build these incredible eight meter high mounds  effectively well ventilated apartment buildings for other termites in Africa and Australia. So I think I've given you some of the possibilities of what we can do with these small robots. And we've made some advances so far  but there's still a long way to go  and hopefully some of you can contribute to that destination. Thanks very much. It is very fashionable and proper  to speak about food in all its forms  all its colors   aromas and tastes. But after the food goes through  the digestive system  when it is thrown out as crap  it is no longer fashionable to speak about it. It is rather revolting. I'm a guy who has graduated  from bullshit to full shit. My organization  Gram Vikas  which means  village development organization   was working in the area  of renewable energy. On the most part  we were  producing biogas  biogas for rural kitchens. We produce biogas in India  by using animal manure  which usually  in India   is called cow dung. But as the gender sensitive  person that I am  I would like to call it bullshit. But realizing later on how important were sanitation and the disposal of crap in a proper way  we went into the arena of sanitation. Eighty percent of all diseases  in India and most developing countries are because of poor quality water. And when we look at the reason  for poor quality water  you find that it is our abysmal attitude  to the disposal of human waste. Human waste  in its rawest form  finds its way back to drinking water  bathing water  washing water  irrigation water  whatever water you see. And this is the cause for    percent  of the diseases in rural areas. In India  it is unfortunately only the women who carry water. So for all domestic needs  women have to carry water. So that is a pitiable state of affairs. Open defecation is rampant. Seventy percent of India defecates in the open. They sit there out in the open  with the wind on their sails  hiding their faces  exposing their bases  and sitting there in pristine glory       percent of India. And if you look at the world total     percent of all the crap that is thrown into the open is by Indians. A fantastic distinction. I don't know if we Indians can be proud of such a distinction. So we  together with a lot of villages  we began to talk about how to really  address this situation of sanitation. And we came together and formed  a project called MANTRA. MANTRA stands for Movement and Action Network for Transformation of Rural Areas. So we are speaking about transformation  transformation in rural areas. Villages that agree  to implement this project  they organize a legal society where the general body  consists of all members who elect a group of men and women who implement the project and  later on  who look after the operation and maintenance. They decide to build a toilet  and a shower room. And from a protected water source  water will be brought to an elevated water reservoir and piped to all households through three taps  one in the toilet  one in the shower   one in the kitchen     hours a day. The pity is that our cities  like New Delhi and Bombay  do not have a    hour water supply. But in these villages  we want to have it. There is a distinct difference  in the quality. Well in India  we have a theory  which is very much accepted by the government bureaucracy and all those who matter  that poor people deserve poor solutions and absolutely poor people deserve pathetic solutions. This  combined with  a Nobel Prize worthy theory that the cheapest is the most economic  is the heady cocktail that the poor are forced to drink. We are fighting against this. We feel that the poor have been humiliated for centuries. And even in sanitation  they should not be humiliated. Sanitation is more about dignity than about human disposal of waste. And so you build these toilets  and very often  we have to hear that the toilets are better than their houses. And you can see that in front are  the attached houses and the others are the toilets. So these people  without a single exception of a family in a village  decide to build a toilet  a bathing room. And for that  they come together  collect all the local materials    local materials like rubble   sand  aggregates  usually a government subsidy is available to meet at least part of the cost  of external materials like cement  steel  toilet commode. And they build a toilet  and a bathing room. Also  all the unskilled laborers  that is  daily wage earners  mostly landless  are given an opportunity to be  trained as masons and plumbers. So while these people are being trained   others are collecting the materials. And when both are ready  they build a toilet  a shower room  and of course also a water tower   an elevated water reservoir. We use a system of two leach pits  to treat the waste. From the toilet  the muck comes into the first leach pit. And when it is full  it is blocked  and it can go to the next. But we discovered that if you plant banana trees  papaya trees on the periphery of these leach pits  they grow very well because they suck up all the nutrients and you get very tasty bananas  papayas. If any of you come to my place  I would be happy to share these bananas and papayas with you. So there you can see  the completed toilets  the water towers. This is in a village where  most of the people are even illiterate. It is always a    hour water supply because water gets polluted very often when you store it    a child dips his or her hand into it  something falls into it. So no water is stored. It's always on tap. This is how an elevated  water reservoir is constructed. And that is the end product. Because it has to go high  and there is some space available  two or three rooms are made under the water tower  which are used by the village for  different committee meetings. We have had clear evidence of the great impact of this program. Before we started  there were  as usual  more than    percent of people suffering from waterborne diseases. But after this  we have empirical evidence that    percent  on average  among all these villages          villages have completed it    waterborne diseases  have come down    percent. Women usually used to spend   especially in the summer months  about six to seven hours  a day carrying water. And when they went to carry water  because  as I said earlier  it's only women who carry water  they used to take their little children  girl children  also to carry water  or else to be back at home to look after the siblings. So there were less than nine percent of girl children attending school  even if there was a school. And boys  about    percent. But girls  it has gone to about    percent and boys  almost to     percent. The most vulnerable section in a village are the landless laborers who are the daily wage earners. Because they have gone  through this training to be masons and plumbers and bar benders  now their ability to earn has  increased     to     percent. So this is a democracy in action because there is a general body   a governing board  the committee. People are questioning   people are governing themselves  people are learning to manage their own affairs  they are taking their own futures into their hands. And that is democracy at the grassroots level in action. More than       villages  have so far done this. It benefits over         people and it's still going on. And I hope it continues to move ahead. For India and such developing countries  armies and armaments  software companies and spaceships may not be as important as taps and toilets. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. When I was young  I prided myself as a nonconformist in the conservative U.S. state I live in  Kansas. I didn't follow along with the crowd. I wasn't afraid to try weird clothing trends or hairstyles. I was outspoken and extremely social. Even these pictures and postcards  of my London semester abroad    years ago show that I obviously didn't care if I was perceived as weird or different. But that same year  I was in London     years ago  I realized something about myself that actually was somewhat unique  and that changed everything. I became the opposite of who I thought I once was. I stayed in my room instead of socializing. I stopped engaging in clubs and leadership activities. I didn't want to stand out in the crowd anymore. I told myself it was because I was growing up and maturing  not that I was suddenly looking for acceptance. I had always assumed I was immune to needing acceptance. After all  I was a bit unconventional. But I realize now that the moment I realized something was different about me was the exact same moment that I began conforming and hiding. Hiding is a progressive habit  and once you start hiding  it becomes harder and harder to step forward and speak out. In fact  even now  when I was talking to people about what this talk was about  I made up a cover story and I even hid the truth about my TED Talk. So it is fitting and scary that I have returned  to this city    years later and I have chosen this stage to finally stop hiding. What have I been hiding for    years  I am a lesbian. Thank you. I've struggled to say those words  because I didn't want to be defined by them. Every time I would think about coming out in the past  I would think to myself  but I just want to be known as Morgana  uniquely Morgana  but not  my lesbian friend Morgana   or  my gay coworker Morgana.  Just Morgana. For those of you from large metropolitan areas  this may not seem like a big deal to you. It may seem strange  that I have suppressed the truth and hidden this for so long. But I was paralyzed by my fear of not being accepted. And I'm not alone  of course. A      Deloitte study found that a surprisingly large number of people hide aspects of their identity. Of all the employees they surveyed     percent reported changing an aspect of their behavior or their appearance in order to fit in at work. Of all the gay  lesbian and bisexual employees     percent admitted to changing some aspects of themselves so they would not  appear at work  too gay.  The study found that even in companies with diversity policies and inclusion programs  employees struggle to be themselves at work because they believe  conformity is critical to their long term career advancement. And while I was surprised that so many people just like me waste so much energy trying to hide themselves  I was scared when I discovered that my silence has life or death consequences and long term social repercussions. Twelve years  the length by which  life expectancy is shortened for gay  lesbian and bisexual people in highly anti gay communities compared to accepting communities. Twelve years reduced life expectancy. When I read that in The Advocate  magazine this year  I realized I could no longer afford to keep silent. The effects of personal stress and social stigmas are a deadly combination. The study found that gays in anti gay communities had higher rates of heart disease  violence and suicide. What I once thought was simply a personal matter I realized had a ripple effect that went into the workplace and out into the community for every story just like mine. My choice to hide and not share who I really am may have inadvertently contributed to this exact same environment and atmosphere of discrimination. I'd always told myself there's no reason to share that I was gay  but the idea that my silence has social consequences was really driven home this year when I missed an opportunity to change the atmosphere of discrimination in my own home state of Kansas. In February  the Kansas House of  Representatives brought up a bill for vote that would have essentially allowed businesses to use religious freedom as a reason to deny gays services. A former coworker and friend of mine has a father who serves in the Kansas House of Representatives. He voted in favor of the bill  in favor of a law that would allow  businesses to not serve me. How does my friend feel about lesbian  gay  bisexual  transgender  queer and questioning people  How does her father feel  I don't know  because I was never honest  with them about who I am. And that shakes me to the core. What if I had told her my story years ago  Could she have told  her father my experience  Could I have ultimately helped change his vote  I will never know  and that made me realize I had done nothing to try to make a difference. How ironic that I work in human resources  a profession that works to welcome  connect and encourage the development of employees  a profession that advocates that the diversity of society should be reflected in the workplace  and yet I have done nothing to advocate for diversity. When I came to this company one year ago  I thought to myself  this company  has anti discrimination policies that protect gay  lesbian  bisexual and transgender people. Their commitment to diversity is evident through their global inclusion programs. When I walk through the doors of this company  I will finally come out. But I didn't. Instead of taking advantage of the opportunity  I did nothing. When I was looking through my London journal and scrapbook from my London semester abroad    years ago  I came across this modified quote from Toni Morrison's book   Paradise.   There are more scary things inside than outside.  And then I wrote a note to myself at the bottom   Remember this.  I'm sure I was trying to encourage myself to get out and explore London  but the message I missed was the need  to start exploring and embracing myself. What I didn't realize until all these years later is that the biggest obstacles I will ever have to overcome are my own fears and insecurities. I believe that by facing my fears inside  I will be able to change reality outside. I made a choice today to reveal a part of myself that I have hidden for too long. I hope that this means I will never hide again  and I hope that by coming out today  I can do something to change the data and also to help others who feel different be more themselves and more fulfilled in both their professional and personal lives. Thank you. On June           precisely at      in a balmy winter afternoon in S o Paulo  Brazil  a typical South American winter afternoon  this kid  this young man  that you see celebrating here like he had scored a goal  Juliano Pinto     years old  accomplished a magnificent deed. Despite being paralyzed and not having any sensation from mid chest to the tip of his toes as the result of a car crash six years ago that killed his brother and produced a complete spinal cord lesion that left Juliano in a wheelchair  Juliano rose to the occasion  and on this day did something that pretty much everybody that saw him  in the six years deemed impossible. Juliano Pinto delivered the opening kick of the      Brazilian  World Soccer Cup here just by thinking. He could not move his body  but he could imagine the movements needed to kick a ball. He was an athlete before the lesion. He's a para athlete right now. He's going to be in the Paralympic Games  I hope  in a couple years. But what the spinal cord lesion  did not rob from Juliano was his ability to dream. And dream he did that afternoon  for a stadium of about        people and an audience of close to a billion watching on TV. And that kick crowned  basically     years of basic research studying how the brain  how this amazing universe that we have between our ears that is only comparable to universe that we have above our head because it has about     billion elements talking to each other through electrical brainstorms  what Juliano accomplished took    years to imagine in laboratories and about    years to plan. When John Chapin and I     years ago  proposed in a paper that we would build something that we called a brain machine interface  meaning connecting a brain to devices so that animals and humans could just move these devices  no matter how far they are from their own bodies  just by imagining what they want to do  our colleagues told us that we actually needed professional help  of the psychiatry variety. And despite that  a Scot and a Brazilian persevered  because that's how we were raised in our respective countries  and for        years  we made demonstration after demonstration suggesting that this was possible. And a brain machine interface is not rocket science  it's just brain research. It's nothing but using sensors to read the electrical brainstorms that a brain is producing to generate the motor commands that have to be downloaded to the spinal cord  so we projected sensors that can read hundreds and now thousands of these brain cells simultaneously  and extract from these electrical signals the motor planning that the brain is generating to actually make us move into space. And by doing that  we converted these signals into digital commands that any mechanical  electronic  or even a virtual device can understand so that the subject can imagine what he  she or it wants to make move  and the device obeys that brain command. By sensorizing these devices with lots of different types of sensors  as you are going to see in a moment  we actually sent messages back to the brain to confirm that that voluntary motor will was being enacted  no matter where    next to the subject  next door  or across the planet. And as this message gave feedback back to the brain  the brain realized its goal  to make us move. So this is just one experiment that we published a few years ago  where a monkey  without moving its body  learned to control the movements of an avatar arm  a virtual arm that doesn't exist. What you're listening to is the sound of the brain of this monkey as it explores three different visually identical spheres in virtual space. And to get a reward  a drop of orange juice that monkeys love  this animal has to detect  select one of these objects by touching  not by seeing it  by touching it  because every time this virtual hand touches one of the objects  an electrical pulse goes back to the brain of the animal describing the fine texture of the surface of this object  so the animal can judge what is  the correct object that he has to grab  and if he does that  he gets a reward without moving a muscle. The perfect Brazilian lunch  not moving a muscle and getting your orange juice. So as we saw this happening  we actually came and proposed the idea that we had published    years ago. We reenacted this paper. We got it out of the drawers  and we proposed that perhaps we could get a human being that is paralyzed to actually use the brain machine interface to regain mobility. The idea was that if you suffered    and that can happen to any one of us. Let me tell you  it's very sudden. It's a millisecond of a collision  a car accident that transforms your life completely. If you have a complete lesion of the spinal cord  you cannot move because your brainstorms cannot reach your muscles. However  your brainstorms continue to be generated in your head. Paraplegic  quadriplegic patients dream about moving every night. They have that inside their head. The problem is how to get that code out of it and make the movement be created again. So what we proposed was  let's create a new body. Let's create a robotic vest. And that's exactly why Juliano could kick that ball just by thinking  because he was wearing the first brain controlled robotic vest that can be used by paraplegic  quadriplegic patients to move and to regain feedback. That was the original idea     years ago. What I'm going to show you is how     people from    countries all over the five continents of this beautiful Earth  dropped their lives  dropped their patents  dropped their dogs  wives  kids  school  jobs  and congregated to come to Brazil for    months to actually get this done. Because a couple years after Brazil was awarded the World Cup  we heard that the Brazilian government wanted to do something meaningful in the opening ceremony in the country that reinvented and perfected soccer until we met the Germans  of course. But that's a different talk  and a different neuroscientist needs to talk about that. But what Brazil wanted to do is to showcase a completely different country  a country that values science and technology  and can give a gift to millions     million people around the world that cannot move any longer because of a spinal cord injury. Well  we went to the Brazilian government and to FIFA and proposed  well  let's have the kickoff of the      World Cup be given by a Brazilian paraplegic using a brain controlled exoskeleton that allows him to kick the ball and to feel the contact of the ball. They looked at us  thought that we were completely nuts  and said   Okay  let's try.  We had    months to do everything from zero  from scratch. We had no exoskeleton  we had no patients  we had nothing done. These people came all together and in    months  we got eight patients in a routine of training and basically built from nothing this guy  that we call Bra Santos Dumont  . The first brain controlled exoskeleton to be built was named after the most famous Brazilian scientist ever  Alberto Santos Dumont  who  on October           created and flew himself the first controlled airship on air in Paris for a million people to see. Sorry  my American friends  I live in North Carolina  but it was two years before the Wright Brothers flew on the coast of North Carolina. Flight control is Brazilian.  Laughter  So we went together with these guys and we basically put this exoskeleton together     degrees of freedom  hydraulic machine that can be commanded by brain signals recorded by a non invasive technology called electroencephalography that can basically allow the patient to imagine the movements and send his commands to the controls  the motors  and get it done. This exoskeleton was covered with an artificial skin invented by Gordon Cheng  one of my greatest friends  in Munich  to allow sensation from the joints moving and the foot touching the ground to be delivered back to the patient through a vest  a shirt. It is a smart shirt with micro vibrating elements that basically delivers the feedback and fools the patient's brain by creating a sensation that it is not a machine that is carrying him  but it is he who is walking again. So we got this going  and what you'll see here is the first time one of our patients  Bruno  actually walked. And he takes a few seconds because we are setting everything  and you are going to see a blue light cutting in front of the helmet because Bruno is going to imagine the movement that needs to be performed  the computer is going to analyze it  Bruno is going to certify it  and when it is certified  the device starts moving under the command of Bruno's brain. And he just got it right  and now he starts walking. After nine years without being able to move  he is walking by himself. And more than that    more than just walking  he is feeling the ground  and if the speed of the exo goes up  he tells us that he is walking again on the sand of Santos  the beach resort where he used to go before he had the accident. That's why the brain is creating a new sensation in Bruno's head. So he walks  and at the end of the walk    I am running out of time already    he says   You know  guys  I need to borrow this thing from you when I get married  because I wanted to walk to the priest and see my bride and actually be there by myself. Of course  he will have it whenever he wants. And this is what we wanted to show during the World Cup  and couldn't  because for some mysterious reason  FIFA cut its broadcast in half. What you are going to see very quickly is Juliano Pinto in the exo doing the kick a few minutes before we went to the pitch and did the real thing in front of the entire crowd  and the lights you are going to see just describe the operation. Basically  the blue lights pulsating indicate that the exo is ready to go. It can receive thoughts and it can deliver feedback  and when Juliano makes the decision to kick the ball  you are going to see two streams of green and yellow light coming from the helmet and going to the legs  representing the mental commands that were taken by the exo to actually make that happen. And in basically    seconds  Juliano actually did. You can see the commands. He gets ready   the ball is set  and he kicks. And the most amazing thing is     seconds after he did that  and looked at us on the pitch  he told us  celebrating as you saw   I felt the ball.  And that's priceless. So where is this going to go  I have two minutes to tell you that it's going to the limits of your imagination. Brain actuating technology is here. This is the latest  We just published this a year ago  the first brain to brain interface that allows two animals to exchange mental messages so that one animal that sees something coming from the environment can send a mental SMS  a torpedo  a neurophysiological torpedo  to the second animal  and the second animal performs the act that he needed to perform without ever knowing what the environment was sending as a message  because the message came from the first animal's brain. So this is the first demo. I'm going to be very quick because I want to show you the latest. But what you see here is the first rat getting informed by a light that is going to show up on the left of the cage that he has to press the left cage to basically get a reward. He goes there and does it. And the same time  he is sending a mental message to the second rat that didn't see any light  and the second rat  in    percent of the times is going to press the left lever and get a reward without ever experiencing the light in the retina. Well  we took this to a little higher limit by getting monkeys to collaborate  mentally in a brain net  basically to donate their brain activity and combine them to move the virtual arm that I showed you before  and what you see here is the first time the two monkeys combine their brains  synchronize their brains perfectly to get this virtual arm to move. One monkey is controlling the x dimension  the other monkey is controlling the y dimension. But it gets a little more interesting when you get three monkeys in there and you ask one monkey to control x and y  the other monkey to control y and z  and the third one to control x and z  and you make them all play the game together  moving the arm in  D into a target to get the famous Brazilian orange juice. And they actually do. The black dot is the average of all these brains working in parallel  in real time. That is the definition of a biological computer  interacting by brain activity and achieving a motor goal. Where is this going  We have no idea. We're just scientists. We are paid to be children  to basically go to the edge and discover what is out there. But one thing I know  One day  in a few decades  when our grandchildren surf the Net just by thinking  or a mother donates her eyesight to an autistic kid who cannot see  or somebody speaks because of a brain to brain bypass  some of you will remember that it all started on a winter afternoon in a Brazilian soccer field with an impossible kick. Thank you. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Miguel  thank you for sticking to your time. I actually would have given you a couple more minutes  because there are a couple of points we want to develop  and  of course  clearly it seems that we need connected  brains to figure out where this is going. So let's connect all this together. So if I'm understanding correctly  one of the monkeys is actually getting a signal and the other monkey is reacting to that signal just because the first one is receiving it and transmitting the neurological impulse. Miguel Nicolelis   No  it's a little different. No monkey knows of the existence of the other two monkeys. They are getting a visual feedback in  D  but the task they have to accomplish is  D. They have to move an arm in three dimensions. But each monkey is only getting the two dimensions on the video screen that the monkey controls. And to get that thing done  you need at least two monkeys to synchronize their brains  but the ideal is three. So what we found out is that when one monkey starts slacking down  the other two monkeys enhance their performance to get the guy to come back  so this adjusts dynamically  but the global synchrony remains the same. Now  if you flip without telling the monkey the dimensions that each brain has to control  like this guy is controlling x and y  but he should be controlling now y and z  instantaneously  that animal's brain forgets about the old dimensions and it starts concentrating on the new dimensions. So what I need to say is that no Turing machine  no computer can predict what a brain net will do. So we will absorb technology as part of us. Technology will never absorb us. It's simply impossible. BG  How many times have you tested this  And how many times have you succeeded versus failed  MN  Oh  tens of times. With the three monkeys  Oh  several times. I wouldn't be able to talk about this here unless I had done it a few times. And I forgot to mention  because of time  that just three weeks ago  a European group just demonstrated the first man to man brain to brain connection. BG  And how does that play  MN  There was one bit of information    big ideas start in a humble way    but basically the brain activity of one subject was transmitted to a second object  all non invasive technology. So the first subject got a message  like our rats  a visual message  and transmitted it to the second subject. The second subject received a magnetic pulse in the visual cortex  or a different pulse  two different pulses. In one pulse  the subject saw something. On the other pulse  he saw something different. And he was able to verbally indicate what was the message the first subject was sending through the Internet across continents. Moderator  Wow. Okay  that's where we are going. That's the next TED Talk at the next conference. Miguel Nicolelis  thank you. MN  Thank you  Bruno. Thank you. I want to speak about  a forgotten conflict. It's a conflict that rarely hits the headlines. It happens right here  in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Now  most people outside of Africa don't know much about the war in Congo  so let me give you a couple of key facts. The Congolese conflict is the deadliest  conflict since World War II. It has caused almost four million deaths. It has destabilized most of Central Africa for the past    years. It is the largest ongoing humanitarian crisis in the world. That's why I first went to Congo in     . I was a young humanitarian aid worker  and I met this woman who was my age. She was called Isabelle. Local militias had attacked Isabelle's village. They had killed many men  raped many women. They had looted everything. And then they wanted to take Isabelle  but her husband stepped in  and he said   No  please don't take Isabelle. Take me instead.  So he had gone to the forest with the militias  and Isabelle had never seen him again. Well  it's because of people like Isabelle and her husband that I have devoted my career to studying this war that we know so little about. Although there is one story about Congo that you may have heard. It's a story about minerals and rape. Policy statements and media reports both usually focus on a primary cause of violence in Congo    the illegal exploitation and trafficking of natural resources    and on a main consequence    sexual abuse of women and girls as a weapon of war. So  not that these two issues aren't important and tragic. They are. But today I want to tell you  a different story. I want to tell you a story that emphasizes a core cause of the ongoing conflict. Violence in Congo is in large part driven by local bottom up conflicts that international peace efforts have failed to help address. The story starts from the fact that not only is Congo notable for being the world's worst ongoing humanitarian crisis  but it is also home to some of the largest international peacebuilding efforts in the world. Congo hosts the largest and most expensive United Nations peacekeeping mission in the world. It was also the site of the first European led peacekeeping mission  and for its first cases ever  the International Criminal Court chose to prosecute Congolese warlords. In       when Congo held the first  free national elections in its history  many observers thought that an end to  violence in the region had finally come. The international community lauded the  successful organization of these elections as finally an example of successful international intervention in a failed state. But the eastern provinces have continued to face massive population displacements and horrific human rights violations. Shortly before I went back there last summer  there was a horrible massacre in the province of South Kivu. Thirty three people were killed. They were mostly women and children  and many of them were hacked to death. During the past eight years  fighting in the eastern provinces has regularly reignited full scale civil and international war. So basically  every time we feel that we are on the brink of peace  the conflict explodes again. Why  Why have the massive international efforts failed to help Congo  achieve lasting peace and security  Well  my answer to this question revolves around two central observations. First  one of the main reasons for the continuation of violence in Congo is fundamentally local    and when I say local  I really mean at the level of the individual  the family  the clan  the municipality  the community  the district  sometimes the ethnic group. For instance  you remember the story of Isabelle that I told you. Well  the reason why militias had attacked Isabelle's village was because they wanted to take the land that the villagers needed to cultivate food and to survive. The second central observation is that international peace efforts have failed to help address local conflicts because of the presence of a dominant peacebuilding culture. So what I mean is that Western and African diplomats  United Nations peacekeepers  donors  the staff of most nongovernmental organizations that work with the resolution of conflict  they all share a specific way of seeing the world. And I was one of these people  and I shared this culture  so I know all too well how powerful it is. Throughout the world  and throughout conflict zones  this common culture shapes the intervener's understanding of the causes of violence as something that is primarily located in the national and international spheres. It shapes our understanding of the path toward peace as something again that requires top down intervention to address national and international tensions. And it shapes our understanding of the roles of foreign actors as engaging in national and international peace processes. Even more importantly  this common culture enables international peacebuilders to ignore the micro level tensions that often jeopardize the macro level settlements. So for instance  in Congo  because of how they are socialized and trained  United Nations officials  donors  diplomats  the staff of most nongovernmental organizations  they interpret continued fighting and massacres as a top down problem. To them  the violence they see is the consequence of tensions between President Kabila and various national opponents  and tensions between Congo  Rwanda and Uganda. In addition  these international  peacebuilders view local conflicts as simply the result of national and international tensions  insufficient state authority  and what they call the Congolese people's so called inherent penchant for violence. The dominant culture also constructs intervention at the national and international levels as the only natural and legitimate task for United Nations staffers and diplomats. And it elevates the organization of general elections  which is now a sort of cure all  as the most crucial state reconstruction mechanism over more effective state building approaches. And that happens not only in Congo but also in many other conflict zones. But let's dig deeper  into the other main sources of violence. In Congo  continuing violence is motivated not only by the national and international causes but also by longstanding bottom up agendas whose main instigators are villagers  traditional chiefs  community chiefs or ethnic leaders. Many conflicts revolve around political  social and economic stakes that are distinctively local. For instance  there is a lot of competition at the village or district level over who can be chief of village or chief of territory according to traditional law  and who can control the distribution of land and the exploitation of local mining sites. This competition often results in localized fighting  for instance in one village or territory  and quite frequently  it escalates into generalized fighting  so across a whole province  and even at times into neighboring countries. Take the conflict between Congolese  of Rwandan descent and the so called indigenous  communities of the Kivus. This conflict started in the     s during Belgian colonization  when both communities competed over access to land and to local power. Then  in       after Congolese independence  it escalated because each camp tried to align with national politicians  but still to advance their local agendas. And then  at the time of the      genocide in Rwanda  these local actors allied with Congolese and Rwandan armed groups  but still to advance their local agendas in the provinces of the Kivus. And since then  these local disputes over land and local power have fueled violence  and they have regularly jeopardized the national and international settlements. So we can wonder why in these circumstances the international peacebuilders have failed to help implement local peacebuilding programs. And the answer is that international interveners deem the resolution of grassroots conflict an unimportant  unfamiliar  and illegitimate task. The very idea of becoming involved at the local level clashes fundamentally with existing cultural norms  and it threatens key organizational interests. For instance  the very identity of the United Nations as this macro level diplomatic organization would be upended if it were to refocus on local conflicts. And the result is that neither the internal resistance to the dominant ways of working nor the external shocks have managed to convince international actors that they should reevaluate their understanding of violence and intervention. And so far  there have been only very few exceptions. There have been exceptions  but only very few exceptions  to this broad pattern. So to wrap up  the story I just told you is a story about how a dominant peacebuilding culture shapes the intervener's understanding of what the causes of violence are  how peace is made  and what interventions should accomplish. These understandings enable international peacebuilders to ignore the micro level foundations that are so necessary for sustainable peace. The resulting inattention to local conflicts leads to inadequate peacebuilding in the short term and potential war resumption in the long term. And what's fascinating is that this analysis helps us to better understand many cases of lasting conflict and international intervention failures  in Africa and elsewhere. Local conflicts fuel violence in most war and post war environments  from Afghanistan to Sudan to Timor Leste  and in the rare cases where there have been comprehensive  bottom up peacebuilding initiatives  these attempts have been successful at making peace sustainable. One of the best examples is the contrast between the relatively peaceful situation in Somaliland  which benefited from sustained grassroots peacebuilding initiatives  and the violence prevalent in the rest of Somalia  where peacebuilding has been mostly top down. And there are several other cases in which local  grassroots conflict resolution has made a crucial difference. So if we want international peacebuilding to work  in addition to any top down intervention  conflicts must be resolved from the bottom up. And again  it's not that national and international tensions don't matter. They do. And it's not that national and international peacebuilding isn't necessary. It is. Instead  it is that both macro level and micro level peacebuilding are needed to make peace sustainable  and local nongovernmental organizations  local authorities and  civil society representatives should be the main actors in the bottom up process. So of course  there are obstacles. Local actors often lack the funding and sometimes the logistical means and the technical capacity to implement effective  local peacebuilding programs. So international actors should expand their funding and support for local conflict resolution. As for Congo  what can be done  After two decades of conflict and the deaths of millions  it's clear that we need to change our approach. Based on my field research  I believe that international and Congolese actors should pay more attention to the resolution of land conflict and the promotion of inter community reconciliation. So for instance  in the province of the Kivus  the Life and Peace Institute and its Congolese partners have set up inter community forums to discuss the specifics of local conflicts over land  and these forums have found solutions to help manage the violence. That's the kind of program that is sorely needed throughout eastern Congo. It's with programs like this that we can help people like Isabelle and her husband. So these will not be magic wands  but because they take into account deeply rooted causes of the violence  they could definitely be game changers. Thank you. Hi. Today I'm going to share my personal journey with female genital mutilation  FGM. Feel free to cry  laugh  cross your legs  or do anything your body feels like doing. I'm not going to name the things your body does. I was born in Sierra Leone. Did anybody watch  Blood Diamond   If you have any thoughts    I don't have any diamonds  on me  by the way. If you have heard of Ebola  well  that's in Sierra Leone as well. I don't have Ebola. You're all safe. Don't rush to the door. Be seated. You're fine. I was checked before I got here. My grandfather had three wives. Don't ask me why a man needs more than one wife. Men  do you need more than one wife  I don't think so. There you go. He was looking for a heart attack  that's what I say. Oh yeah  he was. When I was three  war broke out in Sierra Leone in     . I remember literally going to bed one night  everything was good. The next day  I woke up  bombs were dropping everywhere  and people were trying to kill me and my family. We escaped the war and ended up in Gambia  in West Africa. Ebola is there as well. Stay away from it. While we were there as refugees  we didn't know what was going to become of us. My mom applied for refugee status. She's a wonderful  smart woman  that one  and we were lucky. Australia said  we will take you in. Good job  Aussies. Before we were meant to travel  my mom came home one day  and said   We're going on  a little holiday  a little trip.  She put us in a car  and we drove for hours and ended up in a bush in a remote area in Gambia. In this bush  we found two huts. An old lady came towards us. She was ethnic looking  very old. She had a chat with my mom  and went back. Then she came back and walked away from us into a second hut. I'm standing there thinking   This is very confusing. I don't know what's going on.  The next thing I knew  my mom took me into this hut. She took my clothes off  and then she pinned me down on the floor. I struggled and tried to get her off me  but I couldn't. Then the old lady came towards me with a rusty looking knife  one of the sharp knives  orange looking  has never seen water or sunlight before. I thought she was going to slaughter me  but she didn't. She slowly slid down my body and ended up where my vagina is. She took hold of what I now know to be my clitoris  she took that rusty knife  and started cutting away  inch by inch. I screamed  I cried  and asked my mom to get off me so this pain will stop  but all she did was say   Be quiet.  This old lady sawed away at my flesh for what felt like forever  and then when she was done  she threw that piece of flesh across the floor as if it was the most disgusting thing she's ever touched. They both got off me  and left me there bleeding  crying  and confused as to what just happened. We never talked about this again. Very soon  we found that we were coming to Australia  and this is when you had the Sydney Olympics at the time  and people said we were going to the end of the world  there was nowhere else to go after Australia. Yeah  that comforted us a bit. It took us three days to get here. We went to Senegal  then France  and then Singapore. We went to the bathroom to wash our hands. We spent    minutes opening the tap like this. Then somebody came in  slid their hand under and water came out  and we thought  is this what we're in for  Like  seriously. We got to Adelaide  small place  where literally they dumped us in Adelaide  that's what I would say. They dumped us there. We were very grateful. We settled and we liked it. We were like   We're home  we're here.  Then somebody took us to Rundle Mall. Adelaide has only one mall. It's this small place. And we saw a lot of Asian people. My mom said all of a sudden  panicking   You brought us to the wrong place. You must take us back to Australia.  Yeah. It had to be explained to her that  there were a lot of Asians in Australia and we were in the right place. So fine  it's all good. My mom then had this brilliant idea that I should go to a girls school because they were less racist. I don't know where she read  that publication.  Laughter  Never found evidence of it to this day. Six hundred white kids   and I was the only black child there. No  I was the only person with a bit of a color on me. Let me say that. Chocolate color. There were no Asians  no indigenous. All we had was some tan girls  girls who felt the need to be under the sun. It wasn't the same as my chocolate  though. Not the same. Settling in Australia was quite hard  but it became harder when I started volunteering for an organization called Women's Health Statewide  and I joined their female genital mutilation program without any awareness of what this program was actually about  or that it related to me in any way. I spent months educating nurses and doctors about what female genital mutilation was and where it was practiced  Africa  the Middle East  Asia  and now  Australia and London and America  because  as we all know  we live in a multicultural society  and people who come from those backgrounds come with their culture  and sometimes they have cultural practices that we may not agree with  but they continue to practice them. One day  I was looking at the chart of the different types of female genital mutilation  FGM  I will just say FGM for short. Type I is when they cut off the hood. Type II is when they cut off the whole clitoris and some of your labia majora  or your outer lips  and Type III is when they  cut off the whole clitoris and then they sew you up so you only have a little hole to pee and have your period. My eyes went onto Type II. Before all of this  I pretty much had amnesia. I was in so much shock  and traumatized by what had happened  I didn't remember any of it. Yes  I was aware something bad happened to me  but I had no recollection of what had happened. I knew I had a scar down there  but I thought everybody had a scar down there. This had happened to everybody else. But when I looked at Type II  it all came back to me. I remembered what was done to me. I remembered being in that hut with that old lady and my mom holding me down. Words cannot express the pain I felt  the confusion that I felt  because now I realized that  what was done to me was a terrible thing that in this society was called barbaric  it was called mutilation. My mother had said it was called circumcision  but here it was mutilation. I was thinking  I'm mutilated  I'm a mutilated person. Oh my God. And then the anger came. I was a black angry woman.  Laughter  Oh yeah. A little one  but angry nevertheless. I went home and said to my mom   You did something.  This is not the African thing to do  pointing at your mother  but hey  I was ready for any consequences.  You did something to me.  She's like   What are you talking about  Khadija   She's used to me mouthing off. I'm like   Those years ago  You circumcised me. You cut away something that belonged to me.  She said   Yes  I did. I did it for your own good. It was in your best interest. Your grandmother did it to me  and I did it to you. It's made you a woman.  I'm like   How   She said   You're empowered  Khadija. Do you get itchy down there   I'm like   No  why would I get itchy down there   She said   Well  if you were not circumcised  you would get itchy down there. Women who are not circumcised get itchy all the time. Then they sleep around with everybody. You are not going to sleep around with anybody.  And I thought  her definition of empowerment was very strange.  Laughter  That was the end of our first conversation. I went back to school. These were the days when we had  Dolly and Girlfriend magazines. There was always the sealed section. Anybody remember those sealed sections  The naughty bits  you know  Oh yeah  I love those.  Laughter  Anyway  there was always an article about pleasure and relationships and  of course  sex. But it always assumed that you had a clitoris  though  and I thought  this doesn't fit me. This doesn't talk about people like me. I don't have a clitoris. I watched TV and those women would moan like   Oh  Oh   I was like  these people and their damned clitoris. What is a woman without a clitoris supposed to do with her life  That's what I want to know. I want to do that too     Oh  Oh   and all of that. Didn't happen. So I came home once again and said to my mom   Dolly and Girlfriend said I deserve pleasure  that I should be having orgasms  and that white men should figure out how to find the clitoris.  Apparently  white men have a problem finding the clitoris. Just saying  it wasn't me. It was Dolly that said that. And I thought to myself  I had an inner joke in my head that said   I will marry a white man. He won't have that problem with me.   Laughter  So I said to my mom   Dolly and Girlfriend said I deserve pleasure  and do you know what you have taken away from me  what you have denied me  You have invaded me in the most sacred way. I want pleasure. I want to get horny  dammit  as well.  And she said to me   Who is Dolly and Girlfriend  Are they your new friends  Khadija   I was like   No  they're not. That's a magazine  mom  a magazine.  She didn't get it. We came from two different worlds. When she was growing up  not having a clitoris was the norm. It was celebrated. I was an African Australian girl. I lived in a society that was very clitoris centric. It was all about the damn clitoris  And I didn't have one  That pissed me off. So once I went through this strange phase of anger and pain and confusion  I remember booking an appointment with my therapist. Yes  I'm an African  who has a therapist. There you go. And I said to her   I was   . I was a child. I was settling in a new country  I was dealing with racism and discrimination  English is my third language  and then there it was.  I said to her   I feel like I'm not a woman because of what was done to me. I feel incomplete. Am I going to be asexual   Because from what I knew about FGM  the whole aim of it was to control the sexuality of women. It's so that we don't have any sexual desire. And I said   Am I asexual now  Will I just live the rest of my life not feeling like having sex  not enjoying sex   She couldn't answer my questions  so they went unanswered. When I started having my period around the age of     I realized I didn't have  normal periods because of FGM. My periods were heavy  they were long  and they were very painful. Then they told me I had fibroids. They're like these little balls sitting there. One was covering one of my ovaries. And there came then the big news.  We don't think you can have children  Khadija.  And once again  I was an angry black woman. I went home and I said to my mom   Your act  your action  no matter what your may defense may be     because she thought she did it out love     what you did out of love  is harming me  and it's hurting me. What do you have to say for that   She said   I did what I had to do as a mother.  I'm still waiting for an apology  by the way. Then I got married. And once again    FGM is like the gift that keeps giving. You figure that out very soon. Sex was very painful. It hurt all the time. And of course I realized  they said   You can't have kids.  I thought   Wow  is this my existence  Is this what life is all about   I'm proud to tell you  five months ago  I was told I was pregnant. I am the lucky girl. There are so many women out there who have gone through FGM who have infertility. I know a nine year old girl who has incontinence  constant infections  pain. It's that gift. It doesn't stop giving. It affects every area of your life  and this happened to me because I was born a girl in the wrong place. That's why it happened to me. I channel all that anger   all that pain  into advocacy because I needed my pain to be worth something. So I'm the director of an organization called No FGM Australia. You heard me right. Why No FGM Australia  FGM is in Australia. Two days ago  I had to call Child Protective Services  because somewhere in Australia  there's a four year old there's a four year old whose mom  is planning on performing FGM on her. That child is in kindy. I'll let that sink in  four years old. A couple of months ago  I met a lady who is married to a Malaysian man. Her husband came home one day and said he was going to take their daughters back to Malaysia to cut off their clitoris. And she said   Why   He said they were dirty. And she said   Well  you married me.  He said   Oh  this is my cultural belief.  They then went into a whole discussion where she said to him   Over my dead body will you do that to my daughters.  But imagine if this woman wasn't aware of what FGM was  if they never had that conversation  Her children would have been flown over to Malaysia and they would have come back changed for the rest of their lives. Do you know the millions of dollars it would take us to deal with an issue like that   Three children per day  in Australia are at risk of having FGM performed on them. This is an Australian problem  people. It's not an African problem. It's not a Middle Eastern problem. It's not white  it's not black  it has no color  it's everybody's problem. FGM is child abuse. It's violence against women. It's saying that women don't have a right to sexual pleasure. It says we don't have a right to our bodies. Well  I say no to that  and you know what  Bullshit. That's what I have to say to that. I am proud to say that I'm doing my part in ending FGM. What are you going to do  There may be a child in your classroom who is at risk of FGM. There may be a patient who comes to your hospital who is at risk of FGM. But this is the reality  that even in our beloved Australia  the most wonderful place in the world  children are being abused because of a culture. Culture should not be a defense for child abuse. I want ever single one of you to see FGM as an issue for you. Make it personal. It could be your daughter  your sister  your cousin. I can't fight FGM alone. I could try  but I can't. So my appeal to you is  please join me. Sign my petition on Change.org and type in Khadija  my name  and it'll come up  and sign it. The aim of that is to get support for FGM victims in Australia and to protect little girls growing up here to not have this evil done to them  because every child has a right to pleasure. Every child has a right to their bodies being left intact  and dammit  ever child has a right to a clitoris. So please join me in ending this act. My favorite quote is   All it takes for evil to prevail is for a few good men and women to do nothing.  Are you going to let this evil of female genital mutilation to prevail in Australia  I don't think so  so please join me in ensuring that it ends in my generation. Thank you. I'm a blogger  a filmmaker and a butcher  and I'll explain how these identities come together. It started four years ago  when a friend and I opened our first Ramadan fast at one of the busiest mosques in New York City. Crowds of men with beards and skullcaps were swarming the streets. It was an FBI agent's wet dream.  Laughter  But being a part of this community  we knew how welcoming this space was. For years  I'd seen photos  of this space being documented as a lifeless and cold monolith  much like the stereotypical image painted of the American Muslim experience. Frustrated by this myopic view  my friend and I had this crazy idea  Let's break our fast at a different mosque in a different state each night of Ramadan and share those stories on a blog. We called it     Mosques in    Days   and we drove to all the    states and shared stories from over     vastly different Muslim communities  ranging from the Cambodian refugees in the L.A. projects to the black Sufis living in the woods of South Carolina. What emerged was a beautiful and complicated portrait of America. The media coverage forced local journalists to revisit their Muslim communities  but what was really exciting was seeing people from around the world being inspired to take their own    mosque journey. There were even these two NFL athletes who took a sabbatical from the league to do so. And as    Mosques was blossoming around the world  I was actually stuck in Pakistan working on a film. My codirector  Omar  and I were at  a breaking point with many of our friends on how to position the film. The movie is called  These Birds Walk   and it is about wayward street kids who are struggling to find some semblance of family. We focus on the complexities of youth and family discord  but our friends kept on nudging us to comment on drones and target killings to make the film  more relevant   essentially reducing these people who have entrusted us with their stories into sociopolitical symbols. Of course  we didn't listen to them  and instead  we championed the tender gestures of love and headlong flashes of youth. The agenda behind our cinematic  immersion was only empathy  an emotion that's largely  deficient from films that come from our region of the world. And as  These Birds Walk  played at film  festivals and theaters internationally  I finally had my feet planted at home in New York  and with all the extra time and still no real money  my wife tasked me to cook more for us. And whenever I'd go to the local butcher to purchase some halal meat  something felt off. For those that don't know  halal is a term used for meat that is raised and slaughtered humanely following very strict Islamic guidelines. Unfortunately  the majority of halal meat in America doesn't rise to the standard that my faith calls for. The more I learned about these unethical practices  the more violated I felt  particularly because businesses from my own community were the ones taking advantage of my orthodoxy. So  with emotions running high  and absolutely no experience in butchery  some friends and I opened a meat store in the heart of the East Village fashion district. We call it Honest Chops  and we're reclaiming halal by sourcing organic  humanely raised animals  and by making it accessible and affordable to working class families. There's really nothing like it in America. The unbelievable part is actually that    percent of our in store customers are not even Muslim. For many  it is their first time  interacting with Islam on such an intimate level. So all these disparate projects     Laughter     are the result of a restlessness. They are a visceral response to the businesses and curators who work hard to oversimplify my beliefs and my community  and the only way to beat their machine is to play by different rules. We must fight with an inventive approach. With the trust  with the access  with the love that only we can bring  we must unapologetically reclaim our beliefs in every moving image  in every cut of meat  because if we whitewash our stories for the sake of mass appeal  not only will we fail  but we will be trumped by those with more money and more resources to tell our stories. But the call for creative courage is not for novelty or relevance. It is simply because our communities are so damn unique and so damn beautiful. They demand us to find uncompromising ways to be acknowledged and respected. Thank you. So recently  we heard a lot about how social media helps empower protest  and that's true  but after more than a decade of studying and participating in multiple social movements  I've come to realize that the way technology empowers social movements can also paradoxically help weaken them. This is not inevitable  but overcoming it requires diving deep into what makes success possible over the long term. And the lessons apply in multiple domains. Now  take Turkey's Gezi Park protests  July       which I went back to study in the field. Twitter was key to its organizing. It was everywhere in the park    well  along with a lot of tear gas. It wasn't all high tech. But the people in Turkey had already gotten used to the power of Twitter because of an unfortunate incident about a year before when military jets had bombed and killed    Kurdish smugglers near the border region  and Turkish media completely censored this news. Editors sat in their newsrooms and waited for the government to tell them what to do. One frustrated journalist could not take this anymore. He purchased his own plane ticket  and went to the village where this had occurred. And he was confronted by this scene  a line of coffins coming down a hill  relatives wailing. He later he told me how overwhelmed he felt  and didn't know what to do  so he took out his phone  like any one of us might  and snapped that picture and tweeted it out. And voila  that picture went viral and broke the censorship and forced mass media to cover it. So when  a year later  Turkey's Gezi protests happened  it started as a protest about a park being razed  but became an anti authoritarian protest. It wasn't surprising that media also censored it  but it got a little ridiculous at times. When things were so intense  when CNN International was broadcasting live from Istanbul  CNN Turkey instead was broadcasting a documentary on penguins. Now  I love penguin documentaries  but that wasn't the news of the day. An angry viewer put his two screens together and snapped that picture  and that one too went viral  and since then  people call Turkish media the penguin media.  Laughter  But this time  people knew what to do. They just took out their phones and looked for actual news. Better  they knew to go to the park and take pictures and participate and share it more on social media. Digital connectivity was used for everything from food to donations. Everything was organized partially with the help of these new technologies. And using Internet to mobilize and publicize protests actually goes back a long way. Remember the Zapatistas  the peasant uprising in the southern Chiapas region of Mexico led by the masked  pipe smoking  charismatic Subcomandante Marcos  That was probably the first movement that got global attention thanks to the Internet. Or consider Seattle '    when a multinational grassroots effort brought global attention to what was then an obscure organization  the World Trade Organization  by also utilizing these digital technologies to help them organize. And more recently  movement after movement has shaken country after country  the Arab uprisings from Bahrain to Tunisia to Egypt and more  indignados in Spain  Italy  Greece  the Gezi Park protests  Taiwan  Euromaidan in Ukraine  Hong Kong. And think of more recent initiatives  like the  BringBackOurGirls hashtags. Nowadays  a network of tweets can unleash a global awareness campaign. A Facebook page can become the hub of a massive mobilization. Amazing. But think of the moments I just mentioned. The achievements they were able to have  their outcomes  are not really proportional to the size and energy they inspired. The hopes they rightfully raised are not really matched by what they were able to have as a result in the end. And this raises a question  As digital technology makes things easier for movements  why haven't successful outcomes become more likely as well  In embracing digital platforms for activism and politics  are we overlooking some of the benefits of doing things the hard way  Now  I believe so. I believe that the rule of thumb is  Easier to mobilize does not always mean easier to achieve gains. Now  to be clear  technology does empower in multiple ways. It's very powerful. In Turkey  I watched four young college students organize a countrywide citizen journalism network called    Journos that became the central hub for uncensored news in the country. In Egypt  I saw another four young people use digital connectivity to organize the supplies and logistics for    field hospitals  very large operations  during massive clashes near Tahrir Square in     . And I asked the founder of this effort  called Tahrir Supplies  how long it took him to go from when he had the idea to when he got started.  Five minutes   he said. Five minutes. And he had no training or background in logistics. Or think of the Occupy movement which rocked the world in     . It started with a single email from a magazine  Adbusters  to        subscribers in its list. About two months after that first email  there were in the United States     ongoing occupations and protests. Less than one month after the first physical occupation in Zuccotti Park  a global protest was held in about    countries      cities. It was one of the largest global protests ever organized. Now  compare that to what the Civil Rights Movement had to do in      Alabama to protest the racially segregated bus system  which they wanted to boycott. They'd been preparing for many years and decided it was time to swing into action after Rosa Parks was arrested. But how do you get the word out    tomorrow we're going to start the boycott    when you don't have Facebook  texting  Twitter  none of that  So they had to mimeograph        leaflets by sneaking into a university duplicating room and working all night  secretly. They then used the    African American organizations that criss crossed the city to distribute those leaflets by hand. And the logistical tasks were daunting  because these were poor people. They had to get to work  boycott or no  so a massive carpool was organized  again by meeting. No texting  no Twitter  no Facebook. They had to meet almost all the time to keep this carpool going. Today  it would be so much easier. We could create a database  available rides and what rides you need  have the database coordinate  and use texting. We wouldn't have to meet all that much. But again  consider this  the Civil Rights Movement in the United States navigated a minefield of political dangers  faced repression and overcame  won major policy concessions  navigated and innovated through risks. In contrast  three years after Occupy sparked that global conversation about inequality  the policies that fueled it are still in place. Europe was also rocked by anti austerity protests  but the continent didn't shift its direction. In embracing these technologies  are we overlooking some of the benefits of slow and sustained  To understand this  I went back to Turkey about a year after the Gezi protests and I interviewed a range of people  from activists to politicians  from both the ruling party and the opposition party and movements. I found that the Gezi protesters were despairing. They were frustrated  and they had achieved much less than what they had hoped for. This echoed what I'd been hearing around the world from many other protesters that I'm in touch with. And I've come to realize that part of the problem is that today's protests have become a bit like climbing Mt. Everest with the help of    Sherpas  and the Internet is our Sherpa. What we're doing is taking the fast routes and not replacing the benefits of the slower work. Because  you see  the kind of work that went into organizing all those daunting  tedious logistical tasks did not just take care of those tasks  they also created the kind of organization that could think together collectively and make hard decisions together  create consensus and innovate  and maybe even more crucially  keep going together through differences. So when you see this March on Washington in       when you look at that picture  where this is the march where Martin Luther King gave his famous  I have a dream  speech        you don't just see a march and you don't just hear a powerful speech  you also see the painstaking  long term work that can put on that march. And if you're in power  you realize you have to take the capacity signaled by that march  not just the march  but the capacity signaled by that march  seriously. In contrast  when you look at Occupy's global marches that were organized in two weeks  you see a lot of discontent  but you don't necessarily see teeth that can bite over the long term. And crucially  the Civil Rights Movement innovated tactically from boycotts to lunch counter sit ins to pickets to marches to freedom rides. Today's movements scale up very quickly without the organizational base that can see them through the challenges. They feel a little like startups that got very big without knowing what to do next  and they rarely manage to shift tactically because they don't have the depth of capacity to weather such transitions. Now  I want to be clear  The magic is not in the mimeograph. It's in that capacity to work together  think together collectively  which can only be built over time with a lot of work. To understand all this  I interviewed a top official from the ruling party in Turkey  and I ask him   How do you do it   They too use digital technology extensively  so that's not it. So what's the secret  Well  he told me. He said the key is he never took sugar with his tea. I said  what has that got to do with anything  Well  he said  his party starts getting ready for the next election the day after the last one  and he spends all day every day meeting with voters in their homes  in their wedding parties  circumcision ceremonies  and then he meets with his colleagues to compare notes. With that many meetings every day  with tea offered at every one of them  which he could not refuse  because that would be rude  he could not take even one cube of sugar per cup of tea  because that would be many kilos of sugar  he can't even calculate how many kilos  and at that point I realized why he was speaking so fast. We had met in the afternoon  and he was already way over caffeinated. But his party won two major elections within a year of the Gezi protests with comfortable margins. To be sure  governments have different resources to bring to the table. It's not the same game  but the differences are instructive. And like all such stories  this is not a story just of technology. It's what technology allows us to do converging with what we want to do. Today's social movements want to operate informally. They do not want institutional leadership. They want to stay out of politics because they fear corruption and cooptation. They have a point. Modern representative democracies are being strangled in many countries by powerful interests. But operating this way makes it hard for them to sustain over the long term and exert leverage over the system  which leads to frustrated protesters dropping out  and even more corrupt politics. And politics and democracy without an effective challenge hobbles  because the causes that have inspired the modern recent movements are crucial. Climate change is barreling towards us. Inequality is stifling human growth and potential and economies. Authoritarianism is choking many countries. We need movements to be more effective. Now  some people have argued that the problem is today's movements are not formed of people who take as many risks as before  and that is not true. From Gezi to Tahrir to elsewhere  I've seen people put their lives and livelihoods on the line. It's also not true  as Malcolm Gladwell claimed  that today's protesters form weaker virtual ties. No  they come to these protests  just like before  with their friends  existing networks  and sometimes they do make new friends for life. I still see the friends that I made in those Zapatista convened global protests more than a decade ago  and the bonds between strangers are not worthless. When I got tear gassed in Gezi  people I didn't know helped me and one another instead of running away. In Tahrir  I saw people  protesters  working really hard to keep each other safe and protected. And digital awareness raising is great  because changing minds is the bedrock of changing politics. But movements today have to move beyond participation at great scale very fast and figure out how to think together collectively  develop strong policy proposals  create consensus  figure out the political steps and relate them to leverage  because all these good intentions and bravery and sacrifice by itself are not going to be enough. And there are many efforts. In New Zealand  a group of young people are developing a platform called Loomio for participatory decision making at scale. In Turkey     Journos are holding hack a thons so that they support communities as well as citizen journalism. In Argentina  an open source platform called DemocracyOS is bringing participation to parliaments and political parties. These are all great  and we need more  but the answer won't just be better online decision making  because to update democracy  we are going to need to innovate at every level  from the organizational to the political to the social. Because to succeed over the long term  sometimes you do need tea without sugar along with your Twitter. Thank you. When I was invited to give this talk  a couple of months ago  we discussed a number  of titles with the organizers  and a lot of different items were  kicked around and were discussed. But nobody suggested this one  and the reason for that was two months ago  Ebola was escalating exponentially and spreading over wider geographic areas than we had ever seen  and the world was terrified   concerned and alarmed by this disease  in a way we've not  seen in recent history. But today  I can stand here  and I can talk to you about beating Ebola because of people  whom you've never heard of  people like Peter Clement  a Liberian  doctor who's working in Lofa County  a place that many of you have  never heard of  probably  in Liberia. The reason that Lofa County  is so important is because about five months ago  when the epidemic was  just starting to escalate  Lofa County was right at the center   the epicenter of this epidemic. At that time  MSF and the treatment center there  they were seeing dozens of patients  every single day  and these patients  these communities were becoming more and more terrified as time went by  with this disease  and what it was doing to their families  to their communities   to their children  to their relatives. And so Peter Clement was charged with  driving that    hour long rough road from Monrovia  the capital  up to Lofa County  to try and help bring control to the escalating epidemic there. And what Peter found when he arrived was the terror that I just mentioned to you. So he sat down with the local chiefs   and he listened. And what he heard was heartbreaking. He heard about the devastation  and the desperation of people affected by this disease. He heard the heartbreaking stories about not just the damage that Ebola did to people  but what it did to families  and what it did to communities. And he listened to the local chiefs there and what they told him    They said   When our children are sick   when our children are dying  we can't hold them at a time when  we want to be closest to them. When our relatives die  we can't take care of them as our tradition demands. We are not allowed to wash  the bodies to bury them the way our communities and  our rituals demand. And for this reason  they were deeply disturbed  deeply alarmed and the entire epidemic  was unraveling in front of them. People were turning on the healthcare  workers who had come  the heroes who had come to try  and help save the community  to help work with the community  and they were unable to access them. And what happened then was  Peter explained to the leaders. The leaders listened.  They turned the tables. And Peter explained what Ebola was. He explained what the disease was. He explained what it did to their communities. And he explained that Ebola threatened  everything that made us human. Ebola means you can't hold your children the way you would in this situation. You can't bury your dead  the way that you would. You have to trust these people  in these space suits to do that for you. And ladies and gentlemen  what  happened then was rather extraordinary  The community and the health workers   Peter  they sat down together and they put together a new plan  for controlling Ebola in Lofa County. And the reason that this is such  an important story  ladies and gentlemen  is because today  this county  which is  right at the center of this epidemic you've been watching   you've been seeing in the newspapers  you've been seeing on  the television screens  today Lofa County is nearly eight weeks without seeing a single case of Ebola. Now  this doesn't mean that  the job is done  obviously. There's still a huge risk that there will be additional cases there. But what it does teach us  is that Ebola can be beaten. That's the key thing. Even on this scale  even with the rapid kind of growth that we saw in this environment here  we now know Ebola can be beaten. When communities come together  with health care workers  work together  that's when this disease can be stopped. But how did Ebola end up in Lofa County in the first place  Well  for that  we have to go back     months  to the start of this epidemic. And as many of you know   this virus went undetected  it evaded detection for three  or four months when it began. That's because this is not  a disease of West Africa  it's a disease of Central Africa   half a continent away. People hadn't seen the disease before  health workers hadn't seen  the disease before. They didn't know what  they were dealing with  and to make it  even more complicated  the virus itself was causing a symptom  a type of a presentation that wasn't classical of the disease. So people didn't even recognize  the disease  people who knew Ebola. For that reason it evaded detection  for some time  But contrary to public belief  sometimes these days  once the virus was detected   there was a rapid surge in of support. MSF rapidly set up an Ebola treatment  center  as many of you know  in the area. The World Health Organization and the partners that it works with deployed eventually hundreds of people  over the next two months to be able to help track the virus. The problem  ladies and gentlemen  is by then  this virus  well known now as Ebola   had spread too far. It had already outstripped what was  one of the largest responses that had been mounted so far to an Ebola outbreak. By the middle of the year  not just Guinea but now Sierra Leone and Liberia were also infected. As the virus was spreading geographically  the numbers were increasing and at this time  not only were  hundreds of people infected and dying of the disease  but as importantly  the front line responders  the people who had gone to try and help  the health care workers  the other  responders were also sick and dying by the dozens. The presidents of these countries  recognized the emergencies. They met right around that time   they agreed on common action and they put together an emergency  joint operation center in Conakry to try and work together to finish this disease and get it stopped  to implement the strategies we talked about. But what happened then was something  we had never seen before with Ebola. What happened then was the virus   or someone sick with the virus  boarded an airplane   flew to another country  and for the first time  we saw in another distant country the virus pop up again. This time it was in Nigeria  in the teeming metropolis of Lagos     million people. Now the virus was in that environment. And as you can anticipate   there was international alarm  international concern on a scale that  we hadn't seen in recent years caused by a disease like this. The World Health Organization immediately  called together an expert panel  looked at the situation   declared an international emergency. And in doing so  the expectation would be that there would be a huge outpouring of international assistance to help these countries which were in so much trouble and concern at that time. But what we saw was  something very different. There was some great response. A number of countries came to assist    many  many NGOs and others  as you know  but at the same time  the opposite  happened in many places. Alarm escalated  and very soon  these countries found themselves not receiving the support they needed  but increasingly isolated. What we saw was commercial airlines  stopped  flying into these countries and people who hadn't even been exposed to the virus were no longer allowed to travel. This caused not only problems  obviously   for the countries themselves  but also for the response. Those organizations that were  trying to bring people in  to try and help them respond to the outbreak  they could not get  people on airplanes  they could not get them into the  countries to be able to respond. In that situation  ladies and gentleman  a virus like Ebola takes advantage. And what we saw then was something  also we hadn't seen before. Not only did this virus  continue in the places where they'd already become infected  but then it started to escalate and we saw the case numbers that you see here  something we'd never seen before on such a scale  an exponential increase of Ebola cases not just in these countries or the areas  already infected in these countries but also spreading further and  deeper into these countries. Ladies and gentleman  this was one of the most concerning international emergencies in public health we've ever seen. And what happened in these countries then  many of you saw  again  on the television  read about in the newspapers  we saw the health system start to collapse under the weight of this epidemic. We saw the schools begin to close   markets no longer started  no longer functioned the way  that they should in these countries. We saw that misinformation and  misperceptions started to spread even faster through the communities  which became even more alarmed about the situation. They started to recoil from those people  that you saw in those space suits  as they call them   who had come to help them. And then the situation deteriorated even further. The countries had to declare a state of emergency. Large populations needed to be quarantined in some areas  and then riots broke out. It was a very  very terrifying situation. Around the world  many people began to ask  can we ever stop Ebola  when it starts to spread like this  And they started to ask  how well  do we really know this virus  The reality is we don't know  Ebola extremely well. It's a relatively modern disease in terms of what we know about it. We've known the disease only for    years  since it first popped up in Central Africa in     . But despite that  we do know many things  We know that this virus probably survives in a type of a bat. We know that it probably enters  a human population when we come in contact with a wild animal that has been infected with the virus  and probably sickened by it. Then we know that the virus spreads from person to person through contaminated body fluids. And as you've all seen  we know the horrific disease that it then causes in humans  where we see this disease cause severe fevers  diarrhea  vomiting  and then unfortunately  in    percent of the cases or often more  death. This is a very dangerous  debilitating  and deadly disease. But despite the fact that we've not known this disease for a particularly long time  and we don't know everything about it  we do know how to stop this disease. There are four things that are critical to stopping Ebola. First and foremost  the communities  have got to understand this disease  they've got to understand  how it spreads and how to stop it. And then we've got to be able to have  systems that can find every single case  every contact of those cases  and begin to track the transmission chains so that you can stop transmission. We have to have treatment centers  specialized Ebola treatment centers  where the workers can be protected as they try to provide support to the people who are infected  so that they might survive the disease. And then for those who do die  we have to ensure there is a safe  but at the same time dignified  burial process  so that there is no spread  at that time as well. So we do know how to stop Ebola  and these strategies work  ladies and gentlemen. The virus was stopped in Nigeria  by these four strategies and the people implementing  them  obviously. It was stopped in Senegal  where it had spread  and also in the other countries that were affected by this virus   in this outbreak. So there's no question that  these strategies actually work. The big question  ladies and gentlemen  was whether these strategies could work on this scale  in this situation  with so many countries affected with the kind of exponential  growth that you saw. That was the big question that we were  facing just two or three months ago. Today we know the answer to that question. And we know that answer  because of the extraordinary work of an incredible group of NGOs  of governments  of local leaders  of U.N. agencies and many humanitarian  and other organizations that came and joined the fight to try and stop Ebola in West Africa. But what had to be done there  was slightly different. These countries took those strategies  I just showed you  the community engagement  the case finding  contact tracing  etc.  and they turned them on their head. There was so much disease  they approached it differently. What they decided to do was they would  first try and slow down this epidemic by rapidly building as many beds as possible in specialized treatment centers so that they could prevent the disease from spreading from those were infected. They would rapidly build out many  many burial teams so that they could safely deal with the dead  and with that  they would try  and slow this outbreak to see if it could actually then  be controlled using the classic approach of case finding and contact tracing. And when I went to West Africa about three months ago  when I was there what I saw was extraordinary. I saw presidents opening emergency operation centers themselves against Ebola so that they could personally coordinate  and oversee and champion this surge of international support  to try and stop this disease. We saw militaries from within  those countries and from far beyond coming in to help build  Ebola treatment centers that could be used to isolate  those who were sick. We saw the Red Cross movement working with its partner agencies on the ground there to help train the communities so that they could actually safely bury their dead in a dignified manner themselves. And we saw the U.N. agencies   the World Food Program  build a tremendous air bridge that could get responders to every single corner of these countries rapidly to be able to implement the strategies that we just talked about. What we saw  ladies and gentlemen   which was probably most impressive  was this incredible work by the governments  by the leaders in these countries  with the communities  to try to ensure people  understood this disease  understood the extraordinary things they  would have to do to try and stop Ebola. And as a result  ladies and gentlemen  we saw something that we did not know only two or three months earlier  whether or not it would be possible. What we saw was  what you see now in this graph  when we took stock on December  . What we saw was we could  bend that curve  so to speak  change this exponential growth  and bring some hope back to the ability to control this outbreak. And for this reason  ladies and gentlemen  there's absolutely no question now that we can catch up with this outbreak  in West Africa and we can beat Ebola. The big question  though   that many people are asking  even when they saw this curve  they said   Well  hang on a minute    that's great you can slow it down  but can you actually drive it down to zero   We already answered that question  back at the beginning of this talk  when I spoke about Lofa County in Liberia. We told you the story how Lofa County got to a situation where they have not seen Ebola for eight weeks. But there are similar stories from  the other countries as well. From Gueckedou in Guinea  the first area where the first case was actually diagnosed. We've seen very  very few cases in the last couple of months  and here in Kenema  in Sierra Leone   another area in the epicenter  we have not seen the virus for more than a couple of weeks    way too early to declare  victory  obviously  but evidence  ladies and gentlemen  not only can the response  catch up to the disease  but this disease can be driven to zero. The challenge now  of course   is doing this on the scale needed right across these three countries  and that is a huge challenge. Because when you've been at something for this long  on this scale  two other big threats  come in to join the virus. The first of those is complacency  the risk that as this  disease curve starts to bend  the media look elsewhere   the world looks elsewhere. Complacency always a risk. And the other risk  of course  is when you've been working so hard for so long  and slept so few hours  over the past months  people are tired  people become fatigued  and these new risks  start to creep into the response. Ladies and gentlemen  I can tell you today I've just come back from West Africa. The people of these countries  the leaders of these countries  they are not complacent. They want to drive Ebola to zero  in their countries. And these people  yes  they're tired   but they are not fatigued. They have an energy  they have a courage  they have the strength  to get this finished. What they need  ladies and gentlemen  at this point  is the unwavering support of the  international community  to stand with them  to bolster and bring even more support  at this time  to get the job finished. Because finishing Ebola right now  means turning the tables on this virus  and beginning to hunt it. Remember  this virus  this whole crisis   rather  started with one case  and is going to finish with one case. But it will only finish if those countries have got enough epidemiologists  enough health workers  enough logisticians and enough other people working with them to be able to find every one  of those cases  track their contacts and make sure that this disease  stops once and for all. Ladies and gentleman  Ebola can be beaten. Now we need you to take this story out to tell it to the people who will listen and educate them  on what it means to beat Ebola  and more importantly  we need you to advocate with the people who can help us bring the resources we need to these countries  to beat this disease. There are a lot of people out there  who will survive and will thrive  in part because of what you do  to help us beat Ebola. Thank you. You've heard of your I.Q.  your general intelligence  but what's your Psy Q  How much do you know about what makes you tick  and how good are you at predicting other people's behavior or even your own  And how much of what you think you know about psychology is wrong  Let's find out by counting down the top    myths of psychology. You've probably heard it said that when it comes to their psychology  it's almost as if men are from Mars and women are from Venus. But how different are men and women really  To find out  let's start by looking at something on which men and women really do differ and plotting some psychological gender differences on the same scale. One thing men and women do really differ on is how far they can throw a ball. So if we look at the data for men here  we see what is called a normal distribution curve. A few men can throw a ball really far  and a few men not far at all  but most a kind of average distance. And women share the same distribution as well  but actually there's quite a big difference. In fact  the average man can throw a ball further than about    percent of all women. So now let's look at what some psychological gender differences look like on the same standardized scale. Any psychologist will tell you that men are better at spatial awareness than women    so things like map reading   for example    and it's true  but let's have a look at the size of this difference. It's tiny  the lines are so close together they almost overlap. In fact  the average woman is better than    percent of all men  and of course  if that was    percent  then the two genders would be exactly equal. It's worth bearing in mind that this difference and the next one I'll show you are pretty much the biggest psychological gender differences ever discovered in psychology. So here's the next one. Any psychologist will tell you that women are better with language and grammar than men. So here's performance on the standardized grammar test. There go the women. There go the men. Again  yes  women are better on average  but the lines are so close that    percent of men are better than the average woman  and again  if it was    percent  that would represent complete gender equality. So it's not really a case of Mars and Venus. It's more a case of  if anything  Mars and Snickers  basically the same  but one's maybe  slightly nuttier than the other. I won't say which. Now we've got you warmed up. Let's psychoanalyze you using the famous Rorschach inkblot test. So you can probably see two  I dunno  two bears or two people or something. But what do you think they're doing  Put your hand up if you think they're saying hello. Not many people. Okay. Put your hands up if you think they are high fiving. Okay. What if you think they're fighting  Only a few people there. Okay  so if you think they're saying hello or high fiving  then that means you're a friendly person. If you think they're fighting  you're a bit more of a  nasty  aggressive person. Are you a lover or a fighter  basically. What about this one  This isn't really a voting one  so on  three everyone shout out what you see. One  two  three.  Audience shouting  I heard hamster. Who said hamster  That was very worrying. A guy there said hamster. Well  you should see some kind of two legged animal here  and then the mirror image of them there. If you didn't  then this means that you have difficulty processing complex situations where there's a lot going on. Except  of course  it doesn't mean that at all. Rorschach inkblot tests have basically no validity when it comes to diagnosing people's personality and are not used by modern day psychologists. In fact  one recent study found that when you do try to diagnose people's personalities using Rorschach inkblot tests  schizophrenia was diagnosed in about one sixth of apparently perfectly normal participants. So if you didn't do that well on this  maybe you are not a very visual type of person. So let's do another quick quiz to find out. When making a cake  do you prefer to    so hands up for each one again    do you prefer to use a recipe book with pictures  Yeah  a few people. Have a friend talk you through  Or have a go  making it up as you go along  Quite a few people there. Okay  so if you said A  then this means that you are a visual learner and you learn best when information is presented in a visual style. If you said B  it means you're an auditory learner  that you learn best when information is presented to you in an auditory format. And if you said C  it means that you're a kinesthetic learner  that you learn best when you get stuck in and do things with your hands. Except  of course  as you've probably guessed  that it doesn't  because the whole thing is a complete myth. Learning styles are made up and are  not supported by scientific evidence. So we know this because in tightly controlled experimental studies  when learners are given material to learn either in their preferred style or an opposite style  it makes no difference at all to the amount of information that they retain. And if you think about it for just a second  it's just obvious that this has to be true. It's obvious that the best presentation format depends not on you  but on what you're trying to learn. Could you learn to drive a car  for example  just by listening to someone telling you what to do with no kinesthetic experience  Could you solve simultaneous equations by talking them through in your head and without writing them down  Could you revise  for your architecture exams using interpretive dance if you're a kinesthetic learner  No. What you need to do  is match the material to be learned to the presentation format  not you. I know many of you are A level students that will have recently gotten your GCSE results. And if you didn't quite get what you were hoping for  then you can't really blame your learning style  but one thing that you might want to think about blaming is your genes. So what this is all about is a recent study at University College London found that    percent of the variation between different students and their GCSE results was down to genetic factors. That sounds like a very precise figure  so how can we tell  Well  when we want to unpack the relative contributions of genes and the environment  what we can do is do a twin study. So identical twins share     percent of their environment and     percent of their genes  whereas non identical twins share     percent of their environment  but just like any brother and sister  share only    percent of their genes. So by comparing how similar GCSE results are in identical twins versus non identical twins  and doing some clever math  we can an idea of how much variation and performance is due to the environment and how much is due to genes. And it turns out that it's about    percent due to genes. So this isn't to undermine the hard work that you and your teachers here put in. If you didn't quite get the GCSE results that you were hoping for  then you can always try blaming your parents  or at least their genes. One thing that you shouldn't blame is being a left brained or right brained learner  because again  this is a myth. So the myth here is that the left brain is logical  it's good with equations like this  and the right brain is more creative  so the right brain is better at music. But again  this is a myth because nearly everything that you do involves nearly all parts of your brain talking together  even just the most mundane thing like having a normal conversation. However  perhaps one reason why this myth has survived is that there is a slight grain of truth to it. So a related version of the myth is that left handed people are more creative than right handed people  which kind of makes sense because your brain controls the opposite hands  so left handed people  the right side of the brain is slightly more active than the left hand side of the brain  and the idea is the right hand side is more creative. Now  it isn't true per se that left handed people are more creative than right handed people. What is true that ambidextrous people  or people who use both hands for different tasks  are more creative thinkers than one handed people  because being ambidextrous involves having both sides of the brain talk to each other a lot  which seems to be involved in creating flexible thinking. The myth of the creative left hander arises from the fact that being ambidextrous is more common amongst  left handers than right handers  so a grain of truth in the idea of the creative left hander  but not much. A related myth that you've probably heard of is that we only use    percent of our brains. This is  again  a complete myth. Nearly everything that we do  even the most mundane thing  uses nearly all of our brains. That said  it is of course true that most of us don't use our brainpower quite as well as we could. So what could we do to boost our brainpower  Maybe we could listen to a nice bit of Mozart. Have you heard of the idea of the Mozart effect  So the idea is that listening  to Mozart makes you smarter and improves your  performance on I.Q. tests. Now again  what's interesting about this myth is that although it's basically a myth  there is a grain of truth to it. So the original study found that participants who were played Mozart music for a few minutes did better on a subsequent I.Q. test than participants who simply sat in silence. But a follow up study recruited some people who liked Mozart music and then another group of people who were fans of  the horror stories of Stephen King. And they played the people the music or the stories. The people who preferred Mozart music to the stories got a bigger I.Q. boost from the Mozart than the stories  but the people who preferred the stories to the Mozart music got a bigger I.Q. boost from listening to the Stephen King stories than the Mozart music. So the truth is that listening to something that you enjoy perks you up a bit and gives you a temporary I.Q. boost on a narrow range of tasks. There's no suggestion that listening to Mozart  or indeed Stephen King stories  is going to make you any smarter in the long run. Another version of the Mozart myth is that listening to Mozart can make you not only cleverer but healthier  too. Unfortunately  this doesn't seem to be true of someone who listened to the music of Mozart almost every day  Mozart himself  who suffered from gonorrhea  smallpox  arthritis  and  what most people think eventually killed him in the end  syphilis. This suggests that Mozart should have bit more careful  perhaps  when choosing his sexual partners. But how do we choose a partner  So a myth that I have to say is sometimes spread a bit by sociologists is that our preferences in a romantic  partner are a product of our culture  that they're very culturally specific. But in fact  the data don't back this up. A famous study surveyed people from      different cultures across the globe  from Americans to Zulus  on what they look for in a partner. And in every single culture across the globe  men placed more value on physical attractiveness in a partner than did women  and in every single culture  too  women placed more importance than did men on ambition and high earning power. In every culture  too  men preferred women who were younger than themselves  an average of  I think it was  .   years  and in every culture  too  women preferred men who were older than them  so an average of  .   years  which is why we've got here  Everybody needs a Sugar Daddy.  So moving on from trying to score with a partner to trying to score in basketball or football or whatever your sport is. The myth here is that sportsmen go through hot hand streaks  Americans call them  or purple patches  we sometimes say in England  where they just can't miss  like this guy here. But in fact  what happens is that if you analyze the pattern of hits and misses statistically  it turns out that it's nearly always at random. Your brain creates patterns from the randomness. If you toss a coin  a streak of heads or tails is going  to come out somewhere in the randomness  and because the brain likes to see patterns where there are none  we look at these streaks and attribute meanings to them and say   Yeah he's really on form today   whereas actually you would get the same pattern if you were just getting hits and misses at random. So an exception to this  however  is penalty shootouts. A recent study looking at penalty shootouts in football shows that players who represent countries with a very bad record in penalty shootouts  like  for example  England  tend to be quicker to take their shots than countries with a better record  and presumably as a result  they're more likely to miss. Which raises the question of if there's any way that we could improve people's performance. And one thing you might think about doing is punishing people for their misses and seeing if that improves them. This idea  the effect that punishment can improve performance  is what participants thought they were testing in Milgram's famous learning and punishment experiment that you've probably heard about if you're a psychology student. The story goes that participants were prepared to give what they believed to be fatal electric shocks to a fellow participant when they got a question wrong  just because someone in a white coat told them to. But this story is a myth for three reasons. Firstly and most crucially  the lab coat wasn't white  it was in fact grey. Secondly  the participants were told before the study and reminded any time they raised a concern  that although the shocks were painful  they were not fatal and indeed caused no permanent damage whatsoever. And thirdly  participants didn't give the shocks just because someone in the coat told them to. When they were interviewed after the study  all the participants said that they firmly believed that the learning and punishment study served a worthy scientific purpose which would have enduring gains for science as opposed to the momentary nonfatal discomfort caused to the participants. Okay  so I've been talking for about    minutes now  and you've probably been  sitting there listening to me  analyzing my speech patterns  and body language and trying to work out if you should take any notice of what I'm saying  whether I'm telling the truth or whether I'm lying  but if so you've probably completely failed  because although we all think we can catch a liar from their body language and speech patterns  hundreds of psychological tests over the years have shown that all of us  including police officers and detectives  are basically at chance when it comes to detecting lies from body language and verbal patterns. Interestingly  there is one exception  TV appeals for missing relatives. It's quite easy to predict when the relatives are missing and when the appealers have in fact murdered the relatives themselves. So hoax appealers are more likely to shake their heads  to look away  and to make errors in their speech  whereas genuine appealers are more likely to express hope that the person will return safely and to avoid brutal language. So  for example  they might say  taken from us  rather than  killed.  Speaking of which  it's about time I killed this talk  but before I do  I just want  to give you in    seconds the overarching myth of psychology. So the myth is that psychology is just a collection of interesting theories  all of which say something useful and all of which have something to offer. What I hope to have shown you in the past few minutes is that this isn't true. What we need to do is assess psychological theories by seeing what predictions they make  whether that is that listening to Mozart makes you smarter  that you learn better when information is presented in your preferred learning style or whatever it is  all of these are testable empirical predictions  and the only way we can make progress is to test these predictions against the data in tightly controlled experimental studies. And it's only by doing so that we can hope to discover which of these theories are well supported  and which  like all the ones I've told you about today  are myths. Thank you. Some years ago  I stumbled across a simple design exercise that helps people understand and solve complex problems  and like many of these design exercises  it kind of seems trivial at first  but under deep inspection  it turns out that it reveals unexpected truths about the way that we collaborate and make sense of things. The exercise has three parts and begins with something that we all know how to do  which is how to make toast. It begins with a clean sheet of paper  a felt marker  and without using any words  you begin to draw how to make toast. And most people draw something like this. They draw a loaf of bread   which is sliced  then put into a toaster. The toast is then deposited for some time. It pops up  and then voila  After two minutes  toast and happiness. Now  over the years  I've collected many hundreds of drawings of these toasts  and some of them are very good  because they really illustrate the toast making process quite clearly. And then there are some that are  well  not so good. They really suck  actually  because you don't know what they're trying to say. Under close inspection  some reveal some aspects of toast making while hiding others. So there's some that are all about the toast  and all about the transformation of toast. And there's others that are all about the toaster  and the engineers love to draw the mechanics of this. And then there are others that are about people. It's about visualizing the experience that people have. And then there are others that are about the supply chain of making toast that goes all the way back to the store. It goes through the supply chain networks of teleportation and all the way back to the field and wheat  and one all actually goes all the way back to the Big Bang. So it's crazy stuff. But I think it's obvious that even though these drawings are really wildly different  they share a common quality  and I'm wondering if you can see it. Do you see it  What's common about these  Most drawings have nodes and links. So nodes represent the tangible objects like the toaster and people  and links represent the connections between the nodes. And it's the combination of links and nodes that produces a full systems model  and it makes our private mental models visible about how we think something works. So that's the value of these things. What's interesting about these systems models is how they reveal our various points of view. So for example  Americans make toast with a toaster. That seems obvious. Whereas many Europeans make toast with a frying pan  of course  and many students make toast with a fire. I don't really understand this. A lot of MBA students do this. So you can measure the complexity by counting the number of nodes  and the average illustration has between four and eight nodes. Less than that  the drawing seems trivial  but it's quick to understand  and more than     the drawing produces a feeling of map shock. It's too complex. So the sweet spot is between   and   . So if you want to communicate something visually  have between five and    nodes in your diagram. So though we may not be skilled at drawing  the point is that we intuitively know how to break down complex things into simple things and then  bring them back together again. So this brings us to our second part of  the exercise  which is how to make toast  but now with sticky notes or with cards. So what happens then  Well  with cards  most people tend to draw clear  more detailed  and more logical nodes. You can see the step by step analysis that takes place  and as they build up their model  they move their nodes around  rearranging them like Lego blocks. Now  though this might seem trivial  it's actually really important. This rapid iteration of expressing and then reflecting and analyzing is really the only way in which we get clarity. It's the essence of the design process. And systems theorists do tell us that the ease with which we can change a representation correlates to our willingness to improve the model. So sticky note systems are not only more fluid  they generally produce way more nodes than static drawings. The drawings are much richer. And this brings us to our third part of the exercise  which is to draw how to make toast  but this time in a group. So what happens then  Well  here's what happens. It starts out messy  and then it gets really messy  and then it gets messier  but as people refine the models  the best nodes become more prominent  and with each iteration  the model becomes clearer because people build on top of each other's ideas. What emerges is a unified systems model that integrates the diversity of everyone's individual points of view  so that's a really different outcome from what usually happens  in meetings  isn't it  So these drawings can contain    or more nodes  but participants don't feel map shock because they participate in the building of their models themselves. Now  what's also really interesting  that the groups spontaneously mix and add additional layers of organization to it. To deal with contradictions  for example  they add branching patterns and parallel patterns. Oh  and by the way  if they do it in complete silence  they do it much better and much more quickly. Really interesting    talking gets in the way. So here's some key lessons that can emerge from this. First  drawing helps us understand the situations as systems with nodes and their relationships. Movable cards produce better systems models  because we iterate much more fluidly. And then the group notes produce  the most comprehensive models because we synthesize several points of view. So that's interesting. When people work together under the right circumstances  group models are much better than individual models. So this approach works really great for drawing how to make toast  but what if you wanted to draw something more relevant or pressing  like your organizational vision  or customer experience  or long term sustainability  There's a visual revolution that's taking place as more organizations are addressing their wicked problems by collaboratively drawing them out. And I'm convinced that those who see their world as movable nodes and links really have an edge. And the practice is really pretty simple. You start with a question  you collect the nodes  you refine the nodes  you do it over again  you refine and refine and refine  and the patterns emerge  and the group gets clarity and you answer the question. So this simple act of visualizing and doing over and over again produces some really remarkable outcomes. What's really important to know is that it's the conversations that are the important aspects  not just the models themselves. And these visual frames of reference can grow to several hundreds or even thousands of nodes. So  one example is from an organization called Rodale. Big publishing company. They lost a bunch of money one year  and their executive team for three days visualized their entire practice. And what's interesting is that after visualizing the entire business  systems upon systems  they reclaimed     million dollars of revenue  and they also moved from a D rating  to an A rating from their customers. Why  Because there's alignment from the executive team. So I'm now on a mission to help organizations solve their wicked problems by using collaborative visualization  and on a site that I've produced called drawtoast.com  I've collected a bunch of best practices. and so you can learn how to run a workshop here  you can learn more about the visual language and the structure of links and nodes that you can apply to general problem solving  and download examples of various templates for unpacking the thorny problems that we all face in our organizations. So the seemingly trivial design exercise of drawing toast helps us get clear  engaged and aligned. So next time you're confronted with an interesting challenge  remember what design has to teach us. Make your ideas visible  tangible  and consequential. It's simple  it's fun  it's powerful  and I believe it's an idea worth celebrating. Thank you. I'm an artist and I cut books. This is one of my first book works. It's called  Alternate Route to Knowledge.  I wanted to create a stack of books so that somebody could come into the gallery and think they're just looking at a regular stack of books  but then as they got closer they would see this rough hole carved into it  and wonder what was happening  wonder why  and think about the material of the book. So I'm interested in the texture  but I'm more interested in the text and the images that we find within books. In most of my work  what I do is I seal the edges of a book with a thick varnish so it's creating sort of a skin on the outside of the book so it becomes a solid material  but then the pages inside are still loose  and then I carve into the surface of the book  and I'm not moving or adding anything. I'm just carving around whatever I find interesting. So everything you see within the finished piece is exactly where it was in the book before I began. I think of my work as sort of a remix  in a way  because I'm working with somebody else's material in the same way that a D.J. might be working with somebody else's music. This was a book of Raphael paintings  the Renaissance artist  and by taking his work and remixing it  carving into it  I'm sort of making it into something that's more new and more contemporary. I'm thinking also about breaking out of the box of the traditional book and pushing that linear format  and try to push the structure of the book itself so that the book can become fully sculptural. I'm using clamps and ropes and all sorts of materials  weights  in order to hold things  in place before I varnish so that I can push the form  before I begin  so that something like this can become a piece like this  which is just made from a single dictionary. Or something like this can become a piece like this. Or something like this  which who knows what that's going to be or why that's in my studio  will become a piece like this. So I think one of the reasons people are disturbed by destroying books  people don't want to rip books and nobody really wants to throw away a book  is that we think about books as living things  we think about them as a body  and they're created to relate to our body  as far as scale  but they also have the potential to continue to grow and to continue to become new things. So books really are alive. So I think of the book as a body  and I think of the book as a technology. I think of the book as a tool. And I also think of the book as a machine. I also think of the book as a landscape. This is a full set of encyclopedias that's been connected and sanded together  and as I carve through it  I'm deciding what I want to choose. So with encyclopedias  I could have chosen anything  but I specifically chose images of landscapes. And with the material itself  I'm using sandpaper and sanding the edges so not only the images suggest landscape  but the material itself suggests a landscape as well. So one of the things I do is when I'm carving through the book  I'm thinking about images  but I'm also thinking about text  and I think about them in a very similar way  because what's interesting is that when we're reading text  when we're reading a book  it puts images in our head  so we're sort of filling that piece. We're sort of creating images when we're reading text  and when we're looking at an image  we actually use language in order to understand what we're looking at. So there's sort of a yin yang that happens  sort of a flip flop. So I'm creating a piece that the viewer is completing themselves. And I think of my work as almost an archaeology. I'm excavating and I'm trying to maximize the potential and discover as much as I possibly can and exposing it within my own work. But at the same time  I'm thinking about this idea of erasure  and what's happening now that most of our information is intangible  and this idea of loss  and this idea that not only is the format constantly shifting within computers  but the information itself  now that we don't have a physical backup  has to be constantly updated in order to not lose it. And I have several dictionaries in my own studio  and I do use a computer every day  and if I need to look up a word  I'll go on the computer  because I can go directly and instantly to what I'm looking up. I think that the book was never really the right format for nonlinear information  which is why we're seeing reference books becoming the first to be  endangered or extinct. So I don't think that the book will ever really die. People think that now that we have digital technology  the book is going to die  and we are seeing things shifting and things evolving. I think that the book will evolve  and just like people said painting would die when photography and printmaking became everyday materials  but what it really allowed painting to do was it allowed painting to quit its day job. It allowed painting to not have to have that everyday chore of telling the story  and painting became free and was allowed to tell its own story  and that's when we saw Modernism emerge  and we saw painting go into different branches. And I think that's what's happening with books now  now that most of our technology  most of our information  most of our personal and cultural  records are in digital form  I think it's really allowing the book to become something new. So I think it's a very exciting time for an artist like me  and it's very exciting to see what will happen with the book in the future. Thank you. So infectious diseases  right  Infectious diseases  are still the main cause of human suffering and death  around the world. Every year  millions of people die of diseases such as T.B.  malaria  HIV  around the world  and even in the United States. Every year  thousands of Americans die of seasonal flu. Now of course  humans  we are creative. Right  We have come up with ways to protect ourselves against these diseases. We have drugs and vaccines. And we're conscious    we learn from our experiences and come up with creative solutions. We used to think we're alone in this  but now we know we're not. We're not the only medical doctors. Now we know that there's a lot of animals out there that can do it too. Most famous  perhaps  chimpanzees. Not so much different from us  they can use plants to treat their intestinal parasites. But the last few decades have shown us that other animals can do it too  elephants  porcupines  sheep  goats  you name it. And even more interesting than that is that recent discoveries are telling us that insects and other little animals with smaller brains can use medication too. The problem with infectious diseases  as we all know  is that pathogens continue to evolve  and a lot of the drugs that we have developed are losing their efficacy. And therefore  there is this great need to find new ways to discover drugs that we can use against our diseases. Now  I think that we should look at these animals  and we can learn from them how to treat our own diseases. As a biologist  I have been studying monarch butterflies for the last    years. Now  monarchs are extremely famous for their spectacular migrations from the U.S. and Canada down to Mexico every year  where millions of them come together  but it's not why I started studying them. I study monarchs because they get sick. They get sick like you. They get sick like me. And I think what they do can tell us a lot about drugs that we can develop for humans. Now  the parasites that monarchs get infected with are called ophryocystis elektroscirrha    a mouthful. What they do is they produce spores  millions of spores on the outside of the butterfly that are shown as little specks in between the scales of the butterfly. And this is really detrimental to the monarch. It shortens their lifespan  it reduces their ability to fly  it can even kill them before they're even adults. Very detrimental parasite. As part of my job  I spend a lot of time in the greenhouse growing plants  and the reason for this is that monarchs are extremely picky eaters. They only eat milkweed as larvae. Luckily  there are several species of milkweed that they can use  and all these milkweeds have cardenolides in them. These are chemicals that are toxic. They're toxic to most animals  but not to monarchs. In fact  monarchs can take up the chemicals  put it in their own bodies  and it makes them toxic against their predators  such as birds. And what they do  then  is advertise this toxicity through their beautiful warning colorations with this orange  black and white. So what I did during my job is grow plants in the greenhouse  different ones  different milkweeds. Some were toxic  including the tropical milkweed  with very high concentrations of these cardenolides. And some were not toxic. And then I fed them to monarchs. Some of the monarchs were healthy. They had no disease. But some of the monarchs were sick  and what I found is that some of these milkweeds are medicinal  meaning they reduce the disease symptoms in the monarch butterflies  meaning these monarchs can live longer when they are infected when feeding on these medicinal plants. And when I found this  I had this idea  and a lot of people said it was a crazy idea  but I thought   what if monarchs can use this  What if they can use these plants as their own form of medicine  What if they can act as medical doctors  So my team and I started doing experiments. In the first types of experiments  we had caterpillars  and gave them a choice  medicinal milkweed versus non medicinal milkweed. And then we measured how much they ate of each species over their lifetime. And the result  as so often  in science  was boring  Fifty percent of their food was medicinal. Fifty percent was not. These caterpillars didn't do anything for their own welfare. So then we moved on to adult butterflies  and we started asking the question whether it's the mothers that can medicate their offspring. Can the mothers lay their eggs on medicinal milkweed that will make their future offspring less sick  We have done these experiments now over several years  and always get the same results. What we do is we put a monarch in a big cage  a medicinal plant on one side  a non medicinal plant on the other side  and then we measure the number of eggs that the monarchs lay on each plant. And what we find when we do that is always the same. What we find is that the monarchs strongly prefer the medicinal milkweed. In other words  what these females are doing is they're laying    percent of their eggs in the medicinal milkweed. Intriguingly  what they do is they actually transmit the parasites when they're laying the eggs. They cannot prevent this. They can also not medicate themselves. But what these experiments tell us is that these monarchs  these mothers  can lay their eggs on medicinal milkweed that will make their future offspring less sick. Now  this is a really important discovery  I think  not just because it tells us something cool about nature  but also because it may tell us something more about how we should find drugs. Now  these are animals that are very small and we tend to think of them as very simple. They have tiny little brains  yet they can do this very sophisticated medication. Now  we know that even today  most of our drugs derive from natural products  including plants  and in indigenous cultures  traditional healers often look at animals to find new drugs. In this way  elephants have told us how to treat stomach upset  and porcupines have told people how to treat bloody diarrhea. What I think is important   though  is to move beyond these large brained mammals and give these guys more credit  these simple animals  these insects that we tend to think of as very  very simple with tiny little brains. The discovery that these animals can also use medication opens up completely new avenues  and I think that maybe one day  we will be treating human diseases with drugs that were first discovered by butterflies  and I think that is an amazing opportunity worth pursuing. Thank you so much. On Mondays and Thursdays  I learn how to die. I call them my terminal days. My wife Fernanda doesn't like the term  but a lot of people in my family died of melanoma cancer and my parents and grandparents had it. And I kept thinking  one day I could be sitting in front of a doctor who looks at my exams and says   Ricardo  things don't look very good. You have six months or a year to live.  And you start thinking about what you would do with this time. And you say   I'm going to spend  more time with the kids. I'm going to visit these places  I'm going to go up and down mountains and places and I'm going to do all the things I didn't do when I had the time.  But of course  we all know these are very bittersweet memories  we're going to have. It's very difficult to do. You spend a good part of the time crying  probably. So I said  I'm going to do something else. Every Monday and Thursday  I'm going use my terminal days. And I will do  during those days  whatever it is I was going to do if I had received that piece of news. When you think about    when you think about the opposite of work  we  many times  think it's leisure. And you say  ah  I need  some leisure time  and so forth. But the fact is that  leisure is a very busy thing. You go play golf and tennis  and you meet people  and you're going for lunch  and you're late for the movies. It's a very crowded thing that we do. The opposite of work is idleness. But very few of us know what to do with idleness. When you look at the way that we distribute our lives in general  you realize that in the periods in which we have a lot of money  we have very little time. And then when we finally have time  we have neither the money nor the health. So we started thinking about that as a company for the last    years. This is a complicated company with thousands of employees  hundreds of millions of dollars of business that makes rocket fuel propellent systems  runs       ATMs in Brazil  does income tax preparation for dozens of thousands. So this is not a simple business. We looked at it and we said  let's devolve to these people  let's give these people a company where we take away all the boarding school aspects of  this is when you arrive  this is how you dress  this is how you go to meetings  this is what you say  this is what you don't say  and let's see what's left. So we started this about    years ago  and we started dealing with this very issue. And so we said  look  the retirement  the whole issue of how  we distribute our graph of life. Instead of going mountain climbing when you're     why don't you do it next week  And we'll do it like this  we'll sell you back your Wednesdays for    percent of your salary. So now  if you were going to be  a violinist  which you probably weren't  you go and do this on Wednesday. And what we found    we thought  these are the older people who are going to be really interested in this program. And the average age of the first people who adhered were     of course. And so we started looking  and we said  we have to do things in a different way. So we started saying things like  why do we want to know what time you came to work  what time you left  etc.  Can't we exchange this for a contract for buying something from you  some kind of work  Why are we building these headquarters  Is it not an ego issue that we want to look solid and big and important  But we're dragging you two hours across town because of it  So we started asking questions one by one. We'd say it like this  One  How do we find people  We'd go out and try and recruit people and we'd say  look  when you come to us  we're not going to have two or three interviews and then you're going to be married to us for life. That's not how we do  the rest of our lives. So  come have your interviews. Anyone who's interested in interviewing  you will show up. And then we'll see what happens out of the intuition that rises from that  instead of just filling out the little  items of whether you're the right person. And then  come back. Spend an afternoon  spend a whole day  talk to anybody you want. Make sure we are the bride  you thought we were and not all the bullshit we put into our own ads. Slowly we went to a process  where we'd say things like  we don't want anyone to be a leader in the company if they haven't been  interviewed and approved by their future subordinates. Every six months  everyone gets  evaluated  anonymously  as a leader. And this determines whether they should continue in that leadership position  which is many times situational  as you know. And so if they don't have        percent  of a grade  they don't stay  which is probably the reason why I haven't been CEO for more than    years. And over time  we started asking other questions. We said things like  why can't people set their own salaries  What do they need to know  There's only three things  you need to know  how much people make inside the company  how much people make somewhere else in a similar business and how much we make in general to see whether we can afford it. So let's give people these three pieces of information. So we started having  in the cafeteria  a computer where you could go in  and you could ask what someone spent   how much someone makes  what they make in benefits   what the company makes  what the margins are  and so forth. And this is    years ago. As this information started  coming to people  we said things like  we don't want  to see your expense report  we don't want to know how many  holidays you're taking  we don't want to know where you work. We had  at one point     different offices around town  and we'd say  go to the one  that's closest to your house  to the customer that  you're going to visit today. Don't tell us where you are. And more  even when we had thousands of people        people  we had two people in the H.R. department  and thankfully one of them has retired. And so  the question we were asking was  how can we be taking care of people  People are the only thing we have. We can't have a department that runs after people and looks after people. So as we started finding that this worked  and we'd say  we're looking for    and this is  I think  the main thing I was looking for in the terminal days and in the company  which is  how do you set up for wisdom  We've come from an age of revolution  industrial revolution  an age of information  an age of knowledge  but we're not any closer to the age of wisdom. How we design  how do we organize  for more wisdom  So for example  many times  what's the smartest or the intelligent decision doesn't jive. So we'd say things like  let's agree that you're going to sell    widgets per week. If you sell them by Wednesday   please go to the beach. Don't create a problem for us   for manufacturing  for application  then we have to buy new companies  we have to buy our competitors  we have to do all kinds of things because you sold too many widgets. So go to the beach and start again on Monday. So the process is looking for wisdom. And in the process  of course   we wanted people to know everything  and we wanted to be truly democratic about the way we ran things. So our board had two seats open  with the same voting rights  for the first two people who showed up. And so we had cleaning ladies voting on a board meeting  which had a lot of other very important people in suits and ties. And the fact is that they kept us honest. This process  as we started looking at the people who came to us  we'd say  now wait a second  people come to us and they say  where am I supposed to sit  How am I supposed to work  Where am I going to be in   years' time  And we looked at that and we said  we have to start much earlier. Where do we start  We said  oh  kindergarten  seems like a good place. So we set up a foundation  which now has   for    years  three schools  where we started asking the same questions  how do you redesign school for wisdom  It is one thing to say  we need to recycle the teachers  we need the directors to do more. But the fact is that what we do with education is entirely obsolete. The teacher's role is entirely obsolete. Going from a math class  to biology  to   th century France is very silly. So we started thinking   what could it look like  And we put together people   including people who like education  people like Paulo Freire   and two ministers of education in Brazil and we said  if we were to design a school from scratch  what would it look like  And so we created this school  which is called Lumiar  and Lumiar  one of them is a public school  and Lumiar says the following  Let's divide this role of the teacher into two. One guy  we'll call a tutor. A tutor  in the old sense of the Greek  paideia   Look after the kid. What's happening at home  what's their moment in life  etc.. But please don't teach  because the little you know compared  to Google  we don't want to know. Keep that to yourself. Now  we'll bring in people who have two things  passion and expertise  and it could be their profession or not. And we use the senior citizens  who are    percent of the population with wisdom that nobody wants anymore. So we bring them to school and we say  teach these kids whatever you really believe in. So we have violinists teaching math. We have all kinds of things where we say  don't worry about  the course material anymore. We have approximately    great threads that go from   to   . Things like  how do we measure ourselves as humans  So there's a place for math and physics and all that there. How do we express ourselves  So there's a place for music and literature  etc.  but also for grammar. And then we have things that everyone has forgotten  which are probably the most  important things in life. The very important things in life  we know nothing about. We know nothing about love  we know nothing about death  we know nothing about why we're here. So we need a thread in school that talks about everything we don't know. So that's a big part of what we do. So over the years  we started going into other things. We'd say  why do we have to scold the kids and say  sit down and come here  and do that  and so forth. We said  let's get the kids to do  something we call a circle  which meets once a week. And we'd say  you put the rules together and then you decide what you want to do with it. So can you all hit yourself on the head  Sure  for a week  try. They came up with the very same rules that we had  except they're theirs. And then  they have the power  which means  they can and do suspend and expel kids so that we're not playing school  they really decide. And then  in this same vein  we keep a digital mosaic  because this is not constructivist or Montessori or something. It's something where we keep the Brazilian curriculum with     tiles of a mosaic  which we want to expose these kids to by the time they're   . And follow this all the time and we know how they're doing and we say  you're not interested  in this now  let's wait a year. And the kids are in groups that don't have an age category  so the six year old kid who is ready for that with an    year old  that eliminates all of the gangs and the groups and this stuff that we have  in the schools  in general. And they have a zero  to     percent grading  which they do themselves with an app every couple of hours. Until we know they're    percent of the way we'd like them to be on this issue  so that we can send them out in the world with them knowing enough about it. And so the courses are World Cup Soccer  or building a bicycle. And people will sign up for  a    day course on building a bicycle. Now  try to build a bicycle without  knowing that pi is  .    . You can't. And try  any one of you   using  .     for something. You don't know anymore. So this is lost and that's what  we try to do there  which is looking  for wisdom in that school. And that brings us back to this graph and this distribution of our life. I accumulated a lot of money  when I think about it. When you think and you say  now is the time to give back    well  if you're giving back   you took too much. I keep thinking of Warren Buffet waking up one day and finding out he has    billion dollars more than he thought he had. And he looks and he says  what am I going to do with this  And he says  I'll give it to someone who really needs this. I'll give it to Bill Gates.  Laughter  And my guy  who's my financial advisor in New York  he says  look  you're a silly guy because you would have  .  times  more money today if you had made money with money instead of sharing as you go. But I like sharing as you go better. I taught MBAs at MIT for a time and I ended up  one day  at the Mount Auburn Cemetery. It is a beautiful cemetery in Cambridge. And I was walking around. It was my birthday and I was thinking. And the first time around   I saw these tombstones and these wonderful people  who'd done great things and I thought  what do I want  to be remembered for  And I did another stroll around  and the second time  another question came to me  which did me better  which was  why do I want to be remembered at all  And that  I think   took me different places. When I was     my wife Fernanda and I sat for a whole afternoon  we had a big pit with fire  and I threw everything I had ever  done into that fire. This is a book in    languages  hundreds and hundreds of articles and DVDs  everything there was. And that did two things. One  it freed our five kids from following in our steps  our shadow    They don't know what I do. Which is good. And I'm not going to take them somewhere and say  one day  all of this will be yours. The five kids know nothing  which is good. And the second thing is  I freed myself from this anchor of past achievement or whatever. I'm free to start something new every time and to decide things from scratch in part of those terminal days. And some people would say  oh  so now you have this time  these terminal days  and so you go out and do everything. No  we've been to the beaches  so we've been to Samoa and Maldives and Mozambique  so that's done. I've climbed mountains in the Himalayas. I've gone down    meters to see  hammerhead sharks. I've spent    days on the back of a camel from Chad to Timbuktu. I've gone to the magnetic  North Pole on a dog sled. So  we've been busy. It's what I'd like to call  my empty bucket list. And with this rationale  I look at these days and I think  I'm not retired.  I don't feel retired at all. And so I'm writing a new book. We started three new companies in the last two years. I'm now working on getting this  school system for free out into the world  and I've found  very interestingly enough  that nobody wants it for free. And so I've been trying for    years to get the public system to take over this school rationale  much as the public schools we have  which has instead of    out of      as their rating  as their grades  has    out of    . But for free  nobody wants it. So maybe we'll start charging for it  and then it will go somewhere. But getting this out is one of the things we want to do. And I think what this leaves us as a message for all of you  I think is a little bit like this  We've all learned how to go on Sunday night to email and work from home. But very few of us have learned how to go to the movies on Monday afternoon. And if we're looking for wisdom  we need to learn to do that as well. And so  what we've done all of these years is very simple  is use the little tool  which is ask three whys in a row. Because the first why you always have a good answer for. The second why  it starts getting difficult. By the third why  you don't really know why you're doing what you're doing. What I want to leave you with is the seed and the thought that maybe if you do this  you will come to the question  what for  What am I doing this for  And hopefully  as a result of that  and over time  I hope that with this  and that's what I'm wishing you  you'll have a much wiser future. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  So Ricardo   you're kind of crazy. To many people  this seems crazy. And yet so deeply wise  also. The pieces I'm trying to put together are this  Your ideas are so radical. How  in business  for example  these ideas have been out for a while  probably the percentage of businesses  that have taken some of them is still quite low. Are there any times you've seen  some big company take on one of your ideas  and you've gone   Yes    Ricardo Semler  It happens. It happened about two weeks ago with Richard Branson  with his people saying  oh  I don't want to control your holidays anymore  or Netflix does a little bit of this and that  but I don't think it's very important. I'd like to see it happen maybe a little bit in a bit of a missionary zeal  but that's a very personal one. But the fact is that it takes a leap  of faith about losing control. And almost nobody who is in control is ready to take leaps of faith. It will have to come from kids  and other people who are starting companies  in a different way. CA  So that's the key thing  From your point of view the evidence is there  in the business point of view this works  but people just don't have the courage to     Whoosh  RS  They don't even have the incentive. You're running a company with a    day mandate. It's a quarterly report. If you're not good in    days  you're out. So you say   Here's a great program that  in less than one generation     And the guy says   Get out of here.  So this is the problem. CA  What you're trying to do in education seems to me incredibly profound. Everyone is bothered about their country's education system. No one thinks that we've caught up yet to a world where there's Google and all these  technological options. So you've got actual evidence now that  the kids so far going through your system  there's a dramatic increase  in performance. How do we help you move these ideas forward  RS  I think it's that problem of ideas whose time has come. And I've never been very evangelical about these things. We put it out there. Suddenly  you find people    there's a group in Japan   which scares me very much  which is called the Semlerists  and they have     companies. They've invited me. I've always been scared to go. And there is a group in Holland that has     small  Dutch companies. It's something that will flourish on its own. Part of it will be wrong   and it doesn't matter. This will find its own place. And I'm afraid of the other one  which says  this is so good you've got to do this. Let's set up a system  and put lots of money into it and then people will do it no matter what. CA  So you have asked  extraordinary questions your whole life. It seems to me that's the fuel  that's driven a lot of this. Do you have any other questions for us  for TED  for this group here  RS  I always come back  to variations of the question that my son asked me when he was three. We were sitting in a jacuzzi  and he said   Dad  why do we exist   There is no other question. Nobody has any other question. We have variations of this one question  from three onwards. So when you spend time in a company  in a bureaucracy  in an organization and you're saying  boy    how many people do you know who on their death beds said  boy  I wish I had spent more time at the office  So there's a whole thing  of having the courage now    not in a week  not in two months  not when you find out  you have something    to say  no  what am I doing this for  Stop everything. Let me do something else. And it will be okay  it will be much better than what you're doing  if you're stuck in a process. CA  So that strikes me as a profound and quite beautiful way to end this penultimate day of TED. Ricardo Semler  thank you so much. RS  Thank you so much. What's the fastest growing threat to Americans' health  Cancer  Heart attacks  Diabetes  The answer is actually none of these  it's Alzheimer's disease. Every    seconds  someone in the United States is diagnosed with Alzheimer's. As the number of Alzheimer's patients triples by the year       caring for them  as well as the rest of the aging population  will become an overwhelming societal challenge. My family has experienced firsthand the struggles of caring for an Alzheimer's patient. Growing up in a family with three generations  I've always been very close to my grandfather. When I was four years old  my grandfather and I  were walking in a park in Japan when he suddenly got lost. It was one of the scariest moments I've ever experienced in my life  and it was also the first instance that informed us that my grandfather had Alzheimer's disease. Over the past    years  his condition got worse and worse  and his wandering in particular caused my family a lot of stress. My aunt  his primary caregiver  really struggled to stay awake at night to keep an eye on him  and even then often failed to catch him leaving the bed. I became really concerned about my aunt's well being as well as my grandfather's safety. I searched extensively for a solution that could help my family's problems  but couldn't find one. Then  one night about two years ago  I was looking after my grandfather and I saw him stepping out of the bed. The moment his foot landed on the floor  I thought  why don't I put a pressure sensor on the heel of his foot  Once he stepped onto the floor and out of the bed  the pressure sensor would detect an increase in pressure caused by body weight and then wirelessly send an audible alert to the caregiver's smartphone. That way  my aunt could sleep much better at night without having to worry about my grandfather's wandering. So now I'd like to perform a demonstration of this sock. Could I please have my sock model on the stage  Great. So once the patient steps onto the floor    an alert is sent to the caregiver's smartphone. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you  sock model. So this is a drawing of my preliminary design. My desire to create a sensor based technology perhaps stemmed from my lifelong love for sensors and technology. When I was six years old  an elderly family friend fell down in the bathroom and suffered severe injuries. I became concerned about my own grandparents and decided to invent a smart bathroom system. Motion sensors would be installed inside the tiles of bathroom floors to detect the falls of elderly patients whenever they fell down in the bathroom. Since I was only six years old at the time and I hadn't graduated from kindergarten yet  I didn't have the necessary resources and  tools to translate my idea into reality  but nonetheless  my research experience really implanted in me a firm desire to use sensors to help the elderly people. I really believe that sensors can improve the quality of life of the elderly. When I laid out my plan  I realized that I faced three main challenges  first  creating a sensor  second  designing a circuit  and third  coding a smartphone app. This made me realize that my project was actually much harder to realize than I initially had thought it to be. First  I had to create a wearable sensor that was thin and flexible enough to be worn comfortably on the bottom of the patient's foot. After extensive research and testing of different materials like rubber  which I realized was too thick to be worn snugly on the bottom of the foot  I decided to print a film sensor with electrically conductive pressure sensitive ink particles. Once pressure is applied  the connectivity between the particles increases. Therefore  I could design a circuit that would measure pressure by measuring electrical resistance. Next  I had to design a wearable wireless circuit  but wireless signal transmission consumes lots of power and requires heavy  bulky batteries. Thankfully  I was able to find out about the Bluetooth low energy technology  which consumes very little power and can be driven by a coin sized battery. This prevented the system from dying in the middle of the night. Lastly  I had to code a smartphone app that would essentially transform the care giver's smartphone into a remote monitor. For this  I had to expand upon my knowledge of coding with Java and XCode and I also had to learn about how to code for Bluetooth low energy devices by watching YouTube tutorials and reading various textbooks. Integrating these components  I was able to successfully create two prototypes  one in which the sensor is embedded inside a sock  and another that's a re attachable sensor assembly that can be adhered anywhere that makes contact with the bottom of the patient's foot. I've tested the device on my grandfather for about a year now  and it's had a     percent success rate in detecting the over      known cases of his wandering. Last summer  I was able to beta test my device at several residential care facilities in California  and I'm currently incorporating the feedback to further improve the device  into a marketable product. Testing the device on a number of patients made me realize that I needed to invent solutions for people who didn't want to wear socks to sleep at night. So sensor data  collected on a vast number of patients  can be useful for improving patient care and also leading to a cure for the disease  possibly. For example  I'm currently examining correlations between the frequency of a patient's nightly wandering and his or her daily activities and diet. One thing I'll never forget is when my device first caught my grandfather's wandering out of bed at night. At that moment  I was really struck by the power of technology to change lives for the better. People living happily and healthfully    that's the world that I imagine. Thank you very much. Today I want to talk to you about the mathematics of love. Now  I think that we can all agree that mathematicians are famously excellent at finding love. But it's not just because of our dashing personalities  superior conversational skills and excellent pencil cases. It's also because we've actually done an awful lot of work into the maths of how to find the perfect partner. Now  in my favorite paper on the subject  which is entitled   Why I Don't Have a Girlfriend      Laughter     Peter Backus tries to rate his chances of finding love. Now  Peter's not a very greedy man. Of all of the available women in the U.K.  all Peter's looking for is somebody who lives near him  somebody in the right age range  somebody with a university degree  somebody he's likely to get on well with  somebody who's likely to be attractive  somebody who's likely  to find him attractive. And comes up with an estimate of    women in the whole of the UK. It's not looking very good   is it Peter  Now  just to put that into perspective  that's about     times fewer than the best estimates of how many intelligent extraterrestrial life forms there are. And it also gives Peter a   in         chance of bumping into any one of these special ladies on a given night out. I'd like to think that's why mathematicians don't really bother going on nights out anymore. The thing is that I personally don't subscribe to such a pessimistic view. Because I know  just as well as all of you do  that love doesn't really work like that. Human emotion isn't neatly ordered and rational and easily predictable. But I also know that that doesn't mean that mathematics hasn't got something that it can offer us because  love  as with most of life  is full of patterns and mathematics is  ultimately  all about the study of patterns. Patterns from predicting the weather to the fluctuations in the stock market  to the movement of the planets or the growth of cities. And if we're being honest  none of those things are exactly neatly ordered and easily predictable  either. Because I believe that mathematics is so powerful that it has the potential to offer us a new way of looking at almost anything. Even something as mysterious as love. And so  to try to persuade you of how totally amazing  excellent and relevant mathematics is  I want to give you my top three mathematically verifiable tips for love. Okay  so Top Tip     How to win at online dating. So my favorite online dating  website is OkCupid  not least because it was started by a group of mathematicians. Now  because they're mathematicians  they have been collecting data on everybody who uses their site for almost a decade. And they've been trying  to search for patterns in the way that we talk about ourselves and the way that we  interact with each other on an online dating website. And they've come up with some seriously interesting findings. But my particular favorite is that it turns out that on an online dating website  how attractive you are does not dictate how popular you are  and actually  having people think that you're ugly can work to your advantage. Let me show you how this works. In a thankfully voluntary section of OkCupid  you are allowed to rate how attractive you think people are on a scale between   and  . Now  if we compare this score   the average score  to how many messages a selection of people receive  you can begin to get a sense of how attractiveness links to popularity on an online dating website. This is the graph that the OkCupid guys have come up with. And the important thing to notice is that it's not totally true that the more attractive you are  the more messages you get. But the question arises then of what is it about people up here who are so much more popular than people down here  even though they have the same score of attractiveness  And the reason why is that it's not just  straightforward looks that are important. So let me try to illustrate their findings with an example. So if you take someone like Portia de Rossi  for example  everybody agrees that Portia de Rossi is a very beautiful woman. Nobody thinks that she's ugly  but she's not a supermodel  either. If you compare Portia de Rossi to someone like Sarah Jessica Parker  now  a lot of people   myself included  I should say  think that Sarah Jessica Parker is seriously fabulous and possibly one of the most beautiful creatures to have ever have walked  on the face of the Earth. But some other people   i.e.  most of the Internet  seem to think that she looks  a bit like a horse.  Laughter  Now  I think that if you ask people how attractive they thought Sarah Jessica Parker  or Portia de Rossi were  and you ask them to give  them a score between   and    I reckon that they'd average out to have roughly the same score. But the way that people would vote would be very different. So Portia's scores would all be clustered around the   because everybody agrees  that she's very beautiful  whereas Sarah Jessica Parker completely divides opinion. There'd be a huge spread in her scores. And actually it's this spread that counts. It's this spread that makes you more popular on an online Internet dating website. So what that means then is that if some people think that you're attractive  you're actually better off having some other people think that you're a massive minger. That's much better than everybody just thinking that you're the cute girl next door. Now  I think this begins  makes a bit more sense when you think in terms of the people who are sending these messages. So let's say that you think somebody's attractive  but you suspect that other people won't necessarily be that interested. That means there's less competition for you and it's an extra incentive for you to get in touch. Whereas compare that  to if you think somebody is attractive but you suspect that everybody  is going to think they're attractive. Well  why would you bother  humiliating yourself  let's be honest  Here's where the really interesting part comes. Because when people choose the pictures that they use on an online dating website  they often try to minimize the things that they think some people  will find unattractive. The classic example is people who are  perhaps  a little bit overweight deliberately choosing  a very cropped photo  or bald men  for example  deliberately choosing pictures where they're wearing hats. But actually this is the opposite  of what you should do if you want to be successful. You should really  instead  play up to  whatever it is that makes you different  even if you think that some people will find it unattractive. Because the people who fancy you are just going to fancy you anyway  and the unimportant losers who don't  well  they only play up to your advantage. Okay  Top Tip     How to pick the perfect partner. So let's imagine then that you're a roaring success on the dating scene. But the question arises  of how do you then convert that success into longer term happiness and in particular  how do you decide when is the right time to settle down  Now generally  it's not advisable to just cash in and marry the first person who comes along and shows you any interest at all. But  equally  you don't really  want to leave it too long if you want to maximize your  chance of long term happiness. As my favorite author   Jane Austen  puts it   An unmarried woman of seven and twenty can never hope to feel or inspire affection again.  Thanks a lot  Jane. What do you know about love  So the question is then  how do you know when  is the right time to settle down given all the people  that you can date in your lifetime  Thankfully  there's a rather delicious bit of mathematics that we can use to help us out here  called optimal stopping theory. So let's imagine then  that you start dating when you're    and ideally  you'd like to be married by the time that you're   . And there's a number of people that you could potentially date across your lifetime  and they'll be at varying  levels of goodness. Now the rules are that once  you cash in and get married  you can't look ahead to see what you could have had  and equally  you can't go back and change your mind. In my experience at least  I find that typically people don't much like being recalled years after being passed up  for somebody else  or that's just me. So the math says then that what you should do in the first    percent  of your dating window  you should just reject everybody as serious marriage potential. And then  you should pick the  next person that comes along that is better than everybody  that you've seen before. So here's the example. Now if you do this  it can be mathematically proven  in fact  that this is the best possible way of maximizing your chances  of finding the perfect partner. Now unfortunately  I have to tell you that this method does come with some risks. For instance  imagine if  your perfect partner appeared during your first    percent. Now  unfortunately   you'd have to reject them. Now  if you're following the maths  I'm afraid no one else comes along that's better than anyone you've seen before  so you have to go on  rejecting everyone and die alone. Probably surrounded by cats nibbling at your remains. Okay  another risk is   let's imagine  instead  that the first people that you dated in your first    percent are just incredibly dull  boring  terrible people. Now  that's okay  because  you're in your rejection phase  so thats fine   you can reject them. But then imagine  the next person to come along is just marginally less boring   dull and terrible than everybody that you've seen before. Now  if you are following the maths  I'm afraid you have to marry them and end up in a relationship which is  frankly  suboptimal. Sorry about that. But I do think that there's an opportunity here for Hallmark to cash in on and really cater for this market. A Valentine's Day card like this.  Laughter   My darling husband  you are marginally less terrible than the first    percent of people I dated.  It's actually more romantic than I normally manage. Okay  so this method doesn't give you a     percent success rate  but there's no other possible strategy that can do any better. And actually  in the wild  there are certain types of fish which follow and employ this exact strategy. So they reject every possible  suitor that turns up in the first    percent  of the mating season  and then they pick the next fish that comes along after that window that's  I don't know  bigger and burlier than all of the fish  that they've seen before. I also think that subconsciously  humans  we do sort of do this anyway. We give ourselves a little bit of time to play the field  get a feel for the marketplace  or whatever when we're young. And then we only start looking seriously at potential marriage candidates once we hit our mid to late   s. I think this is conclusive proof  if ever it were needed  that everybody's brains are prewired  to be just a little bit mathematical. Okay  so that was Top Tip   . Now  Top Tip     How to avoid divorce. Okay  so let's imagine then that you picked your perfect partner and you're settling into a lifelong relationship with them. Now  I like to think that everybody would ideally like to avoid divorce  apart from  I don't know   Piers Morgan's wife  maybe  But it's a sad fact of modern life that   in   marriages in the States ends in divorce  with the rest of the world not being far behind. Now  you can be forgiven  perhaps for thinking that the arguments that precede a marital breakup are not an ideal candidate for mathematical investigation. For one thing  it's very hard to know what you should be measuring  or what you should be quantifying. But this didn't stop a psychologist  John Gottman  who did exactly that. Gottman observed hundreds of couples having a conversation and recorded  well   everything you can think of. So he recorded what was said  in the conversation  he recorded their skin conductivity  he recorded their facial expressions  their heart rates  their blood pressure  basically everything apart from whether or not the wife was actually always right  which incidentally she totally is. But what Gottman and his team found was that one of the most important predictors for whether or not a couple is going to get divorced was how positive or negative each  partner was being in the conversation. Now  couples that were very low risk scored a lot more positive points on Gottman's scale than negative. Whereas bad relationships  by which I mean  probably going to get divorced  they found themselves getting  into a spiral of negativity. Now just by using these very simple ideas  Gottman and his group were able to predict whether a given couple was going to get divorced with a    percent accuracy. But it wasn't until he teamed up with a mathematician  James Murray  that they really started to understand what causes these negativity spirals  and how they occur. And the results that they found I think are just incredibly impressively simple and interesting. So these equations  they predict how  the wife or husband is going to respond in their next turn of the conversation  how positive or negative they're going to be. And these equations  they depend on the mood of the person  when they're on their own  the mood of the person when they're with their partner  but most importantly  they depend on how much the husband and wife influence one another. Now  I think it's important  to point out at this stage  that these exact equations  have also been shown to be perfectly able at describing what happens between two countries in an arms race. So that    an arguing couple spiraling into negativity and teetering on the brink of divorce    is actually mathematically equivalent to the beginning of a nuclear war. But the really important term in this equation is the influence that people have on one another  and in particular  something called  the negativity threshold. Now  the negativity threshold  you can think of as how annoying the husband can be before the wife starts to get  really pissed off  and vice versa. Now  I always thought that good marriages were about compromise and understanding and allowing the person to  have the space to be themselves. So I would have thought that perhaps the most successful relationships were ones where there was a really high negativity threshold. Where couples let things go and only brought things up if  they really were a big deal. But actually  the mathematics and subsequent findings by the team have shown the exact opposite is true. The best couples  or the most successful couples  are the ones with a really low  negativity threshold. These are the couples that don't let anything go unnoticed and allow each other  some room to complain. These are the couples that are continually trying to repair their own relationship  that have a much more positive outlook on their marriage. Couples that don't let things go and couples that don't let trivial things end up being a really big deal. Now of course  it takes bit more than  just a low negativity threshold and not compromising to have a successful relationship. But I think that it's quite interesting to know that there is really mathematical evidence to say that you should never let the sun go down on your anger. So those are my top three tips of how maths can help you with love and relationships. But I hope that aside from their use as tips  they also give you a little bit of insight into the power of mathematics. Because for me  equations  and symbols aren't just a thing. They're a voice that speaks out about the incredible richness of nature and the startling simplicity in the patterns that twist and turn and warp and evolve all around us  from how the world works to how we behave. So I hope that perhaps  for just a couple of you  a little bit of insight into the mathematics of love can persuade you to have  a little bit more love for mathematics. Thank you. I grew up with my identical twin  who was an incredibly loving brother. Now  one thing about being a twin  is that it makes you an expert at spotting favoritism. If his cookie was even slightly bigger  than my cookie  I had questions. And clearly  I wasn't starving. When I became a psychologist  I began to notice favoritism of a different kind  and that is how much more we value the body than we do the mind. I spent nine years at university earning my doctorate in psychology  and I can't tell you how many people  look at my business card and say   Oh  a psychologist.  So not a real doctor   as if it should say that on my card. This favoritism we show the body  over the mind  I see it everywhere. I recently was at a friend's house  and their five year old was getting ready for bed. He was standing on a stool  by the sink brushing his teeth  when he slipped  and scratched his leg  on the stool when he fell. He cried for a minute   but then he got back up  got back on the stool  and reached out for a box of Band Aids to put one on his cut. Now  this kid could barely  tie his shoelaces  but he knew you have to cover a cut  so it doesn't become infected  and you have to care for your teeth by brushing twice a day. We all know how to maintain our physical health and how to practice dental hygiene  right  We've known it since we were five years old. But what do we know about maintaining our psychological health  Well  nothing. What do we teach our children about emotional hygiene  Nothing. How is it that we spend more time taking care of our teeth than we do our minds. Why is it that our physical health is so much more important to us than our psychological health  We sustain psychological injuries even more often than we do physical ones  injuries like failure or rejection or loneliness. And they can also get worse if we ignore them  and they can impact our lives in dramatic ways. And yet  even though there are  scientifically proven techniques we could use to treat these kinds of psychological injuries  we don't. It doesn't even occur to us  that we should.  Oh  you're feeling depressed  Just shake it off  it's all in your head.  Can you imagine saying that to somebody with a broken leg   Oh  just walk it off  it's all in your leg.  It is time we closed the gap between our physical and our psychological health. It's time we made them more equal  more like twins. Speaking of which   my brother is also a psychologist. So he's not a real doctor  either. We didn't study together  though. In fact  the hardest thing  I've ever done in my life is move across the Atlantic  to New York City to get my doctorate in psychology. We were apart then for the first time in our lives  and the separation was  brutal for both of us. But while he remained among family and friends  I was alone in a new country. We missed each other terribly  but international phone calls were really expensive then and we could only afford to speak for five minutes a week. When our birthday rolled around  it was the first we wouldn't be spending together. We decide to splurge  and that week we would talk for    minutes. I spent the morning pacing around my room  waiting for him to call    and waiting and waiting   but the phone didn't ring. Given the time difference  I assumed   Ok  he's out with friends   he will call later.  There were no cell phones then. But he didn't. And I began to realize that after  being away for over    months  he no longer missed me  the way I missed him. I knew he would call in the morning  but that night was one of the saddest and longest nights of my life. I woke up the next morning. I glanced down at the phone  and  I realized I had kicked it off the hook when pacing the day before. I stumbled out off bed  I put the phone back on the receiver  and it rang a second later  and it was my brother  and  boy  was he pissed. It was the saddest and longest  night of his life as well. Now I tried to explain what happened  but he said   I don't understand.  If you saw I wasn't calling you  why didn't you just pick up  the phone and call me   He was right. Why didn't I call him  I didn't have an answer then  but I do today  and it's a simple one  loneliness. Loneliness creates a deep psychological wound  one that distorts our perceptions and scrambles our thinking. It makes us believe that those around us care much less than they actually do. It make us really afraid to reach out  because why set yourself up for rejection and heartache when your heart is already aching more than you can stand  I was in the grips of real  loneliness back then  but I was surrounded by people all day  so it never occurred to me. But loneliness is defined  purely subjectively. It depends solely on whether you feel emotionally or socially disconnected from those around you. And I did. There is a lot of research on loneliness  and all of it is horrifying. Loneliness won't just make you miserable  it will kill you. I'm not kidding. Chronic loneliness increases your  likelihood of an early death by    percent. Loneliness causes high blood pressure  high cholesterol. It even suppress the functioning of your immune system  making you vulnerable to all kinds  of illnesses and diseases. In fact  scientists have concluded  that taken together  chronic loneliness poses as  significant a risk for your longterm health and  longevity as cigarette smoking. Now cigarette packs come with warnings saying   This could kill you.  But loneliness doesn't. And that's why it's so important that we prioritize our psychological health  that we practice emotional hygiene. Because you can't treat  a psychological wound if you don't even know you're injured. Loneliness isn't the only  psychological wound that distorts our perceptions  and misleads us. Failure does that as well. I once visited a day care center  where I saw three toddlers play with identical plastic toys. You had to slide the red button  and a cute doggie would pop out. One little girl tried pulling the purple button  then pushing it  and then she just sat back and looked  at the box  with her lower lip trembling. The little boy next to her  watched this happen  then turned to his box and and burst  into tears without even touching it. Meanwhile  another little girl tried  everything she could think of until she slid the red button  the cute doggie popped out  and she squealed with delight. So three toddlers with  identical plastic toys  but with very different  reactions to failure. The first two toddlers were perfectly capable of sliding a red button. The only thing that prevented them from succeeding was that their mind tricked them into believing they could not. Now  adults get tricked this way  as well  all the time. In fact  we all have a default set of  feelings and beliefs that gets triggered whenever we encounter  frustrations and setbacks. Are you aware of how  your mind reacts to failure  You need to be. Because if your mind tries to convince you you're incapable of something and you believe it  then like those two toddlers  you'll begin to feel helpless and you'll stop trying too soon  or you won't even try at all. And then you'll be even more  convinced you can't succeed. You see  that's why so many people function below their actual potential. Because somewhere along the way   sometimes a single failure convinced them that they couldn't  succeed  and they believed it. Once we become convinced of something  it's very difficult to change our mind. I learned that lesson the hard way when I was a teenager with my brother. We were driving with friends  down a dark road at night  when a police car stopped us. There had been a robbery in the area and they were looking for suspects. The officer approached the car  and he shined his flashlight on the driver  then on my brother in the front seat  and then on me. And his eyes opened wide and he said   Where have I seen your face before   And I said   In the front seat.  But that made no sense to him whatsoever. So now he thought I was on drugs. So he drags me out of the car  he searches me  he marches me over to the police car  and only when he verified I didn't have a police record  could I show him  I had a twin in the front seat. But even as we were driving away   you could see by the look on his face he was convinced that I was getting away with something. Our mind is hard to change  once we become convinced. So it might be very natural to feel demoralized and defeated after you fail. But you cannot allow yourself to become  convinced you can't succeed. You have to fight  feelings of helplessness. You have to gain control over the situation. And you have to break this kind of  negative cycle before it begins. Our minds and our feelings  they're not the trustworthy friends we thought they were. They are more like a really moody friend  who can be totally supportive one minute  and really unpleasant the next. I once worked with this woman who after    years marriage and an extremely ugly divorce  was finally ready for her first date. She had met this guy online  and he seemed nice and he seemed successful  and most importantly   he seemed really into her. So she was very excited   she bought a new dress  and they met at an upscale New York City bar for a drink. Ten minutes into the date   the man stands up and says   I'm not interested   and walks out. Rejection is extremely painful. The woman was so hurt she couldn't move.  All she could do was call a friend. Here's what the friend said   Well  what do you expect  You have big hips  you have nothing interesting to say  why would a handsome   successful man like that ever go out with a loser like you   Shocking  right  that a friend  could be so cruel  But it would be much less shocking if I told you it wasn't  the friend who said that. It's what the woman said to herself. And that's something we all do   especially after a rejection. We all start thinking of all our faults and all our shortcomings  what we wish we were   what we wish we weren't  we call ourselves names. Maybe not as harshly  but we all do it. And it's interesting that we do  because our self esteem is already hurting. Why would we want to go  and damage it even further  We wouldn't make a physical injury  worse on purpose. You wouldn't get a cut on your arm  and decide   Oh  I know  I'm going to take a knife and see how much deeper I can make it.  But we do that with psychological injuries all the time. Why  Because of poor emotional hygiene. Because we don't prioritize  our psychological health. We know from dozens of studies that when your self esteem is lower  you are more vulnerable to  stress and to anxiety  that failures and rejections hurt more and it takes longer to recover from them. So when you get rejected   the first thing you should be doing is to revive your self esteem  not  join Fight Club and beat it into a pulp. When you're in emotional pain  treat yourself with the same compassion  you would expect from a truly good friend. We have to catch our unhealthy  psychological habits and change them. One of unhealthiest and most common is called rumination. To ruminate means to chew over. It's when your boss yells at you  or your  professor makes you feel stupid in class  or you have big fight with a friend and you just can't stop replaying the scene in your head for days  sometimes for weeks on end. Ruminating about upsetting events in this way can easily become a habit  and it's a very costly one. Because by spending so much time focused on upsetting and negative thoughts  you are actually putting yourself at significant risk for developing clinical depression   alcoholism  eating disorders  and even cardiovascular disease. The problem is the urge to ruminate can feel really strong and really important  so it's a difficult habit to stop. I know this for a fact   because a little over a year ago  I developed the habit myself. You see  my twin brother was diagnosed with stage III non Hodgkin's lymphoma. His cancer was extremly aggressive. He had visible tumors all over his body. And he had to start a harsh course of chemotherapy. And I couldn't stop thinking about  what he was going through. I couldn't stop thinking about  how much he was suffering  even though he never complained  not once. He had this incredibly positive attitude. His psychological health was amazing. I was physically healthy   but psychologically I was a mess. But I knew what to do. Studies tell us that even a two minute distraction is sufficient to break the urge to ruminate in that moment. And so each time I had a worrying   upsetting  negative thought  I forced myself to concentrate on something else until the urge passed. And within one week   my whole outlook changed and became more positive  and more hopeful. Nine weeks after he started chemotherapy  my brother had a CAT scan  and I was by his side when  he got the results. All the tumors were gone. He still had three more rounds  of chemotherapy to go  but we knew he would recover. This picture was taken two weeks ago. By taking action when you're lonely  by changing your responses to failure  by protecting your self esteem  by battling negative thinking  you won't just heal your psychological wounds  you will build emotional resilience  you will thrive. A hundred years ago   people began practicing personal hygiene  and life expectancy rates rose  by over    percent in just a matter of decades. I believe our quality of life could rise just as dramatically if we all began practicing  emotional hygiene. Can you imagine what the world would be like if everyone was psychologically healthier  If there were less loneliness  and less depression  If people knew how to overcome failure  If they felt better about themselves and more empowered  If they were happier and more fulfilled  I can  because that's the world I want to live in  and that's the world my brother wants to live in as well. And if you just become informed and change a few simple habits  well  that's the world we can all live in. Thank you very much. In the mid '  s  the CDC and Kaiser Permanente discovered an exposure that dramatically increased the risk for seven out of    of the leading causes of death in the United States. In high doses  it affects brain development  the immune system  hormonal systems  and even the way our DNA is read and transcribed. Folks who are exposed in very high doses have triple the lifetime risk of heart disease and lung cancer and a    year difference in life expectancy. And yet  doctors today are not trained in routine screening or treatment. Now  the exposure I'm talking about is not a pesticide or a packaging chemical. It's childhood trauma. Okay. What kind of trauma am I talking about here  I'm not talking about failing a test or losing a basketball game. I am talking about threats that are so severe or pervasive that they literally get under our skin and change our physiology  things like abuse or neglect  or growing up with a parent  who struggles with mental illness or substance dependence. Now  for a long time  I viewed these things in the way  I was trained to view them  either as a social problem    refer to social services    or as a mental health problem    refer to mental health services. And then something happened to make me rethink my entire approach. When I finished my residency  I wanted to go someplace where I felt really needed  someplace where I could make a difference. So I came to work for California Pacific Medical Center  one of the best private hospitals in Northern California  and together  we opened a clinic in Bayview Hunters Point  one of the poorest  most underserved neighborhoods in San Francisco. Now  prior to that point  there had been only one pediatrician in all of Bayview to serve more than        children  so we hung a shingle  and we were able to provide top quality care regardless of ability to pay. It was so cool. We targeted the typical health disparities  access to care  immunization rates  asthma hospitalization rates  and we hit all of our numbers. We felt very proud of ourselves. But then I started noticing a disturbing trend. A lot of kids were being referred to me for ADHD  or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder  but when I actually did a thorough history and physical  what I found was that for most of my patients  I couldn't make a diagnosis of ADHD. Most of the kids I was seeing had experienced such severe trauma that it felt like something else was going on. Somehow I was missing something important. Now  before I did my residency  I did a master's degree in public health  and one of the things that they teach you in public health school is that if you're a doctor and you see     kids that all drink from the same well  and    of them develop diarrhea  you can go ahead and write that prescription for dose after dose after dose of antibiotics  or you can walk over and say   What the hell is in this well   So I began reading everything that I could get my hands on about how exposure to adversity affects the developing brains and bodies of children. And then one day  my colleague walked into my office  and he said   Dr. Burke  have you seen this   In his hand was a copy of a research study called the Adverse Childhood Experiences Study. That day changed my clinical practice and ultimately my career. The Adverse Childhood Experiences Study is something that everybody needs to know about. It was done by Dr. Vince Felitti at Kaiser and Dr. Bob Anda at the CDC  and together  they asked        adults about their history of exposure to what they called  adverse  childhood experiences   or ACEs. Those include physical  emotional  or sexual abuse  physical or emotional neglect  parental mental illness  substance dependence  incarceration  parental separation or divorce  or domestic violence. For every yes  you would get a point on your ACE score. And then what they did was they correlated these ACE scores against health outcomes. What they found was striking. Two things  Number one  ACEs are incredibly common. Sixty seven percent of the population had at least one ACE  and   .  percent  one in eight  had four or more ACEs. The second thing that they found was that there was a dose response relationship between ACEs and health outcomes  the higher your ACE score  the worse your health outcomes. For a person with an ACE score of four or more  their relative risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was two and a half times that of someone with an ACE score of zero. For hepatitis  it was also two and a half times. For depression  it was four and a half times. For suicidality  it was    times. A person with an ACE score of seven or more had triple the lifetime risk of lung cancer and three and a half times the risk of ischemic heart disease  the number one killer in the United States of America. Well  of course this makes sense. Some people looked at this data and they said   Come on. You have a rough childhood  you're more likely to drink and smoke and do all these things that are going to ruin your health. This isn't science. This is just bad behavior.  It turns out this is exactly where the science comes in. We now understand better than we ever have before how exposure to early adversity affects the developing brains and bodies of children. It affects areas like the nucleus accumbens  the pleasure and reward center of the brain that is implicated in substance dependence. It inhibits the prefrontal cortex  which is necessary for impulse control and executive function  a critical area for learning. And on MRI scans  we see measurable differences in the amygdala  the brain's fear response center. So there are real neurologic reasons why folks exposed to high doses of adversity are more likely to engage in high risk behavior  and that's important to know. But it turns out that even if you don't engage in any high risk behavior  you're still more likely to develop heart disease or cancer. The reason for this has to do with the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis  the brain's and body's stress response system that governs our fight or flight response. How does it work  Well  imagine you're walking in the forest and you see a bear. Immediately  your hypothalamus sends a signal to your pituitary  which sends a signal  to your adrenal gland that says   Release stress hormones  Adrenaline  Cortisol   And so your heart starts to pound  Your pupils dilate  your airways open up  and you are ready to either fight that bear or run from the bear. And that is wonderful if you're in a forest and there's a bear. But the problem is what happens when the bear comes home every night  and this system is activated over and over and over again  and it goes from being adaptive  or life saving  to maladaptive  or health damaging. Children are especially sensitive to this repeated stress activation  because their brains and bodies are just developing. High doses of adversity not only affect brain structure and function  they affect the developing immune system  developing hormonal systems  and even the way our DNA is read and transcribed. So for me  this information threw my old training out the window  because when we understand the mechanism of a disease  when we know not only which pathways are disrupted  but how  then as doctors  it is our job to use this science for prevention and treatment. That's what we do. So in San Francisco  we created the Center for Youth Wellness to prevent  screen and heal the impacts of ACEs and toxic stress. We started simply with routine screening of every one of our kids at their regular physical  because I know that if my patient  has an ACE score of    she's two and a half times as likely to develop hepatitis or COPD  she's four and half times as likely to become depressed  and she's    times as likely to attempt to take her own life as my patient with zero ACEs. I know that when she's in my exam room. For our patients who do screen positive  we have a multidisciplinary treatment team that works to reduce the dose of adversity and treat symptoms using best practices  including home visits  care coordination  mental health care  nutrition  holistic interventions  and yes  medication when necessary. But we also educate parents about the impacts of ACEs and toxic stress the same way you would for covering electrical outlets  or lead poisoning  and we tailor the care of our asthmatics and our diabetics in a way that recognizes that they may need more aggressive treatment  given the changes to their hormonal and immune systems. So the other thing that happens when you understand this science is that you want to shout it from the rooftops  because this isn't just an issue for kids in Bayview. I figured the minute that everybody else heard about this  it would be routine screening  multi disciplinary treatment teams  and it would be a race to the most effective clinical treatment protocols. Yeah. That did not happen. And that was a huge learning for me. What I had thought of as simply best clinical practice I now understand to be a movement. In the words of Dr. Robert Block  the former President of the American Academy of Pediatrics   Adverse childhood experiences are the single greatest unaddressed public health threat facing our nation today.  And for a lot of people  that's a terrifying prospect. The scope and scale of the problem seems so large that it feels overwhelming to think about how we might approach it. But for me  that's actually where the hopes lies  because when we have the right framework  when we recognize this to be a public health crisis  then we can begin to use the right  tool kit to come up with solutions. From tobacco to lead poisoning  to HIV AIDS  the United States actually has quite a strong track record with addressing public health problems  but replicating those successes with ACEs and toxic stress is going to take determination and commitment  and when I look at what our nation's response has been so far  I wonder  why haven't we taken this more seriously  You know  at first I thought that we marginalized the issue because it doesn't apply to us. That's an issue for those kids in those neighborhoods. Which is weird  because the data doesn't bear that out. The original ACEs study was done in a population that was    percent Caucasian     percent college educated. But then  the more I talked to folks  I'm beginning to think that maybe I had it completely backwards. If I were to ask how many people in this room grew up with a family member who suffered from mental illness  I bet a few hands would go up. And then if I were to ask how many folks had a parent who maybe drank too much  or who really believed that if you spare the rod  you spoil the child  I bet a few more hands would go up. Even in this room  this is an issue that touches many of us  and I am beginning to believe that we marginalize the issue because it does apply to us. Maybe it's easier to see in other zip codes because we don't want to look at it. We'd rather be sick. Fortunately  scientific advances and  frankly  economic realities make that option less viable every day. The science is clear  Early adversity dramatically affects health across a lifetime. Today  we are beginning to understand how to interrupt the progression from early adversity to disease and early death  and    years from now  the child who has a high ACE score and whose behavioral symptoms go unrecognized  whose asthma management is not connected  and who goes on to develop high blood pressure and early heart disease or cancer will be just as anomalous as a six month mortality from HIV AIDS. People will look at that situation and say   What the heck happened there   This is treatable. This is beatable. The single most important thing that we need today is the courage to look this problem in the face and say  this is real and this is all of us. I believe that we are the movement. Thank you. As an Arab female photographer  I have always found ample inspiration for my projects in personal experiences. The passion I developed for knowledge  which allowed me to break barriers towards a better life was the motivation  for my project I Read I Write. Pushed by my own experience  as I was not allowed initially to pursue my higher education  I decided to explore and document stories of other women who changed their lives through education  while exposing and questioning the barriers they face. I covered a range of topics that concern women's education  keeping in mind the differences among Arab countries due to economic and social factors. These issues include female illiteracy  which is quite high in the region  educational reforms  programs for dropout students  and political activism among university students. As I started this work  it was not always easy  to convince the women to participate. Only after explaining to them how their stories might influence other women's lives  how they would become role models for their own community  did some agree. Seeking a collaborative and reflexive approach  I asked them to write their own words and ideas on prints of their own images. Those images were then shared in some of the classrooms  and worked to inspire and motivate other women going through similar educations  and situations. Aisha  a teacher from Yemen  wrote   I sought education in order to be independent and to not count on men with everything.  One of my first subjects was Umm El Saad from Egypt. When we first met  she was barely able to write her name. She was attending a nine month literacy program run by a local NGO in the Cairo suburbs. Months later  she was joking that her husband had threatened to pull her out of the classes  as he found out that his now literate wife was going through his phone text messages. Naughty Umm El Saad. Of course  that's not why Umm El Saad joined the program. I saw how she was longing to gain control over her simple daily routines  small details that we take for granted  from counting money at the market to helping her kids in homework. Despite her poverty and her community's mindset  which belittles women's education  Umm El Saad  along with her Egyptian classmates  was eager to learn how to read and write. In Tunisia  I met Asma  one of the four activist women I interviewed. The secular bioengineering student is quite active on social media. Regarding her country  which treasured what has been called the Arab Spring  she said   I've always dreamt of discovering a new bacteria. Now  after the revolution  we have a new one every single day.  Asma was referring to the rise of religious fundamentalism in the region  which is another obstacle to women in particular. Out of all the women I met  Fayza from Yemen affected me the most. Fayza was forced to drop out of school at the age of eight when she was married. That marriage lasted for a year. At     she became the third wife of a    year old man  and by the time she was     she was a divorced mother of three. Despite her poverty  despite her social status as a divorc e in an ultra conservative society  and despite the opposition of her parents to her going back to school  Fayza knew that her only way to control her life was through education. She is now   . She received a grant from a local NGO to fund her business studies at the university. Her goal is to find a job  rent a place to live in  and bring her kids back with her. The Arab states are going through tremendous change  and the struggles women face are overwhelming. Just like the women I photographed  I had to overcome many barriers to becoming the photographer I am today  many people along the way telling me what I can and cannot do. Umm El Saad  Asma and Fayza  and many women across the Arab world  show that it is possible to overcome barriers to education  which they know is the best means to a better future. And here I would like to end with a quote by Yasmine  one of the four activist women I interviewed in Tunisia. Yasmine wrote   Question your convictions. Be who you to want to be  not who they want you to be. Don't accept their enslavement  for your mother birthed you free.  Thank you. I am multidisciplinary. As a scientist  I've been a crew commander for a NASA Mars simulation last year  and as an artist  I create multicultural community art all over the planet. And recently  I've actually been combining both. But let me first talk a little more about that NASA mission. This is the HI SEAS program. HI SEAS is a NASA funded planetary surface analogue on the Mauna Loa volcano in Hawaii  and it's a research program that is specifically designed to study the effects of long term isolation of small crews. I lived in this dome for four months with a crew of six  a very interesting experience  of course. We did all kinds of research. Our main research was actually a food study  but apart from that food study    developing a new food system for astronauts living in deep space    we also did all kinds of other research. We did extra vehicular activities  as you can see here  wearing mock up space suits  but we also had our chores and lots of other stuff to do  like questionnaires at the end of every day. Busy  busy work. Now  as you can imagine  it's quite challenging to live with just a small group of people in a small space for a long time. There's all kinds of psychological challenges  how to keep a team together in these circumstances  how to deal with the warping of time you start to sense when you're living in these circumstances  sleep problems that arise  etc. But also we learned a lot. I learned a lot about how individual crew members actually cope with a situation like this  how you can keep a crew productive and happy  for example  giving them a good deal of autonomy is a good trick to do that  and honestly  I learned a lot about leadership  because I was a crew commander. So doing this mission  I really started thinking more deeply about our future in outer space. We will venture into outer space  and we will start inhabiting outer space. I have no doubt about it. It might take    years or it might take     years  but it's going to happen nevertheless. So I came up with a new art project called Seeker. And the Seeker project is actually challenging communities all over the world to come up with starship prototypes that re envision human habitation and survival. That's the core of the project. Now  one important thing  This is not a dystopian project. This is not about   Oh my God  the world is going wrong and we have to escape because we need another future somewhere else.  No  no. The project is basically inviting people to take a step away from earthbound constraints and  as such  reimagine our future. And it's really helpful  and it works really well  so that's really the important part of what we're doing. Now  in this project  I'm using a cocreation approach  which is a slightly different approach from what you would expect from many artists. I'm essentially dropping a basic idea into a group  into a community  people start gravitating to the idea  and together  we shape  and build the artwork. It's a little bit like termites  really. We just work together  and even  for example  when architects visit what we're doing  sometimes they have a bit of a hard time understanding how we build without a master plan. We always come up with these fantastic large scale scupltures that actually we can also inhabit. The first version was done in Belgium and Holland. It was built with a team of almost    people. This is the second iteration of that same project  but in Slovenia  in a different country  and the new group was like  we're going  to do the architecture differently. So they took away the architecture  they kept the base of the artwork  and they built an entirely new  much more biomorphic architecture on top of that. And that's another crucial part of the project. It's an evolving artwork  evolving architecture. This was the last version that was just presented a few weeks ago in Holland  which was using caravans  as modules to build a starship. We bought some second hand caravans  cut them open  and reassembled them into a starship. Now  when we're thinking about starships  we're not just approaching it as a technological challenge. We're really looking at it as a combination of three systems  ecology  people and technology. So there's always a strong ecological component in the project. Here you can see aquaponic systems that are actually surrounding the astronauts  so they're constantly in contact with part of the food that they're eating. Now  a very typical thing for this project is that we run our own isolation missions inside these art and design projects. We actually lock ourselves up for multiple days on end  and test what we build. And this is  for example  on the right hand side you can see an isolation mission in the Museum of Modern Art in Ljubljana in Slovenia  where six artists and designers locked themselves up    I was part of that    for four days inside the museum. And  of course  obviously  this is a very performative and very strong experience for all of us. Now  the next version of the project is currently being developed together with Camilo Rodriguez Beltran  who is also a TED Fellow  in the Atacama Desert in Chile  a magical place. First of all  it's really considered a Mars analogue. It really does look like Mars in certain locations and has been used by NASA to test equipment. And it has a long history of being connected to space through observations of the stars. It's now home to ALMA  the large telescope that's being developed there. But also  it's the driest location on the planet  and that makes it extremely interesting to build our project  because suddenly  sustainability is something we have to explore fully. We have no other option  so I'm very curious to see what's going to happen. Now  a specific thing for this particular version of the project is that I'm very interested to see how we can connect with the local population  the native population. These people have been living there for a very long time and can be considered experts in sustainability  and so I'm very interested to see what we can learn from them  and have an input of indigenous knowledge into space exploration. So we're trying to redefine how we look at our future in outer space by exploring integration  biology  technology and people  by using a cocreation approach  and by using and exploring local traditions and to see how we can learn from the past and integrate that into our deep future. Thank you. An    year old  African American male joined the United States Air Force and was assigned to Mountain Home  Air Force Base and was a part of the air police squadron. Upon first arriving there  the first goal that I had was for me to identify an apartment  so I could bring my wife  and my new baby  Melanie  out to join me in Idaho. I immediately went to  the personnel office  and talking with the guys in personnel  they said   Hey  no problem finding  an apartment in Mountain Home  Idaho. The people down there love us  because they know if they have an airman who is coming in to rent  one of their apartments  they'll always get their money.  And that was a really important thing. He said   So here is a list  of people that you can call  and then they will then allow you  to select the apartment that you want.  So I got the list  I made the call. The lady answered on the other end and I told her what I wanted. She said   Oh  great you called. We have four or five apartments available right now.  She said   Do you want  a one bedroom or two bedroom   Then she said   Let's not talk about that. Just come on down   select the apartment that you want. We'll sign the contract and you'll have keys in your hand to get your family out here right away.  So I was excited. I jumped in my car. I went downtown and knocked on the door. When I knocked on the door   the woman came to the door  and she looked at me  and she said   Can I help you   I said   Yes  I'm the person  who called about the apartments. I was just coming down  to make my selection.  She said   You know what   I'm really sorry  but my husband rented those apartments and didn't tell me about them.  I said   You mean he rented  all five of them in one hour   She didn't give me a response  and what she said was this  She said   Why don't you leave your number  and if we have some openings   I'll give you a call   Needless to say  I did not get a call from her. Nor did I get any responses  from the other people that they gave me on the list where I could get apartments. So as a result of that  and feeling rejected  I went back to the base  and I talked to the squadron commander. His name was McDow  Major McDow. I said   Major McDow  I need your help.  I told him what happened   and here's what he said to me  He said   James  I would love to help you. But you know the problem  We can't make people rent to folks  that they don't want to rent to. And besides  we have a great relationship with people in the community and we really don't want to damage that.  He said   So maybe this is  what you should do. Why don't you let your family stay home  because you do know  that you get a    day leave. So once a year  you can go home to your family  spend    days and then come on back.  Needless to say  that didn't resonate for me. So after leaving him   I went back to personnel  and talking to the clerk  he said   Jim  I think I have a  solution for you. There's an airman who is leaving and he has a trailer. If you noticed  in Mountain Home  there are trailer parks and trailers all over the place. You can buy his trailer  and you'd probably get a really good deal because he wants to get out of town as soon as possible. And that would take care of your problem  and that would provide  the solution for you.  So I immediately jumped in my car  went downtown  saw the trailer    it was a small trailer  but under the circumstances  I figured that was the  best thing that I could do. So I bought the trailer. And then I asked him    Can I just leave the trailer here  and that would take care  of all my problems  I wouldn't have to find another trailer park   He said   Before I say yes to that   I need to check with management.  So I get back to the base  he called me back and management said   No  you can't leave the trailer here because we had promised that slot to some other people.  And that was strange to me because there were several  other slots that were open  but it just so happened that he  had promised that slot to someone else. So  what I did    and he said   You shouldn't worry  Jim  because there are a lot of trailer parks.  So I put out another exhaustive list of going to trailer parks. I went to one after another   after another. And I got the same kind of rejection there that I received when I was looking  for the apartment. And as a result  the kind of comments that they made to me  in addition to saying that they didn't have any slots open  one person said   Jim  the reason why we can't rent to you  we already have a Negro family in the trailer park.  He said   And it's not me   because I like you people.  And that's what I did  too. I chuckled  too. He said   But here's the problem  If I let you in  the other tenants  will move out and I can't afford to take that kind of a hit.  He said   I just can't rent to you.  Even though that was discouraging  it didn't stop me. I kept looking  and I looked at the far end  of the town in Mountain Home  and there was a small trailer park. I mean  a really small trailer park. It didn't have any paved roads in it  it didn't have the concrete slabs  it didn't have fencing to portion off your trailer slot  from other trailer slots. It didn't have a laundry facility. But the conclusion I reached  at that moment was that I didn't have  a lot of other options. So I called my wife  and I said   We're going to make this one work.  And we moved into it and we became homeowners in Mountain Home  Idaho. And of course  eventually things settled down. Four years after that  I received papers to move from Mountain Home  Idaho to a place called Goose Bay  Labrador. We won't even talk about that. It was another great location.  Laughter  So my challenge then was to get my family  from Mountain Home  Idaho to Sharon  Pennsylvania. That wasn't a problem because we had just purchased a brand new automobile. My mother called  and said she'll fly out. She'll be with us as we drive  she'll help us manage the children. So she came out  her and Alice  put a lot of food together for the trip. That morning  we left at about   a.m. Great trip  having a great time   good conversation. Somewhere around         o'clock  we got a little bit tired  and we said   Why don't we get a motel so that we can rest and then have an early start in the morning   So we were looking at a number  of the motels as we drove down the road  and we saw one  it was a great big  bright flashing light that said   Vacancies  Vacancies  Vacanies.  So we stopped in. They were in the parking lot   I went inside. When I walked inside  the lady was just finishing up  one contract with some folks  some other people  were coming in behind me. And so I walked to the counter  and she said   How can I help you   I said   I would like to get a motel  for the evening for my family.  She said   You know  I'm really sorry  I just rented the last one. We will not have any more  until the morning.  She said   But if you go down the road about an hour     minutes  there's another trailer park down there.  I said   Yeah  but you still have the  'Vacancies' light on  and it's flashing.  She said   Oh  I forgot.  And she reached over  and turned the light off. She looked at me and I looked at her. There were other people in the room. She kind of looked at them. No one said anything. So I just got the hint and I left  and went outside to the parking lot. And I told my mother and I told my wife and also Melanie  and I said   It looks like we're going to have to drive a little bit further down the road to be able to sleep tonight.  And we did drive down the road  but just before we took off  and pulled out of the parking lot  guess what happened  The light came back on. And it said   Vacancies   Vacancies  Vacancies.  We were able to find a nice place. It wasn't our preference  but it was secure and it was clean. And so we had a great sleep that night. The piece that's important about that is that we had similar kinds of experiences from Idaho all the way through  to Pennsylvania  where we were rejected from hotels   motels and restaurants. But we made it to Pennsylvania. We got the family settled. Everyone was glad to see the kids. I jumped on a plane and shot off to Goose Bay  Labrador  which is another story  right  Here it is     years later  I now have nine grandchildren   two great grandchildren. Five of the grandchildren are boys. I have master's  Ph.D.  undergrad  one in medical school. I have a couple that are trending. They're almost there but not quite.  Laughter  I have one who has been  in college now for eight years. He doesn't have a degree yet   but he wants to be a comedian. So we're just trying to get him to stay in school. Because you never know  just because you're funny at home  does not make you a comedian  right  But the thing about it   they're all good kids    no drugs  no babies  in high school  no crime. So with that being the backdrop  I was sitting in my TV room watching TV  and they were talking about Ferguson and all the hullabaloo that was going on. And all of a sudden  one of the news  commentators got on the air and she said   In the last three months  eight unarmed African American males have been killed by police  white homeowners  or white citizens.  For some reason  at that moment it just all hit me. I said   What is it  It is so insane. What is the hatred that's causing people  to do these kinds of things   Just then  one of my grandsons called. He said   Granddad  did you hear what they said on TV   I said   Yes  I did.  He said   I'm just so confused. We do everything we do  but it seems that driving while black  walking while black  talking while black  it's just dangerous. What can we do  We do everything that you told us to do. When stopped by the police  we place both hands on the steering wheel at the    o'clock position. If asked to get identification  we tell them  'I am slowly reaching over  into the glove compartment to get my I.D.' When pulled out of the car to be searched  when laid on the ground to be searched  when our trunks are opened to be searched  we don't push back  we don't challenge because we know  you've told us  'Don't you challenge the police. After it's over  call us and we'll be the ones to challenge.  He said   And this is the piece  that really bugs me  Our white friends  our buddies  we kind of hang together. When they hear about these kinds of things happening to us  they say  'Why do you take it  You need to push back. You need to challenge. You need to ask them  for their identification.'  And here's what the boys have been taught to tell them   We know that you can do that  but please do not do that while we're in the car because the consequences for you are significantly different than the consequences for us.  And so as a grandparent   what do I tell my grandsons  How do I keep them safe  How do I keep them alive  As a result of this  people have come to me and said   Jim  are you angry   And my response to that is this   I don't have the luxury of being angry  and I also know the consequences  of being enraged.  So therefore  the only thing that I can do is take my collective intellect and my energy and my ideas and my experiences and dedicate myself to challenge   at any point in time  anything that looks  like it might be racist. So the first thing I have  to do is to educate  the second thing I have to do  is to unveil racism  and the last thing I need to do is do everything within my power to eradicate racism in my lifetime by any means necessary. The second thing I do is this  I want to appeal to Americans. I want to appeal to their humanity  to their dignity  to their civic pride and ownership to be able to not react to these  heinous crimes in an adverse manner. But instead  to elevate your level of societal knowledge  your level of societal awareness and societal consciousness to then collectively come together  all of us come together  to make sure that we speak out against and we challenge any kind of insanity  any kind of insanity that makes it  okay to kill unarmed people  regardless of their ethnicity  regardless of their race  regardless of their diversity makeup. We have to challenge that. It doesn't make any sense. The only way I think we can do that is through a collective. We need to have black and white  and Asian and Hispanic just to step forward and say   We are not going to accept  that kind of behavior anymore.  We humans have always been very concerned about the health of our bodies  but we haven't always been that good at figuring out what's important. Take the ancient Egyptians  for example  very concerned about the body parts they thought they'd need in the afterlife  but they left some parts out. This part  for example. Although they very carefully  preserved the stomach  the lungs  the liver  and so forth  they just mushed up the brain  drained it out through the nose  and threw it away  which makes sense  really  because what does a brain do for us anyway  But imagine if there were a kind of neglected organ in our bodies that weighed just as much as the brain and in some ways was just as important to who we are  but we knew so little about and treated with such disregard. And imagine if  through new scientific advances  we were just beginning to understand its importance to how we think of ourselves. Wouldn't you want to know more about it  Well  it turns out that we do have something just like that  our gut  or rather  its microbes. But it's not just the microbes in our gut that are important. Microbes all over our body turn out to be really critical to a whole range of differences that make different people who we are. So for example  have you ever noticed how some people get bitten by mosquitos way more often than others  It turns out that everyone's anecdotal experience out camping is actually true. For example  I seldom get bitten by mosquitos  but my partner Amanda attracts them in droves  and the reason why is that we have different microbes on our skin that produce different chemicals that the mosquitos detect. Now  microbes are also really important in the field of medicine. So  for example  what microbes you have in your gut determine whether particular painkillers are toxic to your liver. They also determine whether or not other drugs will work for your heart condition. And  if you're a fruit fly  at least  your microbes determine who you want to have sex with. We haven't demonstrated this in humans yet but maybe it's just a matter of time before we find out.  Laughter  So microbes are performing a huge range of functions. They help us digest our food. They help educate our immune system. They help us resist disease  and they may even be affecting our behavior. So what would a map of all these microbial communities look like  Well  it wouldn't look exactly like this  but it's a helpful guide for understanding biodiversity. Different parts of the world have different landscapes of organisms that are immediately characteristic of one place or another or another. With microbiology  it's kind of the same  although I've got to be honest with you  All the microbes essentially look the same under a microscope. So instead of trying to identify them visually  what we do is we look at their DNA sequences  and in a project called the Human Microbiome Project  NIH funded this      million project where hundreds  of researchers came together to map out all the A's  T's  G's  and C's  and all of these microbes in the human body. So when we take them together  they look like this. It's a bit more difficult to tell who lives where now  isn't it  What my lab does is develop computational techniques that allow us to take all these terabytes of sequence data and turn them into something that's a bit more useful as a map  and so when we do that with the human microbiome data from     healthy volunteers  it looks like this. Each point here represents all the complex microbes in an entire microbial community. See  I told you they basically all look the same. So what we're looking at is each point represents one microbial community from one body site of one healthy volunteer. And so you can see that there's different parts of the map in different colors  almost like separate continents. And what it turns out to be is that those  as the different regions of the body  have very different microbes in them. So what we have is we have the oral community up there in green. Over on the other side  we have the skin community in blue  the vaginal community in purple  and then right down at the bottom  we have the fecal community in brown. And we've just over the last few years found out that the microbes in different parts of the body are amazingly different from one another. So if I look at just one person's microbes in the mouth and in the gut  it turns out that the difference between those two microbial communities is enormous. It's bigger than the difference between the microbes in this reef and the microbes in this prairie. So this is incredible when you think about it. What it means is that a few feet of difference in the human body makes more of a difference to your microbial ecology than hundreds of miles on Earth. And this is not to say that two people  look basically the same in the same body habitat  either. So you probably heard that we're pretty much all the same in terms of our human DNA. You're   .   percent identical in terms of your human DNA to the person sitting next to you. But that's not true of your gut microbes  you might only share    percent similarity with the person sitting next to you in terms of your gut microbes. So that's as different as the bacteria on this prairie and the bacteria in this forest. So these different microbes have all these different kinds  of functions that I told you about  everything from digesting food to involvement in different kinds of diseases  metabolizing drugs  and so forth. So how do they do all this stuff  Well  in part it's because although there's just three pounds of those microbes in our gut  they really outnumber us. And so how much do they outnumber us  Well  it depends on what you think of as our bodies. Is it our cells  Well  each of us consists of about    trillion human cells  but we harbor as many as     trillion microbial cells. So they outnumber us    to one. Now  you might think  well  we're human because of our DNA  but it turns out that each of us has about        human genes  depending on what you count exactly  but as many as two million to    million microbial genes. So whichever way we look at it  we're vastly outnumbered by our microbial symbionts. And it turns out that in addition  to traces of our human DNA  we also leave traces of our microbial DNA on everything we touch. We showed in a study a few years ago that you can actually match the palm of someone's hand up to the computer mouse that they use routinely with up to    percent accuracy. So this came out in a scientific journal a few years ago  but more importantly  it was featured on  CSI  Miami   so you really know it's true. So where do our microbes come from in the first place  Well if  as I do  you have dogs or kids  you probably have some dark suspicions about that  all of which are true  by the way. So just like we can match you to your computer equipment by the microbes you share  we can also match you up to your dog. But it turns out that in adults  microbial communities are relatively stable  so even if you live together with someone  you'll maintain your separate microbial identity over a period of weeks  months  even years. It turns out that our first microbial communities depend a lot on how we're born. So babies that come out the regular way  all of their microbes are basically like the vaginal community  whereas babies that are delivered by C section  all of their microbes instead look like skin. And this might be associated with some of the differences in health associated with Cesarean birth  such as more asthma  more allergies  even more obesity  all of which have been linked to microbes now  and when you think about it  until recently  every surviving mammal had been delivered by the birth canal  and so the lack of those protective microbes that we've co evolved with might be really important for a lot of these different conditions that we now know involve the microbiome. When my own daughter was born a couple of years ago by emergency C section  we took matters into our own hands and made sure she was coated with those vaginal microbes that she would have gotten naturally. Now  it's really difficult to tell whether this has had an effect on her health specifically  right  With a sample size of just one child  no matter how much we love her  you don't really have enough of a sample size to figure out what happens on average  but at two years old  she hasn't had an ear infection yet  so we're keeping our fingers crossed on that one. And what's more  we're starting to do clinical trials with more children to figure out whether this has a protective effect generally. So how we're born has a tremendous effect on what microbes we have initially  but where do we go after that  What I'm showing you again here is this map of the Human Microbiome Project Data  so each point represents a sample from one body site from one of     healthy adults. And you've seen children develop physically. You've seen them develop mentally. Now  for the first time  you're going to see one of my colleague's children develop microbially. So what we are going to look at is we're going to look  at this one baby's stool  the fecal community  which represents the gut  sampled every week for almost two and a half years. And so we're starting on day one. What's going to happen is that the infant is going to start off as this yellow dot  and you can see that he's starting off basically in the vaginal community  as we would expect from his delivery mode. And what's going to happen over these two and a half years is that he's going to travel  all the way down to resemble the adult fecal community from healthy volunteers down at the bottom. So I'm just going to start this going and we'll see how that happens. What you can see  and remember each step in this is just one week  what you can see is that week to week  the change in the microbial community of the feces of this one child  the differences week to week are much greater than the differences between individual healthy adults in the Human Microbiome Project cohort  which are those brown dots down at the bottom. And you can see he's starting to approach the adult fecal community. This is up to about two years. But something amazing is about to happen here. So he's getting antibiotics for an ear infection. What you can see is this huge change in the community  followed by a relatively rapid recovery. I'll just rewind that for you. And what we can see is that just over these few weeks  we have a much more radical change  a setback of many months  of normal development  followed by a relatively rapid recovery  and by the time he reaches day      which is the end of this video  you can see that he has essentially reached the healthy adult stool community  despite that antibiotic intervention. So this is really interesting because it raises fundamental questions about what happens when we intervene at different ages in a child's life. So does what we do early on  where the microbiome is changing so rapidly  actually matter  or is it like throwing a stone into a stormy sea  where the ripples will just be lost  Well  fascinatingly  it turns out that if you give children antibiotics in the first six months of life  they're more likely to become obese later on than if they don't get antibiotics then or only get them later  and so what we do early on may have profound impacts on the gut microbial community and on later health that we're only beginning to understand. So this is fascinating  because one day  in addition to the effects that antibiotics have on antibiotic resistant bacteria  which are very important  they may also be degrading our gut microbial ecosystems  and so one day we may come to regard antibiotics with the same horror that we currently reserve for those metal tools that the Egyptians used to use to mush up the brains before they drained them out for embalming. So I mentioned that microbes have all these important functions  and they've also now  just over the past few years  been connected to a whole range of different diseases  including inflammatory bowel disease  heart disease  colon cancer  and even obesity. Obesity has a really  large effect  as it turns out  and today  we can tell whether you're lean or obese with    percent accuracy by looking at the microbes in your gut. Now  although that might sound impressive  in some ways it's a little bit problematic as a medical test  because you can probably tell which of these people is obese without knowing anything about their gut microbes  but it turns out that even if we sequence their complete genomes and had all their human DNA  we could only predict which one was obese with about    percent accuracy. So that's amazing  right  What it means that the three pounds of microbes that you carry around with you may be more important for some health conditions than every single gene in your genome. And then in mice  we can do a lot more. So in mice  microbes have been linked to all kinds of additional conditions  including things like multiple sclerosis  depression  autism  and again  obesity. But how can we tell whether these microbial differences that correlate with disease are cause or effect  Well  one thing we can do is we can raise some mice without any microbes of their own in a germ free bubble. Then we can add in some microbes that we think are important  and see what happens. When we take the microbes from an obese mouse and transplant them into a genetically normal mouse that's been raised in a bubble with no microbes of its own  it becomes fatter than if it got them  from a regular mouse. Why this happens is absolutely amazing  though. Sometimes what's going on is that the microbes are helping them digest food more efficiently from the same diet  so they're taking more energy from their food  but other times  the microbes are actually affecting their behavior. What they're doing is they're eating more than the normal mouse  so they only get fat if we let them  eat as much as they want. So this is really remarkable  right  The implication is that microbes can affect mammalian behavior. So you might be wondering whether we can  also do this sort of thing across species  and it turns out that if you take microbes from an obese person and transplant them into mice you've raised germ free  those mice will also become fatter than if they received the microbes from a lean person  but we can design a microbial community that we inoculate them with that prevents them from gaining this weight. We can also do this for malnutrition. So in a project funded by the Gates Foundation  what we're looking at is children in Malawi who have kwashiorkor  a profound form of malnutrition  and mice that get the kwashiorkor community transplanted into them lose    percent of their body mass in just three weeks  but we can restore their health by using  the same peanut butter based supplement that is used for  the children in the clinic  and the mice that receive the community from the healthy identical twins of the kwashiorkor children do fine. This is truly amazing because it suggests that we can pilot therapies by trying them out in a whole bunch of different mice with individual people's gut communities and perhaps tailor those therapies all the way down to the individual level. So I think it's really important that everyone has a chance to participate in this discovery. So  a couple of years ago  we started this project called American Gut  which allows you to claim a place  for yourself on this microbial map. This is now the largest crowd funded science project that we know of    over       people have signed up at this point. What happens is  they send in their samples  we sequence the DNA of their microbes and then release the results back to them. We also release them  de identified  to scientists  to educators  to interested members of the general public  and so forth  so anyone can have access to the data. On the other hand  when we do tours of our lab at the BioFrontiers Institute  and we explain that we use robots and lasers to look at poop  it turns out that not everyone wants to know. But I'm guessing that many of you do  and so I brought some kits here if you're interested in trying this out for yourself. So why might we want to do this  Well  it turns out that microbes are not just important for finding out where we are in terms of our health  but they can actually cure disease. This is one of the newest things we've been able to visualize with colleagues  at the University of Minnesota. So here's that map of the human microbiome again. What we're looking at now    I'm going to add in the community of some people with C. diff. So  this is a terrible form of diarrhea where you have to go up to    times a day  and these people have failed antibiotic therapy for two years before they're eligible for this trial. So what would happen if we transplanted some of the stool from a healthy donor  that star down at the bottom  into these patients. Would the good microbes do battle with the bad microbes and help to restore their health  So let's watch exactly what happens there. Four of those patients are about to get a transplant from that healthy donor at the bottom  and what you can see is that immediately  you have this radical change in the gut community. So one day after you do that transplant  all those symptoms clear up  the diarrhea vanishes  and they're essentially healthy again  coming to resemble the donor's community  and they stay there. So we're just at the beginning of this discovery. We're just finding out that microbes have implications for all these different kinds of diseases  ranging from inflammatory  bowel disease to obesity  and perhaps even autism and depression. What we need to do  though  is we need to develop a kind of microbial GPS  where we don't just know where we are currently but also where we want to go and what we need to do in order to get there  and we need to be able to make this simple enough that even a child can use it.  Laughter  Thank you. While preparing for my talk I was reflecting on my life and trying to figure out where exactly was that moment when my journey began. A long time passed by  and I simply couldn't figure out the beginning or the middle or the end of my story. I always used to think that my beginning was one afternoon in my community when my mother had told me that I had escaped three arranged marriages by the time I was two. Or one evening when electricity had failed for eight hours in our community  and my dad sat  surrounded by all of us  telling us stories of when he was a little kid struggling to go to school while his father  who was a farmer  wanted him to work in the fields with him. Or that dark night when I was    when three little kids had come to me and they whispered in my ear that my friend was murdered in something called the honor killings. But then I realized that  as much as I know that these moments have contributed on my journey  they have influenced my journey but they have not been the beginning of it  but the true beginning of my journey was in front of a mud house in upper Sindh of Pakistan  where my father held the hand of my    year old mother and they decided to walk out of the village to go to a town where they could send their kids to school. In a way  I feel like my life is kind of a result of some wise choices and decisions they've made. And just like that  another of their decisions was to keep me and my siblings connected to our roots. While we were living in a community I fondly remember as called Ribabad  which means community of the poor  my dad made sure that we also had a house in our rural homeland. I come from an indigenous tribe in the mountains of Balochistan called Brahui. Brahui  or Brohi  means mountain dweller  and it is also my language. Thanks to my father's very strict rules about connecting to our customs  I had to live a beautiful life of songs   cultures  traditions  stories  mountains  and a lot of sheep. But then  living in two extremes between the traditions  of my culture  of my village  and then modern education in my school wasn't easy. I was aware that I was the only girl who got to have such freedom  and I was guilty of it. While going to school in Karachi and Hyderabad  a lot of my cousins and childhood friends were getting married off  some to older men  some in exchange  some even as second wives. I got to see the beautiful tradition and its magic fade in front of me when I saw that the birth of a girl child was celebrated with sadness  when women were told to have patience as their main virtue. Up until I was     I healed my sadness by crying  mostly at nights  when everyone would sleep and I would sob in my pillow  until that one night  when I found out my friend was killed in the name of honor. Honor killings is a custom where men and women are suspected of having relationships before or outside of the marriage  and they're killed by their family for it. Usually the killer is the brother or father or the uncle in the family. The U.N. reports there are about       honor murders every year in Pakistan  and these are only the reported cases. A custom that kills did not make any sense to me  and I knew I had to do something about it this time. I was not going to cry myself to sleep. I was going to do something  anything  to stop it. I was       I started writing poetry and going door to door telling everybody about honor killings and why it happens  why it should be stopped  and raising awareness about it until I actually found a much  much  better way to handle this issue. In those days  we were living in a very small  one roomed house in Karachi. Every year  during the monsoon seasons  our house would flood up with water    rainwater and sewage    and my mom and dad would be taking the water out. In those days  my dad brought home a huge machine  a computer. It was so big it looked as if it was going to take up half of the only room we had  and had so many pieces and wires that needed to be connected. But it was still the most exciting thing that has ever happened to me and my sisters. My oldest brother Ali got to be in charge of taking care of the computer  and all of us were given    to    minutes every day to use it. Being the oldest of eight kids  I got to use it the last  and that was after I had washed the dishes  cleaned the house  made dinner with my mom  and put blankets on the floor for everyone to sleep  and after that   I would run to the computer  connect it to the Internet  and have pure joy and wonder for    to    minutes. In those days  I had discovered a website called Joogle.  Google   Laughter  In my frantic wish to do something about this custom  I made use of Google and discovered Facebook  a website where people can connect to anyone around the world  and so  from my very tiny  cement roofed room in Karachi  I connected with people in the U.K.  the U.S.  Australia and Canada  and created a campaign called WAKE UP Campaign against Honor Killings. It became enormous in just a few months. I got a lot of support from all around the world. Media was connecting to us. A lot of people were reaching out trying to raise awareness with us. It became so big that it went from online to the streets of my hometown  where we would do rallies and strikes trying to change the policies  in Pakistan for women's support. And while I thought everything was perfect  my team    which was basically my friends and neighbors at that time    thought everything was going so well  we had no idea a big opposition was coming to us. My community stood up against us  saying we were spreading un Islamic behavior. We were challenging centuries old customs in those communities. I remember my father receiving anonymous letters saying   Your daughter  is spreading Western culture in the honorable societies.  Our car was stoned at one point. One day I went to the office and found our metal signboard wrinkled and broken as if a lot of people had been hitting it with something heavy. Things got so bad that I had to hide myself in many ways. I would put up the windows of the car  veil my face  not speak while I was in public  but eventually situations got worse when my life was threatened  and I had to leave  back to Karachi  and our actions stopped. Back in Karachi  as an    year old  I thought this was the biggest failure of my entire life. I was devastated. As a teenager  I was blaming myself for everything that happened. And it turns out  when we started reflecting  we did realize that it was actually me and my team's fault. There were two big reasons why our campaign had failed big time. One of those  the first reason  is we were standing against core values of people. We were saying no to something that was very important to them  challenging their code of honor  and hurting them deeply in the process. And number two  which was very important for me to learn  and amazing  and surprising for me to learn  was that we were not including the true heroes who should be fighting for themselves. The women in the villages had no idea we were fighting for them in the streets. Every time I would go back  I would find my cousins and friends with scarves on their faces  and I would ask   What happened   And they'd be like    Our husbands beat us.  But we are working in the streets for you  We are changing the policies. How is that not impacting their life  So then we found out something which was very amazing for us. The policies of a country do not necessarily always affect the tribal and rural communities. It was devastating    like  oh  we can't actually do something about this  And we found out there's a huge gap when it comes to official policies and the real truth on the ground. So this time  we were like  we are going to do something different. We are going to use strategy  and we are going to go back and apologize. Yes  apologize. We went back to the communities and we said we are  very ashamed of what we did. We are here to apologize  and in fact  we are here to make it up to you. How do we do that  We are going to promote three of your main cultures. We know that it's music  language  and embroidery. Nobody believed us. Nobody wanted to work with us. It took a lot of convincing and discussions with these communities until they agreed that we are going to promote their language by making a booklet of their stories  fables and old tales in the tribe  and we would promote their music by making a CD of the songs from the tribe  and some drumbeating. And the third  which was my favorite  was we would promote their embroidery by making a center in the village where women would come every day to make embroidery. And so it began. We worked with one village  and we started our first center. It was a beautiful day. We started the center. Women were coming to make embroidery  and going through a life changing process of education  learning about their rights  what Islam says about their rights  and enterprise development  how they can create money  and then how they can create money from money  how they can fight the customs that have been destroying their lives from so many centuries  because in Islam  in reality  women are supposed to be shoulder to shoulder with men. Women have so much status that we have not been hearing  that they have not been hearing  and we needed to tell them that they need to know where their rights are and how to take them by themselves  because they can do it and we can't. So this was the model which actually came out    very amazing. Through embroidery we were promoting their traditions. We went into the village. We would mobilize the community. We would make a center inside where    women will come for six months to learn about value addition of traditional embroidery  enterprise development  life skills and basic education  and about their rights and how to say no to those customs and how to stand as leaders for themselves and the society. After six months  we would connect these women to loans and to markets where they can become local entrepreneurs in their communities. We soon called this project Sughar. Sughar is a local word used in many  many languages in Pakistan. It means skilled and confident women. I truly believe  to create women leaders  there's only one thing you have to do  Just let them know that they have what it takes to be a leader. These women you see here  they have strong skills and potential to be leaders. All we had to do was remove the barriers that surrounded them  and that's what we decided to do. But then while we were thinking everything was going well  once again everything was fantastic  we found our next setback  A lot of men started seeing the visible changes in their wife. She's speaking more  she's making decisions    oh my gosh  she's handling  everything in the house. They stopped them from coming to the centers  and this time  we were like  okay  time for strategy two. We went to the fashion  industry in Pakistan and decided to do research about what happens there. Turns out the fashion industry in Pakistan is very strong and growing day by day  but there is less contribution from the tribal areas and to the tribal areas  especially women. So we decided to launch our first ever tribal women's very own fashion brand  which is now called Nomads. And so women started earning more  they started contributing more financially to the house  and men had to think again before saying no to them when they were coming to the centers. Thank you  thank you. In       we launched our first Sughar Hub instead of a center. We partnered with TripAdvisor and created a cement hall in the middle of a village and invited so many other organizations to work over there. We created this platform for the nonprofits so they can touch and work on the other issues that Sughar is not working on  which would be an easy place  for them to give trainings  use it as a farmer school  even as a marketplace  and anything they want to use it for  and they have been doing really amazingly. And so far  we have been able to support     women in    villages around Pakistan. But that's actually not what I want. My dream is to reach out to one million women in the next    years  and to make sure that happens  this year we launched Sughar Foundation in the U.S. It is not just going to fund Sughar but many other organizations in Pakistan to replicate the idea and to find even more innovative ways to unleash the rural women's potential in Pakistan. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Khalida  you are quite the force of nature. I mean  this story  in many ways  just seems beyond belief. It's incredible that someone so young could do achieve this much through so much force and ingenuity. So I guess one question  This is a spectacular dream to reach out and empower a million women    how much of the current  success depends on you  the force of this magnetic personality  How does it scale  Khalida Brohi  I think my job is to give the inspiration out  give my dream out. I can't teach how to do it  because there are so many different ways. We have been experimenting with three ways only. There are a hundred different ways to unleash potential in women. I would just give the inspiration and that's my job. I will keep doing it. Sughar will still be growing. We are planning to reach out to two more villages  and soon I believe  we will be scaling out of Pakistan into South Asia and beyond. CA  I love that when you talked about your team in the talk  I mean  you were all    at the time. What did this team look like  This was school friends  right  KB  Do people here believe that I'm at an age where I'm supposed to be a grandmother in my village  My mom was married at nine  and I am the oldest woman not married and not doing anything in my life in my village. CA  Wait  wait  wait  not doing anything  KB  No. CA  You're right. KB  People feel sorry for me  a lot of times. CA  But how much time are you spending now actually back in Balochistan  KB  I live over there. We live between  still  Karachi and Balochistan. My siblings are all going to school. I am still the oldest of eight siblings. CA  But what you're doing is definitely threatening to some people there. How do you handle safety  Do you feel safe  Are there issues there  KB  This question has come to me a lot of times before  and I feel like the word  fear  just comes to me and then drops  but there is one fear that I have that is different from that. The fear is that if I get killed  what would happen to the people who love me so much  My mom waits for me till late at night that I should come home. My sisters want to learn so much from me  and there are many  many girls in my community who want to talk to me and ask me different things  and I recently got engaged.  Laughs  CA  Is he here  You've got to stand up. KB  Escaping arranged marriages  I chose my own husband across the world in L.A.  a really different world. I had to fight for a whole year. That's totally a different story. But I think that's the only thing that I'm afraid of  and I don't want my mom to not see anyone when she waits in the night. CA  So people who want to help you on their way  they can go on  they can maybe buy some of these clothes that you're bringing over that are actually made  the embroidery is done back in Balochistan  KB  Yeah. CA  Or they can get involved in the foundation. KB  Definitely. We are looking for as many people as we can  because now that the foundation's in the beginning process  I am trying to learn a lot about how to operate  how to get funding or reach out to more organizations  and especially in the e commerce  which is very new for me. I mean  I am not a fashion person  believe me. CA  Well  it's been incredible to have you here. Please go on being courageous  go on being smart  and please stay safe. KB  Thank you so much. CA  Thank you  Khalida.  Applause  One of the first patients I had to see as a pediatrician was Sol  a beautiful month old baby who was admitted with signs of a severe respiratory infection. Until then  I had never seen a patient worsen so fast. In just two days she was connected to a respirator and on the third day she died. Sol had whooping cough. After discussing the case in the room and after a quite distressing catharsis  I remember my chief resident said to me   Okay  take a deep breath. Wash your face. And now comes the hardest part  We have to go talk to her parents.  At that time  a thousand questions came to mind  from   How could a one month old baby be so unfortunate   to   Could we have done something about it   Before vaccines existed  many infectious diseases killed millions of people per year. During the      flu pandemic    million people died. That's greater than Argentina's current population. Perhaps  the older ones among you remember the polio epidemic that occurred in Argentina in     . At that time  there was no vaccine available against polio. People didn't know what to do. They were going crazy. They would go painting trees with caustic lime. They'd put little bags of camphor in their children's underwear  as if that could do something. During the polio epidemic  thousands of people died. And thousands of people were left with very significant neurological damage. I know this because I read about it  because thanks to vaccines  my generation was lucky to not live through an epidemic as terrible as this. Vaccines are one of the great successes of the   th century's public health. After potable water  they are the interventions that have most reduced mortality  even more than antibiotics. Vaccines eradicated terrible diseases such as smallpox from the planet and succeeded in significantly reducing mortality due to other diseases such as measles  whooping cough  polio and many more. All these diseases are considered vaccine preventable diseases. What does this mean  That they are potentially preventable  but in order to be so  something must be done. You need to get vaccinated. I imagine that most  if not all of us here today  received a vaccine at some point in our life. Now  I'm not so sure that many of us know which vaccines or boosters we should receive after adolescence. Have you ever wondered who we are protecting when we vaccinate  What do I mean by that  Is there any other effect beyond protecting ourselves  Let me show you something. Imagine for a moment that we are in a city that has never had a case of a particular disease  such as the measles. This would mean that no one in the city has ever had contact with the disease. No one has natural defenses against  nor been vaccinated against measles. If one day  a person sick with the measles appears in this city the disease won't find much resistance and will begin spreading from person to person  and in no time it will disseminate throughout the community. After a certain time a big part of the population will be ill. This happened when there were no vaccines. Now  imagine the complete opposite case. We are in a city where more than    percent of the population has defenses against the measles  which means that they either had the disease  survived  and developed natural defenses  or that they had been immunized against measles. If one day  a person sick with the measles appears in this city  the disease will find much more resistance and won't be transmitted that much from person to person. The spread will probably remain contained and a measles outbreak won't happen. I would like you to pay attention to something. People who are vaccinated are not only protecting themselves  but by blocking the dissemination of the disease within the community  they are indirectly protecting the people in this community who are not vaccinated. They create a kind of protective shield which prevents them from coming in contact with the disease  so that these people are protected. This indirect protection that the unvaccinated people within a community receive simply by being surrounded by vaccinated people  is called herd immunity. Many people in the community depend almost exclusively on this herd immunity to be protected against disease. The unvaccinated people you see in infographics are not just hypothetical. Those people are our nieces and nephews  our children  who may be too young to receive their first shots. They are our parents  our siblings  our acquaintances  who may have a disease  or take medication that lowers their defenses. There are also people who are allergic to a particular vaccine. They could even be among us  any of us who got vaccinated  but the vaccine didn't produce the expected effect  because not all vaccines are always     percent effective. All these people depend almost exclusively on herd immunity to be protected against diseases. To achieve this effect of herd immunity  it is necessary that a large percentage of the population be vaccinated. This percentage is called the threshold. The threshold depends on many variables  It depends on the germ's characteristics  and those of the immune response that the vaccine generates. But they all have something in common. If the percentage of the population in a vaccinated community is below this threshold number  the disease will begin to spread more freely and may generate an outbreak of this disease within the community. Even diseases which were  at some point controlled may reappear. This is not just a theory. This has happened  and is still happening. In       a British researcher published an article in one of the most important medical journals  saying that the MMR vaccine  which is given for measles  mumps and rubella  was associated with autism. This generated an immediate impact. People began to stop getting vaccinated  and stopped vaccinating their children. And what happened  The number of people vaccinated  in many communities around the world  fell below this threshold. And there were outbreaks of measles in many cities in the world    in the U.S.  in Europe. Many people got sick. People died of measles. What happened  This article also generated a huge stir within the medical community. Dozens of researchers began to assess if this was actually true. Not only could no one find a causal association between MMR and autism at the population level  but it was also found that this article had incorrect claims. Even more  it was fraudulent. It was fraudulent. In fact  the journal publicly retracted the article in     . One of the main concerns and excuses for not getting vaccinated are the adverse effects. Vaccines  like other drugs  can have potential adverse effects. Most are mild and temporary. But the benefits are always greater than possible complications. When we are ill  we want to heal fast. Many of us who are here take antibiotics when we have an infection  we take anti hypertensives when we have high blood pressure  we take cardiac medications. Why  Because we are sick and we want to heal fast. And we don't question it much. Why is it so difficult to think of preventing diseases  by taking care of ourselves when we are healthy  We take care of ourselves a lot when affected by an illness  or in situations of imminent danger. I imagine most of us here  remember the influenza A pandemic which broke out in      in Argentina and worldwide. When the first cases began to come to light  we  here in Argentina  were entering the winter season. We knew absolutely nothing. Everything was a mess. People wore masks on the street  ran into pharmacies to buy alcohol gel. People would line up in pharmacies to get a vaccine  without even knowing if it was the right vaccine that would protect them against this new virus. We knew absolutely nothing. At that time  in addition to doing my fellowship at the Infant Foundation  I worked as a home pediatrician for a prepaid medicine company. I remember that I started my shift at   a.m.  and by    I already had a list of    scheduled visits. It was chaos  people didn't know what to do. I remember the types of patients that I was examining. The patients were a little older than what we were used to seeing in winter  with longer fevers. And I mentioned that to my fellowship mentor  and he  for his part  had heard the same from a colleague  about the large number of pregnant women and young adults being hospitalized in intensive care  with hard to manage clinical profiles. At that time  we set out to understand what was happening. First thing Monday morning  we took the car and went to a hospital in Buenos Aires Province  that served as a referral hospital for cases of the new influenza virus. We arrived at the hospital  it was crowded. All health staff were dressed in NASA like bio safety suits. We all had face masks in our pockets. I  being a hypochondriac  didn't breathe for two hours. But we could see what was happening. Immediately  we started reaching out to pediatricians from six hospitals in the city and in Buenos Aires Province. Our main goal was to find out how this new virus behaved in contact with our children  in the shortest time possible. A marathon work. In less than three months  we could see what effect this new H N  virus had on the     children hospitalized by this virus. We could see which children got more seriously ill  children under four  especially those less than one year old  patients with neurological diseases  and young children with chronic pulmonary diseases. Identifying these at risk groups was important to include them as priority groups in the recommendations for getting the influenza vaccine  not only here in Argentina  but also in other countries which the pandemic not yet reached. A year later  when a vaccine against the pandemic H N  virus became available  we wanted to see what happened. After a huge vaccination campaign aimed at protecting at risk groups  these hospitals  with    percent of the at risk groups vaccinated  had not hospitalized a single patient for the pandemic H N  virus. In          . In       zero. Vaccination is an act of individual responsibility  but it has a huge collective impact. If I get vaccinated  not only am I protecting myself  but I am also protecting others. Sol had whooping cough. Sol was very young  and she hadn't yet received her first vaccine against whooping cough. I still wonder what would have happened if everyone around Sol had been vaccinated. Six thousand miles of road      miles of subway track      miles of bike lanes and a half a mile of tram track  if you've ever been to Roosevelt Island. These are the numbers that make up the infrastructure of New York City. These are the statistics of our infrastructure. They're the kind of numbers you can find released in reports by city agencies. For example  the Department of Transportation will probably tell you how many miles of road they maintain. The MTA will boast how many miles of subway track there are. Most city agencies give us statistics. This is from a report this year from the Taxi and Limousine Commission  where we learn that there's about        taxis here in New York City. Pretty interesting  right  But did you ever think about where these numbers came from  Because for these numbers to exist  someone at the city agency had to stop and say  hmm  here's a number that somebody might want want to know. Here's a number  that our citizens want to know. So they go back to their raw data  they count  they add  they calculate  and then they put out reports  and those reports will have numbers like this. The problem is  how do they know all of our questions  We have lots of questions. In fact  in some ways there's literally an infinite number of questions that we can ask about our city. The agencies can never keep up. So the paradigm isn't exactly working  and I think our policymakers realize that  because in       Mayor Bloomberg signed into law what he called the most ambitious and comprehensive open data legislation in the country. In a lot of ways  he's right. In the last two years   the city has released       datasets on our open data portal  and it's pretty awesome. So you go and look at data like this  and instead of just counting the number of cabs  we can start to ask different questions. So I had a question. When's rush hour in New York City  It can be pretty bothersome. When is rush hour exactly  And I thought to myself  these cabs aren't just numbers  these are GPS recorders driving around in our city streets recording each and every ride they take. There's data there  and I looked at that data  and I made a plot of the average speed of taxis in New York City throughout the day. You can see that from about midnight to around      in the morning  speed increases  and at that point  things turn around  and they get slower and slower and slower until about      in the morning  when they end up at around    and a half miles per hour. The average taxi is going    and a half miles per hour on our city streets  and it turns out it stays that way for the entire day. So I said to myself  I guess there's no rush hour in New York City. There's just a rush day. Makes sense. And this is important for a couple of reasons. If you're a transportation planner  this might be pretty interesting to know. But if you want to get somewhere quickly  you now know to set your alarm for      in the morning and you're all set. New York  right  But there's a story behind this data. This data wasn't just available  it turns out. It actually came from something called a Freedom of Information Law Request  or a FOIL Request. This is a form you can find on the Taxi and Limousine Commission website. In order to access this data  you need to go get this form  fill it out  and they will notify you  and a guy named Chris Whong did exactly that. Chris went down  and they told him   Just bring a brand new hard drive  down to our office  leave it here for five hours  we'll copy the data and you take it back.  And that's where this data came from. Now  Chris is the kind of guy who wants to make the data public  and so it ended up online for all to use  and that's where this graph came from. And the fact that it exists is amazing. These GPS recorders    really cool. But the fact that we have citizens walking around with hard drives picking up data from city agencies to make it public    it was already kind of public  you could get to it  but it was  public   it wasn't public. And we can do better than that as a city. We don't need our citizens walking around with hard drives. Now  not every dataset is behind a FOIL Request. Here is a map I made with the most dangerous intersections in New York City based on cyclist accidents. So the red areas are more dangerous. And what it shows is first the East side of Manhattan  especially in the lower area of Manhattan  has more cyclist accidents. That might make sense because there are more cyclists coming off the bridges there. But there's other hotspots worth studying. There's Williamsburg. There's Roosevelt Avenue in Queens. And this is exactly the kind of data we need for Vision Zero. This is exactly what we're looking for. But there's a story behind this data as well. This data didn't just appear. How many of you guys know this logo  Yeah  I see some shakes. Have you ever tried to copy and paste data out of a PDF and make sense of it  I see more shakes. More of you tried copying and pasting than knew the logo. I like that. So what happened is  the data that you just saw was actually on a PDF. In fact  hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of pages of PDF put out by our very own NYPD  and in order to access it  you would either have to copy and paste for hundreds and hundreds of hours  or you could be John Krauss. John Krauss was like  I'm not going to copy and paste this data. I'm going to write a program. It's called the NYPD Crash Data Band Aid  and it goes to the NYPD's website and it would download PDFs. Every day it would search  if it found a PDF  it would download it and then it would run some PDF scraping program  and out would come the text  and it would go on the Internet  and then people could make maps like that. And the fact that the data's here  the fact that we have access to it    Every accident  by the way  is a row in this table. You can imagine how many PDFs that is. The fact that we have access to that is great  but let's not release it in PDF form  because then we're having our citizens write PDF scrapers. It's not the best use of our citizens' time  and we as a city can do better than that. Now  the good news is that the de Blasio administration actually recently released this data a few months ago  and so now we can actually have access to it  but there's a lot of data still entombed in PDF. For example  our crime data is still only available in PDF. And not just our crime data  our own city budget. Our city budget is only readable right now in PDF form. And it's not just us that can't analyze it    our own legislators who vote for the budget also only get it in PDF. So our legislators cannot analyze  the budget that they are voting for. And I think as a city we can do a little better than that as well. Now  there's a lot of data that's not hidden in PDFs. This is an example of a map I made  and this is the dirtiest waterways in New York City. Now  how do I measure dirty  Well  it's kind of a little weird  but I looked at the level of fecal coliform  which is a measurement of fecal matter in each of our waterways. The larger the circle  the dirtier the water  so the large circles are dirty water  the small circles are cleaner. What you see is inland waterways. This is all data that was sampled by the city over the last five years. And inland waterways are  in general  dirtier. That makes sense  right  And the bigger circles are dirty. And I learned a few things from this. Number one  Never swim in anything that ends in  creek  or  canal.  But number two  I also found the dirtiest waterway in New York City  by this measure  one measure. In Coney Island Creek  which is not the Coney Island you swim in  luckily. It's on the other side. But Coney Island Creek     percent of samples taken over the last five years have had fecal levels so high that it would be against state law to swim in the water. And this is not the kind of fact that you're going to see boasted in a city report  right  It's not going to be  the front page on nyc.gov. You're not going to see it there  but the fact that we can get  to that data is awesome. But once again  it wasn't super easy  because this data was not on the open data portal. If you were to go to the open data portal  you'd see just a snippet of it   a year or a few months. It was actually on the Department of Environmental Protection's website. And each one of these links is an Excel  sheet  and each Excel sheet is different. Every heading is different  you copy  paste  reorganize. When you do you can make maps and that's great  but once again  we can do better than that  as a city  we can normalize things. And we're getting there  because there's this website that Socrata makes called the Open Data Portal NYC. This is where       data sets  that don't suffer from the things I just told you live  and that number is growing  and that's great. You can download data in any format  be it CSV or PDF or Excel document. Whatever you want  you can download the data that way. The problem is  once you do  you will find that each agency codes their addresses differently. So one is street name   intersection street  street  borough  address  building  building address. So once again  you're spending time  even when we have this portal  you're spending time normalizing our address fields. And that's not the best use  of our citizens' time. We can do better than that as a city. We can standardize our addresses  and if we do   we can get more maps like this. This is a map of fire hydrants in New York City  but not just any fire hydrants. These are the top     grossing fire hydrants in terms of parking tickets. So I learned a few things from this map  and I really like this map. Number one  just don't park on the Upper East Side. Just don't. It doesn't matter where you park  you will get a hydrant ticket. Number two  I found the two highest grossing hydrants in all of New York City  and they're on the Lower East Side  and they were bringing in over        dollars a year in parking tickets. And that seemed a little strange to me when I noticed it  so I did a little digging and it turns out what you had is a hydrant and then something called a curb extension  which is like a seven foot space to walk on  and then a parking spot. And so these cars came along  and the hydrant     It's all the way over there  I'm fine   and there was actually a parking spot painted there beautifully for them. They would park there  and the NYPD disagreed with this designation and would ticket them. And it wasn't just me  who found a parking ticket. This is the Google  Street View car driving by finding the same parking ticket. So I wrote about this on my blog  on I Quant NY  and the DOT responded  and they said   While the DOT has not received any complaints about this location  we will review the roadway markings and make any appropriate alterations.  And I thought to myself  typical government response  all right  moved on with my life. But then  a few weeks later  something incredible happened. They repainted the spot  and for a second I thought I saw the future of open data  because think about what happened here. For five years  this spot was being  ticketed  and it was confusing  and then a citizen found something  they told the city  and within a few weeks the problem was fixed. It's amazing. And a lot of people see open data as being a watchdog. It's not  it's about being a partner. We can empower our citizens to be better partners for government  and it's not that hard. All we need are a few changes. If you're FOILing data  if you're seeing your data  being FOILed over and over again  let's release it to the public  that's a sign that it should be made public. And if you're a government agency releasing a PDF  let's pass legislation that requires you to post it with the underlying data  because that data is coming from somewhere. I don't know where  but it's coming from somewhere  and you can release it with the PDF. And let's adopt and share some open data standards. Let's start with our addresses here in New York City. Let's just start normalizing our addresses. Because New York is a leader in open data. Despite all this  we are absolutely a leader in open data  and if we start normalizing things  and set an open data standard  others will follow. The state will follow  and maybe the federal government  Other countries could follow  and we're not that far off from a time where you could write one program and map information from     countries. It's not science fiction. We're actually quite close. And by the way  who are we empowering with this  Because it's not just John Krauss and it's not just Chris Whong. There are hundreds of meetups going on in New York City right now  active meetups. There are thousands of people attending these meetups. These people are going after work and on weekends  and they're attending these meetups to look at open data and make our city a better place. Groups like BetaNYC  who just last week  released something called citygram.nyc that allows you to subscribe to     complaints around your own home  or around your office. You put in your address  you get local complaints. And it's not just the tech community that are after these things. It's urban planners like  the students I teach at Pratt. It's policy advocates  it's everyone  it's citizens from a diverse set of backgrounds. And with some small  incremental changes  we can unlock the passion and the ability of our citizens to harness open data and make our city even better  whether it's one dataset  or one parking spot at a time. Thank you. I'd like to start my performance by saying    percent of everything is crap. It's called Sturgeon's law  and what that means is that the majority of anything is always bad. I have a giraffe here. I'm going to throw the giraffe behind my back and whoever catches it is going to help me on this next thing. Sir  you caught the giraffe. I have a playing card in my hand. Freely name any card in the deck. Audience member     of hearts. Helder Guimar es     of hearts. You could have named any card in the deck  but you said the    of hearts. Ninety percent of everything is crap  so there's this to prove that Sturgeon was correct. Sir  this is not your show. Keep the giraffe for a moment  okay  Jesus. Crazy people. Well  the truth is  why is the majority of everything bad  And my answer is  I think we stop thinking too soon. I'll give you a clear little example  something that people used to do around the turn of the century    not this century  the other one. The idea was to take a piece of paper and fold it inside out using only your weaker hand  in my case  the left hand. Something that would look like this. By the way you reacted  I can see your lack of interest. But that's okay  I understand why. We stop thinking too soon. But if we give it a little bit more thought  like a paper clip. A paper clip makes this a little bit more interesting. Not only that  if instead of using my hand with the fingers  I use my hand closed into a fist  that makes this even a little bit more interesting. Not only that  but I will impose myself a time limit of one second  something that would look like this. Now    no  no  no. Sturgeon may be correct. But he doesn't have to be correct forever. Things can always change. Sir  what was the card  The    of hearts  There's this to prove that things can always change    the    of hearts. Secrets are important. And secrets are valuable. And this is the best secret I've ever experienced. It starts with a deck of cards onto the table  an old man and a claim   I will not touch the deck till the end.  It doesn't matter who the man was  all that matters was that sentence ringing in my head   I will not touch the deck till the end.  Now  during all this time  he was holding a small notebook that sometimes he would open and flip through the pages and look at something. But I was not really paying attention to the book because I was paying attention the deck and the claim he had made before   I will not touch the deck till the end.  Now sir  you have the giraffe. Go ahead  throw it in any direction so that you can find someone else at random. Perfect. Sir  you're going to play my role in this story. The old man turned to me and he said   You could pick a red card or a black card.  My answer was ... Audience member    The black card. HG  Indeed  It was a black card. He said   It could be a club or a spade   and my answer was ... Audience member    Spade. HG  Indeed  It was a spade. He said   It could be a high spade or a low spade.  And my answer was ... Audience member    A high spade. HG  Indeed  It was a high spade. Since it's a high spade  it could be a nine  a     a jack  king  queen or the ace of spades. And my answer was ... Audience member    The king. HG  The king of spades  indeed. Now sir  let's be fair. You selected black  you selected spade  you selected the high spade  and you selected    sorry  Audience member    King. HG  King of spades. Did you feel I influenced you in any decision  Audience member    No  I just felt your energy. HG  But it was a free choice  correct  Because if not  we could start all over again. But it was really fair  Audience member    Absolutely. HG  Now  the old man turned to me and he asked me one more question  a number between one and   . And the first number I thought of was ... Audience member      . HG  Indeed  It was the   . The old man only said one more thing   This is the end.  And I knew exactly what that meant. I knew that he was going to touch the deck. Everything that you're about to see is exactly as it looked. He took the deck out of the box. Nothing in the box. He counted   One  two  three  four  five  six  seven  eight  nine    .  The tension was building.                            .  And on the     instead of the king of spades  something appeared in the middle of the deck  that later  I would realize was actually a secret. The old man stood up  he left. I never saw him again. But he left his notebook that was there from the beginning. And when I picked it up  that was the best secret I've ever experienced. We are defined by the secrets we keep and by the secrets we share. And this was his way of sharing a secret with me. Crazy shit  Now    I believe that amazing things happen all the time. I really do. And the reason why we don't see them as often  it's because we don't place ourselves in a position to search for those amazing things. But what if we decided to search for those amazing things  for those small coincidences in life that are truly amazing  So you have the giraffe  go ahead  throw it in any direction so you find one last person at random. Sir  I'm going to ask you  do you have  with you  a United States    bill  Audience member    I think so. HG  Yes  You see  a coincidence  Let's make sure you have it. Do you have it  Audience member    Yes. HG  Yes  Perfect. Now  I want you to do exactly the same thing I am about to do. I have a dollar bill here to explain. I want you to take the dollar bill  and fold the Washington part inside  like this. So you get this kind of big square  okay  Now  I want you to take the bill and fold it like this  lengthwise  so it becomes like a rectangle  and then again    really fold it  really crease it    and when you have it  please fold the bill again into a little square like this and let me know when you have it. Do you have it  Perfect. Now  I'm going to approach  and before we start  I want to make sure that we do this in very  very serious conditions. First of all  I want to ensure that we have a marker and we have a paper clip. First of all  take the marker and go ahead and sign the bill. And this is the reason why  later  I'm going to be doing a bunch of stuff on stage and I don't want you to think  oh  while I was distracted by Helder  someone came onstage and swapped the bill. So I want to make sure it's exactly the same bill. Now not only that  I want you to take the paper clip and put it around the bill. So even if nobody comes onstage and switches the bill  I don't have enough time to go open the bill and close it and see what I don't want to see. Is that fair  Now you can give me the marker back. And just like that  very clearly  I want to make sure that we place this in full view from the beginning of this experience and to make sure that everyone is going to see it  we're going to actually have a camera man onstage. Yes  perfect  so that you can see. That's your signature  Yes  Perfect. Now  we're going to use also the deck and a glass for this. And we're going to put ourselves in a position to search for an amazing coincidence. Do you mind  can you help me with this  Go ahead and take some cards and shuffle. And do you mind  can you take some cards and shuffle  You can take some cards and shuffle. You can shuffle cards in a variety of ways. You can shuffle cards like this. You can shuffle cards in a more messed up way  something like this. You can shuffle cards in the American way. As a Portuguese  I don't feel entitled to teach you guys how to do it. But the important part is after shuffling the cards  always remember to cut and complete the cards. Do you mind doing that for me  sir  Please cut and complete. And when you have it  place the cards up in the air. And you too  cut and complete and up in the air. Up in the air. A deck of cards cut and shuffled by one  two  three  four and five people. Now  very clearly  I'm going to gather the deck together. And just like that. I'm going to search for a coincidence in front of everyone. I'm going to try. I have some cards that maybe  maybe they don't mean anything. But maybe that's because we are not paying close attention. Because maybe  maybe they mean a lot. Before we start  sir  you gave me a dollar bill. Is that your signature  Audience member    Yes it is. HG  I want you to see very clearly that I'm going to open your bill and reveal a small secret that we created. And the secret of this dollar bill is the serial number. Madam  can you take the dollar bill  In the serial number  there is a letter. What is the first number after the letter  Audience member    Seven. HG  Seven. Seven. But  that's maybe just one coincidence. What is the second number  Audience member    Nine. So after the seven  we have a nine. And after the nine  Audience member    Two. HG  The two. And after the two  Audience member    Three. HG  Three  and after  Audience member    Three. HG  Three. Audience member    Seven. HG  Seven. Audience member    Four. HG  Four. Audience member    Two. HG  Two  and  Audience member    Q. HG  Q like in queen  The queen of clubs  All the cards in order  just for you. And that's my show. Thank you very much and have a nice night. As a software developer and technologist  I've worked on a number of civic technology projects over the years. Civic tech is sometimes referred to as tech for good  using technology to solve humanitarian problems. This is in      in Uganda  working on a solution that allowed local populations to avoid government surveillance on their mobile phones for expressing dissent. That same technology was deployed later in North Africa for similar purposes to help activists stay connected when governments were deliberately shutting off connectivity as a means of population control. But over the years  as I have thought about these technologies and the things that I work on  a question kind of nags in the back of my mind  which is  what if we're wrong about the virtues of technology  and if it sometimes actively hurts the communities that we're intending to help  The tech industry around the world tends to operate under similar assumptions that if we build great things  it will positively affect everyone. Eventually  these innovations will get out and find everyone. But that's not always the case. I like to call this blind championing of technology  trickle down techonomics   to borrow a phrase.  Laughter  We tend to think that if we design things for the select few  eventually those technologies will reach everyone  and that's not always the case. Technology and innovation behaves a lot like wealth and capital. They tend to consolidate in the hands of the few  and sometimes they find their way out into the hands of the many. And so most of you aren't tackling oppressive regimes on the weekends  so I wanted to think of a few examples that might be a little bit more relatable. In the world of wearables and smartphones and apps  there's a big movement to track people's personal health with applications that track the number of calories that you burn or whether you're sitting too much or walking enough. These technologies make patient intake in medical facilities much more efficient  and in turn  these medical facilities are starting to expect these types of efficiencies. As these digital tools find their way into medical rooms  and they become digitally ready  what happens to the digitally invisible  What does the medical experience look like for someone who doesn't have the      phone or watch tracking their every movement  Do they now become a burden on the medical system  Is their experience changed  In the world of finance  Bitcoin and crypto currencies are revolutionizing the way we move money around the world  but the challenge with these technologies is the barrier to entry is incredibly high  right  You need access to the same phones  devices  connectivity  and even where you don't  where you can find a proxy agent  usually they require a certain amount of capital to participate. And so the question that I ask myself is  what happens to the last community using paper notes when the rest of the world moves to digital currency  Another example from my hometown in Philadelphia  I recently went to the public library there  and they are facing an existential crisis. Public funding is dwindling  they have to reduce their footprint to stay open and stay relevant  and so one of the ways they're going about this is digitizing a number of the books and moving them to the cloud. This is great for most kids. Right  You can check out books from home  you can research on the way to school or from school  but these are really two big assumptions  that one  you have access at home  and two  that you have access to a mobile phone  and in Philadelphia  many kids do not. So what does their education experience look like in the wake of a completely cloud based library  what used to be considered such a basic part of education  How do they stay competitive  A final example from across the world in East Africa  there's been a huge movement to digitize land ownership rights  for a number of reasons. Migrant communities  older generations dying off  and ultimately poor record keeping have led to conflicts over who owns what. And so there was a big movement to put all this information online  to track all the ownership of these plots of land  put them in the cloud  and give them to the communities. But actually  the unintended consequence of this has been that venture capitalists  investors  real estate developers  have swooped in and they've begun buying up these plots of land right out from under these communities  because they have access to the technologies and the connectivity that makes that possible. So that's the common thread that connects these examples  the unintended consequences of the tools and the technologies that we make. As engineers  as technologists  we sometimes prefer efficiency over efficacy. We think more about doing things than the outcomes of what we are doing. This needs to change. We have a responsibility to think about the outcomes of the technologies we build  especially as they increasingly control the world in which we live. In the late '  s  there was a big push for ethics in the world of investment and banking. I think in       we're long overdue for a similar movement in the area of tech and technology. So  I just encourage you  as you are all thinking about the next big thing  as entrepreneurs  as CEOs  as engineers  as makers  that you think about the unintended consequences of the things that you're building  because the real innovation is in finding ways to include everyone. Thank you. In the summer of       as a tourist  I visited the rainforests of Borneo for the very first time  and as you might imagine  it was the overwhelming sounds of the forest that struck me the most. There's this constant cacophony of noise. Some things actually do stick out. For example  this here is a big bird  a rhinoceros hornbill. This buzzing is a cicada. This is a family of gibbons. It's actually singing to each other over a great distance. The place where this was recorded was in fact a gibbon reserve  which is why you can hear so many of them  but in fact the most important noise that  was coming out of the forest that time was one that I didn't notice  and in fact nobody there had actually noticed it. So  as I said  this was a gibbon reserve. They spend most of their time rehabilitating gibbons  but they also have to spend a lot of their time protecting their area from illegal logging that takes place on the side. And so if we take the sound of the forest and we actually turn down the gibbons  the insects  and the rest  in the background  the entire time  in recordings you heard  was the sound of a chainsaw at great distance. They had three full time guards who were posted around this sanctuary whose job was in fact to guard against illegal logging  and one day  we went walking  again as tourists  out into the forest  and within five minutes' walk  we stumbled upon somebody who was just sawing a tree down  five minutes' walk  a few hundred meters from the ranger station. They hadn't been able to hear the chainsaws  because as you heard  the forest is very  very loud. It struck me as quite unacceptable that in this modern time  just a few hundred meters away  from a ranger station in a sanctuary  that in fact nobody could hear it when someone who has a chainsaw gets fired up. It sounds impossible  but in fact  it was quite true. So how do we stop illegal logging  It's really tempting  as an engineer  always to come up with a high tech  super crazy high tech solution  but in fact  you're in the rainforest. It has to be simple  it has to be scalable  and so what we also noticed while were there was that everything we needed was already there. We could build a system that would allow us to stop this using what's already there. Who was there  What was  already in the forest  Well  we had people. We had this group there that was  dedicated  three full time guards  that was dedicated to go and stop it  but they just needed to know what was happening out in the forest. The real surprise  this is the big one  was that there was connectivity out in the forest. There was cell phone service way out in the middle of nowhere. We're talking hundreds of kilometers from the nearest road  there's certainly no electricity  but they had very good cell phone service  these people in the towns were on Facebook all the time  they're surfing the web on their phones  and this sort of got me thinking that in fact it would be possible to use the sounds of the forest  pick up the sounds  of chainsaws programmatically  because people can't hear them  and send an alert. But you have to have a device to go up in the trees. So if we can use some device to listen to the sounds of the forest  connect to the cell phone network that's there  and send an alert to people on the ground  perhaps we could have a solution to this issue for them. But let's take a moment to talk about saving the rainforest  because it's something that we've definitely all heard about forever. People in my generation have heard about saving the rainforest since we were kids  and it seems that the message has never changed  We've got to save the rainforest  it's super urgent  this many football fields have been destroyed yesterday. and yet here we are today  about half of the rainforest remains  and we have potentially more urgent  problems like climate change. But in fact  this is the little known fact that I didn't realize at the time  Deforestation accounts  for more greenhouse gas than all of the world's planes  trains  cars  trucks and ships combined. It's the second highest contributor to climate change. Also  according to Interpol  as much as    percent of the logging that takes place in the rainforest is illegal logging  like the illegal logging that we saw. So if we can help people in the forest enforce the rules that are there  then in fact we could eat heavily into this    percent and potentially have a major impact in the short term. It might just be the cheapest  fastest way to fight climate change. And so here's the system that we imagine. It looks super high tech. The moment a sound of a chainsaw is heard in the forest  the device picks up the sound of the chainsaw  it sends an alert through the standard GSM network that's already there to a ranger in the field who can in fact show up in real time and stop the logging. It's no more about going out and finding a tree that's been cut. It's not about seeing  a tree from a satellite in an area that's been clear cut  it's about real time intervention. So I said it was the cheapest and fastest way to do it  but in fact  actually  as you saw  they weren't able to do it  so it may not be so cheap and fast. But if the devices in the trees were actually cell phones  it could be pretty cheap. Cell phones are thrown away by the hundreds of millions every year  hundreds of millions in the U.S. alone  not counting the rest of the world  which of course we should do  but in fact  cell phones are great. They're full of sensors. They can listen to the sounds of the forest. We do have to protect them. We have to put them in this box that you see here  and we do have to power them. Powering them is one of the greater engineering challenges that we had to deal with  because powering a cell phone under a tree canopy  any sort of solar power under a tree canopy  was an as yet unsolved problem  and that's this unique solar panel design that you see here  which in fact is built also from recycled byproducts of an industrial process. These are strips that are cut down. So this is me putting it all together in my parents' garage  actually. Thanks very much to them for allowing me to do that. As you can see  this is a device up in a tree. What you can see from here  perhaps  is that they are pretty well obscured up in the tree canopy at a distance. That's important  because although they are able to hear chainsaw noises up to a kilometer in the distance  allowing them to cover about three square kilometers  if someone were to take them  it would make the area unprotected. So does it actually work  Well  to test it  we took it back to Indonesia  not the same place  but another place  to another gibbon reserve that was threatened daily by illegal logging. On the very second day  it picked up illegal chainsaw noises. We were able to get a real time alert. I got an email on my phone. Actually  we had just climbed the tree. Everyone had just gotten back down. All these guys are smoking cigarettes  and then I get an email  and they all quiet down  and in fact you can hear the chainsaw really  really faint in the background  but no one had noticed it  until that moment. And so then we took off to actually stop these loggers. I was pretty nervous. This is the moment where we've actually arrived close to where the loggers are. This is the moment where you can see where I'm actually regretting perhaps the entire endeavor. I'm not really sure what's on the other side of this hill. That guy's much braver than I am. But he went  so I had to go  walking up  and in fact  he made it over the hill  and interrupted the loggers in the act. For them  it was such a surprise    they had never  ever been interrupted before    that it was such an impressive event for them  that we've heard from our partners they have not been back since. They were  in fact  great guys. They showed us how the entire operation works  and what they really convinced us on the spot was that if you can show up in real time and stop people  it's enough of a deterrent they won't come back. So    Thank you.  Applause  Word of this spread  possibly because we told a lot of people  and in fact  then some really amazing stuff started to happen. People from around the world started to send us emails  phone calls. What we saw was that people throughout Asia  people throughout Africa  people throughout South America  they told us that they could use it too  and what's most important  what we'd found that we thought might be exceptional  in the forest there was pretty good cell phone service. That was not exceptional  we were told  and that particularly is on the periphery of the forests that are most under threat. And then something  really amazing happened  which was that people started sending us their own old cell phones. So in fact what we have now is a system where we can use people on the ground  people who are already there  who can both improve and use the existing connectivity  and we're using old cell phones that are being sent to us by people from around the world that want their phones to be doing  something else in their afterlife  so to speak. And if the rest of the device can be completely recycled  then we believe it's an entirely upcycled device. So again  this didn't come because of any sort of high tech solution. It just came from using what's already there  and I'm thoroughly convinced that if it's not phones  that there's always going to be enough there that you can build similar solutions that can be very effective in new contexts. Thank you very much. My name is Harry Baker. Harry Baker is my name. If your name was Harry Baker  then our names would be the same. It's a short introductory part. Yeah  I'm Harry. I study maths. I write poetry. So I thought I'd start with a love poem about prime numbers. This is called    .  I was going to call it  Prime Time Loving.  That reaction is why I didn't. So     .     wakes up on the wrong  side of the bed. Realizes all his hair is  on one side of his head. Takes just under a minute to work out that it s because of the way that he slept. He finds some clothes and gets dressed. He can t help but look in the mirror and be subtly impressed How he looks rough around the edges and yet casually messed. And as he glances out the window  he sees the sight that he gets blessed with of    from across the street. Now    was beautiful. With perfectly trimmed cuticles  dressed in something suitable. Never rude or crude at all. Unimprovable  right on time as usual  more on cue than a snooker ball but liked to play it super cool.    wanted to tell her that he knew her favorite flower. He thought of her every second  every minute  every hour. But he knew it wouldn t work  he d never get the girl. Because although she lived  across the street they came from different worlds. While    admired    s perfectly round figure     thought    was odd.  Laughter  One of his favorite films was      Dalmatians.  She preferred the sequel. He romanticized the idea they were star crossed lovers. They could overcome the odds and evens because they had each other. While she maintained the strict views imposed on her by her mother That separate could not be equal. And though at the time he felt stupid and dumb For trying to love a girl controlled by her stupid mum  He should have been comforted by the simple sum. Take    away from     and you re left with the one. Sure enough after two months of moping around     days later     was who he found  He had lost his keys  and his parents were out. So one day after school  he went into a house As he noticed the slightly wonky numbers on the door  He wondered why he d never introduced himself before  As she let him in  his jaw  dropped in awe.    was like     but a little bit more.  Laughter  She had prettier eyes  and an approachable smile  And like him  rough around the edges  casual style  And like him  everything was in disorganized piles  And like him  her mum didn t mind if friends stayed a while. Because she was like him   and he liked her. He reckoned she would like him if she knew he was like her  And it was different this time. I mean  this girl was wicked  So he plucked up the courage and asked for her digits. She said   I'm   .  He grinned  said   I'm   .  Today I ve had a really nice time  So tomorrow if you wanted you could come over to mine  She said   Sure.  She loved talking to someone  just as quirky  She agreed to this unofficial first date. In the end he was only ready one minute early  But it didn t matter because she arrived one minute late. And from that moment on there was nonstop chatter  How they loved  X Factor   how they had two factors  How that did not matter  distinctiveness made them better  By the end of the night they knew they were meant together. And one day she was talking about stuck up     She noticed that    looked a bit shifty. He blushed  told her of his crush   The best thing that never happened because it led to us.     was clever  see  not prone to jealousy  She looked him in the eyes and told him quite tenderly   You re     I m     together we combine to become twice what    could ever be.  At this point    had tears in his eyes  Was so glad to have this one of a kind girl in his life. He told her the very definition of being prime Was that with only one and himself could his heart divide  And she was the one he wanted to give his heart to  She said she felt the same and now she knew the films were half true. Because that wasn't real love  that love was just a sample  When it came to real love  they were a prime example. Cheers. That was the first poem that I wrote and it was for a prime number themed  poetry night     Laughter     which turned out to be a prime number themed poetry competition. And I became a prime number themed poetry competition winner  or as I like to call it  a prime minister.  Laughter  And this is how I discovered these things called poetry slams  and if you don't know what  a poetry slam is  it was a format come up with in America    years ago as a way of tricking people into going to poetry events by putting an exciting word like  slam  on the end. And each performer got three minutes to perform and then random audience members would hold up scorecards  and they would end up with a numerical score  and what this meant is  it kind of broke down the barrier between performer and audience and encouraged the kind of connection with the listener. And what it also means is you can win. And if you win a poetry slam  you can call yourself a slam champion and pretend you're a wrestler  and if you lose a poetry slam you can say   Oh  what  Poetry's a subjective art form  you can't put numbers on such things.  But I loved it  and I got involved in these slams  and I became the U.K. slam champion and got invited to the Poetry World Cup in Paris  which was unbelievable. It was people from all around the world speaking in their native languages to be judged by five French strangers. And somehow  I won  which was great  and I've been able to travel the world since doing it  but it also means that this next piece is technically the best poem in the world. So... According to five French strangers. So this is  Paper People.  I like people. I'd like some paper people. They d be purple paper people. Maybe pop up purple paper people. Proper pop up purple paper people.  How do you prop up pop up purple paper people   I hear you cry. Well I ... I d probably prop up proper pop up purple paper people with a proper pop up purple people paperclip  but I d pre prepare appropriate adhesives as alternatives  a cheeky pack of Blu Tack just in case the paper slipped. Because I could build a pop up metropolis. but I wouldn t wanna deal with all the paper people politics. paper politicians with their paper thin policies  broken promises without appropriate apologies. There d be a little paper me. And a little paper you. And we could watch paper TV and it would all be pay per view. We d see the poppy paper rappers rap about their paper package or watch paper people carriers get stuck in paper traffic on the A . There d be a paper princess Kate but we d all stare at paper Pippa  and then we d all live in fear of killer Jack the Paper Ripper  because the paper propaganda propagates the people's prejudices  papers printing pictures of the photogenic terrorists. A little paper me. And a little paper you. And in a pop up population people s problems pop up too. There d be a pompous paper parliament who remained out of touch  and who ignored the people's protests about all the paper cuts  then the peaceful paper protests would get blown to paper pieces  by the confetti cannons manned by pre emptive police. And yes there d still be paper money  so there d still be paper greed  and the paper piggy bankers pocketing more than they need  purchasing the potpourri to pepper their paper properties  others live in poverty and ain t acknowledged properly. A proper poor economy where so many are proper poor  but while their needs are ignored the money goes to big wars. Origami armies unfold plans for paper planes and we remain imprisoned in our own paper chains  but the greater shame is that it always seems to stay the same  what changes is who s in power choosing how to lay the blame  they re naming names  forgetting these are names of people  because in the end it all comes down to people. I like people. 'Cause even when the situation s dire  it is only ever people who are able to inspire  and on paper  it s hard to see how we all cope. But in the bottom of Pandora s box there s still hope  and I still hope 'cause I believe in people. People like my grandparents. Who every single day since I was born  have taken time out of their morning to pray for me. That s      days straight of someone checking I m okay  and that s amazing. People like my aunt who puts on plays with prisoners. People who are capable of genuine forgiveness. People like the persecuted Palestinians. People who go out of their way to make your life better  and expect nothing in return. You see  people have potential to be powerful. Just because the people in power tend to pretend to be victims we don t need to succumb to that system. And a paper population is no different. There s a little paper me. And a little paper you. And in a pop up population people's problems pop up too  but even if the whole world fell apart then we d still make it through. Because we re people. Thank you. Thank you very much. I've just got time for one more. For me  poetry has been the ultimate way of ideas without frontiers. When I first started  the people who inspired me were the ones with the amazing stories  and I thought  as an    year old with a happy life  it was too normal  but I could create these worlds where I could talk about my experiences and dreams and beliefs. So it's amazing to be here in front of you today. Thank you for being here. If you weren't here  it would be pretty much like the sound check yesterday. And this is more fun. So this last one is called  The Sunshine Kid.  Thank you very much for listening. Old man sunshine was proud of his sun  And it brightened his day to see his little boy run  Not because of what he d done  nor the problems overcome  But that despite that his disposition remained a sunny one. It hadn t always been like this. There d been times when he d tried to hide his brightness  You see  every star hits periods of hardship  It takes a brighter light to inspire them through the darkness. If we go back to when he was born in a nebula  We know that he never was thought of as regular  Because he had a flair about him  To say the Midas touch is wrong But all he went near seemed to turn a little bronze  Yes this sun was loved by some more than others  It was a case of Joseph and his dreamcoat and his brothers Because standing out from the crowd had its pros and its cons  And jealousy created enemies in those he outshone Such as the Shadow People. Now the Shadow People didn t like the Sunshine Kid  Because he showed up the dark things the Shadow People did  And when he shone he showed the places where the Shadow People hid  So the Shadow People had an evil plan to get rid of him  First up    they made fun of his sunspots  Shooting his dreams from the sky  their words were gunshots  Designed to remind him he wasn t very cool And he didn t fit in with any popular kids at school. They said his head was up in space and they would bring him down to Earth  Essentially he came from nothing and that is what he was worth  He d never get to go to university to learn  Only degrees he d ever show would be the first degree burns From those that came too close  they told him he was too bright  That s why no one ever looked him in the eyes  His judgment became clouded So did the sky  With evaporated tears as the sun started to cry. Because the sunshine kid was bright  with a warm personality  And inside he burned savagely Hurt by the words and curses of the shadowy folk who spoke holes in his soul and left cavities  And as his heart hardened  his spark darkened  Every time they called him names it cooled his flames  He thought they might like him if he kept his light dim But they were busy telling lightning she had terrible aim  He couldn t quite get to grips with what they said  So he let his light be eclipsed by what they said  He fell into a Lone Star State like Texas  And felt like he d been punched in his solar plexus. But that s when Little Miss Sunshine came along Singing her favorite song about how we re made to be strong  And you don t have to be wrong to belong  Just be true to who you are  because we are all stars at heart. Little Miss Sunshine was hot stuff  The kind of girl when you looked at her you forgot stuff  But for him  there was no forgetting her  The minute he saw her her image burned in his retina  She was out of this world  and she accepted him  Something about this girl meant he knew whenever she was next to him  Things weren t as dark as they seemed  and he dared to dream  Shadows were nowhere to be seen  when she was there he beamed  His eyes would light up in ways that can t be faked  When she grinned her rays erased the razor tipped words of hate  They gave each other nicknames  they were  cool star  and  fun sun   And gradually the shadowy damage became undone  She was one in a septillion  and she was brilliant  Could turn the coldest blooded reptilians vermillion  Loved by billions  from Chileans to Brazilians  And taught the Sunshine Kid the meaning of resilience. She said   All the darkness in the world cannot put out the light from a single candle So how the hell can they handle your light  Only you can choose to dim it  and the sky is the limit  so silence the critics by burning.  And if eyes are windows to the soul then she drew back the curtains And let the sun shine through the hurting. In a universe of adversity these stars stuck together  And though days became nights the memories would last forever  Whether the weatherman said it or not  it would be fine  'Cause even behind the clouds the kid could still shine. Yes  the Sunshine Kid was bright  with a warm personality  And inside he burned savagely  Fueled by the fire inspired across galaxies By the girl who showed him belief. Thank you very much. Twenty five years ago  scientists at CERN created the World Wide Web. Since then  the Internet has transformed  the way we communicate  the way we do business  and even the way we live. In many ways  the ideas that gave birth to Google  Facebook  Twitter  and so many others  have now really transformed our lives  and this has brought us many real benefits such as a more connected society. However  there are also some downsides to this. Today  the average person has an astounding amount of personal information online  and we add to this online information every single time we post on Facebook  each time we search on Google  and each time we send an email. Now  many of us probably think  well  one email  there's nothing in there  right  But if you consider a year's worth of emails  or maybe even a lifetime of email  collectively  this tells a lot. It tells where we have been  who we have met  and in many ways  even what we're thinking about. And the more scary part about this is our data now lasts forever  so your data can and will outlive you. What has happened is that we've largely lost control over our data and also our privacy. So this year  as the web turns     it's very important for us to take a moment and think about the implications of this. We have to really think. We've lost privacy  yes  but actually what we've also lost is the idea of privacy itself. If you think about it  most of us here today probably remember  what life was like before the Internet  but today  there's a new generation that is being taught from a very young age to share everything online  and this is a generation that is not  going to remember when data was private. So we keep going down this road     years from now  the word 'privacy' is going to have a completely different meaning from what it means to you and I. So  it's time for us  to take a moment and think  is there anything we can do about this  And I believe there is. Let's take a look at one of the most widely used forms of communication in the world today  email. Before the invention of email  we largely communicated using letters  and the process was quite simple. You would first start by writing your message on a piece of paper  then you would place it into a sealed envelope  and from there  you would go ahead and send it after you put a stamp and address on it. Unfortunately  today  when we actually send an email  we're not sending a letter. What you are sending  in many ways  is actually a postcard  and it's a postcard in the sense that everybody that sees it from the time it leaves your computer to when it gets to the recipient can actually read the entire contents. So  the solution to this has been known for some time  and there's many attempts to do it. The most basic solution is to use encryption  and the idea is quite simple. First  you encrypt the connection between your computer and the email server. Then  you also encrypt the data as it sits on the server itself. But there's a problem with this  and that is  the email servers also hold the encryption keys  so now you have a really big lock with a key placed right next to it. But not only that  any government could lawfully ask for and get the key to your data  and this is all without you being aware of it. So the way we fix this problem is actually relatively easy  in principle  You give everybody their own keys  and then you make sure the server doesn't actually have the keys. This seems like common sense  right  So the question that comes up is  why hasn't this been done yet  Well  if we really think about it  we see that the business model of the Internet today really isn't compatible with privacy. Just take a look at some of the biggest names on the web  and you see that advertising plays a huge role. In fact  this year alone  advertising is     billion dollars  and to optimize the ads that are shown to us  companies have to know everything about us. They need to know where we live  how old we are  what we like  what we don't like  and anything else they can get their hands on. And if you think about it  the best way to get this information is really just to invade our privacy. So these companies aren't going to give us our privacy. If we want to have privacy online  what we have to do is we've got to go out and get it ourselves. For many years  when it came to email  the only solution was something known as PGP  which was quite complicated and only accessible to the tech savvy. Here's a diagram that basically shows the process for encrypting and decrypting messages. So needless to say  this is not a solution for everybody  and this actually is part of the problem  because if you think about communication  by definition  it involves having someone to communicate with. So while PGP does a great job of what it's designed to do  for the people out there who can't understand how to use it  the option to communicate privately simply does not exist. And this is a problem that we need to solve. So if we want to have privacy online  the only way we can succeed is if we get the whole world on board  and this is only possible if we bring down the barrier to entry. I think this is actually the key challenge that lies in the tech community. What we really have to do is work and make privacy more accessible. So last summer  when the Edward Snowden story came out  several colleagues and I decided to see if we could make this happen. At that time  we were working at the European Organization for Nuclear Research at the world's largest particle collider  which collides protons  by the way. We were all scientists  so we used our scientific creativity and came up with a very creative name for our project  ProtonMail.  Laughter  Many startups these days actually begin in people's garages or people's basements. We were a bit different. We started out at the CERN cafeteria  which actually is great  because look  you have all the food and water you could ever want. But even better than this is that every day between    p.m. and   p.m.  free of charge  the CERN cafeteria comes with several thousand scientists and engineers  and these guys basically know the answers to everything. So it was in this environment that we began working. What we actually want to do is we want to take your email and turn it into something that looks more like this  but more importantly  we want to do it in a way that you can't even tell that it's happened. So to do this  we actually need a combination of technology and also design. So how do we go about doing something like this  Well  it's probably a good idea not to put the keys on the server. So what we do is we generate encryption keys on your computer  and we don't generate a single key  but actually a pair of keys  so there's an RSA private key and an RSA public key  and these keys are mathematically connected. So let's have a look and see how this works when multiple people communicate. So here we have Bob and Alice  who want to communicate privately. So the key challenge is to take Bob's message and to get it to Alice in such a way that the server cannot read that message. So what we have to do is we have to encrypt it before it even leaves Bob's computer  and one of the tricks is  we encrypt it using the public key from Alice. Now this encrypted data is sent through the server to Alice  and because the message was encrypted using Alice's public key  the only key that can now decrypt it is a private key that belongs to Alice  and it turns out Alice is the only person that actually has this key. So we've now accomplished the objective  which is to get the message from Bob to Alice without the server being able to read what's going on. Actually  what I've shown here is a highly simplified picture. The reality is much more complex and it requires a lot of software that looks a bit like this. And that's actually the key design challenge  How do we take all this complexity  all this software  and implement it in a way that the user cannot see it. I think with ProtonMail  we have gotten pretty close to doing this. So let's see how it works in practice. Here  we've got Bob and Alice again  who also want to communicate securely. They simply create accounts on ProtonMail  which is quite simple and takes a few moments  and all the key encryption and generation is happening automatically in the background as Bob is creating his account. Once his account is created  he just clicks  compose   and now he can write his email like he does today. So he fills in his information  and then after that   all he has to do is click  send   and just like that  without understanding cryptography  and without doing anything different from how he writes email today  Bob has just sent an encrypted message. What we have here is really just the first step  but it shows that with improving technology  privacy doesn't have to be difficult  it doesn't have to be disruptive. If we change the goal from maximizing  ad revenue to protecting data  we can actually make it accessible. Now  I know a question on everybody's minds is  okay  protecting privacy  this is a great goal  but can you actually do this without the tons of money that advertisements give you  And I think the answer is actually yes  because today  we've reached a point where people around the world really understand how important privacy is  and when you have that  anything is possible. Earlier this year  ProtonMail actually had so many users  that we ran out of resources  and when this happened  our community of users got together and donated half a million dollars. So this is just an example of what can happen when you bring the community together towards a common goal. We can also leverage the world. Right now  we have a quarter of a million people that have signed up for ProtonMail  and these people come from everywhere  and this really shows that privacy is not just an American or a European issue  it's a global issue that impacts all of us. It's something that we really have to pay attention to going forward. So what do we have to do to solve this problem  Well  first of all  we need to support a different business model for the Internet  one that does not rely entirely on advertisements for revenue and for growth. We actually need to build a new Internet where our privacy and our ability  to control our data is first and foremost. But even more importantly  we have to build an Internet  where privacy is no longer just an option but is also the default. We have done the first step with ProtonMail  but this is really just the first step in a very  very long journey. The good news I can share with you guys today  the exciting news  is that we're not traveling alone. The movement to protect people's privacy and freedom online is really gaining momentum  and today  there are dozens of projects from all around the world who are working together to improve our privacy. These projects protect things from our chat to voice communications  also our file storage  our online search  our online browsing  and many other things. And these projects are not backed by billions of dollars in advertising  but they've found support really from the people  from private individuals like you and I from all over the world. This really matters  because ultimately  privacy depends on each and every one of us  and we have to protect it now because our online data is more than just a collection of ones and zeros. It's actually a lot more than that. It's our lives  our personal stories  our friends  our families  and in many ways  also our hopes and our aspirations. We need to spend time now to really protect our right to share this only with people that we want to share this with  because without this  we simply can't have a free society. So now's the time for us to collectively stand up and say  yes  we do want to live in a world with online privacy  and yes  we can work together to turn this vision into a reality. Thank you. About    years ago  I gave up my career in banking to try to make the world a safer place. This involved a journey into national and global advocacy and meeting some of the most extraordinary people in the world. In the process  I became a civil society diplomat. Civil society diplomats do three things  They voice the concerns of the people  are not pinned down by national interests  and influence change through citizen networks  not only state ones. And if you want to change the world  we need more of them. But many people still ask   Can civil society really make a big difference  Can citizens influence and shape national and global policy   I never thought I would ask myself these questions  but here I am to share some lessons about two powerful civil society  movements that I've been involved in. They are in issues that I'm passionate about  gun control and drug policy. And these are issues that matter here. Latin America is ground zero for both of them. For example  Brazil    this beautiful country hosting TEDGlobal has the world's ugliest record. We are the number one champion in homicidal violence. One in every    people killed around the world is a Brazilian. This translates into over        people dying violently each year. Most of them are young  black boys dying by guns. Brazil is also one of the world's largest consumers of drugs  and the War on Drugs has been especially painful here. Around    percent of the homicides in the streets in Brazil are related to the War on Drugs. The same is true for about    percent of people in jail. And it's not just Brazil that is affected by the twin problems of guns and drugs. Virtually every country and city across Central and South America is in trouble. Latin America has nine percent of the world's population  but    percent of its global violent deaths. These are not problems we can run away from. I certainly could not. So the first campaign I got involved with started here in      to change Brazil's gun law and to create a program to buy back weapons. In just a few years  we not only changed national legislation that made it much more difficult for civilians to buy a gun  but we collected and destroyed almost half a million weapons. This was one of the biggest buyback programs in history    but we also suffered some setbacks. We lost a referendum to ban gun sales to civilians in     . The second initiative was also home grown  but is today a global movement to reform the international drug control regime. I am the executive coordinator of something called the Global Commission on Drug Policy. The commission is a high level group of global leaders brought together to identify more humane and effective approaches to the issue of drugs. Since we started in       the taboo on drugs is broken. Across the Americas  from the US and Mexico to Colombia and Uruguay  change is in the air. But rather than tell you the whole story about these two movements  I just want to share with you four key insights. I call them lessons to change the world. There are certainly many more  but these are the ones that stand out to me. So the first lesson is  Change and control the narrative. It may seem obvious  but a key ingredient to civil society diplomacy is first changing and then controlling the narrative. This is something that veteran politicians understand  but that civil society groups generally do not do very well. In the case of drug policy  our biggest success has been to change the discussion away from prosecuting a War on Drugs to putting people's health and safety first. In a cutting edge report we just launched in New York  we also showed that the groups benefiting most from this      billion market are criminal gangs and cartels. So in order to undermine the power and profit of these groups  we need to change the conversation. We need to make illegal drugs legal. But before I get you too excited  I don't mean drugs should be a free for all. What I'm talking about  and what the Global Commission advocates for is creating a highly regulated market  where different drugs would have different degrees of regulation. As for gun control  we were successful in changing  but not so much in controlling  the narrative. And this brings me to my next lesson  Never underestimate your opponents. If you want to succeed in changing the world  you need to know who you're up against. You need to learn their motivations and points of view. In the case of gun control  we really underestimated our opponents. After a very successful gun collection program  we were elated. We had support from    percent of Brazilians  and thought that this could help us win the referendum to ban gun sales to civilians. But we were dead wrong. During a televised    day public debate  our opponent used our own arguments against us. We ended up losing the popular vote. It was really terrible. The National Rifle Association    yes  the American NRA    came to Brazil. They inundated our campaign with their propaganda  that as you know  links the right to own guns to ideas of freedom and democracy. They simply threw everything at us. They used our national flag  our independence anthem. They invoked women's rights and misused images of Mandela  Tiananmen Square  and even Hitler. They won by playing with people's fears. In fact  guns were almost completely ignored in their campaign. Their focus was on individual rights. But I ask you  which right is more important  the right to life or the right to have a gun that takes life away  We thought people would vote in defense of life  but in a country with a recent past of military dictatorship  the anti government message of our opponents resonated  and we were not prepared to respond. Lesson learned. We've been more successful in the case of drug policy. If you asked most people    years ago if an end to the War on Drugs was possible  they would have laughed. After all  there are huge military police prisons and financial establishments benefiting from this war. But today  the international drug control regime is starting to crumble. Governments and civil societies are experimenting with new approaches. The Global Commission on Drug Policy really knew its opposition  and rather than fighting them  our chair    former Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso    reached out to leaders from across the political spectrum  from liberals to conservatives. This high level group agreed to honestly discuss the merits and flaws of drug policies. It was this reasoned  informed and strategic discussion that revealed the sad truth about the War on Drugs. The War on Drugs has simply failed across every metric. Drugs are cheaper and more available than ever  and consumption has risen globally. But even worse  it also generated massive negative unintended consequences. It is true that some people have made these arguments before  but we've made a difference by anticipating the arguments of our opponents and by leveraging powerful voices that a few years ago would probably have resisted change. Third lesson  Use data to drive your argument. Guns and drugs are emotive issues  and as we've painfully learned in the gun referendum campaign in Brazil  sometimes it's impossible to cut through the emotions and get to the facts. But this doesn't mean that we shouldn't try. Until quite recently  we simply didn't know how many Brazilians were killed by guns. Amazingly  it was a local soap opera called  Mulheres Apaixonadas     or  Women in Love     that kicked off Brazil's national gun control campaign. In one highly viewed episode  a soap opera lead actress was killed by a stray bullet. Brazilian grannies and housewives were outraged  and in a case of art imitating life  this episode also included footage of a real gun control march that we had organized right here  outside in Copacabana Beach. The televised death and march had a huge impact on public opinion. Within weeks  our national congress approved the disarmament bill that had been languishing for years. We were then able to mobilize data to show the successful outcomes of the change in the law and gun collection program. Here is what I mean  We could prove that in just one year  we saved more than       lives. And in the case of drugs  in order to undermine this fear and prejudice that surrounds the issue  we managed to gather and present data that shows that today's drug policies cause much more harm than drug use per se  and people are starting to get it. My fourth insight is  Don't be afraid to bring together odd bedfellows. What we've learned in Brazil    and this doesn't only apply to my country    is the importance of bringing diverse and eclectic folks together. If you want to change the world  it helps to have a good cross section of society on your side. In both the case of guns and drugs  we brought together a wonderful mix of people. We mobilized the elite and got huge support from the media. We gathered the victims  human rights champions  cultural icons. We also assembled the professional classes    doctors  lawyers  academia and more. What I've learned over the last years is that you need coalitions of the willing and of the unwilling to make change. In the case of drugs  we needed libertarians  anti prohibitionists  legalizers  and liberal politicians. They may not agree on everything  in fact  they disagree on almost everything. But the legitimacy of the campaign is based on their diverse points of view. Over a decade ago  I had a comfortable future working for an investment bank. I was as far removed from the world of civil society diplomacy as you can imagine. But I took a chance. I changed course  and on the way  I helped  to create social movements that I believe have made  some parts of the world safer. Each and every one of us has the power to change the world. No matter what the issue  and no matter how hard the fight  civil society is central to the blueprint for change. Thank you. Traditional prescriptions for growth in Africa are not working very well. After one trillion dollars in African development related aid in the last    years  real per capita income today is lower than it was in the     s. Aid is not doing too well. In response  the Bretton Woods institutions    the IMF and the World Bank    pushed for free trade not aid  yet the historical record shows little empirical evidence that free trade leads to economic growth. The newly prescribed  silver bullet is microcredit. We seem to be fixated on this romanticized idea that every poor peasant in Africa is an entrepreneur. Yet my work and travel in    plus countries across Africa have taught me that most people want jobs instead. My solution  Forget micro entrepreneurs. Let's invest in building pan African titans like Sudanese businessman Mo Ibrahim. Mo took a contrarian bet on Africa when he founded Celtel International in '   and built it into a mobile  cellular provider with    million subscribers across    African countries by     . The Mo model might be better than the everyman entrepreneur model  which prevents an effective means of diffusion and knowledge sharing. Perhaps we are not at a stage in Africa where many actors and small enterprises leads to growth through competition. Consider these two alternative scenarios. One  You loan     dollars  to each of     banana farmers allowing them to dry  their surplus bananas and fetch    percent more revenue at the local market. Or two  You give         dollars to one savvy entrepreneur and help her set up a factory that yields    percent additional income to all     banana farmers and creates    additional jobs. We invested in the second scenario  and backed    year old Kenyan entrepreneur Eric Muthomi to set up an agro processing factory called Stawi to produce gluten free banana based flour and baby food. Stawi is leveraging economies of scale and using modern manufacturing processes to create value for not only its owners but its workers  who have an ownership in the business. Our dream is to take an Eric Muthomi and try to help him become a Mo Ibrahim  which requires skill  financing  local and global partnerships  and extraordinary perseverance. But why pan African  The scramble for Africa during the Berlin Conference of         where  quite frankly  we Africans were not exactly consulted    resulted in massive fragmentation and many sovereign states with small populations  Liberia  four million  Cape Verde         . Pan Africa gives you one billion people  granted across    countries with trade barriers and other impediments  but our ancestors traded across the continent before Europeans drew lines around us. The pan African opportunities outweigh the challenges  and that's why we're expanding Stawi's markets from just Kenya to Algeria  Nigeria  Ghana  and anywhere else that will buy our food. We hope to help solve food security  empower farmers  create jobs  develop the local economy  and we hope to become rich in the process. While it's not the sexiest approach  and maybe it doesn't achieve the same feel good as giving a woman     dollars  to buy a goat on kiva.org  perhaps supporting fewer  higher impact entrepreneurs to build massive businesses that scale pan Africa can help change this. The political freedom for which our forebearers fought is meaningless without economic freedom. We hope to aid this fight for economic freedom by building world class businesses  creating indigenous wealth  providing jobs that we so desperately need  and hopefully helping achieve this. Africa shall rise. Thank you. Tom Rielly  So Sangu  of course  this is strong rhetoric. You're making     percent contrast between microcredit and regular investment and growing regular investment. Do you think there is a role for microcredit at all  Sangu Delle  I think there is a role. Microcredit has been a great  innovative way to expand financial access to the bottom of the pyramid. But for the problems we face in Africa  when we are looking at the Marshall Plan to revitalize war torn Europe  it was not full of donations of sheep. We need more than just microcredit. We need more than just give     dollars. We need to build big businesses  and we need jobs. TR  Very good. Thank you so much. Today I'm going to speak to you about the last    years of architectural history. That's a lot to pack into    minutes. It's a complex topic  so we're just going to dive right in at a complex place  New Jersey. Because    years ago  I'm from Jersey  and I was six  and I lived there in my parents' house in a town called Livingston  and this was my childhood bedroom. Around the corner from my bedroom was the bathroom that I used to share with my sister. And in between my bedroom and the bathroom was a balcony that overlooked the family room. And that's where everyone would hang out and watch TV  so that every time that I walked from my bedroom to the bathroom  everyone would see me  and every time I took a shower and would come back in a towel  everyone would see me. And I looked like this. I was awkward  insecure  and I hated it. I hated that walk  I hated that balcony  I hated that room  and I hated that house. And that's architecture. Done. That feeling  those emotions that I felt  that's the power of architecture  because architecture is not about math and it's not about zoning  it's about those visceral  emotional connections that we feel to the places that we occupy. And it's no surprise that we feel that way  because according to the EPA  Americans spend    percent of their time indoors. That's    percent of our time surrounded by architecture. That's huge. That means that architecture is shaping us in ways that we didn't even realize. That makes us a little bit gullible and very  very predictable. It means that when I show you a building like this  I know what you think  You think  power  and  stability  and  democracy.  And I know you think that because it's based on a building that was build       years ago by the Greeks. This is a trick. This is a trigger that architects use to get you to create an emotional connection to the forms that we build our buildings out of. It's a predictable emotional connection  and we've been using this trick for a long  long time. We used it       years ago to build banks. We used it in the   th century to build art museums. And in the   th century in America  we used it to build houses. And look at these solid  stable little soldiers facing the ocean and keeping away the elements. This is really  really useful  because building things is terrifying. It's expensive  it takes a long time  and it's very complicated. And the people that build things    developers and governments    they're naturally afraid of innovation  and they'd rather just use those forms that they know you'll respond to. That's how we end up with buildings like this. This is a nice building. This is the Livingston Public Library that was completed in      in my hometown  and  you know  it's got a dome and it's got this round thing  and columns  red brick  and you can kind of guess what Livingston is trying to say with this building  children  property values and history. But it doesn't have much to do with what a library actually does today. That same year  in       on the other side of the country  another library was completed  and it looks like this. It's in Seattle. This library is about how we consume media in a digital age. It's about a new kind of public amenity for the city  a place to gather and read and share. So how is it possible that in the same year  in the same country  two buildings  both called libraries  look so completely different  And the answer is that architecture works on the principle of a pendulum. On the one side is innovation  and architects are constantly pushing  pushing for new technologies  new typologies  new solutions for the way that we live today. And we push and we push and we push until we completely alienate all of you. We wear all black  we get very depressed  you think we're adorable  we're dead inside because we've got no choice. We have to go to the other side and reengage those symbols that we know you love. So we do that  and you're happy  we feel like sellouts  so we start experimenting again and we push the pendulum back and back and forth and back and forth we've gone for the last     years  and certainly for the last    years. Okay     years ago we were coming out of the '  s. Architects had been busy experimenting with something called brutalism. It's about concrete. You can guess this. Small windows  dehumanizing scale. This is really tough stuff. So as we get closer to the '  s  we start to reengage those symbols. We push the pendulum back into the other direction. We take these forms that we know you love and we update them. We add neon and we add pastels and we use new materials. And you love it. And we can't give you enough of it. We take Chippendale armoires and we turned those into skyscrapers  and skyscrapers can be medieval castles made out of glass. Forms got big  forms got bold and colorful. Dwarves became columns. Swans grew to the size of buildings. It was crazy. But it's the '  s  it's cool. We're all hanging out in malls and we're all moving to the suburbs  and out there  out in the suburbs  we can create our own architectural fantasies. And those fantasies  they can be Mediterranean or French or Italian. Possibly with endless breadsticks. This is the thing about postmodernism. This is the thing about symbols. They're easy  they're cheap  because instead of making places  we're making memories of places. Because I know   and I know all of you know  this isn't Tuscany. This is Ohio. So architects get frustrated  and we start pushing the pendulum back into the other direction. In the late '  s and early '  s  we start experimenting with something called deconstructivism. We throw out historical symbols  we rely on new  computer aided design techniques  and we come up with new compositions  forms crashing into forms. This is academic and heady stuff  it's super unpopular  we totally alienate you. Ordinarily  the pendulum would just swing back into the other direction. And then  something amazing happened. In       this building opened. This is the Guggenheim Bilbao  by Frank Gehry. And this building fundamentally changes the world's relationship to architecture. Paul Goldberger said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when critics  academics  and the general public were completely united around a building. The New York Times called this building a miracle. Tourism in Bilbao increased       percent after this building was completed. So all of a sudden  everybody wants one of these buildings  L.A.  Seattle  Chicago  New York  Cleveland  Springfield. Everybody wants one  and Gehry is everywhere. He is our very first starchitect. Now  how is it possible that these forms    they're wild and radical    how is it possible that they become so ubiquitous throughout the world  And it happened because media so successfully galvanized around them that they quickly taught us that these forms mean culture and tourism. We created an emotional reaction to these forms. So did every mayor in the world. So every mayor knew that if they had these forms  they had culture and tourism. This phenomenon at the turn of the new millennium happened to a few other starchitects. It happened to Zaha and it happened to Libeskind  and what happened to these elite few architects at the turn of the new millennium could actually start to happen to the entire field of architecture  as digital media starts to increase the speed with which we consume information. Because think about how you consume architecture. A thousand years ago  you would have had to have walked to the village next door to see a building. Transportation speeds up  You can take a boat  you can take a plane  you can be a tourist. Technology speeds up  You can see it in a newspaper  on TV  until finally  we are all architectural photographers  and the building has become disembodied from the site. Architecture is everywhere now  and that means that the speed of communication has finally caught up to the speed of architecture. Because architecture actually moves quite quickly. It doesn't take long to think about a building. It takes a long time to build a building  three or four years  and in the interim  an architect will design two or eight or a hundred other buildings before they know if that building that they designed four years ago was a success or not. That's because there's never been a good feedback loop in architecture. That's how we end up with buildings like this. Brutalism wasn't a two year movement  it was a    year movement. For    years  we were producing buildings like this because we had no idea how much you hated it. It's never going to happen again  I think  because we are living on the verge of the greatest revolution in architecture since the invention of concrete  of steel  or of the elevator  and it's a media revolution. So my theory is that when you apply media to this pendulum  it starts swinging faster and faster  until it's at both extremes nearly simultaneously  and that effectively blurs the difference between innovation and symbol  between us  the architects  and you  the public. Now we can make nearly instantaneous  emotionally charged symbols out of something that's brand new. Let me show you how this plays out in a project that my firm recently completed. We were hired to replace this building  which burned down. This is the center of a town called the Pines in Fire Island in New York State. It's a vacation community. We proposed a building that was audacious  that was different than any of the forms that the community was used to  and we were scared and our client was scared and the community was scared  so we created a series of photorealistic renderings that we put onto Facebook and we put onto Instagram  and we let people start to do what they do  share it  comment  like it  hate it. But that meant that two years before the building was complete  it was already a part of the community  so that when the renderings looked exactly like the finished product  there were no surprises. This building was already a part of this community  and then that first summer  when people started arriving and sharing the building on social media  the building ceased to be just an edifice and it became media  because these  these are not just pictures of a building  they're your pictures of a building. And as you use them to tell your story  they become part of your personal narrative  and what you're doing is you're short circuiting all of our collective memory  and you're making these charged symbols for us to understand. That means we don't need the Greeks anymore to tell us what to think about architecture. We can tell each other what we think about architecture  because digital media hasn't just changed the relationship between all of us  it's changed the relationship between us and buildings. Think for a second about those librarians back in Livingston. If that building was going to be built today  the first thing they would do is go online and search  new libraries.  They would be bombarded by examples of experimentation  of innovation  of pushing at the envelope of what a library can be. That's ammunition. That's ammunition that they can take with them to the mayor of Livingston  to the people of Livingston  and say  there's no one answer to what a library is today. Let's be a part of this. This abundance of experimentation gives them the freedom to run their own experiment. Everything is different now. Architects are no longer these mysterious creatures that use big words and complicated drawings  and you aren't the hapless public  the consumer that won't accept anything that they haven't seen anymore. Architects can hear you  and you're not intimidated by architecture. That means that that pendulum swinging back and forth from style to style  from movement to movement  is irrelevant. We can actually move forward and find relevant solutions to the problems that our society faces. This is the end of architectural history  and it means that the buildings of tomorrow are going to look a lot different than the buildings of today. It means that a public space in the ancient city of Seville can be unique and tailored to the way that a modern city works. It means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be a stadium in Brooklyn  not some red brick historical pastiche of what we think a stadium ought to be. It means that robots are going to build our buildings  because we're finally ready for the forms that they're going to produce. And it means that buildings will twist to the whims of nature instead of the other way around. It means that a parking garage in Miami Beach  Florida  can also be a place for sports and for yoga and you can even get married there late at night. It means that three architects can dream about swimming in the East River of New York  and then raise nearly half a million dollars from a community that gathered around their cause  no one client anymore. It means that no building is too small for innovation  like this little reindeer pavilion that's as muscly and sinewy as the animals it's designed to observe. And it means that a building doesn't have to be beautiful to be lovable  like this ugly little building in Spain  where the architects dug a hole  packed it with hay  and then poured concrete around it  and when the concrete dried  they invited someone to come and clean that hay out so that all that's left when it's done is this hideous little room that's filled with the imprints and scratches of how that place was made  and that becomes the most sublime place to watch a Spanish sunset. Because it doesn't matter if a cow builds our buildings or a robot builds our buildings. It doesn't matter how we build  it matters what we build. Architects already know how to make buildings that are greener and smarter and friendlier. We've just been waiting for all of you to want them. And finally  we're not on opposite sides anymore. Find an architect  hire an architect  work with us to design better buildings  better cities  and a better world  because the stakes are high. Buildings don't just reflect our society  they shape our society down to the smallest spaces  the local libraries  the homes where we raise our children  and the walk that they take from the bedroom to the bathroom. Thank you. We need to change the culture in our jails and prisons  especially for young inmates. New York state is one of only two in the U.S. that automatically arrests and tries     to    year olds as adults. This culture of violence takes these young people and puts them in a hostile environment  and the correctional officers pretty much allow any and everything to go on. There's not really much for these young people to do to actually enhance their talent and actually rehabilitate them. Until we can raise the age of criminal responsibility to     we need to focus on changing the daily lives of these young people. I know firsthand. Before I ever turned     I spent approximately     days on Rikers Island  and to add to that I spent almost     days in solitary confinement  and let me tell you this  Screaming at the top of your lungs all day on your cell door or screaming at the top of your lungs out the window  it gets tiring. Since there's not much for you to do while you're in there  you start pacing back and forth in your cell  you start talking to yourself  your thoughts start running wild  and then your thoughts become your own worst enemy. Jails are actually supposed to rehabilitate a person  not cause him or her to become more angry  frustrated  and feel more hopeless. Since there's not a discharge plan put in place for these young people  they pretty much  reenter society with nothing. And there's not really much for them to do to keep them from recidivating. But it all starts with the C.O.s. It's very easy for some people to look at these correctional officers as the good guys and the inmates as the bad guys  or vice versa for some  but it's a little more than that. See  these C.O.s are normal  everyday people. They come from the same neighborhoods as the population they  serve.  They're just normal people. They're not robots  and there's  nothing special about them. They do pretty much everything anybody else in society does. The male C.O.s want to talk and flirt with the female C.O.s. They play the little high school kid games with each other. They politic with one another. And the female C.O.s gossip to each other. So I spent numerous amounts of time with numerous amounts of C.O.s  and let me tell you about this one in particular named Monroe. One day he pulled me in between the A and B doors which separate the north and south sides of our housing unit. He pulled me there because I had a physical altercation with another young man in my housing unit  and he felt  since there was a female officer working on the floor  that I violated his shift. So he punched me in my chest. He kind of knocked the wind out of me. I wasn't impulsive  I didn't react right away  because I know this is their house. I have no wins. All he has to do is pull his pin and backup will come immediately. So I just gave him a look in his eyes and I guess he saw the anger and frustration just burning  and he said to me   Your eyes are going to get you in a lot of trouble  because you're looking like you want to fight.  So he commenced to taking off his utility belt  he took off his shirt and his badge  and he said   We could fight.  So I asked him   You gonna hold it down   Now  that's a term that's commonly used on Rikers Island meaning that you're not going to say anything to anybody  and you're not going to report it. He said   Yeah  I'm gonna hold it down. You gonna hold it down   I didn't even respond. I just punched him right in his face  and we began fighting right then and there. Towards the end of the fight  he slammed me up against the wall  so while we were tussled up  he said to me   You good   as if he got the best of me  but in my mind  I know I got the best of him  so I replied very cocky   Oh  I'm good  you good   He said   Yeah  I'm good   I'm good.  We let go  he shook my hand  said he gave me my respect  gave me a cigarette and sent me on my way. Believe it or not  you come across some C.O.s on Rikers Island that'll fight you one on one. They feel that they understand how it is  and they feel that I'm going to meet you where you're at. Since this is how you commonly handle your disputes  we can handle it in that manner. I walk away from it like a man  you walk away from it like a man  and that's it. Some C.O.s feel that they're jailing with you. This is why they have that mentality and that attitude and they go by that concept. In some instances  we're in it together with the C.O.s. However  institutions need to give these correctional officers proper trainings on how to properly deal with the adolescent population  and they also need to give them proper trainings on how to deal with  the mental health population as well. These C.O.s play a big factor in these young people's lives for x amount of time until a disposition is reached on their case. So why not try to mentor these young people while they're there  Why not try to give them some type of insight to make a change  so once they reenter back into society  they're doing something positive  A second big thing to help our teens in jails is better programming. When I was on Rikers Island  the huge thing was solitary confinement. Solitary confinement was originally designed to break a person mentally  physically and emotionally. That's what it was designed for. The U.S. Attorney General recently released a report stating that they're going to ban solitary confinement in New York state for teens. One thing that kept me sane while I was in solitary confinement was reading. I tried to educate myself as much as possible. I read any and everything I could get my hands on. And aside from that  I wrote music and short stories. Some programs that I feel would benefit our young people are art therapy programs for the kids that like to draw and have that talent  and what about the young individuals that are musically inclined  How about a music program for them that actually teaches them how to write and make music  Just a thought. When adolescents come to Rikers Island  C    RNDC is the building that they're housed in. That's nicknamed  gladiator school   because you have a young individual coming in from the street thinking that they're tough  being surrounded by a bunch of other young individuals from all of the five boroughs  and everybody feels that they're tough. So now you have a bunch of young gentlemen poking their chests out feeling that I have to prove I'm equally as tough as you or I'm tougher than you  you and you. But let's be honest  That culture is very dangerous and damaging to our young people. We need to help institutions and these teens realize that they don't have to lead the previous lifestyle that they led when they were on the street  that they can actually make a change. It's sad to report that while I was in prison  I used to hear dudes talking about when they get released from prison  what type of crimes they're going to commit when they get back in the street. The conversations used to sound something like this   Oh  when I hit the street  my brother got this connection for this  that and the third   or   My man over here got this connection for the low price. Let's exchange information   and   When we hit the town  we're going to do it real big.  I used to hear these conversations and think to myself   Wow  these dudes are really talking about going back in the street and committing future crimes.  So I came up with a name for that  I called it a go back to jail quick scheme because really  how long is that going to last  You get a retirement plan with that  Nice little pension      k       b   You get health insurance  Dental  But I will tell you this  Being in jail and being in prison  I came across some of the most intelligent  brilliant  and talented people that I would ever meet. I've seen individuals take a potato chip bag and turn it into the most beautiful picture frame. I've seen individuals take the state soap that's provided for free and turn them into the most beautiful sculptures that would make Michelangelo look like a kindergartner made it. At the age of     I was in a maximum security prison called Elmira Correctional Facility. I just came out of the weight shack from working out  and I saw an older gentleman that I knew standing in the middle of the yard just looking up at the sky. Mind you  this older gentlemen was serving a    and a third to life sentence in which he already had served    years of that sentence. So I walk up to him and I said   O.G.  what's going on  man  you good   He looked at me  and he said   Yeah  I'm good  young blood.  I'm like   So what are you looking up at the sky for  man  What's so fascinating up there   He said   You look up and you tell me what you see.   Clouds.   Laughter  He said   All right. What else do you see   At that time  it was a plane passing by. I said   All right  I see an airplane.  He said   Exactly  and what's  on that airplane    People.   Exactly. Now where's that plane and those people going    I don't know. You know  Please let me know if you do. Then let me get some lottery numbers.  He said   You're missing the big picture  young blood. That plane with those people is going somewhere  while we're here stuck. The big picture is this  That plane with those people going somewhere  that's life passing us by while we behind these walls  stuck.  Ever since that day  that sparked something in my mind and made me know I had to make a change. Growing up  I was always a good  smart kid. Some people would say I was a little too smart for my own good. I had dreams of becoming an architect or an archaeologist. Currently  I'm working at the Fortune Society  which is a reentry program  and I work with people as a case manager that are at high risk for recidivism. So I connect them with the services that they need once they're released from jail and prison so they can make a positive transition back into society. If I was to see my    year old self today  I would sit down and talk to him and try to educate him and I would let him know   Listen  this is me. I'm you. This is us. We are one. Everything that you're about to do  I know what you're gonna do before you do it because I already did it  and I would encourage him not to hang out with x  y and z people. I would tell him not to be in such and such place. I would tell him  keep your behind in school  man  because that's where you need to be  because that's what's going to get you somewhere in life. This is the message that we should be sharing with our young men and young women. We shouldn't be treating them as adults and putting them in cultures of violence that are nearly impossible for them to escape. Thank you. Hello. I'm a toy developer. With a dream of creating new toys that have never been seen before  I began working at a toy company nine years ago. When I first started working there  I proposed many new ideas to my boss every day. However  my boss always asked if I had the data to prove it would sell  and asked me to think of product development after analyzing market data. Data  data  data. So I analyzed the market data before thinking of a product. However  I was unable to think of anything new at that moment. My ideas were unoriginal. I wasn't getting any new ideas and I grew tired of thinking. It was so hard that I became this skinny. It's true.  Applause  You've all probably had similar experiences and felt this way too. Your boss was being difficult. The data was difficult. You become sick of thinking. Now  I throw out the data. It's my dream to create new toys. And now  instead of data  I'm using a game called Shiritori to come up with new ideas. I would like to introduce this method today. What is Shiritori  Take apple  elephant  and trumpet  for example. It's a game where  you take turns saying words that start with the last letter of the previous word. It's the same in Japanese and English. You can play Shiritori as you like   neko  kora  raibu  burashi   etc  etc.  Cat  cola  concert  brush  Many random words will come out. You force those words to connect to what you want to think of and form ideas. In my case  for example  since I want to think of toys  what could a toy cat be  A cat that lands after doing a somersault from a high place  How about a toy with cola  A toy gun where you shoot cola and get someone soaking wet  Ridiculous ideas are okay. The key is to keep them flowing. The more ideas you produce  you're sure to come up with some good ones  too. A brush  for example. Can we make a toothbrush into a toy  We could combine a toothbrush with a guitar and    you've got a toy you can play with while brushing your teeth. Kids who don't like to brush their teeth might begin to like it. Can we make a hat into a toy  How about something like a roulette game  where you try the hat on one by one  and then  when someone puts it on  a scary alien breaks through the top screaming   Ahh   I wonder if there would be a demand for this at parties  Ideas that didn't come out while you stare at the data will start to come out. Actually  this bubble wrap  which is used to pack fragile objects  combined with a toy  made Mugen Pop Pop  a toy where you can pop the bubbles as much as you like. It was a big hit when it reached stores. Data had nothing to do with its success. Although it's only popping bubbles  it's a great way to kill time  so please pass this around amongst yourselves today and play with it. Anyway  you continue to come up with useless ideas. Think up many trivial ideas  everyone. If you base your ideas on data analysis and know what you're aiming for  you'll end up trying too hard  and you can't produce new ideas. Even if you know what your aim is  think of ideas as freely as if you were throwing darts with your eyes closed. If you do this  you surely will hit somewhere near the center. At least one will. That's the one you should choose. If you do so  that idea will be in demand and  moreover  it will be brand new. That is how I think of new ideas. It doesn't have to be Shiritori  there are many different methods. You just have to choose words at random. You can flip through a dictionary and choose words at random. For example  you could look up two random letters and gather the results or go to the store and connect product names with what you want to think of. The point is to gather random words  not information from the category you're thinking for. If you do this  the ingredients for the association of ideas are collected and form connections that will produce many ideas. The greatest advantage to this method is the continuous flow of images. Because you're thinking of one word after another  the image of the previous word is still with you. That image will automatically be related with future words. Unconsciously  a concert will be connected to a brush and a roulette game will be connected to a hat. You wouldn't even realize it. You can come up with ideas that you wouldn't have thought of otherwise. This method is  of course  not just for toys. You can collect ideas for books  apps  events  and many other projects. I hope you all try this method. There are futures that are born from data. However  using this silly game called Shiritori  I look forward to the exciting future you will create  a future you couldn't even imagine. Thank you very much. I have a confession to make. I'm a business professor whose ambition has been to help people learn to lead. But recently  I've discovered that what many of us think of as great leadership does not work when it comes to leading innovation. I'm an ethnographer. I use the methods of anthropology to understand the questions in which I'm interested. So along with three co conspirators  I spent nearly a decade observing up close and personal exceptional leaders of innovation. We studied    men and women  located in seven countries across the globe  working in    different industries. In total  we spent hundreds of hours on the ground  on site  watching these leaders in action. We ended up with pages and pages and pages of field notes that we analyzed and looked for patterns in what our leaders did. The bottom line  If we want to build organizations that can innovate time and again  we must unlearn our conventional notions of leadership. Leading innovation is not about creating a vision  and inspiring others to execute it. But what do we mean by innovation  An innovation is anything that is both new and useful. It can be a product or service. It can be a process or a way of organizing. It can be incremental  or it can be breakthrough. We have a pretty inclusive definition. How many of you recognize this man  Put your hands up. Keep your hands up  if you know who this is. How about these familiar faces  From your show of hands  it looks like many of you have seen a Pixar movie  but very few of you recognized Ed Catmull  the founder and CEO of Pixar    one of the companies I had the privilege of studying. My first visit to Pixar was in       when they were working on  Ratatouille   that provocative movie about a rat becoming a master chef. Computer generated movies are really mainstream today  but it took Ed and his colleagues nearly    years to create the first full length C.G. movie. In the    years hence  they've produced    movies. I was recently at Pixar  and I'm here to tell you that number    is sure to be a winner. When many of us think about innovation  though  we think about an Einstein having an 'Aha ' moment. But we all know that's a myth. Innovation is not about solo genius  it's about collective genius. Let's think for a minute about what it takes to make a Pixar movie  No solo genius  no flash of inspiration produces one of those movies. On the contrary  it takes about     people four to five years  to make one of those movies. To help us understand the process  an individual in the studio drew a version of this picture. He did so reluctantly  because it suggested that the process  was a neat series of steps done by discrete groups. Even with all those arrows  he thought it failed to really tell you just how iterative  interrelated and  frankly  messy their process was. Throughout the making of a movie at Pixar  the story evolves. So think about it. Some shots go through quickly. They don't all go through in order. It depends on how vexing the challenges are that they come up with when they are working on a particular scene. So if you think about that scene in  Up  where the boy hands the piece of chocolate to the bird  that    seconds took one animator almost six months to perfect. The other thing about a Pixar movie is that no part of the movie is considered finished until the entire movie wraps. Partway through one production  an animator drew a character with an arched eyebrow that suggested a mischievous side. When the director saw that drawing  he thought it was great. It was beautiful  but he said   You've got to lose it  it doesn't fit the character.  Two weeks later  the director came back and said   Let's put in those few seconds of film.  Because that animator was allowed to share what we referred to as his slice of genius  he was able to help that director reconceive the character in a subtle but important way that really improved the story. What we know is  at the heart of innovation is a paradox. You have to unleash the talents and passions of many people and you have to harness them into a work that is actually useful. Innovation is a journey. It's a type of collaborative problem solving  usually among people who have different expertise and different points of view. Innovations rarely get created full blown. As many of you know  they're the result  usually  of trial and error. Lots of false starts  missteps and mistakes. Innovative work can be very exhilarating  but it also can be really downright scary. So when we look at why it is that Pixar is able to do what it does  we have to ask ourselves  what's going on here  For sure  history and certainly Hollywood  is full of star studded teams that have failed. Most of those failures are attributed to too many stars or too many cooks  if you will  in the kitchen. So why is it that Pixar  with all of its cooks  is able to be so successful time and time again  When we studied an Islamic Bank in Dubai  or a luxury brand in Korea  or a social enterprise in Africa  we found that innovative organizations are communities that have three capabilities  creative abrasion  creative agility and creative resolution. Creative abrasion is about being able to create a marketplace of ideas through debate and discourse. In innovative organizations  they amplify differences  they don't minimize them. Creative abrasion is not about brainstorming  where people suspend their judgment. No  they know how to have very heated but constructive arguments to create a portfolio of alternatives. Individuals in innovative organizations learn how to inquire  they learn how to actively listen  but guess what  They also learn how to advocate for their point of view. They understand that innovation rarely happens unless you have both diversity and conflict. Creative agility is about being able to test and refine that portfolio of ideas through quick pursuit  reflection and adjustment. It's about discovery driven learning where you act  as opposed to plan  your way to the future. It's about design thinking where you have that interesting combination of the scientific method and the artistic process. It's about running a series of experiments  and not a series of pilots. Experiments are usually about learning. When you get a negative outcome  you're still really learning something that you need to know. Pilots are often about being right. When they don't work  someone or something is to blame. The final capability is creative resolution. This is about doing decision making in a way that you can actually combine even opposing ideas to reconfigure them in new combinations to produce a solution that is new and useful. When you look at innovative organizations  they never go along to get along. They don't compromise. They don't let one group or one individual dominate  even if it's the boss  even if it's the expert. Instead  they have developed a rather patient and more inclusive decision making process that allows for both and solutions to arise and not simply either or solutions. These three capabilities are why we see that Pixar is able to do what it does. Let me give you another example  and that example is the infrastructure group of Google. The infrastructure group of Google is the group that has to keep the website up and running     . So when Google was about to introduce Gmail and YouTube  they knew that their data storage system wasn't adequate. The head of the engineering group and the infrastructure group at that time was a man named Bill Coughran. Bill and his leadership team  who he referred to as his brain trust  had to figure out what to do about this situation. They thought about it for a while. Instead of creating a group to tackle this task  they decided to allow groups to emerge spontaneously around different alternatives. Two groups coalesced. One became known as Big Table  the other became known as Build It From Scratch. Big Table proposed that they build on the current system. Build It From Scratch proposed that it was time for a whole new system. Separately  these two teams were allowed to work full time on their particular approach. In engineering reviews  Bill described his role as   Injecting honesty into the process by driving debate.  Early on  the teams were encouraged to build prototypes so that they could  bump them up against reality and discover for themselves the strengths and weaknesses of their particular approach.  When Build It From Scratch shared their prototype with the group whose beepers would have to go off in the middle of the night if something went wrong with the website  they heard loud and clear about the limitations of their particular design. As the need for a solution became more urgent and as the data  or the evidence  began to come in  it became pretty clear that the Big Table solution was the right one for the moment. So they selected that one. But to make sure that they did not lose the learning of the Build it From Scratch team  Bill asked two members of that team to join a new team that was emerging to work on the next generation system. This whole process took nearly two years  but I was told that they were all working at breakneck speed. Early in that process  one of the engineers had gone to Bill and said   We're all too busy for this inefficient system of running parallel experiments.  But as the process unfolded  he began to understand the wisdom of allowing talented people to play out their passions. He admitted   If you had forced us to all be on one team  we might have focused on proving who was right  and winning  and not on learning and discovering what was the best answer for Google.  Why is it that Pixar and Google are able to innovate time and again  It's because they've mastered the capabilities required for that. They know how to do collaborative problem solving  they know how to do discovery driven learning and they know how to do integrated decision making. Some of you may be sitting there and saying to yourselves right now   We don't know how to do those things in my organization. So why do they know how to do those things at Pixar  and why do they know how to do those things at Google   When many of the people that worked for Bill told us  in their opinion  that Bill was one of the finest leaders in Silicon Valley  we completely agreed  the man is a genius. Leadership is the secret sauce. But it's a different kind of leadership  not the kind many of us think about when we think about great leadership. One of the leaders I met with early on said to me   Linda  I don't read books on leadership. All they do is make me feel bad.   Laughter   In the first chapter they say I'm supposed to create a vision. But if I'm trying to do something that's truly new  I have no answers. I don't know what direction we're going in and I'm not even sure I know how to figure out how to get there.  For sure  there are times when visionary leadership is exactly what is needed. But if we want to build organizations that can innovate time and again  we must recast our understanding of what leadership is about. Leading innovation is about creating the space where people are willing and able to do the hard work of innovative problem solving. At this point  some of you may be wondering   What does that leadership really look like   At Pixar  they understand that innovation takes a village. The leaders focus on building a sense of community and building those three capabilities. How do they define leadership  They say leadership is about creating a world to which people want to belong. What kind of world do people want to belong in at Pixar  A world where you're living at the frontier. What do they focus their time on  Not on creating a vision. Instead they spend their time thinking about   How do we design a studio that has the sensibility of a public square so that people will interact  Let's put in a policy that anyone  no matter what their level or role  is allowed to give notes to the director about how they feel about a particular film. What can we do to make sure that all the disruptors  all the minority voices in this organization  speak up and are heard  And  finally  let's bestow credit in a very generous way.  I don't know if you've ever looked at the credits of a Pixar movie  but the babies born during a production are listed there. How did Bill think about what his role was  Bill said   I lead a volunteer organization. Talented people don't want to follow me anywhere. They want to cocreate with me the future. My job is to nurture the bottom up and not let it degenerate into chaos.  How did he see his role   I'm a role model  I'm a human glue  I'm a connector  I'm an aggregator of viewpoints. I'm never a dictator of viewpoints.  Advice about how you exercise the role  Hire people who argue with you. And  guess what  Sometimes it's best to be deliberately fuzzy and vague. Some of you may be wondering now  what are these people thinking  They're thinking   I'm not the visionary  I'm the social architect. I'm creating the space where people are willing and able to share and combine their talents and passions.  If some of you are worrying now that you don't work at a Pixar  or you don't work at a Google  I want to tell you there's still hope. We've studied many organizations that were really not organizations you'd think of as ones where a lot of innovation happens. We studied a general counsel in a pharmaceutical company who had to figure out how to get the outside lawyers     competitors  to collaborate and innovate. We studied the head of marketing at a German automaker where  fundamentally  they believed that it was the design engineers  not the marketeers  who were allowed to be innovative. We also studied Vineet Nayar at HCL Technologies  an Indian outsourcing company. When we met Vineet  his company was about  in his words  to become irrelevant. We watched as he turned that company into a global dynamo of I.T. innovation. At HCL technologies  like at many companies  the leaders had learned to see their role as setting direction and making sure that no one deviated from it. What he did is tell them it was time for them to think about rethinking what they were supposed to do. Because what was happening is that everybody was looking up and you weren't seeing the kind of bottom up innovation we saw at Pixar or Google. So they began to work on that. They stopped giving answers  they stopped trying to provide solutions. Instead  what they did is they began to see the people at the bottom of the pyramid  the young sparks  the people who were closest to the customers  as the source of innovation. They began to transfer the organization's growth to that level. In Vineet's language  this was about inverting the pyramid so that you could unleash the power of the many by loosening the stranglehold of the few  and increase the quality and the speed of innovation that was happening every day. For sure  Vineet and all the other leaders that we studied were in fact visionaries. For sure  they understood that that was not their role. So I don't think it is accidental that many of you did not recognize Ed. Because Ed  like Vineet  understands that our role as leaders is to set the stage  not perform on it. If we want to invent a better future  and I suspect that's why many of us are here  then we need to reimagine our task. Our task is to create the space where everybody's slices of genius can be unleashed and harnessed  and turned into works of collective genius. Thank you. I cannot forget them. Their names were Aslan  Alik  Andrei  Fernanda  Fred  Galina  Gunnhild  Hans  Ingeborg  Matti  Natalya  Nancy  Sheryl  Usman  Zarema  and the list is longer. For many  their existence  their humanity  has been reduced to statistics  coldly recorded as  security incidents.  For me  they were colleagues belonging to that community of humanitarian aid workers that tried to bring a bit of comfort to the victims of the wars in Chechnya in the '  s. They were nurses  logisticians  shelter experts  paralegals  interpreters. And for this service  they were murdered  their families torn apart  and their story largely forgotten. No one was ever sentenced for these crimes. I cannot forget them. They live in me somehow  their memories giving me meaning every day. But they are also haunting the dark street of my mind. As humanitarian aid workers  they made the choice to be at the side of the victim  to provide some assistance  some comfort  some protection  but when they needed protection themselves  it wasn't there. When you see the headlines of your newspaper these days with the war in Iraq or in Syria    aid worker abducted  hostage executed    but who were they  Why were they there  What motivated them  How did we become so indifferent to these crimes  This is why I am here today with you. We need to find better ways to remember them. We also need to explain the key values to which they dedicated their lives. We also need to demand justice. When in '   I was sent by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to the North Caucasus  I knew some of the risks. Five colleagues had been killed  three had been seriously injured  seven had already been taken hostage. So we were careful. We were using armored  vehicles  decoy cars  changing patterns of travel  changing homes  all sorts of security measures. Yet on a cold winter night of January '    it was my turn. When I entered my flat in Vladikavkaz with a guard  we were surrounded by armed men. They took the guard  they put him on the floor  they beat him up in front of me  tied him  dragged him away. I was handcuffed  blindfolded  and forced to kneel  as the silencer of a gun pressed against my neck. When it happens to you  there is no time for thinking  no time for praying. My brain went on automatic  rewinding quickly the life I'd just left behind. It took me long minutes to figure out that those masked men there were not there to kill me  but that someone  somewhere  had ordered my kidnapping. Then a process of dehumanization started that day. I was no more than just a commodity. I normally don't talk about this  but I'd like to share a bit with you some of those     days of captivity. I was kept in an underground cellar  total darkness  for    hours and    minutes every day  and then the guards  would come  normally two. They would bring a big piece of bread  a bowl of soup  and a candle. That candle would burn for    minutes     minutes of precious light  and then they would take it away  and I returned to darkness. I was chained by a metal cable to my bed. I could do only four small steps. I always dreamt of the fifth one. And no TV  no radio  no newspaper  no one to talk to. I had no towel  no soap  no toilet paper  just two metal buckets open  one for water  for one waste. Can you imagine that mock execution can be a pastime for guards when they are sadistic or when they are just bored or drunk  We are breaking my nerves very slowly. Isolation and darkness are particularly difficult to describe. How do you describe nothing  There are no words for the depths of loneliness I reached in that very thin border between sanity and madness. In the darkness  sometimes I played imaginary games of checkers. I would start with the black  play with the white  back to the black trying to trick the other side. I don't play checkers anymore. I was tormented by the thoughts of my family and my colleague  the guard  Edik. I didn't know what had happened to him. I was trying not to think  I tried to fill up my time by doing all sorts of physical exercise on the spot. I tried to pray  I tried all sorts of memorization games. But darkness also creates images and thoughts that are not normal. One part of your brain wants you to resist  to shout  to cry  and the other part of the brain orders you to shut up and just go through it. It's a constant internal debate  there is no one to arbitrate. Once a guard came to me  very aggressively  and he told me   Today you're going to kneel and beg for your food.  I wasn't in a good mood  so I insulted him. I insulted his mother  I insulted his ancestors. The consequence was moderate  he threw the food into my waste. The day after he came back with the same demand. He got the same answer  which had the same consequence. Four days later  the body was full of pain. I didn't know hunger hurt so much when you have so little. So when the guards came down  I knelt. I begged for my food. Submission was the only way for me to make it to another candle. After my kidnapping  I was transferred from North Ossetia to Chechnya  three days of slow travel in the trunks of different cars  and upon arrival  I was interrogated for    days by a guy called Ruslan. The routine was always the same  a bit more light     minutes. He would come down to the cellar  he would ask the guards to tie me on the chair  and he would turn on the music loud. And then he would yell questions. He would scream. He would beat me. I'll spare you the details. There are many questions I could not understand  and there are some questions I did not want to understand. The length of the interrogation was the duration of the tape     songs     minutes. I would always long for the last song. On one day  one night in that cellar  I don't know what it was  I heard a child crying above my head  a boy  maybe two or three years old. Footsteps  confusion  people running. So when Ruslan came the day after  before he put the first question to me  I asked him   How is your son today  Is he feeling better   Ruslan was taken by surprise. He was furious that the guards may have leaked some details about his private life. I kept talking about NGOs supplying medicines to local clinics that may help his son to get better. And we talked about education  we talked about families. He talked to me about his children. I talked to him about my daughters. And then he'd talk about guns  about cars  about women  and I had to talk about guns  about cars  about women. And we talked until the last song on the tape. Ruslan was the most brutal man I ever met. He did not touch me anymore. He did not ask any other questions. I was no longer just a commodity. Two days after  I was transferred to another place. There  a guard came to me  very close    it was quite unusual    and he said with a very soft voice  he said   I'd like to thank you for the assistance your organization provided my family when we were displaced in nearby Dagestan.  What could I possibly reply  It was so painful. It was like a blade in the belly. It took me weeks of internal thinking to try to reconcile the good reasons we had to assist that family and the soldier of fortune he became. He was young  he was shy. I never saw his face. He probably meant well. But in those    seconds  he made me question everything we did  all the sacrifices. He made me think also how they see us. Until then  I had assumed that they know why we are there and what we are doing. One cannot assume this. Well  explaining why we do this is not that easy  even to our closest relatives. We are not perfect  we are not superior  we are not the world's fire brigade  we are not superheroes  we don't stop wars  we know that humanitarian response is not a substitute for political solution. Yet we do this because one life matters. Sometimes that's the only difference you make    one individual  one family  a small group of individuals    and it matters. When you have a tsunami  an earthquake or a typhoon  you see teams of rescuers coming from all over the world  searching for survivors for weeks. Why  Nobody questions this. Every life matters  or every life should matter. This is the same for us when we help refugees  people displaced within their country by conflict  or stateless persons  I know many people  when they are confronted by overwhelming suffering  they feel powerless and they stop there. It's a pity  because there are so many ways people can help. We don't stop with that feeling. We try to do whatever we can to provide some assistance  some protection  some comfort. We have to. We can't do otherwise. It's what makes us feel  I don't know  simply human. That's a picture of me the day of my release. Months after my release  I met the then French prime minister. The second thing he told me   You were totally irresponsible to go to the North Caucasus. You don't know how many problems you've created for us.  It was a short meeting. I think helping people in danger is responsible. In that war  that nobody seriously wanted to stop  and we have many of these today  bringing some assistance to people in need and a bit of protection was not just an act of humanity  it was making a real difference for the people. Why could he not understand this  We have a responsibility to try. You've heard about that concept  Responsibility to Protect. Outcomes may depend on various parameters. We may even fail  but there is worse than failing    it's not even trying when we can. Well  if you are met this way  if you sign up for this sort of job  your life is going to be full of joy and sadness  because there are a lot of people we cannot help  a lot of people we cannot protect  a lot of people we did not save. I call them my ghost  and by having witnessed their suffering from close  you take a bit  of that suffering on yourself. Many young humanitarian workers go through their first experience with a lot of bitterness. They are thrown into situations where they are witness  but they are powerless to bring any change. They have to learn to accept it and gradually turn this into positive energy. It's difficult. Many don't succeed  but for those who do  there is no other job like this. You can see the difference you make every day. Humanitarian aid workers know the risk they are taking in conflict areas or  in post conflict environments  yet our life  our job  is becoming  increasingly life threatening  and the sanctity of our life is fading. Do you know that since the millennium  the number of attacks on humanitarian  aid workers has tripled       broke new records      colleagues killed      seriously wounded      abducted. So many broken lives. Until the beginning of the civil war in Somalia in the late '  s  humanitarian aid workers were sometimes victims of what we call collateral damages  but by and large we were not the target of these attacks. This has changed. Look at this picture. Baghdad  August          colleagues were killed. Gone are the days when a U.N. blue flag or a Red Cross would automatically protect us. Criminal groups and some political groups have cross fertilized over the last    years  and they've created these sort of hybrids with whom we have no way of communicating. Humanitarian principles are tested  questioned  and often ignored  but perhaps more importantly  we have abandoned the search for justice. There seems to be no consequence whatsoever for attacks against humanitarian aid workers. After my release  I was told not to seek any form of justice. It won't do you any good  that's what I was told. Plus  you're going to put in danger the life of other colleagues. It took me years to see the sentencing of three people associated  with my kidnapping  but this was the exception. There was no justice for any  of the humanitarian aid workers killed or abducted in Chechnya between '   and '    and it's the same all over the world. This is unacceptable. This is inexcusable. Attacks on humanitarian aid workers are war crimes in international law. Those crimes should not go unpunished. We must end this cycle of impunity. We must consider that those attacks against humanitarian aid workers are attacks against humanity itself. That makes me furious. I know I'm very lucky compared to the refugees I work for. I don't know what it is to have seen my whole town destroyed. I don't know what it is to have seen my relatives shot in front of me. I don't know what it is to lose the protection of my country. I also know that I'm very lucky compared to other hostages. Four days before my eventful release  four hostages were beheaded a few miles away from where I was kept in captivity. Why them  Why am I here today  No easy answer. I was received with a lot of support that I got from my relatives  from colleagues  from friends  from people I didn't know. They have helped me over the years to come out of the darkness. Not everyone was treated with the same attention. How many of my colleagues  after a traumatic incident  took their own life  I can count nine that I knew personally. How many of my colleagues went through a difficult divorce after a traumatic experience because they could not explain anything anymore to their spouse  I've lost that count. There is a price for this type of life. In Russia  all war monuments have this beautiful inscription at the top. It says   In Russian   No one is forgotten  nothing is forgotten.  I do not forget my lost colleagues. I cannot forget anything. I call on you to remember their dedication and demand that humanitarian aid workers around the world be better protected. We should not let that light of hope they have brought to be switched off. After my ordeal  a lot of colleagues asked me   But why do you continue  Why do you do this sort of job  Why do you have to go back to it   My answer was very simple  If I had quit  that would have meant my kidnapper had won. They would have taken my soul and my humanity. Thank you. How many people here have heard of PMS  Everybody  right  Everyone knows that women go a little crazy right before they get their period  that the menstrual cycle throws them onto an inevitable hormonal roller coaster of irrationality and irritability. There's a general assumption that fluctuations in reproductive hormones cause extreme emotions and that the great majority of women are affected by this. Well  I am here to tell you that scientific evidence says neither of those assumptions is true. I'm here to give you  the good news about PMS. But first  let's take a look at how firmly the idea of PMS is entrenched in American culture. If you examine newspaper or magazine articles  you'll see how widely assumed it is that everyone gets PMS. In an article in the magazine Redbook titled  You  PMS Free   readers were informed that between     to    percent of women suffer from PMS. L.A. Muscle magazine warned its readers that    to    percent of women suffer from PMS  and that it plays a major role in women's mental and physical health  and a couple of years ago  even the Wall Street Journal ran an article on calcium as a treatment for PMS  asking its female readers   Do you turn into a witch every month   From all these articles  you would think there must be a mountain of research verifying the widespread nature of PMS. However  after five decades of research  there's no strong consensus on the definition  the cause  the treatment  or even  the existence of PMS. As most commonly defined by psychologists  PMS involves negative behavioral  cognitive and physical symptoms from the time of ovulation to menstruation. But here's where it gets tricky. Over     different symptoms have been used to diagnose PMS  and here are just a few of those. Now  I want to be clear here. I'm not saying women don't get some of these symptoms. What I'm saying is that getting some of these symptoms doesn't amount to a mental disorder  and when psychologists come up with a disorder that's so vaguely defined  the label eventually becomes meaningless. With a list of symptoms this long and wide  I could have PMS  you could have PMS  the guy in the third row here could have PMS  my dog could have PMS.  Laughter  Some researchers said you had to have five symptoms. Some said three. Other researchers said that symptoms were only meaningful if they were highly disturbing to you  but others said minor symptoms were just as important. For many years  because there was no standardization in the definition of PMS  when psychologists tried to report prevalence rates  their estimates ranged from five percent of women to    percent of women  so at the same time almost no one and almost everyone had PMS. Overall  the weaknesses in the methods of research on PMS have been considerable. First  many studies asked women to report their symptoms retrospectively  looking to the past and relying on memory  which is known to inflate reporting of PMS compared to what's called prospective reporting  which involves keeping a daily log of symptoms for at least two months in a row. Many studies also exclusively focused on white  middle class women  which makes it problematic to apply study findings to all women. We know there's a strong cultural component to the belief in PMS because it's nearly unheard of outside of Western nations. Third  many studies failed to use control groups. If we want to understand the specific characteristics of women who have PMS  we need to be able to compare them to women who don't have PMS. And finally  many different types of questionnaires were used to diagnose PMS  focusing on different symptoms  symptom duration and severity. To do reliable research on any condition  scientists must agree on the specific characteristics that make up that condition so they're all talking about the same thing  and with PMS  this has not been the case. However  in       the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders  known as the DSM  thankfully    it's also the manual for mental health professionals    they redefined PMS as PMDD  Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder. And dysphoria refers to a feeling of agitation or unease. And according to these new DSM guidelines  in most menstrual cycles in the last year  at least five of    possible symptoms must appear in the week before menstruation starts  the symptoms must improve once menstruation has begun  and the symptoms must be absent the week after menstruation has ended. One of these symptoms must come from this list of four  marked mood swings  irritability  anxiety  or depression. The other symptoms could come from the first slide or from those on the second slide  including symptoms like feeling out of control and changes in sleep or appetite. The DSM also required now that the symptoms should be associated with clinically significant distress    there should be some kind of disturbance in work or school or social relationships    and that symptoms and symptom severity should now be documented by keeping a daily log for at least two cycles in a row. And finally  the DSM required that the emotional disturbance should be more than simply an exacerbation of an already existing disorder. So scientifically speaking  this is an improvement. We now have a limited number of symptoms  and a high impact on functioning that's required  and the reporting and timing of symptoms have both become very specific. Well  using this criteria and looking at most recent studies  we see that on average  three to eight percent of women suffer from PMDD. Not all women  not most women  not the majority of women  not even a lot of women  three to eight percent. For everyone else  variables like stressful events or happy occasions or even day of the week are more powerful predictors of mood than time of the month  and this is the information the scientific community has had since the     s. In       my colleagues and I published an article describing the PMS and PMDD research  and several similar articles have appeared in psychology journals. The questions is  why hasn't this information trickled down to the public  Why do these myths persist  Well  certainly the onslaught of messages that women receive from books  TV  movies  the Internet  that everyone gets PMS go a long way in convincing them it must be true. Research tells us that the more a woman believes that everyone gets PMS  the more likely she is to erroneously report that she has it. Let me tell you what I mean by  erroneously.  You might ask her   Do you have PMS   and she says yes  but then  when you have her  keep a daily log of psychological symptoms for two months  no correlation is found between her symptoms and time of the month. Another reason for the persistence of the PMS myth has to do with the narrow boundaries of the feminine role. Feminist psychologists like Joan Chrisler have suggested that taking on the label of PMS allows women to express emotions that would otherwise be considered unladylike. The near universal definition of a good woman is one who is happy  loving  caring for others  and taking great satisfaction from that role. Well  PMS has become a permission slip to be angry  complain  be irritated  without losing the title of good woman. We know that the variables in a woman's environment are much more likely to cause her to be angry than her hormones  but when she attributes anger to hormones  she's absolved of responsibility or criticism.  Oh  that's not who she is. It's out of her control.  And while this can be a useful tool  it serves to invalidate women's emotions. When people respond to a woman's anger with the thought   Oh  it's just that time of the month   her ability to be taken seriously or effect change is severely limited. So who else benefits from the myth of PMS  Well  I can tell you that treating PMS has become a profitable   thriving industry. Amazon.com currently offers over       books on PMS treatment. A quick Google search will bring up a cornucopia of clinics  workshops and seminars. Reputable Internet sources of medical information like WebMD or the Mayo Clinic list PMS as a known disorder. It's not a known disorder  but they list it. And they also list the medications that physicians have prescribed to treat it  like anti depressants or hormones. Interestingly  though  both websites say that the success of medication in treating PMS symptoms vary from woman to woman. Well  that doesn't make sense. If you've got a distinct disorder with a distinct cause  which PMS is supposed to be  then the treatment should bring improvement for a great number of women. This has not been the case with these treatments  and FDA regulations say that for a drug to be deemed effective  a large portion of the target population should see clinically significant improvement. So we have not had that at all with these so called treatments. However  the financial gain of perpetuating the myth that PMS is a common mental disorder and is treatable is quite substantial. When women are prescribed drugs like anti depressants or hormones  medical protocol requires that they have physician follow up every three months. That's a lot of doctor visits. Pharmaceutical companies reap untold profits when women are convinced they should take a prescribed medication for all of their child bearing lives. Over the counter drugs like Midol even claim to treat PMS symptoms like tension and irritability  even though they only contain a diuretic  a pain reliever and caffeine. Now  far be it from me to argue with the magical powers of caffeine  but I don't think reducing tension is one of them. Since       Midol has marketed a Teen Midol to adolescents. They are aiming at young girls early  to convince them that everyone gets PMS and that it will make you a monster  but wait  there's something you can do about it  Take Midol and you will be a human being again. In       Midol took in    million dollars in sales revenue. So while perpetuating the myth of PMS has been lucrative for some  it comes with some serious adverse consequences for women. First  it contributes to the medicalization of women's reproductive health. The medical field has a long history of conceptualizing women's reproductive processes as illnesses that require treatment  and this has come at many costs  including excessive Cesarean deliveries  hysterectomies and prescribed hormone treatments that have harmed rather than enhanced women's health. Second  the PMS myth also contributes to the stereotype of women as irrational and overemotional. When the menstrual cycle is described as a hormonal roller coaster that turns women into angry beasts  it becomes easy to question  the competence of all women. Women have made tremendous strides in the workforce  but still there's a minuscule number of women at the highest echelons of fields like government or business  and when we think about who makes for a good CEO or senator  someone who has qualities like  rationality  steadiness  competence come to mind  and in our culture  that sounds more like a man than a woman  and the PMS myth contributes to that. Psychologists know that the moods of men and women are more similar than different. One study followed men and women for four to six months and found that the number of mood swings they experienced and the severity of those mood swings were no different. And finally  the PMS myth keeps women from dealing with the actual issues causing them emotional upset. Individual issues like quality of relationship or work conditions or societal issues like racism or sexism or the daily grind of poverty are all strongly related to daily mood. Sweeping emotions under the rug of PMS keeps women from understanding the source of their negative emotions  but it also takes away the opportunity to take any action to change them. So the good news about PMS is that while some women get some symptoms because of the menstrual cycle  the great majority don't get a mental disorder. They go to work or school  take care of their families  and function at a normal level. We know the emotions and moods of men and women are more similar than different  so let's walk away from the tired old PMS myth of women as witches and embrace the reality of high emotional and professional functioning the great majority of women live every day. Thank you. We are built out of very small stuff  and we are embedded in a very large cosmos  and the fact is that we are not very good at understanding reality at either of those scales  and that's because our brains haven't evolved to understand  the world at that scale. Instead  we're trapped on this very thin slice of perception right in the middle. But it gets strange  because even at  that slice of reality that we call home  we're not seeing most of the action that's going on. So take the colors of our world. This is light waves  electromagnetic radiation that bounces off objects and it hits specialized receptors in the back of our eyes. But we're not seeing all the waves out there. In fact  what we see is less than a    trillionth of what's out there. So you have radio waves and microwaves and X rays and gamma rays passing through your body right now and you're completely unaware of it  because you don't come with the proper biological receptors for picking it up. There are thousands of cell phone conversations passing through you right now  and you're utterly blind to it. Now  it's not that these things are inherently unseeable. Snakes include some infrared in their reality  and honeybees include ultraviolet in their view of the world  and of course we build machines in the dashboards of our cars to pick up on signals in the radio frequency range  and we built machines in hospitals to pick up on the X ray range. But you can't sense any of those by yourself  at least not yet  because you don't come equipped with the proper sensors. Now  what this means is that our experience of reality is constrained by our biology  and that goes against the common sense notion that our eyes and our ears and our fingertips are just picking up the objective reality that's out there. Instead  our brains are sampling just a little bit of the world. Now  across the animal kingdom  different animals pick up on different parts of reality. So in the blind and deaf world of the tick  the important signals are temperature and butyric acid  in the world of the black ghost knifefish  its sensory world is lavishly colored by electrical fields  and for the echolocating bat  its reality is constructed out of air compression waves. That's the slice of their ecosystem that they can pick up on  and we have a word for this in science. It's called the umwelt  which is the German word for the surrounding world. Now  presumably  every animal assumes that its umwelt is the entire objective reality out there  because why would you ever stop to imagine that there's something beyond what we can sense. Instead  what we all do is we accept reality as it's presented to us. Let's do a consciousness raiser on this. Imagine that you are a bloodhound dog. Your whole world is about smelling. You've got a long snout that has     million scent receptors in it  and you have wet nostrils that attract and trap scent molecules  and your nostrils even have slits so you can take big nosefuls of air. Everything is about smell for you. So one day  you stop in your tracks with a revelation. You look at your human owner and you think   What is it like to have the pitiful  impoverished nose of a human  What is it like when you take a feeble little noseful of air  How can you not know that there's a cat     yards away  or that your neighbor was on this very spot six hours ago   So because we're humans  we've never experienced that world of smell  so we don't miss it  because we are firmly settled into our umwelt. But the question is  do we have to be stuck there  So as a neuroscientist  I'm interested in the way that technology might expand our umwelt  and how that's going to change the experience of being human. So we already know that we can marry our technology to our biology  because there are hundreds of thousands of people walking around with artificial hearing and artificial vision. So the way this works is  you take a microphone and you digitize the signal  and you put an electrode strip directly into the inner ear. Or  with the retinal implant  you take a camera and you digitize the signal  and then you plug an electrode grid directly into the optic nerve. And as recently as    years ago  there were a lot of scientists who thought these technologies wouldn't work. Why  It's because these technologies speak the language of Silicon Valley  and it's not exactly the same dialect as our natural biological sense organs. But the fact is that it works  the brain figures out how to use the signals just fine. Now  how do we understand that  Well  here's the big secret  Your brain is not hearing or seeing any of this. Your brain is locked in a vault of silence and darkness inside your skull. All it ever sees are electrochemical signals that come in along different data cables  and this is all it has to work with  and nothing more. Now  amazingly  the brain is really good at taking in these signals and extracting patterns and assigning meaning  so that it takes this inner cosmos and puts together a story of this  your subjective world. But here's the key point  Your brain doesn't know  and it doesn't care  where it gets the data from. Whatever information comes in  it just figures out what to do with it. And this is a very efficient kind of machine. It's essentially a general purpose computing device  and it just takes in everything and figures out what it's going to do with it  and that  I think  frees up Mother Nature to tinker around with different sorts of input channels. So I call this the P.H.  model of evolution  and I don't want to get too technical here  but P.H. stands for Potato Head  and I use this name to emphasize that all these sensors that we know and love  like our eyes and our ears and our fingertips  these are merely peripheral plug and play devices  You stick them in  and you're good to go. The brain figures out what to do with the data that comes in. And when you look across the animal kingdom  you find lots of peripheral devices. So snakes have heat pits with which to detect infrared  and the ghost knifefish has electroreceptors  and the star nosed mole has this appendage with    fingers on it with which it feels around and constructs a  D model of the world  and many birds have magnetite so they can orient to the magnetic field of the planet. So what this means is that nature doesn't have to continually redesign the brain. Instead  with the principles of brain operation established  all nature has to worry about is designing new peripherals. Okay. So what this means is this  The lesson that surfaces is that there's nothing really special or fundamental about the biology that we come to the table with. It's just what we have inherited from a complex road of evolution. But it's not what we have to stick with  and our best proof of principle of this comes from what's called sensory substitution. And that refers to feeding information into the brain via unusual sensory channels  and the brain just figures out what to do with it. Now  that might sound speculative  but the first paper demonstrating this was published in the journal Nature in     . So a scientist named Paul Bach y Rita put blind people in a modified dental chair  and he set up a video feed  and he put something in front of the camera  and then you would feel that poked into your back with a grid of solenoids. So if you wiggle a coffee cup in front of the camera  you're feeling that in your back  and amazingly  blind people got pretty good at being able to determine what was in front of the camera just by feeling it in the small of their back. Now  there have been many modern incarnations of this. The sonic glasses take a video feed right in front of you and turn that into a sonic landscape  so as things move around  and get closer and farther  it sounds like  Bzz  bzz  bzz.  It sounds like a cacophony  but after several weeks  blind people start getting pretty good at understanding what's in front of them just based on what they're hearing. And it doesn't have to be through the ears  this system uses an electrotactile grid on the forehead  so whatever's in front of the video feed  you're feeling it on your forehead. Why the forehead  Because you're not using it for much else. The most modern incarnation is called the brainport  and this is a little electrogrid that sits on your tongue  and the video feed gets turned into these little electrotactile signals  and blind people get so good at using this that they can throw a ball into a basket  or they can navigate complex obstacle courses. They can come to see through their tongue. Now  that sounds completely insane  right  But remember  all vision ever is is electrochemical signals coursing around in your brain. Your brain doesn't know where the signals come from. It just figures out what to do with them. So my interest in my lab is sensory substitution for the deaf  and this is a project I've undertaken with a graduate student in my lab  Scott Novich  who is spearheading this for his thesis. And here is what we wanted to do  we wanted to make it so that sound from the world gets converted in some way so that a deaf person can understand what is being said. And we wanted to do this  given the power and ubiquity of portable computing  we wanted to make sure that this would run on cell phones and tablets  and also we wanted to make this a wearable  something that you could wear under your clothing. So here's the concept. So as I'm speaking  my sound is getting captured by the tablet  and then it's getting mapped onto a vest that's covered in vibratory motors  just like the motors in your cell phone. So as I'm speaking  the sound is getting translated to a pattern of vibration on the vest. Now  this is not just conceptual  this tablet is transmitting Bluetooth  and I'm wearing the vest right now. So as I'm speaking     Applause     the sound is getting translated into dynamic patterns of vibration. I'm feeling the sonic world around me. So  we've been testing this with deaf people now  and it turns out that after just a little bit of time  people can start feeling  they can start understanding the language of the vest. So this is Jonathan. He's    years old. He has a master's degree. He was born profoundly deaf  which means that there's a part of his umwelt that's unavailable to him. So we had Jonathan train with the vest for four days  two hours a day  and here he is on the fifth day. Scott Novich  You. David Eagleman  So Scott says a word  Jonathan feels it on the vest  and he writes it on the board. SN  Where. Where. DE  Jonathan is able to translate this complicated pattern of vibrations into an understanding of what's being said. SN  Touch. Touch. DE  Now  he's not doing this    Jonathan is not doing this consciously  because the patterns are too complicated  but his brain is starting to unlock the pattern that allows it to figure out what the data mean  and our expectation is that  after wearing this for about three months  he will have a direct perceptual experience of hearing in the same way that when a blind person passes a finger over braille  the meaning comes directly off the page without any conscious intervention at all. Now  this technology has the potential to be a game changer  because the only other solution for deafness is a cochlear implant  and that requires an invasive surgery. And this can be built for    times cheaper than a cochlear implant  which opens up this technology globally  even for the poorest countries. Now  we've been very encouraged by our results with sensory substitution  but what we've been thinking a lot about is sensory addition. How could we use a technology like this to add a completely new kind of sense  to expand the human umvelt  For example  could we feed real time data from the Internet directly into somebody's brain  and can they develop a direct perceptual experience  So here's an experiment we're doing in the lab. A subject is feeling a real time streaming feed from the Net of data for five seconds. Then  two buttons appear  and he has to make a choice. He doesn't know what's going on. He makes a choice  and he gets feedback after one second. Now  here's the thing  The subject has no idea what all the patterns mean  but we're seeing if he gets better at figuring out which button to press. He doesn't know that what we're feeding is real time data from the stock market  and he's making buy and sell decisions. And the feedback is telling him whether he did the right thing or not. And what we're seeing is  can we expand the human umvelt so that he comes to have  after several weeks  a direct perceptual experience of the economic movements of the planet. So we'll report on that later to see how well this goes. Here's another thing we're doing  During the talks this morning  we've been automatically scraping Twitter for the TED     hashtag  and we've been doing an automated sentiment analysis  which means  are people using positive words or negative words or neutral  And while this has been going on  I have been feeling this  and so I am plugged in to the aggregate emotion of thousands of people in real time  and that's a new kind of human experience  because now I can know how everyone's doing and how much you're loving this. It's a bigger experience than a human can normally have. We're also expanding the umvelt of pilots. So in this case  the vest is streaming nine different measures from this quadcopter  so pitch and yaw and roll and orientation and heading  and that improves this pilot's ability to fly it. It's essentially like he's extending his skin up there  far away. And that's just the beginning. What we're envisioning is taking a modern cockpit full of gauges and instead of trying to read the whole thing  you feel it. We live in a world of information now  and there is a difference between accessing big data and experiencing it. So I think there's really no end to the possibilities on the horizon for human expansion. Just imagine an astronaut being able to feel the overall health of the International Space Station  or  for that matter  having you feel the invisible states of your own health  like your blood sugar and the state of your microbiome  or having     degree vision or seeing in infrared or ultraviolet. So the key is this  As we move into the future  we're going to increasingly be able to choose our own peripheral devices. We no longer have to wait for Mother Nature's sensory gifts on her timescales  but instead  like any good parent  she's given us the tools that we need to go out and define our own trajectory. So the question now is  how do you want to go out and experience your universe  Thank you. Chris Anderson  Can you feel it  DE  Yeah. Actually  this was the first time I felt applause on the vest. It's nice. It's like a massage.  Laughter  CA  Twitter's going crazy. Twitter's going mad. So that stock market experiment. This could be the first experiment that secures its funding forevermore  right  if successful  DE  Well  that's right  I wouldn't have to write to NIH anymore. CA  Well look  just to be skeptical for a minute  I mean  this is amazing  but isn't most of the evidence so far that sensory substitution works  not necessarily  that sensory addition works  I mean  isn't it possible that the blind person can see through their tongue because the visual cortex is still there  ready to process  and that that is needed as part of it  DE  That's a great question. We actually have no idea what the theoretical limits are of what kind of data the brain can take in. The general story  though  is that it's extraordinarily flexible. So when a person goes blind  what we used to call their visual cortex gets taken over by other things  by touch  by hearing  by vocabulary. So what that tells us is that the cortex is kind of a one trick pony. It just runs certain kinds of computations on things. And when we look around at things like braille  for example  people are getting information through bumps on their fingers. So I don't think we have any reason to think there's a theoretical limit that we know the edge of. CA  If this checks out  you're going to be deluged. There are so many possible applications for this. Are you ready for this  What are you most excited about  the direction it might go  DE  I mean  I think there's a lot of applications here. In terms of beyond sensory substitution  the things I started mentioning about astronauts on the space station  they spend a lot of their time monitoring things  and they could instead just get what's going on  because what this is really good for is multidimensional data. The key is this  Our visual systems are good at detecting blobs and edges  but they're really bad at what our world has become  which is screens with lots and lots of data. We have to crawl that with our attentional systems. So this is a way of just feeling the state of something  just like the way you know the state of your body as you're standing around. So I think heavy machinery  safety  feeling the state of a factory  of your equipment  that's one place it'll go right away. CA  David Eagleman  that was one mind blowing talk. Thank you very much. DE  Thank you  Chris.  Applause  I'm thrilled to be here tonight to share with you something we've been working on for over two years  and it's in the area of additive manufacturing  also known as  D printing. You see this object here. It looks fairly simple  but it's quite complex at the same time. It's a set of concentric geodesic structures with linkages between each one. In its context  it is not manufacturable by traditional manufacturing techniques. It has a symmetry such that you can't injection mold it. You can't even manufacture it through milling. This is a job for a  D printer  but most  D printers would take between three and    hours to fabricate it  and we're going to take the risk tonight to try to fabricate it onstage during this    minute talk. Wish us luck. Now   D printing is actually a misnomer. It's actually  D printing over and over again  and it in fact uses the technologies associated with  D printing. Think about inkjet printing where you lay down ink on a page to make letters  and then do that over and over again to build up a three dimensional object. In microelectronics  they use something called lithography to do the same sort of thing  to make the transistors and integrated circuits and build up a structure several times. These are all  D printing technologies. Now  I'm a chemist  a material scientist too  and my co inventors are also material scientists  one a chemist  one a physicist  and we began to be interested in  D printing. And very often  as you know  new ideas are often simple connections between people with different experiences in different communities  and that's our story. Now  we were inspired by the  Terminator    scene for T       and we thought  why couldn't a  D printer operate in this fashion  where you have an object arise out of a puddle in essentially real time with essentially no waste to make a great object  Okay  just like the movies. And could we be inspired by Hollywood and come up with ways to actually try to get this to work  And that was our challenge. And our approach would be  if we could do this  then we could fundamentally address the three issues holding back  D printing from being a manufacturing process. One   D printing takes forever. There are mushrooms that grow faster than  D printed parts.  Laughter  The layer by layer process leads to defects in mechanical properties  and if we could grow continuously  we could eliminate those defects. And in fact  if we could grow really fast  we could also start using materials that are self curing  and we could have amazing properties. So if we could pull this off  imitate Hollywood  we could in fact address  D manufacturing. Our approach is to use some standard knowledge in polymer chemistry to harness light and oxygen to grow parts continuously. Light and oxygen work in different ways. Light can take a resin and convert it to a solid  can convert a liquid to a solid. Oxygen inhibits that process. So light and oxygen are polar opposites from one another from a chemical point of view  and if we can control spatially the light and oxygen  we could control this process. And we refer to this as CLIP.  Continuous Liquid Interface Production.  It has three functional components. One  it has a reservoir that holds the puddle  just like the T     . At the bottom of the reservoir is a special window. I'll come back to that. In addition  it has a stage that will lower into the puddle and pull the object out of the liquid. The third component is a digital light projection system underneath the reservoir  illuminating with light in the ultraviolet region. Now  the key is that this window in the bottom of this reservoir  it's a composite  it's a very special window. It's not only transparent to light but it's permeable to oxygen. It's got characteristics like a contact lens. So we can see how the process works. You can start to see that as you lower a stage in there  in a traditional process  with an oxygen impermeable window  you make a two dimensional pattern and you end up gluing that onto the window with a traditional window  and so in order to introduce the next layer  you have to separate it  introduce new resin  reposition it  and do this process over and over again. But with our very special window  what we're able to do is  with oxygen coming through the bottom as light hits it  that oxygen inhibits the reaction  and we form a dead zone. This dead zone is on the order of tens of microns thick  so that's two or three diameters of a red blood cell  right at the window interface that remains a liquid  and we pull this object up  and as we talked about in a Science paper  as we change the oxygen content  we can change the dead zone thickness. And so we have a number of key variables that we control  oxygen content  the light  the light intensity  the dose to cure  the viscosity  the geometry  and we use very sophisticated software to control this process. The result is pretty staggering. It's    to     times faster than traditional  D printers  which is game changing. In addition  as our ability to deliver liquid to that interface  we can go       times faster I believe  and that in fact opens up the opportunity for generating a lot of heat  and as a chemical engineer  I get very excited at heat transfer and the idea that we might one day have water cooled  D printers  because they're going so fast. In addition  because we're growing things  we eliminate the layers  and the parts are monolithic. You don't see the surface structure. You have molecularly smooth surfaces. And the mechanical properties of most parts made in a  D printer are notorious for having properties that depend on the orientation with which how you printed it  because of the layer like structure. But when you grow objects like this  the properties are invariant with the print direction. These look like injection molded parts  which is very different than traditional  D manufacturing. In addition  we're able to throw the entire polymer chemistry textbook at this  and we're able to design chemistries that can give rise to the properties you really want in a  D printed object. There it is. That's great. You always take the risk that something like this won't work onstage  right  But we can have materials with great mechanical properties. For the first time  we can have elastomers that are high elasticity or high dampening. Think about vibration control or great sneakers  for example. We can make materials that have incredible strength  high strength to weight ratio  really strong materials  really great elastomers  so throw that in the audience there. So great material properties. And so the opportunity now  if you actually make a part that has the properties to be a final part  and you do it in game changing speeds  you can actually transform manufacturing. Right now  in manufacturing  what happens is  the so called digital thread in digital manufacturing. We go from a CAD drawing  a design  to a prototype to manufacturing. Often  the digital thread is broken right at prototype  because you can't go all the way to manufacturing because most parts don't have the properties to be a final part. We now can connect the digital thread all the way from design to prototyping to manufacturing  and that opportunity really opens up all sorts of things  from better fuel efficient cars dealing with great lattice properties with high strength to weight ratio  new turbine blades  all sorts of wonderful things. Think about if you need a stent in an emergency situation  instead of the doctor pulling off a stent out of the shelf that was just standard sizes  having a stent that's designed for you  for your own anatomy with your own tributaries  printed in an emergency situation in real time out of the properties such that the stent could go away after    months  really game changing. Or digital dentistry  and making these kinds of structures even while you're in the dentist chair. And look at the structures that my students are making at the University of North Carolina. These are amazing microscale structures. You know  the world is really good at nano fabrication. Moore's Law has driven things from    microns and below. We're really good at that  but it's actually very hard to make things from    microns to       microns  the mesoscale. And subtractive techniques from the silicon industry can't do that very well. They can't etch wafers that well. But this process is so gentle  we can grow these objects up from the bottom using additive manufacturing and make amazing things in tens of seconds  opening up new sensor technologies  new drug delivery techniques  new lab on a chip applications  really game changing stuff. So the opportunity of making a part in real time that has the properties to be a final part really opens up  D manufacturing  and for us  this is very exciting  because this really is owning the intersection between hardware  software and molecular science  and I can't wait to see what designers and engineers around the world are going to be able to do with this great tool. Thanks for listening. You're looking at a woman who was publicly silent for a decade. Obviously  that's changed  but only recently. It was several months ago that I gave my very first major public talk at the Forbes    Under    summit        brilliant people  all under the age of   . That meant that in       the oldest among the group were only     and the youngest  just four. I joked with them that some might only have heard of me from rap songs. Yes  I'm in rap songs. Almost    rap songs.  Laughter  But the night of my speech  a surprising thing happened. At the age of     I was hit on by a    year old guy. I know  right  He was charming and I was flattered  and I declined. You know what his unsuccessful pickup line was  He could make me feel    again. I realized later that night  I'm probably the only person over    who does not want to be    again. At the age of     I fell in love with my boss  and at the age of     I learned the devastating consequences. Can I see a show of hands of anyone here who didn't make a mistake or do something they regretted at     Yep. That's what I thought. So like me  at     a few of you may have also taken wrong turns and fallen in love with the wrong person  maybe even your boss. Unlike me  though  your boss probably wasn't the president of the United States of America. Of course  life is full of surprises. Not a day goes by that I'm not reminded of my mistake  and I regret that mistake deeply. In       after having been swept up into an improbable romance  I was then swept up into the eye of a political  legal and media maelstrom like we had never seen before. Remember  just a few years earlier  news was consumed from just three places  reading a newspaper or magazine  listening to the radio  or watching television. That was it. But that wasn't my fate. Instead  this scandal was brought to you by the digital revolution. That meant we could access all the information we wanted  when we wanted it  anytime  anywhere  and when the story broke in January       it broke online. It was the first time the traditional news was usurped by the Internet for a major news story  a click that reverberated around the world. What that meant for me personally was that overnight I went from being a completely private figure to a publicly humiliated one worldwide. I was patient zero of losing a personal reputation on a global scale almost instantaneously. This rush to judgment  enabled by technology  led to mobs of virtual stone throwers. Granted  it was before social media  but people could still comment online  email stories  and  of course  email cruel jokes. News sources plastered photos of me all over to sell newspapers  banner ads online  and to keep people tuned to the TV. Do you recall a particular image of me  say  wearing a beret  Now  I admit I made mistakes  especially wearing that beret. But the attention and judgment that I received  not the story  but that I personally received  was unprecedented. I was branded as a tramp  tart  slut  whore  bimbo  and  of course  that woman. I was seen by many but actually known by few. And I get it  it was easy to forget that that woman was dimensional  had a soul  and was once unbroken. When this happened to me    years ago  there was no name for it. Now we call it cyberbullying and online harassment. Today  I want to share some of my experience with you  talk about how that experience has helped shape my cultural observations  and how I hope my past experience can lead to a change that results in less suffering for others. In       I lost my reputation and my dignity. I lost almost everything  and I almost lost my life. Let me paint a picture for you. It is September of     . I'm sitting in a windowless office room inside the Office of the Independent Counsel underneath humming fluorescent lights. I'm listening to the sound of my voice  my voice on surreptitiously taped phone calls that a supposed friend had made the year before. I'm here because I've been legally required to personally authenticate all    hours of taped conversation. For the past eight months  the mysterious content of these tapes has hung like the Sword of Damocles over my head. I mean  who can remember what they said a year ago  Scared and mortified  I listen  listen as I prattle on about the flotsam and jetsam of the day  listen as I confess my love for the president  and  of course  my heartbreak  listen to my sometimes catty  sometimes churlish  sometimes silly self being cruel  unforgiving  uncouth  listen  deeply  deeply ashamed  to the worst version of myself  a self I don't even recognize. A few days later  the Starr Report is released to Congress  and all of those tapes and transcripts  those stolen words  form a part of it. That people can read the transcripts is horrific enough  but a few weeks later  the audio tapes are aired on TV  and significant portions made available online. The public humiliation was excruciating. Life was almost unbearable. This was not something that happened with regularity back then in       and by this  I mean the stealing of people's private words  actions  conversations or photos  and then making them public    public without consent  public without context  and public without compassion. Fast forward    years to       and now social media has been born. The landscape has sadly become much more populated with instances like mine  whether or not someone actually make a mistake  and now it's for both public and private people. The consequences for some have become dire  very dire. I was on the phone with my mom in September of       and we were talking about the news of a young college freshman from Rutgers University named Tyler Clementi. Sweet  sensitive  creative Tyler was secretly webcammed by his roommate while being intimate with another man. When the online world learned of this incident  the ridicule and cyberbullying ignited. A few days later  Tyler jumped from  the George Washington Bridge to his death. He was   . My mom was beside herself about what happened to Tyler and his family  and she was gutted with pain in a way that I just couldn't quite understand  and then eventually I realized she was reliving       reliving a time when she sat by my bed every night  reliving a time when she made me shower with the bathroom door open  and reliving a time when both of my parents feared that I would be humiliated to death  literally. Today  too many parents haven't had the chance to step in and rescue their loved ones. Too many have learned of their child's suffering and humiliation after it was too late. Tyler's tragic  senseless death was a turning point for me. It served to recontextualize my experiences  and I then began to look at the world of humiliation and bullying around me and see something different. In       we had no way of knowing where this brave new technology called the Internet would take us. Since then  it has connected people in unimaginable ways  joining lost siblings  saving lives  launching revolutions  but the darkness  cyberbullying  and slut shaming that I experienced had mushroomed. Every day online  people  especially young people who are not developmentally equipped to handle this  are so abused and humiliated that they can't imagine living to the next day  and some  tragically  don't  and there's nothing virtual about that. ChildLine  a U.K. nonprofit that's focused on helping young people on various issues  released a staggering statistic late last year  From      to       there was an    percent increase in calls and emails related to cyberbullying. A meta analysis done out of the Netherlands showed that for the first time  cyberbullying was leading to suicidal ideations more significantly than offline bullying. And you know what shocked me  although it shouldn't have  was other research last year that determined humiliation was a more intensely felt emotion than either happiness or even anger. Cruelty to others is nothing new  but online  technologically enhanced shaming is amplified  uncontained  and permanently accessible. The echo of embarrassment used to extend only as far as your family  village  school or community  but now it's the online community too. Millions of people  often anonymously  can stab you with their words  and that's a lot of pain  and there are no perimeters around how many people can publicly observe you and put you in a public stockade. There is a very personal price to public humiliation  and the growth of the Internet has jacked up that price. For nearly two decades now  we have slowly been sowing the seeds of shame and public humiliation in our cultural soil  both on  and offline. Gossip websites  paparazzi  reality programming  politics  news outlets and sometimes hackers all traffic in shame. It's led to desensitization and a permissive environment online which lends itself to trolling  invasion of privacy  and cyberbullying. This shift has created what Professor Nicolaus Mills calls a culture of humiliation. Consider a few prominent examples just from the past six months alone. Snapchat  the service which is used mainly by younger generations and claims that its messages only have the lifespan of a few seconds. You can imagine the range of content that that gets. A third party app which Snapchatters use to preserve the lifespan of the messages was hacked  and         personal conversations  photos  and videos were leaked online to now have a lifespan of forever. Jennifer Lawrence and several other actors had their iCloud accounts hacked  and private  intimate  nude photos were plastered across the Internet without their permission. One gossip website had over five million hits for this one story. And what about the Sony Pictures cyberhacking  The documents which received the most attention were private emails that had maximum public embarrassment value. But in this culture of humiliation  there is another kind of price tag attached to public shaming. The price does not measure the cost to the victim  which Tyler and too many others  notably women  minorities  and members of the LGBTQ community have paid  but the price measures the profit of those who prey on them. This invasion of others is a raw material  efficiently and ruthlessly mined  packaged and sold at a profit. A marketplace has emerged where public humiliation is a commodity and shame is an industry. How is the money made  Clicks. The more shame  the more clicks. The more clicks  the more advertising dollars. We're in a dangerous cycle. The more we click on this kind of gossip  the more numb we get to the human lives behind it  and the more numb we get  the more we click. All the while  someone is making money off of the back  of someone else's suffering. With every click  we make a choice. The more we saturate our culture with public shaming  the more accepted it is  the more we will see behavior like cyberbullying  trolling  some forms of hacking  and online harassment. Why  Because they all have humiliation at their cores. This behavior is a symptom of the culture we've created. Just think about it. Changing behavior begins with evolving beliefs. We've seen that to be true with racism  homophobia  and plenty of other biases  today and in the past. As we've changed beliefs about same sex marriage  more people have been offered equal freedoms. When we began valuing sustainability  more people began to recycle. So as far as our culture of humiliation goes  what we need is a cultural revolution. Public shaming as a blood sport has to stop  and it's time for an intervention on the Internet and in our culture. The shift begins with something simple  but it's not easy. We need to return to a long held value of compassion    compassion and empathy. Online  we've got a compassion deficit  an empathy crisis. Researcher Bren  Brown said  and I quote   Shame can't survive empathy.  Shame cannot survive empathy. I've seen some very dark days in my life  and it was the compassion and empathy from my family  friends  professionals  and sometimes even strangers that saved me. Even empathy from one person can make a difference. The theory of minority influence  proposed by social psychologist Serge Moscovici  says that even in small numbers  when there's consistency over time  change can happen. In the online world  we can foster minority influence by becoming upstanders. To become an upstander means instead of bystander apathy  we can post a positive comment for someone or report a bullying situation. Trust me  compassionate comments help abate the negativity. We can also counteract the culture by supporting organizations that deal with these kinds of issues  like the Tyler Clementi Foundation in the U.S.  In the U.K.  there's Anti Bullying Pro  and in Australia  there's Project Rockit. We talk a lot about our right to freedom of expression  but we need to talk more about our responsibility to freedom of expression. We all want to be heard  but let's acknowledge the difference between speaking up with intention and speaking up for attention. The Internet is  the superhighway for the id  but online  showing empathy to others benefits us all and helps create a safer and better world. We need to communicate online with compassion  consume news with compassion  and click with compassion. Just imagine walking a mile in someone else's headline. I'd like to end on a personal note. In the past nine months  the question I've been  asked the most is why. Why now  Why was I  sticking my head above the parapet  You can read between the lines in those questions  and the answer has nothing to do with politics. The top note answer was and is because it's time  time to stop tip toeing around my past  time to stop living a life of opprobrium  and time to take back my narrative. It's also not just about saving myself. Anyone who is suffering from shame and public humiliation needs to know one thing  You can survive it. I know it's hard. It may not be painless  quick or easy  but you can insist on a different ending to your story. Have compassion for yourself. We all deserve compassion  and to live both online and off in a more compassionate world. Thank you for listening. Let me show you something. The boy is petting the elephant. Those are people that are going on an airplane. That's a big airplane. Fei Fei Li  This is a three year old child describing what she sees in a series of photos. She might still have a lot to learn about this world  but she's already an expert at one very important task  to make sense of what she sees. Our society is more technologically advanced than ever. We send people to the moon  we make phones that talk to us or customize radio stations that can play only music we like. Yet  our most advanced machines and computers still struggle at this task. So I'm here today to give you a progress report on the latest advances in our research in computer vision  one of the most frontier and potentially revolutionary technologies in computer science. Yes  we have prototyped cars that can drive by themselves  but without smart vision  they cannot really tell the difference between a crumpled paper bag on the road  which can be run over  and a rock that size  which should be avoided. We have made fabulous megapixel cameras  but we have not delivered sight to the blind. Drones can fly over massive land  but don't have enough vision technology to help us to track the changes of the rainforests. Security cameras are everywhere  but they do not alert us when a child is drowning in a swimming pool. Photos and videos are becoming an integral part of global life. They're being generated at a pace that's far beyond what any human  or teams of humans  could hope to view  and you and I are contributing to that at this TED. Yet our most advanced software is still struggling at understanding and managing this enormous content. So in other words  collectively as a society  we're very much blind  because our smartest  machines are still blind.  Why is this so hard   you may ask. Cameras can take pictures like this one by converting lights into a two dimensional array of numbers known as pixels  but these are just lifeless numbers. They do not carry meaning in themselves. Just like to hear is not the same as to listen  to take pictures is not the same as to see  and by seeing  we really mean understanding. In fact  it took Mother Nature     million years of hard work to do this task  and much of that effort went into developing the visual processing apparatus of our brains  not the eyes themselves. So vision begins with the eyes  but it truly takes place in the brain. So for    years now  starting from my Ph.D. at Caltech and then leading Stanford's Vision Lab  I've been working with my mentors  collaborators and students to teach computers to see. Our research field is called computer vision and machine learning. It's part of the general field of artificial intelligence. So ultimately  we want to teach the machines to see just like we do  naming objects  identifying people  inferring  D geometry of things  understanding relations  emotions  actions and intentions. You and I weave together entire stories of people  places and things the moment we lay our gaze on them. The first step towards this goal is to teach a computer to see objects  the building block of the visual world. In its simplest terms  imagine this teaching process as showing the computers some training images of a particular object  let's say cats  and designing a model that learns from these training images. How hard can this be  After all  a cat is just a collection of shapes and colors  and this is what we did in the early days of object modeling. We'd tell the computer algorithm in a mathematical language that a cat has a round face  a chubby body  two pointy ears  and a long tail  and that looked all fine. But what about this cat  It's all curled up. Now you have to add another shape and viewpoint to the object model. But what if cats are hidden  What about these silly cats  Now you get my point. Even something as simple as a household pet can present an infinite number of variations to the object model  and that's just one object. So about eight years ago  a very simple and profound observation changed my thinking. No one tells a child how to see  especially in the early years. They learn this through real world experiences and examples. If you consider a child's eyes as a pair of biological cameras  they take one picture about every     milliseconds  the average time an eye movement is made. So by age three  a child would have seen hundreds of millions of pictures of the real world. That's a lot of training examples. So instead of focusing solely on better and better algorithms  my insight was to give the algorithms the kind of training data that a child was given through experiences in both quantity and quality. Once we know this  we knew we needed to collect a data set that has far more images than we have ever had before  perhaps thousands of times more  and together with Professor Kai Li at Princeton University  we launched the ImageNet project in     . Luckily  we didn't have to mount a camera on our head and wait for many years. We went to the Internet  the biggest treasure trove of pictures that humans have ever created. We downloaded nearly a billion images and used crowdsourcing technology like the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform to help us to label these images. At its peak  ImageNet was one of the biggest employers of the Amazon Mechanical Turk workers  together  almost        workers from     countries around the world helped us to clean  sort and label nearly a billion candidate images. That was how much effort it took to capture even a fraction of the imagery a child's mind takes in in the early developmental years. In hindsight  this idea of using big data to train computer algorithms may seem obvious now  but back in       it was not so obvious. We were fairly alone on this journey for quite a while. Some very friendly colleagues advised me to do something more useful for my tenure  and we were constantly struggling for research funding. Once  I even joked to my graduate students that I would just reopen my dry cleaner's shop to fund ImageNet. After all  that's how I funded my college years. So we carried on. In       the ImageNet project delivered a database of    million images across        classes of objects and things organized by everyday English words. In both quantity and quality  this was an unprecedented scale. As an example  in the case of cats  we have more than        cats of all kinds of looks and poses and across all species of domestic and wild cats. We were thrilled to have put together ImageNet  and we wanted the whole research world to benefit from it  so in the TED fashion  we opened up the entire data set to the worldwide research community for free. Now that we have the data to nourish our computer brain  we're ready to come back to the algorithms themselves. As it turned out  the wealth of information provided by ImageNet was a perfect match to a particular class of machine learning algorithms called convolutional neural network  pioneered by Kunihiko Fukushima  Geoff Hinton  and Yann LeCun back in the     s and '  s. Just like the brain consists of billions of highly connected neurons  a basic operating unit in a neural network is a neuron like node. It takes input from other nodes and sends output to others. Moreover  these hundreds of thousands or even millions of nodes are organized in hierarchical layers  also similar to the brain. In a typical neural network we use to train our object recognition model  it has    million nodes      million parameters  and    billion connections. That's an enormous model. Powered by the massive data from ImageNet and the modern CPUs and GPUs to train such a humongous model  the convolutional neural network blossomed in a way that no one expected. It became the winning architecture to generate exciting new results in object recognition. This is a computer telling us this picture contains a cat and where the cat is. Of course there are more things than cats  so here's a computer algorithm telling us the picture contains a boy and a teddy bear  a dog  a person  and a small kite in the background  or a picture of very busy things like a man  a skateboard  railings  a lampost  and so on. Sometimes  when the computer is not so confident about what it sees  we have taught it to be smart enough to give us a safe answer instead of committing too much  just like we would do  but other times our computer algorithm is remarkable at telling us what exactly the objects are  like the make  model  year of the cars. We applied this algorithm to millions of Google Street View images across hundreds of American cities  and we have learned something really interesting  first  it confirmed our common wisdom that car prices correlate very well with household incomes. But surprisingly  car prices also correlate well with crime rates in cities  or voting patterns by zip codes. So wait a minute. Is that it  Has the computer already matched or even surpassed human capabilities  Not so fast. So far  we have just taught the computer to see objects. This is like a small child learning to utter a few nouns. It's an incredible accomplishment  but it's only the first step. Soon  another developmental milestone will be hit  and children begin to communicate in sentences. So instead of saying this is a cat in the picture  you already heard the little girl telling us this is a cat lying on a bed. So to teach a computer to see a picture and generate sentences  the marriage between big data and machine learning algorithm has to take another step. Now  the computer has to learn from both pictures as well as natural language sentences generated by humans. Just like the brain integrates vision and language  we developed a model that connects parts of visual things like visual snippets with words and phrases in sentences. About four months ago  we finally tied all this together and produced one of the first computer vision models that is capable of generating a human like sentence when it sees a picture for the first time. Now  I'm ready to show you what the computer says when it sees the picture that the little girl saw at the beginning of this talk. A large airplane sitting on top of an airport runway. FFL  Of course  we're still working hard to improve our algorithms  and it still has a lot to learn. And the computer still makes mistakes. FFL  So of course  when it sees too many cats  it thinks everything might look like a cat. FFL  Or  if it hasn't seen a toothbrush  it confuses it with a baseball bat. FFL  We haven't taught Art     to the computers. FFL  And it hasn't learned to appreciate the stunning beauty of nature like you and I do. So it has been a long journey. To get from age zero to three was hard. The real challenge is to go from three to    and far beyond. Let me remind you with this picture of the boy and the cake again. So far  we have taught the computer to see objects or even tell us a simple story when seeing a picture. FFL  But there's so much more  to this picture than just a person and a cake. What the computer doesn't see is that this is a special Italian cake that's only served during Easter time. The boy is wearing his favorite t shirt given to him as a gift by his father after a trip to Sydney  and you and I can all tell how happy he is and what's exactly on his mind at that moment. This is my son Leo. On my quest for visual intelligence  I think of Leo constantly and the future world he will live in. When machines can see  doctors and nurses will have extra pairs of tireless eyes to help them to diagnose and take care of patients. Cars will run smarter and safer on the road. Robots  not just humans  will help us to brave the disaster zones to save the trapped and wounded. We will discover new species   better materials  and explore unseen frontiers with the help of the machines. Little by little  we're giving sight to the machines. First  we teach them to see. Then  they help us to see better. For the first time  human eyes won't be the only ones pondering and exploring our world. We will not only use the machines for their intelligence  we will also collaborate with them in ways that we cannot even imagine. This is my quest  to give computers visual intelligence and to create a better future for Leo and for the world. Thank you.  Where are you from   said the pale  tattooed man.  Where are you from   It's September              days after the worst attack on America since World War II. Everyone wonders about the next plane. People are looking for scapegoats. The president   the night before  pledges to  bring our enemies to justice  or bring justice to our enemies.  And in the Dallas mini mart  a Dallas mini part surrounded by tire shops and strip joints a Bangladeshi immigrant  works the register. Back home  Raisuddin Bhuiyan was a big man  an Air Force officer. But he dreamed of a  fresh start in America. If he had to work briefly in a mini mart to save up for I.T. classes and his wedding in two months  so be it. Then  on September      that tattooed man enters the mart. He holds a shotgun. Raisuddin knows the drill  puts cash on the counter. This time  the man doesn't  touch the money.  Where are you from   he asks.  Excuse me   Raisuddin answers. His accent betrays him. The tattooed man  a self styled true American vigilante  shoots Raisuddin in revenge for     . Raisuddin feels millions of bees stinging his face. In fact  dozens of scalding   birdshot pellets puncture his head. Behind the counter  he lays in blood. He cups a hand over his forehead to keep in the brains on which he'd gambled everything. He recites verses from the Koran  begging his God to live. He senses he is dying. He didn't die. His right eye left him. His fianc e left him. His landlord  the mini mart owner  kicked him out. Soon he was homeless and         dollars in medical debt  including a fee for dialing  for an ambulance. But Raisuddin lived. And years later  he would ask what he could do to repay his God and become worthy of this second chance. He would come to believe  in fact  that this chance called for him to give a second chance to a man we might think deserved no chance at all. Twelve years ago  I was a fresh graduate seeking my way in the world. Born in Ohio to Indian immigrants  I settled on the ultimate rebellion  against my parents  moving to the country they had worked so damn hard to get out of. What I thought might be a six month stint in Mumbai stretched to six years. I became a writer and found myself amid a magical story  the awakening of hope across much of the so called Third World. Six years ago  I returned to America and realized something  The American Dream was thriving  but only in India. In America  not so much. In fact  I observed that  America was fracturing into two distinct societies  a republic of dreams and a republic of fears. And then  I stumbled onto this  incredible tale of two lives and of these two Americas that brutally collided in that Dallas mini mart. I knew at once I wanted to learn more  and eventually that I would write a book about them  for their story was the story  of America's fracturing and of how it might be put back together. After he was shot  Raisuddin's life grew no easier. The day after admitting him  the hospital discharged him. His right eye couldn't see. He couldn't speak. Metal peppered his face. But he had no insurance   so they bounced him. His family in Bangladesh  begged him   Come home.  But he told them he had  a dream to see about. He found telemarketing work  then he became an Olive Garden waiter  because where better to get over his fear of white people than the Olive Garden  Now  as a devout Muslim  he refused alcohol  didn't touch the stuff. Then he learned that not selling it would slash his pay. So he reasoned  like a budding  American pragmatist   Well  God wouldn't want me to starve  would he   And before long  in some months   Raisuddin was that Olive Garden's highest grossing alcohol pusher. He found a man who taught him database administration. He got part time I.T. gigs. Eventually  he landed a six figure job at a blue chip tech company in Dallas. But as America began to work for Raisuddin  he avoided the classic error of the fortunate  assuming you're the rule   not the exception. In fact  he observed that many with the fortune of being born American were nonetheless trapped in lives that  made second chances like his impossible. He saw it at the Olive Garden itself  where so many of his colleagues had childhood horror stories of family dysfunction  chaos   addiction  crime. He'd heard a similar tale about the man who shot him back when he attended his trial. The closer Raisuddin got to the America he had coveted from afar  the more he realized there was another  equally real  America that was stingier with second chances. The man who shot Raisuddin grew up in that stingier America. From a distance  Mark Stroman was always the spark of parties  always making girls feel pretty. Always working  no matter what  drugs or fights he'd had the night before. But he'd always wrestled with demons. He entered the world through the three gateways that doom so many young American men  bad parents  bad schools  bad prisons. His mother told him  regretfully  as a boy that she'd been just    dollars  short of aborting him. Sometimes  that little boy  would be at school  he'd suddenly pull a knife  on his fellow classmates. Sometimes that same little boy would be at his grandparents'  tenderly feeding horses. He was getting arrested before he shaved  first juvenile  then prison. He became a casual white supremacist and  like so many around him   a drug addled and absent father. And then  before long  he found himself on death row  for in his      counter jihad   he had shot not one mini mart clerk  but three. Only Raisuddin survived. Strangely  death row was  the first institution that left Stroman better. His old influences quit him. The people entering his life  were virtuous and caring  pastors  journalists  European pen pals. They listened to him  prayed with him  helped him question himself. And sent him on a journey  of introspection and betterment. He finally faced the hatred  that had defined his life. He read Viktor Frankl   the Holocaust survivor and regretted his swastika tattoos. He found God. Then one day in           years after his crimes  Stroman received news. One of the men he'd shot  the survivor  was fighting to save his life. You see  late in       eight years after that shooting  Raisuddin had gone on his own journey  a pilgrimage to Mecca. Amid its crowds   he felt immense gratitude  but also duty. He recalled promising God   as he lay dying in       that if he lived  he would serve  humanity all his days. Then  he'd gotten busy  relaying the bricks of a life. Now it was time to pay his debts. And he decided  upon reflection  that his method of payment would be an intervention  in the cycle of vengeance between the Muslim and Western worlds. And how would he intervene  By forgiving Stroman publicly in the name of Islam and its doctrine of mercy. And then suing the state of Texas and its governor Rick Perry to prevent them from executing Stroman  exactly like most people  shot in the face do. Yet Raisuddin's mercy was inspired  not only by faith. A newly minted American citizen  he had come to believe that Stroman was the product of a hurting America that couldn't just be lethally injected away. That insight is what moved me  to write my book  The True American.  This immigrant begging America  to be as merciful to a native son as it had been to an adopted one. In the mini mart  all those years earlier  not just two men   but two Americas collided. An America that still dreams   still strives  still imagines that tomorrow can build on today  and an America that has resigned to fate  buckled under stress and chaos  lowered expectations  an ducked into the oldest of refuges  the tribal fellowship of one's own narrow kind. And it was Raisuddin  despite being a newcomer  despite being attacked  despite being homeless and traumatized  who belonged to that republic of dreams and Stroman who belonged to that  other wounded country  despite being born with the privilege of a native white man. I realized these men's stories formed an urgent parable about America. The country I am so proud to call my own wasn't living through a  generalized decline as seen in Spain or Greece   where prospects were dimming for everyone. America is simultaneously the most and the least successful country in the industrialized world. Launching the world's best companies  even as record numbers  of children go hungry. Seeing life expectancy drop for large groups  even as it polishes  the world's best hospitals. America today is a sprightly young body  hit by one of those strokes  that sucks the life from one side  while leaving the other worryingly perfect. On July           right after  a sobbing Raisuddin testified in defense of Stroman's life  Stroman was killed by lethal injection by the state he so loved. Hours earlier  when Raisuddin still thought he could still save Stroman  the two men got to speak  for the second time ever. Here is an excerpt from their phone call. Raisuddin   Mark  you should know  that I am praying for God  the most compassionate and gracious. I forgive you and I do not hate you. I never hated you.  Stroman   You are a remarkable person. Thank you from my heart. I love you  bro.  Even more amazingly  after the execution  Raisuddin reached out to Stroman's  eldest daughter  Amber  an ex convinct and an addict. and offered his help.  You may have lost a father   he told her   but you've gained an uncle.  He wanted her  too  to have  a second chance. If human history were a parade  America's float would be  a neon shrine to second chances. But America  generous with second chances to the children of other lands  today grows miserly with first chances to the children of its own. America still dazzles at allowing anybody to become an American. But it is losing its luster at allowing every American to become a somebody. Over the last decade  seven million foreigners gained American citizenship. Remarkable. In the meanwhile  how many Americans gained a place in the middle class  Actually  the net influx was negative. Go back further   and it's even more striking  Since the   s  the middle class has shrunk by    percent  mainly because of the people tumbling out of it. And my reporting around the country tells me the problem is grimmer than simple inequality. What I observe is a pair of secessions from the unifying center of American life. An affluent secession of up  up and away  into elite enclaves of the educated and into a global matrix of work  money and connections  and an impoverished secession  of down and out into disconnected  dead end lives that the fortunate scarcely see. And don't console yourself  that you are the    percent. If you live near a Whole Foods  if no one in your family serves  in the military  if you're paid by the year  not the hour  if most people you know finished college  if no one you know uses meth  if you married once and remain married  if you're not one of    million Americans with a criminal record    if any or all of these things  describe you  then accept the possibility that actually  you may not know what's going on and you may be part of the problem. Other generations had to build  a fresh society after slavery  pull through a depression  defeat fascism  freedom ride in Mississippi. The moral challenge of  my generation  I believe  is to reacquaint these two Americas  to choose union over secession once again. This ins't a problem we can tax or tax cut away. It won't be solved by tweeting harder  building slicker apps  or starting one more  artisanal coffee roasting service. It is a moral challenge that begs  each of us in the flourishing America to take on the wilting America as our own  as Raisuddin tried to do. Like him  we can make pilgrimages. And there  in Baltimore and Oregon  and Appalachia  find new purpose  as he did. We can immerse ourselves  in that other country  bear witness to its hopes and sorrows  and  like Raisuddin  ask what we can do. What can you do  What can you do  What can we do  How might we build  a more merciful country  We  the greatest inventors in the world  can invent solutions to the problems  of that America  not only our own. We  the writers and the journalists   can cover that America's stories  instead of shutting down  bureaus in its midst. We can finance that America's ideas  instead of ideas from New York  and San Francisco. We can put our stethoscopes to its backs  teach there  go to court there  make there  live there  pray there. This  I believe  is the calling  of a generation. An America whose two halves learn again to stride  to plow  to forge  to dare together. A republic of chances  rewoven  renewed  begins with us. Thank you. Tonight  I'm going to try to make the case that inviting a loved one  a friend or even a stranger to record a meaningful interview with you just might turn out to be one of the most  important moments in that person's life  and in yours. When I was    years old  I was lucky enough to find my calling when I fell into making radio stories. At almost the exact same time  I found out that my dad  who I was very  very close to  was gay. I was taken completely by surprise. We were a very tight knit family  and I was crushed. At some point  in one of our strained conversations  my dad mentioned the Stonewall riots. He told me that one night in       a group of young black and Latino drag queens fought back against the police at a gay bar in Manhattan called the Stonewall Inn  and how this sparked the modern gay rights movement. It was an amazing story  and it piqued my interest. So I decided to pick up my tape  recorder and find out more. With the help of a young archivist named Michael Shirker  we tracked down all of the people we could find who had been at the Stonewall Inn that night. Recording these interviews  I saw how the microphone gave me the license to go places I otherwise never would have gone and talk to people I might not otherwise ever have spoken to. I had the privilege of getting to know some of the most amazing  fierce and courageous human beings I had ever met. It was the first time the story of Stonewall had been told to a national audience. I dedicated the program to my dad  it changed my relationship with him  and it changed my life. Over the next    years  I made many more radio documentaries  working to shine a light on people who are rarely heard from in the media. Over and over again  I'd see how this simple act of being interviewed could mean so much to people  particularly those who had been told that their stories didn't matter. I could literally see people's back straighten as they started to speak into the microphone. In       I made a documentary about the last flophouse hotels on the Bowery in Manhattan. Guys stayed up in these cheap hotels for decades. They lived in cubicles the size of prison cells covered with chicken wire so you couldn't jump from one room into the next. Later  I wrote a book on the men with the photographer Harvey Wang. I remember walking into a flophouse with an early version of the book and showing one of the guys his page. He stood there staring at it in silence  then he grabbed the book out of my hand and started running down the long  narrow hallway holding it over his head shouting   I exist  I exist.  In many ways   I exist  became the clarion call for StoryCorps  this crazy idea that I had a dozen years ago. The thought was to take documentary work and turn it on its head. Traditionally  broadcast documentary has been about recording interviews to create a work of art or entertainment or education that is seen or heard by a whole lot of people  but I wanted to try something where the interview itself was the purpose of this work  and see if we could give many  many  many people the chance to be listened to in this way. So in Grand Central Terminal    years ago  we built a booth where anyone  can come to honor someone else by interviewing them about their life. You come to this booth and you're met by a facilitator who brings you inside. You sit across from  say  your grandfather for close to an hour and you listen and you talk. Many people think of it as  if this was to be our last conversation  what would I want to ask of and say to this person who means so much to me  At the end of the session  you walk away with a copy of the interview and another copy goes to the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress so that your great great great grandkids can someday get to know your grandfather through his voice and story. So we open this booth in one of the busiest places in the world and invite people to have this incredibly intimate conversation with another human being. I had no idea if it would work  but from the very beginning  it did. People treated the experience with incredible respect  and amazing conversations happened inside. I want to play just one animated excerpt from an interview recorded at that original Grand Central Booth. This is    year old Joshua Littman interviewing his mother  Sarah. Josh has Asperger's syndrome. As you may know  kids with Asperger's are incredibly smart but have a tough time socially. They usually have obsessions. In Josh's case  it's with animals  so this is Josh talking with his mom Sarah at Grand Central nine years ago. do you think your life would be different without animals  Sarah Littman  I think it would be an eight without animals  because they add so much pleasure to life. JL  How else do you think your life would be different without them  SL  I could do without things like cockroaches and snakes. JL  Well  I'm okay with snakes as long as they're not venomous or constrict you or anything. SL  Yeah  I'm not a big snake person    JL  But cockroach is just the insect we love to hate. SL  Yeah  it really is. JL  Have you ever thought you couldn't cope with having a child  SL  I remember when you were a baby  you had really bad colic  so you would just cry and cry. JL  What's colic  SL  It's when you get this stomach ache and all you do is scream for  like  four hours. JL  Even louder than Amy does  SL  You were pretty loud  but Amy's was more high pitched. JL  I think it feels like everyone seems to like Amy more  like she's the perfect little angel. SL  Well  I can understand why you think that people like Amy more  and I'm not saying it's because of your Asperger's syndrome  but being friendly comes easily to Amy  whereas I think for you it's more difficult  but the people who take the time to get to know you love you so much. JL  Like Ben or Eric or Carlos  SL  Yeah    JL  Like I have better quality friends but less quantity   Laughter  SL  I wouldn't judge the quality  but I think    JL  I mean  first it was like  Amy loved Claudia  then she hated Claudia  she loved Claudia  then she hated Claudia. SL  Part of that's a girl thing  honey. The important thing for you is that you have a few very good friends  and really that's what you need in life. JL  Did I turn out to be the son you wanted when I was born  Did I meet your expectations  SL  You've exceeded my expectations  sweetie  because  sure  you have these fantasies of what your child's going to be like  but you have made me grow so much as a parent  because you think    JL  Well  I was the one who made you a parent. SL  You were the one who made me a parent. That's a good point.  Laughter  But also because you think differently from what they tell you in the parenting books  I really had to learn to think outside of the box with you  and it's made me much more creative as a parent and as a person  and I'll always thank you for that. JL  And that helped when Amy was born  SL  And that helped when Amy was born  but you are so incredibly special to me and I'm so lucky to have you as my son. David Isay  After this story ran on public radio  Josh received hundreds of letters telling him what an amazing kid he was. His mom  Sarah  bound them together in a book  and when Josh got picked on at school  they would read the letters together. I just want to acknowledge that two of my heroes are here with us tonight. Sarah Littman and her son Josh  who is now an honors student in college. You know  a lot of people talk about crying when they hear StoryCorps stories  and it's not because they're sad. Most of them aren't. I think it's because you're hearing something authentic and pure at this moment  when sometimes it's hard to tell what's real and what's an advertisement. It's kind of the anti reality TV. Nobody comes to StoryCorps to get rich. Nobody comes to get famous. It's simply an act of generosity and love. So many of these are just everyday people talking about lives lived with kindness  courage  decency and dignity  and when you hear that kind of story  it can sometimes feel like you're walking on holy ground. So this experiment  in Grand Central worked  and we expanded across the country. Today  more than         people in all    states in thousands of cities and towns across America have recorded StoryCorps interviews. It's now the largest single collection of human voices ever gathered. We've hired and trained hundreds of facilitators to help guide people through the experience. Most serve a year or two with StoryCorps traveling the country  gathering the wisdom of humanity. They call it bearing witness  and if you ask them  all of the facilitators will tell you that the most important thing they've learned from being present during these interviews is that people are basically good. And I think for the first years of StoryCorps  you could argue that there was some kind of a selection bias happening  but after tens of thousands of interviews with every kind of person in every part of the country    rich  poor  five years old to         different languages  across the political spectrum    you have to think that maybe these guys are actually onto something. I've also learned so much from these interviews. I've learned about the poetry and the wisdom and the grace that can be found in the words of people all around us when we simply take the time to listen  like this interview between a betting clerk in Brooklyn named Danny Perasa who brought his wife Annie to StoryCorps to talk about his love for her. I always feel guilty when I say  I love you  to you. And I say it so often. I say it to remind you that as dumpy as I am  it's coming from me. It's like hearing a beautiful song from a busted old radio  and it's nice of you to keep the radio around the house. Annie Perasa  If I don't have a note on the kitchen table  I think there's something wrong. You write a love letter to me every morning. DP  Well  the only thing that could possibly be wrong is I couldn't find a silly pen. AP  To my princess  The weather outside today is extremely rainy. I'll call you at       in the morning. DP  It's a romantic weather report. AP  And I love you. I love you. I love you. DP  When a guy is happily married  no matter what happens at work  no matter what happens in the rest of the day  there's a shelter when you get home  there's a knowledge knowing that you can hug somebody without them throwing you downstairs and saying   Get your hands off me.  Being married is like having a color television set. You never want to go back to black and white. DI  Danny was about five feet tall with crossed eyes and one single snaggletooth  but Danny Perasa had more romance in his little pinky than all of Hollywood's leading men put together. What else have I learned  I've learned about the almost unimaginable capacity for the human spirit to forgive. I've learned about resilience and I've learned about strength. Like an interview with Oshea Israel and Mary Johnson. When Oshea was a teenager  he murdered Mary's only son  Laramiun Byrd  in a gang fight. A dozen years later  Mary went to prison to meet Oshea and find out who this person was who had taken her son's life. Slowly and remarkably  they became friends  and when he was finally released from the penitentiary  Oshea actually moved in next door to Mary. This is just a short excerpt of a conversation they had soon after Oshea was freed. I didn't see him graduate  and now you're going to college. I'll have the opportunity to see you graduate. I didn't see him get married. Hopefully one day  I'll be able to experience that with you. Oshea Israel  Just to hear you say those things and to be in my life in the manner in which you are is my motivation. It motivates me to make sure that I stay on the right path. You still believe in me  and the fact that you can do it despite how much pain I caused you  it's amazing. MJ  I know it's not an easy thing to be able to share our story together  even with us sitting here looking at each other right now. I know it's not an easy thing  so I admire that you can do this. OI  I love you  lady. MJ  I love you too  son. DI  And I've been reminded countless times of the courage and goodness of people  and how the arc of history truly does bend towards justice. Like the story of Alexis Martinez  who was born Arthur Martinez in the Harold Ickes projects in Chicago. In the interview  she talks with her daughter Lesley about joining a gang as a young man  and later in life transitioning into the woman she was always meant to be. This is Alexis and her daughter Lesley. I was always afraid that I wouldn't be allowed to be in my granddaughters' lives  and you blew that completely out of the water  you and your husband. One of the fruits of that is  in my relationship with my granddaughters  they fight with each other sometimes over whether I'm he or she. Lesley Martinez  But they're free to talk about it. AM  They're free to talk about it  but that  to me  is a miracle. LM  You don't have to apologize. You don't have to tiptoe. We're not going to cut you off  and that's something I've always wanted you to just know  that you're loved. AM  You know  I live this every day now. I walk down the streets as a woman  and I really am at peace with who I am. I mean  I wish I had a softer voice maybe  but now I walk in love and I try to live that way every day. DI  Now I walk in love. I'm going to tell you a secret about StoryCorps. It takes some courage to have these conversations. StoryCorps speaks to our mortality. Participants know this recording will be heard long after they're gone. There's a hospice doctor named Ira Byock who has worked closely with us on recording interviews with people who are dying. He wrote a book called  The Four Things That Matter Most  about the four things you want to say to the most important people in your life before they or you die  thank you  I love you  forgive me  I forgive you. They're just about the most powerful words we can say to one another  and often that's what happens in a StoryCorps booth. It's a chance to have a sense of closure with someone you care about    no regrets  nothing left unsaid. And it's hard and it takes courage  but that's why we're alive  right  So  the TED Prize. When I first heard from TED and Chris a few months ago about the possibility of the Prize  I was completely floored. They asked me to come up with a very brief wish for humanity  no more than    words. So I thought about it  I wrote my    words  and a few weeks later  Chris called and said   Go for it.  So here is my wish  that you will help us take everything we've learned through StoryCorps and bring it to the world so that anyone anywhere can easily record a meaningful interview with another human being which will then be archived for history. How are we going to do that  With this. We're fast moving into a future where everyone in the world will have access to one of these  and it has powers I never could have imagined    years ago when I started StoryCorps. It has a microphone  it can tell you how to do things  and it can send audio files. Those are the key ingredients. So the first part of the wish is already underway. Over the past couple of months  the team at StoryCorps has been working furiously to create an app that will bring StoryCorps out of our booths so that it can be experienced by anyone  anywhere  anytime. Remember  StoryCorps has always been two people and a facilitator helping them record their conversation  which is preserved forever  but at this very moment  we're releasing a public beta version of the StoryCorps app. The app is a digital facilitator that walks you through the StoryCorps interview process  helps you pick questions  and gives you all the tips you need to record a meaningful StoryCorps interview  and then with one tap upload it  to our archive at the Library of Congress. That's the easy part  the technology. The real challenge is up to you  to take this tool and figure out how we can use it all across America and around the world  so that instead of recording thousands of StoryCorps interviews a year  we could potentially record tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands or maybe even more. Imagine  for example  a national homework assignment where every high school student studying U.S. history across the country records an interview with an elder over Thanksgiving  so that in one single weekend an entire generation of American lives and experiences are captured. Or imagine mothers on opposite sides of a conflict somewhere in the world sitting down not to talk about that conflict but to find out who they are as people  and in doing so  begin to build bonds of trust  or that someday it becomes a tradition all over the world that people are honored with a StoryCorps interview on their   th birthday  or that people in your community go into retirement homes or hospitals or homeless shelters or even prisons armed with this app to honor the people least heard in our society and ask them who they are  what they've learned in life  and how they want to be remembered. Ten years ago  I recorded a StoryCorps interview with my dad who was a psychiatrist  and became a well known gay activist. This is the picture of us at that interview. I never thought about that recording until a couple of years ago  when my dad  who seemed to be in perfect health and was still seeing patients    hours a week  was diagnosed with cancer. He passed away very suddenly a few days later. It was June           the anniversary of the Stonewall riots. I listened to that interview for the first time at three in the morning on the day that he died. I have a couple of young kids at home  and I knew that the only way they were going to get to know this person who was such a towering figure in my life would be through that session. I thought I couldn't believe in StoryCorps any more deeply than I did  but it was at that moment that I fully and viscerally grasped the importance of making these recordings. Every day  people come up to me and say   I wish I had interviewed my father or my grandmother or my brother  but I waited too long.  Now  no one has to wait anymore. At this moment  when so much of how we communicate is fleeting and inconsequential  join us in creating this digital archive of conversations that are enduring and important. Help us create this gift to our children  this testament to who we are as human beings. I hope you'll help us make this wish come true. Interview a family member  a friend or even a stranger. Together  we can create an archive of the wisdom of humanity  and maybe in doing so  we'll learn to listen a little more and shout a little less. Maybe these conversations will remind us what's really important. And maybe  just maybe  it will help us recognize that simple truth that every life  every single life  matters equally and infinitely. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I'm a potter  which seems like a fairly humble vocation. I know a lot about pots. I've spent about    years making them. One of the things that really excites me in my artistic practice and being trained as a potter is that you very quickly learn how to make great things out of nothing  that I spent a lot of time at my wheel with mounds of clay trying stuff  and that the limitations of my capacity  my ability  was based on my hands and my imagination  that if I wanted to make a really nice bowl and I didn't know how to make a foot yet  I would have to learn how to make a foot  that that process of learning has been very  very helpful to my life. I feel like  as a potter  you also start to learn how to shape the world. There have been times in my artistic capacity that I wanted to reflect on other really important moments in the history of the U.S.  the history of the world where tough things happened  but how do you talk about tough ideas without separating people from that content  Could I use art like these old  discontinued firehoses from Alabama  to talk about the complexities of a moment of civil rights in the '  s  Is it possible to talk about my father and I doing labor projects  My dad was a roofer  construction guy  he owned small businesses  and at     he was ready to retire and his tar kettle was my inheritance. Now  a tar kettle doesn't sound like much of an inheritance. It wasn't. It was stinky and it took up a lot of space in my studio  but I asked my dad if he would be willing to make some art with me  if we could reimagine this kind of nothing material as something very special. And by elevating the material and my dad's skill  could we start to think about tar just like clay  in a new way  shaping it differently  helping us to imagine what was possible  After clay  I was then kind of turned on to lots of different kinds of materials  and my studio grew a lot because I thought  well  it's not really about the material  it's about our capacity to shape things. I became more and more interested in ideas and more and more things that  were happening just outside my studio. Just to give you a little bit of context  I live in Chicago. I live on the South Side now. I'm a West Sider. For those of you who are not Chicagoans  that won't mean anything  but if I didn't mention that I was a West Sider  there would be a lot of people in the city that would be very upset. The neighborhood that I live in is Grand Crossing. It's a neighborhood that has seen better days. It is not a gated community by far. There is lots of abandonment in my neighborhood  and while I was kind of busy making pots and busy making art and having a good art career  there was all of this stuff that was happening just outside my studio. All of us know about failing housing markets and the challenges of blight  and I feel like we talk about it with some of our cities more than others  but I think a lot of our U.S. cities and beyond have the challenge of blight  abandoned buildings that people no longer know what to do anything with. And so I thought  is there a way that I could start to think about these buildings as an extension or an expansion of my artistic practice  And that if I was thinking along with other creatives    architects  engineers  real estate finance people    that us together might be able to kind of think in more complicated ways about the reshaping of cities. And so I bought a building. The building was really affordable. We tricked it out. We made it as beautiful as we could to try to just get some activity happening on my block. Once I bought the building for about        dollars  I didn't have any money left. So I started sweeping the building as a kind of performance. This is performance art  and people would come over  and I would start sweeping. Because the broom was free and sweeping was free. It worked out. But we would use the building  then  to stage exhibitions  small dinners  and we found that that building on my block  Dorchester    we now referred to the block as Dorchester projects    that in a way that building became a kind of gathering site for lots of different kinds of activity. We turned the building into what we called now the Archive House. The Archive House would do all of these amazing things. Very significant people in the city and beyond would find themselves in the middle of the hood. And that's when I felt like maybe there was a relationship between my history with clay and this new thing that was starting to develop  that we were slowly starting to reshape how people imagined the South Side of the city. One house turned into a few houses  and we always tried to suggest that not only is creating a beautiful vessel important  but the contents of what happens in those buildings is also very important. So we were not only thinking about development  but we were thinking about the program  thinking about the kind of connections that could happen between one house and another  between one neighbor and another. This building became what we call the Listening House  and it has a collection of discarded books from the Johnson Publishing Corporation  and other books from an old bookstore that was going out of business. I was actually just wanting to activate these buildings as much as I could with whatever and whoever would join me. In Chicago  there's amazing building stock. This building  which had been the former crack house on the block  and when the building became abandoned  it became a great opportunity to really imagine what else could happen there. So this space we converted into what we call Black Cinema House. Black Cinema House was an opportunity in the hood to screen films that were important and relevant to the folk who lived around me  that if we wanted to show an old Melvin Van Peebles film  we could. If we wanted to show  Car Wash   we could. That would be awesome. The building we soon outgrew  and we had to move to a larger space. Black Cinema House  which was made from just a small piece of clay  had to grow into a much larger piece of clay  which is now my studio. What I realized was that for those of you who are zoning junkies  that some of the things that I was doing in these buildings that had been left behind  they were not the uses by which the buildings were built  and that there are city policies that say   Hey  a house that is residential needs to stay residential.  But what do you do in neighborhoods when ain't nobody interested in living there  That the people who have the means to leave have already left  What do we do with these abandoned buildings  And so I was trying to wake them up using culture. We found that that was so exciting for folk  and people were so responsive to the work  that we had to then find bigger buildings. By the time we found bigger buildings  there was  in part  the resources  necessary to think about those things. In this bank that we called the Arts Bank  it was in pretty bad shape. There was about six feet of standing water. It was a difficult project to finance  because banks weren't interested in the neighborhood because people weren't interested in the neighborhood because nothing had happened there. It was dirt. It was nothing. It was nowhere. And so we just started imagining  what else could happen in this building  And so now that the rumor of my block has spread  and lots of people are starting to visit  we've found that the bank can now be a center for exhibition  archives  music performance  and that there are people who are now interested in being adjacent to those buildings because we brought some heat  that we kind of made a fire. One of the archives that we'll have there is this Johnson Publishing Corporation. We've also started to collect memorabilia from American history  from people who live or have lived in that neighborhood. Some of these images are degraded images of black people  kind of histories of very challenging content  and where better than a neighborhood with young people who are constantly asking themselves about their identity to talk about some of the complexities of race and class  In some ways  the bank represents a hub  that we're trying to create a pretty  hardcore node of cultural activity  and that if we could start to make multiple hubs and connect some cool green stuff around there  that the buildings that we've purchased and rehabbed  which is now around    or    units  that if we could land miniature Versailles on top of that  and connect these buildings by a beautiful greenbelt    that this place where people never wanted to be would become an important destination for folk from all over the country and world. In some ways  it feels very much like I'm a potter  that we tackle the things that are at our wheel  we try with the skill that we have to think about this next bowl that I want to make. And it went from a bowl to a singular house to a block to a neighborhood to a cultural district to thinking about the city  and at every point  there were things that I didn't know that I had to learn. I've never learned so much about zoning law in my life. I never thought I'd have to. But as a result of that  I'm finding that there's not just room for my own artistic practice  there's room for a lot of other artistic practices. So people started asking us   Well  Theaster  how are you going to go to scale   and   What's your sustainability plan   And what I found was that I couldn't export myself  that what seems necessary in cities like Akron  Ohio  and Detroit  Michigan  and Gary  Indiana  is that there are people in those places who already believe in those places  that are already dying to make those places beautiful  and that often  those people who are passionate about a place are disconnected from the resources necessary to make cool things happen  or disconnected from a contingency of people that could help make things happen. So now  we're starting to give advice around the country on how to start with what you got  how to start with the things that are in front of you  how to make something out of nothing  how to reshape your world at a wheel or at your block or at the scale of the city. Thank you so much. June Cohen  Thank you. So I think many people watching this will be asking themselves the question you just raised at the end  How can they do this in their own city  You can't export yourself. Give us a few pages out of your playbook about what someone who is inspired about their city can do to take on projects like yours  Theaster Gates  One of the things I've found that's really important is giving thought to not just the kind of individual project  like an old house  but what's the relationship between an old house  a local school  a small bodega  and is there some kind of synergy between those things  Can you get those folk talking  I've found that in cases where neighborhoods have failed  they still often have a pulse. How do you identify the pulse in that place  the passionate people  and then how do you get folk who have been fighting  slogging for    years  reenergized about the place that they live  And so someone has to do that work. If I were a traditional developer  I would be talking about buildings alone  and then putting a  For Lease  sign in the window. I think that you actually have to curate more than that  that there's a way in which you have to be mindful about  what are the businesses that I want to grow here  And then  are there people who live in this place who want to grow those businesses with me  Because I think it's not just a cultural space or housing  there has to be the recreation of an economic core. So thinking about those things together feels right. JC  It's hard to get people to create the spark again when people have been slogging for    years. Are there any methods you've found that have helped break through  TG  Yeah  I think that now there are lots of examples of folk who are doing amazing work  but those methods are sometimes like  when the media is constantly saying that only violent things happen in a place  then based on your skill set and the particular context  what are the things that you can do in your neighborhood to kind of fight some of that  So I've found that if you're a theater person  you have outdoor street theater festivals. In some cases  we don't have the resources in certain neighborhoods to do things that are a certain kind of splashy  but if we can then find ways of making sure that people who are local to a place  plus people who could be supportive of the things that are happening locally  when those people get together  I think really amazing things can happen. JC  So interesting. And how can you make sure that the projects you're creating are actually for the disadvantaged and not just for the sort of vegetarian indie movie crowd that might move in to take advantage of them. TG  Right on. So I think this is where it starts to get into the thick weeds. JC  Let's go there. TG  Right now  Grand Crossing is    percent black  or at least living  and we know that maybe who owns property in a place is different from who walks the streets every day. So it's reasonable to say that Grand Crossing is already in the process of being something different than it is today. But are there ways to think about housing trusts or land trusts or a mission based development that starts to protect some of the space that happens  because when you have       empty lots in a city  you want something to happen there  but you need entities that are not just interested in the development piece  but entities that are interested in the stabilization piece  and I feel like often the developer piece is really motivated  but the other work of a kind of neighborhood consciousness  that part doesn't live anymore. So how do you start to grow up important watchdogs that ensure that the resources that are made available to new folk that are coming in are also distributed to folk who have lived in a place for a long time. JC  That makes so much sense. One more question  You make such a compelling case for beauty and the importance of beauty and the arts. There would be others who would argue that funds would be better spent on basic services for the disadvantaged. How do you combat that viewpoint  or come against it  TG  I believe that beauty  is a basic service. Often what I have found is that when there are resources that have not been made available to certain under resourced cities or neighborhoods or communities  that sometimes culture is the thing that helps to ignite  and that I can't do everything  but I think that there's a way in which if you can start with culture and get people kind of reinvested in their place  other kinds of adjacent amenities start to grow  and then people can make a demand that's a poetic demand  and the political demands that are necessary to wake up our cities  they also become very poetic. JC  It makes perfect sense to me. Theaster  thank you so much for being here with us today. Thank you. Theaster Gates. When I wrote my memoir  the publishers were really confused. Was it about me as a child refugee  or as a woman who set up a high tech software company back in the     s  one that went public and eventually employed over       people  Or was it as a mother of an autistic child  Or as a philanthropist that's now given away serious money  Well  it turns out  I'm all of these. So let me tell you my story. All that I am stems from when I got onto a train in Vienna  part of the Kindertransport that saved nearly        Jewish children from Nazi Europe. I was five years old  clutching the hand of my nine year old sister and had very little idea as to  what was going on.  What is England and  why am I going there   I'm only alive because so long ago   I was helped by generous strangers. I was lucky  and doubly lucky to be later reunited with my birth parents. But  sadly  I never bonded  with them again. But I've done more in the seven decades since that miserable day when my mother put me on the train than I would ever have dreamed possible. And I love England  my adopted country  with a passion that perhaps only someone who has lost their human rights can feel. I decided to make mine a life that was worth saving. And then  I just got on with it. Let me take you back to the early     s. To get past the gender issues of the time  I set up my own software house at one of the first such startups in Britain. But it was also a company of women  a company for women  an early social business. And people laughed at the very idea because software  at that time  was given away free with hardware. Nobody would buy software  certainly not from a woman. Although women were then coming out of the universities with decent degrees  there was a glass ceiling to our progress. And I'd hit that glass ceiling too often  and I wanted opportunities for women. I recruited professionally qualified women who'd left the industry on marriage  or when their first child was expected and structured them into a home working organization. We pioneered the concept of women going back into the workforce after a career break. We pioneered all sorts of new  flexible work methods  job shares  profit sharing   and eventually  co ownership when I took a quarter of the company into the hands of the staff at no cost to anyone but me. For years  I was the first woman this  or the only woman that. And in those days  I couldn't work on the stock exchange  I couldn't drive a bus or fly an airplane. Indeed  I couldn't open a bank account without my husband's permission. My generation of women fought the battles for the right to work and the right for equal pay. Nobody really expected much  from people at work or in society because all the expectations then were about home and  family responsibilities. And I couldn't really face that  so I started to challenge the conventions of the time  even to the extent of changing my name from  Stephanie  to  Steve  in my business development letters  so as to get through the door before anyone realized that he was a she. My company  called Freelance Programmers  and that's precisely what it was  couldn't have started smaller   on the dining room table  and financed by the equivalent of     dollars in today's terms  and financed by my labor and  by borrowing against the house. My interests were scientific   the market was commercial    things such as payroll  which I found rather boring. So I had to compromise with  operational research work  which had the intellectual challenge  that interested me and the commercial value  that was valued by the clients  things like scheduling freight trains  time tabling buses  stock control  lots and lots of stock control. And eventually  the work came in. We disguised the domestic and part time nature of the staff by offering fixed prices  one of the very first to do so. And who would have guessed that the programming of the black box flight recorder  of Supersonic Concord would have been done by a bunch  of women working in their own homes. All we used was a simple   trust the staff  approach and a simple telephone. We even used to ask job applicants    Do you have access to a telephone   An early project was to develop software standards on management control protocols. And software was and still is a maddeningly hard to control activity  so that was enormously valuable. We used the standards ourselves  we were even paid to update  them over the years  and eventually  they were adopted by NATO. Our programmers    remember  only women  including gay and transgender    worked with pencil and paper to develop flowcharts defining each task to be done. And they then wrote code   usually machine code  sometimes binary code  which was then sent by mail to a data center to be punched onto paper tape or card and then re punched   in order to verify it. All this  before it ever got near a computer. That was programming in the early     s. In          years from startup  equal opportunity legislation  came in in Britain and that made it illegal to have  our pro female policies. And as an example of  unintended consequences  my female company had to let the men in. When I started my company of women  the men said   How interesting  because it only works because it's small.  And later  as it became sizable   they accepted   Yes  it is sizable now  but of no strategic interest.  And later  when it was a company valued at over three billion dollars  and I'd made    of the staff  into millionaires  they sort of said   Well done  Steve   You can always tell ambitious women by the shape of our heads  They're flat on top for being  patted patronizingly. And we have larger feet to stand away from the kitchen sink. Let me share with you  two secrets of success  Surround yourself with first class people and people that you like  and choose your partner very  very carefully. Because the other day when I said    My husband's an angel   a woman complained     You're lucky   she said   mine's still alive.  If success were easy   we'd all be millionaires. But in my case  it came in the midst of family trauma and indeed  crisis. Our late son  Giles  was an only child  a beautiful  contented baby. And then  at two and a half  like a changeling in a fairy story  he lost the little speech that he had and turned into a wild   unmanageable toddler. Not the terrible twos  he was profoundly autistic  and he never spoke again. Giles was the first resident in the first house of the first charity that I set up to pioneer services for autism. And then there's been a groundbreaking Prior's Court school for pupils with autism and a medical research charity  again  all for autism. Because whenever I found a gap in services  I tried to help. I like doing new things  and making new things happen. And I've just started a three year  think tank for autism. And so that some of my wealth does go back to the industry from which it stems  I've also founded  the Oxford Internet Institute and other IT ventures. The Oxford Internet Institute focuses not on the technology  but on the social  economic  legal and ethical issues of the Internet. Giles died unexpectedly    years ago now. And I have learned to live without him  and I have learned to live  without his need of me. Philanthropy is all that I do now. I need never worry about getting lost because several charities would quickly come and find me. It's one thing to have an idea  for an enterprise  but as many people in this room will know  making it happen is a very difficult thing and it demands extraordinary energy  self belief and determination  the courage to risk family and home  and a      commitment  that borders on the obsessive. So it's just as well that I'm a workaholic. I believe in the beauty of work when we do it properly and in humility. Work is not just something I do when I'd rather be doing something else. We live our lives forward. So what has all that taught me  I learned that tomorrow's  never going to be like today  and certainly nothing like yesterday. And that made me able to cope with change  indeed  eventually to welcome change  though I'm told I'm still very difficult. Thank you very much. I'd like to tell you a story about death and architecture. A hundred years ago  we tended to die of infectious diseases like pneumonia  that  if they took hold  would take us away quite quickly. We tended to die at home  in our own beds  looked after by family  although that was the default option because a lot of people lacked access to medical care. And then in the   th century a lot of things changed. We developed new medicines like penicillin so we could treat those infectious diseases. New medical technologies like x ray machines were invented. And because they were so big and expensive  we needed large  centralized buildings to keep them in  and they became our modern hospitals. After the Second World War  a lot of countries set up  universal healthcare systems so that everyone who needed treatment could get it. The result was that lifespans extended from about    at the start of the century to almost double that today. The   th century was this time of huge  optimism about what science could offer  but with all of the focus on life  death was forgotten  even as our approach to death changed dramatically. Now  I'm an architect  and for the past year and a half I've been looking at these changes and at what they mean for architecture related to death and dying. We now tend to die of cancer and heart disease  and what that means is that many of us will have a long period of chronic illness at the end of our lives. During that period  we'll likely spend a lot of time  in hospitals and hospices and care homes. Now  we've all been in a modern hospital. You know those fluorescent lights and the endless corridors and those rows of uncomfortable chairs. Hospital architecture has earned its bad reputation. But the surprising thing is  it wasn't always like this. This is L'Ospedale degli Innocenti  built in      by Brunelleschi  who was one of the most famous and influential architects of his time. And when I look at this building and then think about hospitals today  what amazes me is this building's ambition. It's just a really great building. It has these courtyards in the middle so that all of the rooms have daylight and fresh air  and the rooms are big and they have high ceilings  so they just feel more comfortable to be in. And it's also beautiful. Somehow  we've forgotten that that's even possible for a hospital. Now  if we want better buildings for dying  then we have to talk about it  but because we find the subject of death uncomfortable  we don't talk about it  and we don't question how we as a society approach death. One of the things that surprised me most in my research  though  is how changeable attitudes actually are. This is the first crematorium in the U.K.  which was built in Woking in the     s. And when this was first built  there were protests in the local village. Cremation wasn't socially acceptable  and   .  percent of people got buried. And yet  only a hundred years later  three quarters of us get cremated. People are actually really open to changing things if they're given the chance to talk about them. So this conversation about death and architecture was what I wanted to start when I did my first exhibition on it in Venice in June  which was called  Death in Venice.  It was designed to be quite playful so that people would literally engage with it. This is one of our exhibits  which is an interactive map of London that shows just how much of the real estate in the city is given over to death and dying  and as you wave your hand across the map  the name of that piece of real estate  the building or cemetery  is revealed. Another of our exhibits was a series of postcards that people could take away with them. And they showed people's homes and hospitals and cemeteries and mortuaries  and they tell the story of the different spaces that we pass through on either side of death. We wanted to show that where we die is a key part of how we die. Now  the strangest thing was the way that visitors reacted to the exhibition  especially the audio visual works. We had people dancing and running and jumping as they tried to activate the exhibits in different ways  and at a certain point they would kind of stop and remember that they were in an exhibition about death  and that maybe that's not how you're supposed to act. But actually  I would question whether there is one way that you're supposed to act around death  and if there's not  I'd ask you to think about what you think a good death is  and what you think that architecture that supports a good death might be like  and mightn't it be a little less like this and a little more like this  Thank you. I was born with bilateral retinoblastoma  retinal cancer. My right eye was removed at seven months of age. I was    months when they removed my left eye. The first thing I did upon awakening from that last surgery was to climb out of my crib and begin wandering around the intensive care nursery  probably looking for the one who did this to me. Evidently  wandering around the nursery was not a problem for me without eyes. The problem was getting caught. It's impressions about blindness that are far more threatening to blind people than the blindness itself. Think for a moment about your own impressions of blindness. Think about your reactions when I first came onto the stage  or the prospect of your own blindness  or a loved one going blind. The terror is incomprehensible to most of us  because blindness is thought to epitomize ignorance and unawareness  hapless exposure to the ravages of the dark unknown. How poetic. Fortunately for me  my parents were not poetic. They were pragmatic. They understood that ignorance and fear were but matters of the mind  and the mind is adaptable. They believed that I should grow up to enjoy the same freedoms and responsibilities as everyone else. In their own words  I would move out    which I did when I was       I will pay taxes    thanks     Laughter     and they knew the difference between love and fear. Fear immobilizes us in the face of challenge. They knew that blindness would pose a significant challenge. I was not raised with fear. They put my freedom first before all else  because that is what love does. Now  moving forward  how do I manage today  The world is a much larger nursery. Fortunately  I have my trusty long cane  longer than the canes used by most blind people. I call it my freedom staff. It will keep me  for example  from making an undignified  departure from the stage.  Laughter  I do see that cliff edge. They warned us earlier that every imaginable mishap has occurred to speakers up here on the stage. I don't care to set a new precedent. But beyond that  many of you may have heard me clicking as I came onto the stage    with my tongue. Those are flashes of sound that go out and reflect from surfaces all around me  just like a bat's sonar  and return to me with patterns   with pieces of information  much as light does for you. And my brain  thanks to my parents  has been activated to form images in my visual cortex  which we now call the imaging system  from those patterns of information  much as your brain does. I call this process flash sonar. It is how I have learned to see through my blindness  to navigate my journey through the dark unknowns of my own challenges  which has earned me the moniker  the remarkable Batman.  Now  Batman I will accept. Bats are cool. Batman is cool. But I was not raised to think of myself as in any way remarkable. I have always regarded myself much like anyone else who navigates the dark unknowns of their own challenges. Is that so remarkable  I do not use my eyes  I use my brain. Now  someone  somewhere  must think that's remarkable  or I wouldn't be up here  but let's consider this for a moment. Everyone out there who faces or who has ever faced a challenge  raise your hands. Whoosh. Okay. Lots of hands going up  a moment  let me do a head count. This will take a while.  Clicking   Laughter  Okay  lots of hands in the air. Keep them up. I have an idea. Those of you who use your brains to navigate these challenges  put your hands down. Okay  anyone with your hands still up has challenges of your own.  Laughter  So we all face challenges  and we all face the dark unknown  which is endemic to most challenges  which is what most of us fear  okay  But we all have brains that allow us  that activate to allow us to navigate the journey through these challenges. Okay  Case in point  I came up here and     Clicking     they wouldn't tell me where the lectern was. So you can't trust those TED folks.  Find it yourself   they said. So     Laughter  And the feedback for the P.A. system is no help at all. So now I present to you a challenge. So if you'd all close your eyes for just a moment  okay  And you're going to learn a bit of flash sonar. I'm going to make a sound. I'm going to hold this panel in front  of me  but I'm not going to move it. Just listen to the sound for a moment. Shhhhhhhhhh. Okay  nothing very interesting. Now  listen to what happens to that same exact sound when I move the panel. Shhhhhhhhhhh.   Pitch getting higher and lower  You do not know the power of the dark side. I couldn't resist. Okay  now keep your eyes closed because  did you hear the difference  Okay. Now  let's be sure. For your challenge  you tell me  just say  now  when you hear the panel start to move. Okay  We'll relax into this. Shhhhhhh. Audience  Now. Daniel Kish  Good. Excellent. Open your eyes. All right. So just a few centimeters  you would notice the difference. You've experienced sonar. You'd all make great blind people.  Laughter  Let's have a look at what can happen when this activation process is given some time and attention. and we can see with our ears. Brian Bushway  It's not a matter of enjoying it more or less  it's about enjoying it differently. Shawn Marsolais  It goes across. DK  Yeah. SM  And then it's gradually coming back down again. DK  Yes  SM  That's amazing. I can  like  see the car. Holy mother  J. Louchart  I love being blind. If I had the opportunity  honestly  I wouldn't go back to being sighted. JR  The bigger the goal  the more obstacles you'll face  and on the other side of that goal is victory.  In Italian  DK  Now  do these people look terrified  Not so much. We have delivered activation training to tens of thousands of blind and sighted people from all backgrounds in nearly    countries. When blind people learn to see  sighted people seem inspired to want to learn to see their way better  more clearly  with less fear  because this exemplifies the immense capacity within us all to navigate any type of challenge  through any form of darkness  to discoveries unimagined when we are activated. I wish you all a most activating journey. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Daniel  my friend. As I know you can see  it's a spectacular standing ovation at TED. Thank you for an extraordinary talk. Just one more question about your world  your inner world that you construct. We think that we have things in our world that you as a blind person don't have  but what's your world like  What do you have that we don't have  DK  Three hundred and sixty degree view  so my sonar works about as well behind me as it does in front of me. It works around corners. It works through surfaces. Generally  it's kind of a fuzzy three dimensional geometry. One of my students  who has now become an instructor  when he lost his vision  after a few months he was sitting in his three story house and he realized that he could hear everything going on throughout the house  conversations  people in the kitchen  people in the bathroom  several floors away  several walls away. He said it was something like having x ray vision. CA  What do you picture that you're in right now  How do you picture this theater  DK  Lots of loudspeakers  quite frankly. It's interesting.  When people make a sound  when they laugh  when they fidget  when they take a drink or blow their nose or whatever  I hear everything. I hear every little movement that every single person makes. None of it really escapes my attention  and then  from a sonar perspective  the size of the room  the curvature  of the audience around the stage  it's the height of the room. Like I say  it's all that kind  of three dimensional surface geometry all around me. CA  Well  Daniel  you have done a spectacular job of helping us all see the world in a different way. Thanks so much for that  truly. DK  Thank you. G'day  my name's Kevin. I'm from Australia. I'm here to help. Tonight  I want to talk about a tale of two cities. One of those cities is called Washington  and the other is called Beijing. Because how these two capitals shape their future and the future of the United States and the future of China doesn't just affect those two countries  it affects all of us in ways  perhaps  we've never thought of  the air we breathe  the water we drink  the fish we eat  the quality of our oceans  the languages we speak in the future  the jobs we have  the political systems we choose  and  of course  the great questions of war and peace. You see that bloke  He's French. His name is Napoleon. A couple of hundred years ago  he made this extraordinary projection   China is a sleeping lion  and when she awakes  the world will shake.  Napoleon got a few things wrong  he got this one absolutely right. Because China is today not just woken up  China has stood up and China is on the march  and the question for us all is where will China go and how do we engage this giant of the   st century  You start looking at the numbers  they start to confront you in a big way. It's projected that China will become  by whichever measure    PPP  market exchange rates    the largest economy in the world over the course of the decade ahead. They're already the largest trading nation  already the largest exporting nation  already the largest manufacturing nation  and they're also the biggest emitters of carbon in the world. America comes second. So if China does become the world's largest economy  think about this  It'll be the first time since this guy was on the throne of England    George III  not a good friend of Napoleon's    that in the world we will have as the largest economy a non English speaking country  a non Western country  a non liberal democratic country. And if you don't think that's going to affect the way in which the world happens in the future  then personally  I think you've been smoking something  and it doesn't mean you're from Colorado. So in short  the question we have tonight is  how do we understand this mega change  which I believe to be the biggest change for the first half of the   st century  It'll affect so many things. It will go to the absolute core. It's happening quietly. It's happening persistently. It's happening in some senses under the radar  as we are all preoccupied with what's going in Ukraine  what's going on in the Middle East  what's going on with ISIS  what's going on with ISIL  what's happening with the future of our economies. This is a slow and quiet revolution. And with a mega change comes also a mega challenge  and the mega challenge is this  Can these two great countries  China and the United States    China  the Middle Kingdom  and the United States  M igu     which in Chinese  by the way  means  the beautiful country.  Think about that    that's the name that China has given this country for more than a hundred years. Whether these two great civilizations  these two great countries  can in fact carve out a common future for themselves and for the world  In short  can we carve out a future which is peaceful and mutually prosperous  or are we looking at a great challenge of war or peace  And I have    minutes to work through war or peace  which is a little less time than they gave this guy to write a book called  War and Peace.  People ask me  why is it that a kid growing up in rural Australia got interested in learning Chinese  Well  there are two reasons for that. Here's the first of them. That's Betsy the cow. Now  Betsy the cow was one of a herd of dairy cattle that I grew up with on a farm in rural Australia. See those hands there  These are not built for farming. So very early on  I discovered that in fact  working in a farm was not designed for me  and China was a very safe remove from any career in Australian farm life. Here's the second reason. That's my mom. Anyone here ever listen to what their mom told them to do  Everyone ever do what their mom told them to do  I rarely did  but what my mom said to me was  one day  she handed me a newspaper  a headline which said  here we have a huge change. And that change is China entering the United Nations.       I had just turned    years of age  and she handed me this headline. And she said   Understand this   learn this  because it's going to affect your future.  So being a very good student of history  I decided that the best thing for me to do was  in fact  to go off and learn Chinese. The great thing about learning Chinese is that your Chinese teacher gives you a new name. And so they gave me this name  K   which means to overcome or to conquer  and W n  and that's the character for literature or the arts. K  W n  Conqueror of the Classics. Any of you guys called  Kevin   It's a major lift from being called Kevin to be called Conqueror of the Classics. I've been called Kevin all my life. Have you been called Kevin all your life  Would you prefer to be called Conqueror of the Classics  And so I went off after that and joined the Australian Foreign Service  but here is where pride    before pride  there always comes a fall. So there I am in the embassy in Beijing  off to the Great Hall of the People with our ambassador  who had asked me to interpret for his first meeting in the Great Hall of the People. And so there was I. If you've been to a Chinese meeting  it's a giant horseshoe. At the head of the horsehoe are the really serious pooh bahs  and down the end of the horseshoe are the not so serious pooh bahs  the junior woodchucks like me. And so the ambassador began with this inelegant phrase. He said   China and Australia are currently enjoying a relationship of unprecedented closeness.  And I thought to myself   That sounds clumsy. That sounds odd. I will improve it.  Note to file  Never do that. It needed to be a little more elegant  a little more classical  so I rendered it as follows.  In Chinese  There was a big pause on the other side of the room. You could see the giant pooh bahs at the head of the horseshoe  the blood visibly draining from their faces  and the junior woodchucks at the other end of the horseshoe engaged in peals of  unrestrained laughter. Because when I rendered his sentence   Australia and China are  enjoying a relationship of unprecedented closeness   in fact  what I said was that Australia and China were now experiencing fantastic orgasm. That was the last time I was asked to interpret. But in that little story  there's a wisdom  which is  as soon as you think you know something about this extraordinary civilization of       years of continuing history  there's always something new to learn. History is against us when it comes to the U.S. and China forging a common future together. This guy up here  He's not Chinese and he's not American. He's Greek. His name's Thucydides. He wrote the history of the Peloponnesian Wars. And he made this extraordinary observation about Athens and Sparta.  It was the rise of Athens and the fear that this inspired in Sparta that made war inevitable.  And hence  a whole literature about something called the Thucydides Trap. This guy here  He's not American and he's not Greek. He's Chinese. His name is Sun Tzu. He wrote  The Art of War   and if you see his statement underneath  it's along these lines   Attack him where he is unprepared  appear where you are not expected.  Not looking good so far for China and the United States. This guy is an American. His name's Graham Allison. In fact  he's a teacher at the Kennedy School over there in Boston. He's working on a single project at the moment  which is  does the Thucydides Trap about the inevitably of war between rising powers and established great powers apply to the future of China U.S. relations  It's a core question. And what Graham has done is explore    cases in history since the     s to establish what the precedents are. And in    out of    of them  let me tell you  they've ended in catastrophic war. You may say   But Kevin    or Conqueror of the Classics    that was the past. We live now in a world of interdependence and globalization. It could never happen again.  Guess what  The economic historians tell us that in fact  the time which we reached the greatest point of economic integration and globalization was in       just before that happened  World War I  a sobering reflection from history. So if we are engaged in this great question of how China thinks  feels  and positions itself towards the United States  and the reverse  how do we get to the baseline of how these two countries and civilizations can possibly work together  Let me first go to  in fact  China's views of the U.S. and the rest of the West. Number one  China feels as if it's been humiliated at the hands of the West through a hundred years of history  beginning with the Opium Wars. When after that  the Western powers carved China up into little pieces  so that by the time it got to the '  s and '  s  signs like this one appeared on the streets of Shanghai.   No dogs and Chinese allowed   How would you feel if you were Chinese  in your own country   if you saw that sign appear  China also believes and feels as if  in the events of       at the Peace Conference in Paris  when Germany's colonies were given back to all sorts of countries around in the world  what about German colonies in China  They were  in fact  given to Japan. When Japan then invaded China in the     s the world looked away and was indifferent to what would happen to China. And then  on top of that  the Chinese to this day believe that the United States and the West do not accept the legitimacy of their political system because it's so radically different from those of us who come from liberal democracies  and believe that the United States to this day is seeking to undermine their political system. China also believes that it is being contained by U.S. allies and by those with strategic partnerships with the U.S. right around its periphery. And beyond all that  the Chinese have this feeling in their heart of hearts and in their gut of guts that those of us in the collective West are just too damned arrogant. That is  we don't recognize the problems in our own system  in our politics and our economics  and are very quick to point the finger elsewhere  and believe that  in fact  we in the collective West are guilty of a great bunch of hypocrisy. Of course  in international relations  it's not just the sound of one hand clapping. There's another country too  and that's called the U.S. So how does the U.S. respond to all of the above  The U.S. has a response to each of those. On the question of is the U.S. containing China  they say   No  look at the history of the Soviet Union. That was containment.  Instead  what we have done in the U.S. and the West is welcome China into the global economy  and on top of that  welcome them into the World Trade Organization. The U.S. and the West say China cheats on the question of intellectual property rights  and through cyberattacks on U.S. and global firms. Furthermore  the United States says that the Chinese political system is fundamentally wrong because it's at such fundamental variance to the human rights  democracy  and rule of law that we enjoy in the U.S. and the collective West. And on top of all the above  what does the United States say  That they fear that China will  when it has sufficient power  establish a sphere of influence in Southeast Asia and wider East Asia  boot the United States out  and in time  when it's powerful enough  unilaterally seek to change the rules of the global order. So apart from all of that  it's just fine and dandy  the U.S. China relationship. No real problems there. The challenge  though  is given those deep rooted feelings  those deep rooted emotions and thought patterns  what the Chinese call  S w i   ways of thinking  how can we craft a basis for a common future between these two  I argue simply this  We can do it on the basis on a framework of constructive realism for a common purpose. What do I mean by that  Be realistic about the things that we disagree on  and a management approach that doesn't enable any one of those differences to break into war or conflict until we've acquired the diplomatic skills to solve them. Be constructive in areas of the bilateral  regional and global engagement between the two  which will make a difference for all of humankind. Build a regional institution capable of cooperation in Asia  an Asia Pacific community. And worldwide  act further  like you've begun to do at the end of last year by striking out against climate change with hands joined together rather than fists apart. Of course  all that happens if you've got a common mechanism and political will to achieve the above. These things are deliverable. But the question is  are they deliverable alone  This is what our head tells us we need to do  but what about our heart  I have a little experience in the question back home of how you try to bring together two peoples who  frankly  haven't had a whole lot in common in the past. And that's when I apologized to Australia's indigenous peoples. This was a day of reckoning in the Australian government  the Australian parliament  and for the Australian people. After     years of unbridled abuse towards the first Australians  it was high time that we white folks said we were sorry. The important thing    The important thing that I remember is staring in the faces of all those from Aboriginal Australia as they came to listen to this apology. It was extraordinary to see  for example  old women telling me the stories of when they were five years old and literally ripped away from their parents  like this lady here. It was extraordinary for me to then be able to embrace and to kiss Aboriginal elders as they came into the parliament building  and one woman said to me  it's the first time a white fella had ever kissed her in her life  and she was over   . That's a terrible story. And then I remember this family saying to me   You know  we drove all the way from the far North down to Canberra to come to this thing  drove our way through redneck country. On the way back  stopped at a cafe after the apology for a milkshake.  And they walked into this cafe quietly  tentatively  gingerly  a little anxious. I think you know what I'm talking about. But the day after the apology  what happened  Everyone in that cafe  every one of the white folks  stood up and applauded. Something had happened in the hearts of these people in Australia. The white folks  our Aboriginal brothers and sisters  and we haven't solved all these problems together  but let me tell you  there was a new beginning because we had gone not just to the head  we'd gone also to the heart. So where does that conclude in terms of the great question that we've been asked to address this evening  which is the future of U.S. China relations  The head says there's a way forward. The head says there is a policy framework  there's a common narrative  there's a mechanism through regular summitry to do these things and to make them better. But the heart must also find a way to reimagine the possibilities of the America China relationship  and the possibilities of China's future engagement in the world. Sometimes  folks  we just need to take a leap of faith not quite knowing where we might land. In China  they now talk about the Chinese Dream. In America  we're all familiar with the term  the American Dream.  I think it's time  across the world  that we're able to think also of something we might also call a dream for all humankind. Because if we do that  we might just change the way that we think about each other.  In Chinese  That's my challenge to America. That's my challenge to China. That's my challenge to all of us  but I think where there's a will and where there is imagination we can turn this into a future driven by peace and prosperity and not once again repeat the tragedies of war. I thank you. Chris Anderson  Thanks so much for that. Thanks so much for that. It feels like you yourself have a role to play in this bridging. You  in a way  are uniquely placed to speak to both sides. Kevin Rudd  Well  what we Australians do best is organize the drinks  so you get them together in one room  and we suggest this and suggest that  then we go and get the drinks. But no  look  for all of us who are friends of these two great countries  America and China  you can do something. You can make a practical contribution  and for all you good folks here  next time you meet someone from China  sit down and have a conversation. See what you can find out about where they come from and what they think  and my challenge for all the Chinese folks who are going to watch this TED Talk at some time is do the same. Two of us seeking to change the world can actually make a huge difference. Those of us up the middle  we can make a small contribution. CA  Kevin  all power to you  my friend. Thank you. KR  Thank you. Thank you  folks. People back home call me a heckler  a troublemaker  an irritant  a rebel  an activist  the voice of the people. But that wasn't always me. Growing up  I had a nickname. They used to call me Softy  meaning the soft  harmless boy. Like every other human being  I avoided trouble. In my childhood  they taught me silence. Don't argue  do as you're told. In Sunday school  they taught me don't confront  don't argue  even if you're right  turn the other cheek. This was reinforced by the political climate of the time. Kenya is a country where you are guilty until proven rich. Kenya's poor are five times more likely to be shot dead by the police who are meant to protect them than by criminals. This was reinforced by the political climate of the day. We had a president  Moi  who was a dictator. He ruled the country with an iron fist  and anyone who dared question his authority was arrested  tortured  jailed or even killed. That meant that people were taught to be smart cowards  stay out of trouble. Being a coward was not an insult. Being a coward was a compliment. We used to be told that a coward goes home to his mother. What that meant  that if you stayed out of trouble you're going to stay alive. I used to question this advice  and eight years ago we had an election in Kenya  and the results were violently disputed. What followed that election was terrible violence  rape  and the killing of over       people. My work was to document the violence. As a photographer  I took thousands of images  and after two months  the two politicians came together  had a cup of tea  signed a peace agreement  and the country moved on. I was a very disturbed man because I saw the violence firsthand. I saw the killings. I saw the displacement. I met women who had been raped  and it disturbed me  but the country never spoke about it. We pretended. We all became smart cowards. We decided to stay out of trouble and not talk about it. Ten months later  I quit my job. I said I could not stand it anymore. After quitting my job  I decided to organize my friends to speak about the violence in the country  to speak about the state of the nation  and June         was the day that we were meant to go to the stadium and try and get the president's attention. It's a national holiday  it's broadcast across the country  and I showed up at the stadium. My friends did not show up. I found myself alone  and I didn't know what to do. I was scared  but I knew very well that that particular day  I had to make a decision. Was I able to live as a coward  like everyone else  or was I going to make a stand  And when the president stood up to speak  I found myself on my feet shouting at the president  telling him to remember the post election violence victims  to stop the corruption. And suddenly  out of nowhere  the police pounced on me like hungry lions. They held my mouth and dragged me out of the stadium  where they thoroughly beat me up and locked me up in jail. I spent that night in a cold cement floor in the jail  and that got me thinking. What was making me feel this way  My friends and family thought I was crazy because of what I did  and the images that I took were disturbing my life. The images that I took were just a number to many Kenyans. Most Kenyans did not see the violence. It was a story to them. And so I decided to actually start a street exhibition to show the images of the violence across the country and get people talking about it. We traveled the country and showed the images  and this was a journey that has started me to the activist path  where I decided to become silent no more  to talk about those things. We traveled  and our general site from our street exhibit became for political graffiti about the situation in the country  talking about corruption  bad leadership. We have even done symbolic burials. We have delivered live pigs to Kenya's parliament as a symbol of our politicians' greed. It has been done in Uganda and other countries  and what is most powerful is that the images have been picked by the media and amplified across the country  across the continent. Where I used to stand up alone seven years ago  now I belong to a community of many people who stand up with me. I am no longer alone when I stand up to speak about these things. I belong to a group of young people who are passionate about the country  who want to bring about change  and they're no longer afraid  and they're no longer smart cowards. So that was my story. That day in the stadium  I stood up as a smart coward. By that one action  I said goodbye to the    years living as a coward. There are two most powerful days in your life  the day you're born  and the day you discover why. That day standing up in that stadium shouting at the President  I discovered why I was truly born  that I would no longer be silent in the face of injustice. Do you know why you were born  Thank you. Tom Rielly  It's an amazing story. I just want to ask you a couple quick questions. So PAWA     you've created a studio  a place where young people can go and harness the power of digital media to do some of this action. What's happening now with PAWA  Boniface Mwangi  So we have  this community of filmmakers  graffiti artists  musicians  and when there's an issue in the country  we come together  we brainstorm  and take up on that issue. So our most powerful tool is art  because we live in a very busy world where people are so busy in their life  and they don't have time to read. So we package our activism and we package our message in art. So from the music  the graffiti   the art  that's what we do. Can I say one more thing  TR  Yeah  of course.  Applause  BM  In spite of being arrested  beaten up  threatened  the moment I discovered my voice  that I could actually stand up for what I really believed in  I'm no longer afraid. I used to be called softy  but I'm no longer softy  because I discovered who I really am  as in  that's what I want to do  and there's such beauty in doing that. There's nothing as powerful as that  knowing that I'm meant to do this  because you don't get scared  you just continue living your life. Thank you. When I was a kid  the disaster we worried about most  was a nuclear war. That's why we had a barrel like this down in our basement  filled with cans of food and water. When the nuclear attack came  we were supposed to go downstairs  hunker down  and eat out of that barrel. Today the greatest risk  of global catastrophe doesn't look like this. Instead  it looks like this. If anything kills over    million people in the next few decades  it's most likely to be  a highly infectious virus rather than a war. Not missiles  but microbes. Now  part of the reason for this is that we've invested a huge amount in nuclear deterrents. But we've actually invested very little  in a system to stop an epidemic. We're not ready for the next epidemic. Let's look at Ebola. I'm sure all of you read about it  in the newspaper  lots of tough challenges. I followed it carefully  through the case analysis tools we use to track polio eradication. And as you look at what went on  the problem wasn't that there was a system that didn't work well enough  the problem was that we  didn't have a system at all. In fact  there's some pretty obvious key missing pieces. We didn't have a group of epidemiologists  ready to go  who would have gone  seen what the disease was  seen how far it had spread. The case reports came in on paper. It was very delayed before they were put online and they were extremely inaccurate. We didn't have a medical team ready to go. We didn't have a way of preparing people. Now  M decins Sans Fronti res  did a great job orchestrating volunteers. But even so  we were far slower than we should have been getting the thousands of workers into these countries. And a large epidemic would require us to have hundreds of thousands of workers. There was no one there  to look at treatment approaches. No one to look at the diagnostics. No one to figure out  what tools should be used. As an example  we could have  taken the blood of survivors  processed it  and put that plasma back in people to protect them. But that was never tried. So there was a lot that was missing. And these things  are really a global failure. The WHO is funded to monitor epidemics  but not to do these things I talked about. Now  in the movies it's quite different. There's a group of handsome epidemiologists ready to go  they move in  they save the day  but that's just pure Hollywood. The failure to prepare  could allow the next epidemic to be dramatically  more devastating than Ebola Let's look at the progression  of Ebola over this year. About        people died  and nearly all were in the three West African countries. There's three reasons why it didn't spread more. The first is that there was a lot  of heroic work by the health workers. They found the people and they  prevented more infections. The second is the nature of the virus. Ebola does not spread through the air. And by the time you're contagious  most people are so sick  that they're bedridden. Third  it didn't get into many urban areas. And that was just luck. If it had gotten into a lot  more urban areas  the case numbers  would have been much larger. So next time  we might not be so lucky. You can have a virus where people  feel well enough while they're infectious that they get on a plane or they go to a market. The source of the virus could be  a natural epidemic like Ebola  or it could be bioterrorism. So there are things that would literally make things a thousand times worse. In fact  let's look at a model of a virus spread through the air  like the Spanish Flu back in     . So here's what would happen  It would spread throughout the world very  very quickly. And you can see over    million people died from that epidemic. So this is a serious problem. We should be concerned. But in fact  we can build a really good response system. We have the benefits of all the science and technology that we talk about here. We've got cell phones to get information from the public  and get information out to them. We have satellite maps where we can see where people are and where they're moving. We have advances in biology that should dramatically change  the turnaround time to look at a pathogen and be able to make drugs and vaccines that fit for that pathogen. So we can have tools  but those tools need to be put into an overall global health system. And we need preparedness. The best lessons  I think   on how to get prepared are again  what we do for war. For soldiers  we have full time  waiting to go. We have reserves that can scale  us up to large numbers. NATO has a mobile unit  that can deploy very rapidly. NATO does a lot of war games  to check  are people well trained  Do they understand  about fuel and logistics and the same radio frequencies  So they are absolutely ready to go. So those are the kinds of things we need to deal with an epidemic. What are the key pieces  First  we need strong health systems in poor countries. That's where mothers  can give birth safely  kids can get all their vaccines. But  also where we'll see  the outbreak very early on. We need a medical reserve corps  lots of people who've got  the training and background who are ready to go  with the expertise. And then we need to pair those medical people with the military. taking advantage of the military's ability to move fast  do logistics and secure areas. We need to do simulations  germ games  not war games  so that we see where the holes are. The last time a germ game  was done in the United States was back in        and it didn't go so well. So far the score is germs     people   . Finally  we need lots of advanced R D in areas of vaccines and diagnostics. There are some big breakthroughs   like the Adeno associated virus  that could work very  very quickly. Now I don't have an exact budget for what this would cost  but I'm quite sure it's very modest compared to the potential harm. The World Bank estimates that  if we have a worldwide flu epidemic  global wealth will go down by over three trillion dollars and we'd have millions and millions of deaths. These investments  offer significant benefits beyond just being ready for the epidemic. The primary healthcare  the R D  those things would reduce  global health equity and make the world more just  as well as more safe. So I think this should absolutely be a priority. There's no need to panic. We don't have to hoard cans of spaghetti or go down into the basement. But we need to get going  because time is not on our side. In fact  if there's one positive thing that can come out of the Ebola epidemic  it's that it can serve as an early  warning  a wake up call  to get ready. If we start now  we can be ready  for the next epidemic. Thank you. I dedicated the past two years  to understanding how people achieve their dreams. When we think about the dreams we have  and the dent we want to leave in the universe  it is striking to see how big  of an overlap there is between the dreams that we have  and projects that never happen. So I'm here to talk to you today about five ways how not  to follow your dreams. One  Believe in overnight success. You know the story  right  The tech guy built a mobile app  and sold it very fast for a lot of money. You know  the story may seem real  but I bet it's incomplete. If you go investigate further  the guy has done    apps before and he has done a master's on the topic  a Ph.D. He has been working on the topic for    years. This is really interesting  I myself have a story in Brazil  that people think is an overnight success. I come from a humble family  and two weeks before  the deadline to apply to MIT  I started the application process. And  voila  I got in. People may think it's  an overnight success  but that only worked because  for the    years prior to that  I took life and education seriously. Your overnight success story is always a result of everything you've done in your  life through that moment. Two  Believe someone else  has the answers for you. Constantly  people want  to help out  right  All sorts of people  your family  your friends  your business partners  they all have opinions  on which path you should take   And let me tell you   go through this pipe.  But whenever you go inside  there are  other ways you have to pick as well. And you need to make  those decisions yourself. No one else has the perfect answers for your life. And you need to keep picking those decisions  right  The pipes are infinite and  you're going to bump your head  and it's a part of the process. Three  and it's very subtle  but very important  Decide to settle when  growth is guaranteed. So when your life is going great  you have put together a great team  and you have growing revenue  and everything is set    time to settle. When I launched my first book  I worked really  really hard to  distribute it everywhere in Brazil. With that  over three million  people downloaded it  over        people  bought physical copies. When I wrote a sequel   some impact was guaranteed. Even if I did little  sales would be okay. But okay is never okay. When you're growing towards a peak  you need to work harder than ever  and find yourself another peak. Maybe if I did little  a couple hundred thousand people would read it  and that's great already. But if I work harder than ever  I can bring this number up to millions. That's why I decided  with my new book  to go to every single state of Brazil. And I can already see a higher peak. There's no time to settle down. Fourth tip  and that's really important  Believe the fault is someone else's. I constantly see people saying   Yes  I had this great idea  but no investor had the vision to invest.   Oh  I created this great product  but the market is so bad  the sales didn't go well.  Or   I can't find good talent  my team is so below expectations.  If you have dreams  it's your responsibility  to make them happen. Yes  it may be hard to find talent. Yes  the market may be bad. But if no one invested in your idea  if no one bought your product  for sure  there is something  there that is your fault. Definitely. You need to get your dreams and make them happen. And no one achieved their goals alone. But if you didn't make them happen   it's your fault and no one else's. Be responsible for your dreams. And one last tip  and this one is  really important as well  Believe that the only things that matter are the dreams themselves. Once I saw an ad   and it was a lot of friends  they were going up a mountain  it was a very high mountain  and it was a lot of work. You could see that they  were sweating and this was tough. And they were going up   and they finally made it to the peak. Of course  they decided to celebrate  right  I'm going to celebrate  so   Yes  We made it  we're at the top   Two seconds later  one looks at the other and says   Okay  let's go down.  Life is never about the goals themselves. Life is about the journey. Yes  you should enjoy  the goals themselves  but people think that you have dreams  and whenever you get to reaching one of those dreams  it's a magical place where  happiness will be all around. But achieving a dream  is a momentary sensation  and your life is not. The only way to really achieve  all of your dreams is to fully enjoy every step  of your journey. That's the best way. And your journey is simple    it's made of steps. Some steps will be right on. Sometimes you will trip. If it's right on  celebrate  because some people wait a lot to celebrate. And if you tripped  turn that into something to learn. If every step becomes something to learn or something to celebrate  you will for sure enjoy the journey. So  five tips  Believe in overnight success  believe someone else  has the answers for you  believe that when growth is guaranteed   you should settle down  believe the fault is someone else's  and believe that only  the goals themselves matter. Believe me  if you do that   you will destroy your dreams. Thank you. Imagine you're in a bar  or a club  and you start talking  and after a while  the question comes up   So  what do you do for work   And since you think your job is interesting  you say   I'm a mathematician.   Laughter  And inevitably  during that conversation one of these two phrases come up  A   I was terrible at math  but it wasn't my fault. It's because the teacher was awful.   Laughter  Or B   But what is math really for   I'll now address Case B. When someone asks you what math is for  they're not asking you about applications of mathematical science. They're asking you  why did I have to study that bullshit I never used in my life again   Laughter  That's what they're actually asking. So when mathematicians are asked what math is for  they tend to fall into two groups    .   percent of mathematicians will assume an attacking position  and   .   percent of mathematicians will take a defensive position. There's a strange  .  percent  among which I include myself. Who are the ones that attack  The attacking ones are mathematicians who would tell you this question makes no sense  because mathematics have a meaning all their own    a beautiful edifice with its own logic    and that there's no point in constantly searching for all possible applications. What's the use of poetry  What's the use of love  What's the use of life itself   What kind of question is that  Hardy  for instance  was a model of this type of attack. And those who stand in defense tell you   Even if you don't realize it  friend  math is behind everything.  Those guys  they always bring up bridges and computers.  If you don't know math  your bridge will collapse.  It's true  computers are all about math. And now these guys have also started saying that behind information security and credit cards are prime numbers. These are the answers your math teacher would give you if you asked him. He's one of the defensive ones. Okay  but who's right then  Those who say that math doesn't need to have a purpose  or those who say that math is behind everything we do  Actually  both are right. But remember I told you I belong to that strange  .  percent claiming something else  So  go ahead  ask me what math is for. Audience  What is math for  Eduardo S enz de Cabez n  Okay    .   percent of you asked the question    .   percent didn't say anything  and the  .  percent    I'm not sure what those guys are doing. Well  to my dear   .   percent    it's true that math doesn't need to serve a purpose  it's true that it's a beautiful structure  a logical one  probably one of the greatest collective efforts ever achieved in human history. But it's also true that there  where scientists and technicians are looking for mathematical theories that allow them to advance  they're within the structure of math  which permeates everything. It's true that we have to go somewhat deeper  to see what's behind science. Science operates on intuition  creativity. Math controls intuition and tames creativity. Almost everyone who hasn't heard this before is surprised when they hear that if you take a  .  millimeter thick sheet of paper  the size we normally use  and  if it were big enough  fold it    times  its thickness would extend almost the distance from the Earth to the sun. Your intuition tells you it's impossible. Do the math and you'll see it's right. That's what math is for. It's true that science  all types of science  only makes sense because it makes us better understand this beautiful world we live in. And in doing that  it helps us avoid the pitfalls of this painful world we live in. There are sciences that help us in this way quite directly. Oncological science  for example. And there are others we look at from afar  with envy sometimes  but knowing that we are what supports them. All the basic sciences support them  including math. All that makes science  science is the rigor of math. And that rigor factors in because its results are eternal. You probably said or were told at some point that diamonds are forever  right  That depends on your definition of forever  A theorem    that really is forever. The Pythagorean theorem is still true even though Pythagoras is dead  I assure you it's true.  Laughter  Even if the world collapsed the Pythagorean theorem would still be true. Wherever any two triangle sides and a good hypotenuse get together the Pythagorean theorem goes all out. It works like crazy. Well  we mathematicians devote ourselves to come up with theorems. Eternal truths. But it isn't always easy to know the difference between an eternal truth  or theorem  and a mere conjecture. You need proof. For example  let's say I have a big  enormous  infinite field. I want to cover it with equal pieces  without leaving any gaps. I could use squares  right  I could use triangles. Not circles  those leave little gaps. Which is the best shape to use  One that covers the same surface  but has a smaller border. In the year      Pappus of Alexandria said the best is to use hexagons  just like bees do. But he didn't prove it. The guy said   Hexagons  great  Let's go with hexagons   He didn't prove it  it remained a conjecture.  Hexagons   And the world  as you know  split into Pappists and anti Pappists  until      years later when in       Thomas Hales proved that Pappus and the bees were right    the best shape to use was the hexagon. And that became a theorem  the honeycomb theorem  that will be true forever and ever  for longer than any diamond you may have.  Laughter  But what happens if we go to three dimensions  If I want to fill the space with equal pieces  without leaving any gaps  I can use cubes  right  Not spheres  those leave little gaps.  Laughter  What is the best shape to use  Lord Kelvin  of the famous Kelvin degrees and all  said that the best was to use a truncated octahedron which  as you all know    is this thing here  Come on. Who doesn't have a truncated octahedron at home   Laughter  Even a plastic one.  Honey  get the truncated octahedron  we're having guests.  Everybody has one   Laughter  But Kelvin didn't prove it. It remained a conjecture    Kelvin's conjecture. The world  as you know  then split into Kelvinists and anti Kelvinists until a hundred or so years later  someone found a better structure. Weaire and Phelan found this little thing over here    this structure to which they gave the very clever name  the Weaire   Phelan structure.  It looks like a strange object  but it isn't so strange  it also exists in nature. It's very interesting that this structure  because of its geometric properties  was used to build the Aquatics Center for the Beijing Olympic Games. There  Michael Phelps won eight gold medals  and became the best swimmer of all time. Well  until someone better comes along  right  As may happen with the Weaire   Phelan structure. It's the best until something better shows up. But be careful  because this one really stands a chance that in a hundred or so years  or even if it's in      years  that someone proves it's the best possible shape for the job. It will then become a theorem  a truth  forever and ever. For longer than any diamond. So  if you want to tell someone that you will love them forever you can give them a diamond. But if you want to tell them that you'll love them forever and ever  give them a theorem  But hang on a minute  You'll have to prove it  so your love doesn't remain a conjecture. It would be nice to be objective in life  in many ways. The problem is that we have these color tinted glasses as we look at all kinds of situations. For example  think about something as simple as beer. If I gave you a few beers to taste and I asked you to rate them on intensity and bitterness  different beers would occupy different space. But what if we tried to be objective about it  In the case of beer  it would be very simple. What if we did a blind taste  Well  if we did the same thing  you tasted the same beer  now in the blind taste  things would look slightly different. Most of the beers will go into one place. You will basically not be able to distinguish them  and the exception  of course  will be Guinness. Similarly  we can think about physiology. What happens when people expect something from their physiology  For example  we sold people pain medications. Some people  we told them the medications were expensive. Some people  we told them it was cheap. And the expensive pain medication worked better. It relieved more pain from people  because expectations do change our physiology. And of course  we all know that in sports  if you are a fan of a particular team  you can't help but see the game develop from the perspective of your team. So all of those are cases in which our preconceived notions and our expectations color our world. But what happened in more important questions  What happened with questions that had to do with social justice  So we wanted to think about what is the blind tasting version for thinking about inequality  So we started looking at inequality  and we did some large scale surveys around the U.S. and other countries. So we asked two questions  Do people know what kind of level of inequality we have  And then  what level of inequality do we want to have  So let's think about the first question. Imagine I took all the people in the U.S. and I sorted them from the poorest on the right to the richest on the left  and then I divided them into five buckets  the poorest    percent  the next    percent  the next  the next  and the richest    percent. And then I asked you to tell me how much wealth do you think is concentrated in each of those buckets. So to make it simpler  imagine I ask you to tell me  how much wealth do you think is concentrated in the bottom two buckets  the bottom    percent  Take a second. Think about it and have a number. Usually we don't think. Think for a second  have a real number in your mind. You have it  Okay  here's what lots of Americans tell us. They think that the bottom    percent has about  .  percent of the wealth  the next group has  .   so together it's slightly more than nine. The next group  they say  has    percent     percent  and the richest    percent  people think has    percent of the wealth. You can see how this relates to what you thought. Now  what's reality  Reality is slightly different. The bottom    percent has  .  percent of the wealth. The next    percent has  .  percent of the wealth. Together  it's  . . The next group has  .     .   and the richest group has       percent of the wealth. So what we actually have and what we think we have are very different. What about what we want  How do we even figure this out  So to look at this  to look at what we really want  we thought about the philosopher John Rawls. If you remember John Rawls  he had this notion of what's a just society. He said a just society is a society that if you knew everything about it  you would be willing to enter it in a random place. And it's a beautiful definition  because if you're wealthy  you might want the wealthy to have more money  the poor to have less. If you're poor  you might want more equality. But if you're going to go into that society in every possible situation  and you don't know  you have to consider all the aspects. It's a little bit like blind tasting in which you don't know what the outcome will be when you make a decision  and Rawls called this the  veil of ignorance.  So  we took another group  a large group of Americans  and we asked them the question in the veil of ignorance. What are the characteristics of a country that would make you want to join it  knowing that you could end randomly at any place  And here is what we got. What did people want to give to the first group  the bottom    percent  They wanted to give them about    percent of the wealth. The next group     percent of the wealth         and   . Now  nobody in our sample wanted full equality. Nobody thought that socialism is a fantastic idea in our sample. But what does it mean  It means that we have this knowledge gap between what we have and what we think we have  but we have at least as big a gap between what we think is right to what we think we have. Now  we can ask these questions  by the way  not just about wealth. We can ask it about other things as well. So for example  we asked people from different parts of the world about this question  people who are liberals and conservatives  and they gave us basically  the same answer. We asked rich and poor  they gave us the same answer  men and women  NPR listeners and Forbes readers. We asked people in England  Australia  the U.S.    very similar answers. We even asked different departments of a university. We went to Harvard and we checked almost every department  and in fact  from Harvard Business School  where a few people wanted the wealthy to have more and the  poor  to have less  the similarity was astonishing. I know some of you went to Harvard Business School. We also asked this question about something else. We asked  what about the ratio of CEO pay to unskilled workers  So you can see what people think is the ratio  and then we can ask the question  what do they think should be the ratio  And then we can ask  what is reality  What is reality  And you could say  well  it's not that bad  right  The red and the yellow are not that different. But the fact is  it's because I didn't draw them on the same scale. It's hard to see  there's yellow and blue in there. So what about other outcomes of wealth  Wealth is not just about wealth. We asked  what about things like health  What about availability of prescription medication  What about life expectancy  What about life expectancy of infants  How do we want this to be distributed  What about education for young people  And for older people  And across all of those things  what we learned was that people don't like inequality of wealth  but there's other things where inequality  which is an outcome of wealth  is even more aversive to them  for example  inequality in health or education. We also learned that people are particularly open to changes in equality when it comes to people who have less agency    basically  young kids and babies  because we don't think of them as responsible for their situation. So what are some lessons from this  We have two gaps  We have a knowledge gap and we have a desirability gap And the knowledge gap is something that we think about  how do we educate people  How do we get people to think differently about inequality and the consequences of inequality in terms of health  education  jealousy  crime rate  and so on  Then we have the desirability gap. How do we get people to think differently about what we really want  You see  the Rawls definition  the Rawls way of looking at the world  the blind tasting approach  takes our selfish motivation out of the picture. How do we implement that to a higher degree on a more extensive scale  And finally  we also have an action gap. How do we take these things and actually do something about it  I think part of the answer is to think about people like young kids and babies that don't have much agency  because people seem to be more willing to do this. To summarize  I would say  next time you go to drink beer or wine  first of all  think about  what is it in your experience that is real  and what is it in your experience that is a placebo effect coming from expectations  And then think about what it also means for other decisions in your life  and hopefully also for policy questions that affect all of us. Thanks a lot. I'd like to take you on the epic quest of the Rosetta spacecraft. To escort and land the probe on a comet  this has been my passion for the past two years. In order to do that  I need to explain to you something about the origin of the solar system. When we go back four and a half billion years  there was a cloud of gas and dust. In the center of this cloud  our sun formed and ignited. Along with that  what we now know as planets  comets and asteroids formed. What then happened  according to theory  is that when the Earth had cooled down a bit after its formation  comets massively impacted the Earth and delivered water to Earth. They probably also delivered complex organic material to Earth  and that may have bootstrapped the emergence of life. You can compare this to having to solve a     piece puzzle and not a       piece puzzle. Afterwards  the big planets like Jupiter and Saturn  they were not in their place where they are now  and they interacted gravitationally  and they swept the whole interior of the solar system clean  and what we now know as comets ended up in something called the Kuiper Belt  which is a belt of objects beyond the orbit of Neptune. And sometimes these objects run into each other  and they gravitationally deflect  and then the gravity of Jupiter pulls them back into the solar system. And they then become the comets as we see them in the sky. The important thing here to note is that in the meantime  the four and a half billion years  these comets have been sitting on the outside of the solar system  and haven't changed    deep  frozen versions of our solar system. In the sky  they look like this. We know them for their tails. There are actually two tails. One is a dust tail  which is blown away by the solar wind. The other one is an ion tail  which is charged particles  and they follow the magnetic field in the solar system. There's the coma  and then there is the nucleus  which here is too small to see  and you have to remember that in the case of Rosetta  the spacecraft is in that center pixel. We are only            kilometers away from the comet. So what's important to remember  Comets contain the original material from which our solar system was formed  so they're ideal to study the components that were present at the time  when Earth  and life  started. Comets are also suspected of having brought the elements which may have bootstrapped life. In       ESA set up its long term Horizon      program  which contained one cornerstone  which would be a mission to a comet. In parallel  a small mission to a comet  what you see here  Giotto  was launched  and in       flew by the comet of Halley with an armada of other spacecraft. From the results of that mission  it became immediately clear that comets were ideal bodies to study to understand our solar system. And thus  the Rosetta mission was approved in       and originally it was supposed to be launched in       but a problem arose with an Ariane rocket. However  our P.R. department  in its enthusiasm  had already made       Delft Blue plates with the name of the wrong comets. So I've never had to buy any china since. That's the positive part. Once the whole problem was solved  we left Earth in      to the newly selected comet  Churyumov Gerasimenko. This comet had to be specially selected because A  you have to be able to get to it  and B  it shouldn't have been in the solar system too long. This particular comet has been  in the solar system since     . That's the first time when it was deflected by Jupiter  and it got close enough to the sun to start changing. So it's a very fresh comet. Rosetta made a few historic firsts. It's the first satellite to orbit a comet  and to escort it throughout its whole tour through the solar system    closest approach to the sun  as we will see in August  and then away again to the exterior. It's the first ever landing on a comet. We actually orbit the comet using something which is not normally done with spacecraft. Normally  you look at the sky and you know where you point and where you are. In this case  that's not enough. We navigated by looking at landmarks on the comet. We recognized features    boulders  craters    and that's how we know where we are respective to the comet. And  of course  it's the first satellite to go beyond the orbit of Jupiter on solar cells. Now  this sounds more heroic than it actually is  because the technology to use radio isotope thermal generators wasn't available in Europe at that time  so there was no choice. But these solar arrays are big. This is one wing  and these are not specially selected small people. They're just like you and me. We have two of these wings     square meters. Now later on  of course  when we got to the comet  you find out that    square meters of sail close to a body which is outgassing is not always a very handy choice. Now  how did we get to the comet  Because we had to go there for the Rosetta scientific objectives very far away    four times the distance of the Earth to the sun    and also at a much higher velocity than we could achieve with fuel  because we'd have to take six times as much fuel as the whole spacecraft weighed. So what do you do  You use gravitational flybys  slingshots  where you pass by a planet at very low altitude  a few thousand kilometers  and then you get the velocity of that planet around the sun for free. We did that a few times. We did Earth  we did Mars  we did twice Earth again  and we also flew by two asteroids  Lutetia and Steins. Then in       we got so far from the sun that if the spacecraft got into trouble  we couldn't actually save the spacecraft anymore  so we went into hibernation. Everything was switched off except for one clock. Here you see in white the trajectory  and the way this works. You see that from the circle where we started  the white line  actually you get more and more and more elliptical  and then finally we approached the comet in May       and we had to start doing the rendezvous maneuvers. On the way there  we flew by Earth and we took a few pictures to test our cameras. This is the moon rising over Earth  and this is what we now call a selfie  which at that time  by the way  that word didn't exist.  Laughter  It's at Mars. It was taken by the CIVA camera. That's one of the cameras on the lander  and it just looks under the solar arrays  and you see the planet Mars and the solar array in the distance. Now  when we got out of hibernation in January       we started arriving at a distance of two million kilometers from the comet in May. However  the velocity the spacecraft had was much too fast. We were going       kilometers an hour faster than the comet  so we had to brake. We had to do eight maneuvers  and you see here  some of them were really big. We had to brake the first one by a few hundred kilometers per hour  and actually  the duration of that was seven hours  and it used     kilos of fuel  and those were seven nerve wracking  hours  because in       there was a leak in the system of the propulsion of Rosetta  and we had to close off a branch  so the system was actually operating at a pressure which it was never designed or qualified for. Then we got in the vicinity of the comet  and these were the first pictures we saw. The true comet rotation period is    and a half hours  so this is accelerated  but you will understand that our flight dynamics engineers thought  this is not going to be an easy thing to land on. We had hoped for some kind of spud like thing where you could easily land. But we had one hope  maybe it was smooth. No. That didn't work either.  Laughter  So at that point in time  it was clearly unavoidable  we had to map this body in all the detail you could get  because we had to find an area which is     meters in diameter and flat. Why     meters  That's the error we have on landing the probe. So we went through this process  and we mapped the comet. We used a technique called photoclinometry. You use shadows thrown by the sun. What you see here is a rock sitting on the surface of the comet  and the sun shines from above. From the shadow  we  with our brain  can immediately determine roughly what the shape of that rock is. You can program that in a computer  you then cover the whole comet  and you can map the comet. For that  we flew special trajectories starting in August. First  a triangle of     kilometers on a side at     kilometers' distance  and we repeated the whole  thing at    kilometers. At that time  we had seen the comet at all kinds of angles  and we could use this technique to map the whole thing. Now  this led to a selection of landing sites. This whole process we had to do  to go from the mapping of the comet to actually finding the final landing site  was    days. We didn't have more. To give you an idea  the average Mars mission takes hundreds of scientists for years to meet about where shall we go  We had    days  and that was it. We finally selected the final landing site and the commands were prepared for Rosetta to launch Philae. The way this works is that Rosetta has to be at the right point in space  and aiming towards the comet  because the lander is passive. The lander is then pushed out and moves towards the comet. Rosetta had to turn around to get its cameras to actually look at Philae while it was departing and to be able to communicate with it. Now  the landing duration of the whole trajectory was seven hours. Now do a simple calculation  if the velocity of Rosetta is off by one centimeter per second  seven hours is        seconds. That means     meters wrong on the comet. So we had to know the velocity of Rosetta much better than one centimeter per second  and its location in space better than     meters at     million kilometers from Earth. That's no mean feat. Let me quickly take you through some of the science and the instruments. I won't bore you with all the details of all the instruments  but it's got everything. We can sniff gas  we can measure dust particles  the shape of them  the composition  there are magnetometers  everything. This is one of the results from an instrument which measures gas density at the position of Rosetta  so it's gas which has left the comet. The bottom graph is September of last year. There is a long term variation  which in itself is not surprising  but you see the sharp peaks. This is a comet day. You can see the effect of the sun on the evaporation of gas and the fact that the comet is rotating. So there is one spot  apparently  where there is a lot of stuff coming from  it gets heated in the Sun  and then cools down on the back side. And we can see the density variations of this. These are the gases and the organic compounds that we already have measured. You will see it's an impressive list  and there is much  much  much more to come  because there are more measurements. Actually  there is a conference going on in Houston at the moment where many of these results are presented. Also  we measured dust particles. Now  for you  this will not look very impressive  but the scientists were thrilled when they saw this. Two dust particles  the right one they call Boris  and they shot it with tantalum in order to be able to analyze it. Now  we found sodium and magnesium. What this tells you is this is the concentration of these two materials at the time the solar system was formed  so we learned things about which materials were there when the planet was made. Of course  one of the important elements is the imaging. This is one of the cameras of Rosetta  the OSIRIS camera  and this actually was the cover of Science magazine on January    of this year. Nobody had expected this body to look like this. Boulders  rocks    if anything  it looks more like the Half Dome in Yosemite than anything else. We also saw things like this  dunes  and what look to be  on the righthand side  wind blown shadows. Now we know these from Mars  but this comet doesn't have an atmosphere  so it's a bit difficult to create a wind blown shadow. It may be local outgassing  stuff which goes up and comes back. We don't know  so there is a lot to investigate. Here  you see the same image twice. On the left hand side  you see in the middle a pit. On the right hand side  if you carefully look  there are three jets coming out of the bottom of that pit. So this is the activity of the comet. Apparently  at the bottom of these pits is where the active regions are  and where the material evaporates into space. There is a very intriguing crack in the neck of the comet. You see it on the right hand side. It's a kilometer long  and it's two and a half meters wide. Some people suggest that actually  when we get close to the sun  the comet may split in two  and then we'll have to choose  which comet do we go for  The lander    again  lots of instruments  mostly comparable except for the things which hammer in the ground and drill  etc. But much the same as Rosetta  and that is because you want to compare what you find in space with what you find on the comet. These are called ground truth measurements. These are the landing descent images that were taken by the OSIRIS camera. You see the lander getting further and further away from Rosetta. On the top right  you see an image taken at    meters by the lander     meters above the surface of the comet. The boulder there is some    meters. So this is one of the last images we took before we landed on the comet. Here  you see the whole sequence again  but from a different perspective  and you see three blown ups from the bottom left to the middle of the lander traveling over the surface of the comet. Then  at the top  there is a before and an after image of the landing. The only problem with the after image is  there is no lander. But if you carefully look at the right hand side of this image  we saw the lander still there   but it had bounced. It had departed again. Now  on a bit of a comical note here is that originally Rosetta was designed to have a lander which would bounce. That was discarded because it was way too expensive. Now  we forgot  but the lander knew. During the first bounce  in the magnetometers  you see here the data from them  from the three axes  x  y and z. Halfway through  you see a red line. At that red line  there is a change. What happened  apparently  is during the first bounce  somewhere  we hit the edge of a crater with one of the legs of the lander  and the rotation velocity of the lander changed. So we've been rather lucky that we are where we are. This is one of the iconic images of Rosetta. It's a man made object  a leg of the lander  standing on a comet. This  for me  is one of the very best images of space science I have ever seen. One of the things we still have to do is to actually find the lander. The blue area here is where we know it must be. We haven't been able to find it yet  but the search is continuing  as are our efforts to start getting the lander to work again. We listen every day  and we hope that between now and somewhere in April  the lander will wake up again. The findings of what we found on the comet  This thing would float in water. It's half the density of water. So it looks like a very big rock  but it's not. The activity increase we saw in June  July  August last year was a four fold activity increase. By the time we will be at the sun  there will be     kilos a second leaving this comet  gas  dust  whatever. That's     million kilos a day. Then  finally  the landing day. I will never forget    absolute madness      TV crews in Germany. The BBC was interviewing me  and another TV crew who was following me all day were filming me being interviewed  and it went on like that for the whole day. The Discovery Channel crew actually caught me when leaving the control room  and they asked the right question  and man  I got into tears  and I still feel this. For a month and a half  I couldn't think about landing day without crying  and I still have the emotion in me. With this image of the comet  I would like to leave you. Thank you. I am a Hazara  and the homeland of my people is Afghanistan. Like hundreds of thousands of other Hazara kids  I was born in exile. The ongoing persecution and operation against the Hazaras forced my parents to leave Afghanistan. This persecution has had a long history going back to the late     s  and the rule of King Abdur Rahman. He killed    percent of  the Hazara population. He built minarets with their heads. Many Hazaras were sold into slavery  and many others fled the country for neighboring Iran and Pakistan. My parents also fled to Pakistan  and settled in Quetta  where I was born. After the September    attack on the Twin Towers  I got a chance to go to Afghanistan for the first time  with foreign journalists. I was only     and I got a job working as an interpreter. After four years  I felt it was safe enough to move to Afghanistan permanently  and I was working there as a documentary photographer  and I worked on many stories. One of the most important stories that I did was the dancing boys of Afghanistan. It is a tragic story about an appalling tradition. It involves young kids dancing for warlords and powerful men in the society. These boys are often abducted or bought from their poor parents  and they are put to work as sex slaves. This is Shukur. He was kidnapped from Kabul by a warlord. He was taken to another province  where he was forced to work as a sex slave for the warlord and his friends. When this story was published in the Washington Post  I started receiving death threats  and I was forced to leave Afghanistan  as my parents were. Along with my family  I returned back to Quetta. The situation in Quetta had changed dramatically since I left in     . Once a peaceful haven for the Hazaras  it had now turned into the most dangerous city in Pakistan. Hazaras are confined into two small areas  and they are marginalized socially  educationally  and financially. This is Nadir. I had known him since my childhood. He was injured when his van was ambushed by terrorists in Quetta. He later died of his injuries. Around       Hazara members had been killed in various attacks  and around       of them were injured  and many of them permanently disabled. The attacks on the Hazara community would only get worse  so it was not surprising that many wanted to flee. After Afghanistan  Iran  Pakistan  Australia is home to the fourth largest population of Hazaras in the world. When it came time to leave Pakistan  Australia seemed the obvious choice. Financially  only one of us could leave  and it was decided that I would go  in the hope that if I arrived at my destination safely  I could work to get the rest of my family to join me later. We all knew about the risks  and how terrifying the journey is  and I met many people who lost loved ones at sea. It was a desperate decision to take  to leave everything behind  and no one makes this decision easily. If I had been able to simply fly to Australia  it would have taken me less than    hours. But getting a visa was impossible. My journey was much longer  much more complicated  and certainly more dangerous  traveling to Thailand by air  and then by road and boat to Malaysia and into Indonesia  paying people and smugglers all the way and spending a lot of time hiding and a lot of time in fear of being caught. In Indonesia  I joined a group of seven asylum seekers. We all shared a bedroom in a town outside of Jakarta called Bogor. After spending a week in Bogor  three of my roommates left for the perilous journey  and we got the news two days later that a distressed boat sank in the sea en route to Christmas Island. We found out that our three roommates    Nawroz  Jaffar and Shabbir    were also among those. Only Jaffar was rescued. Shabbir and Nawroz were never seen again. It made me think  am I doing the right thing  I concluded I really had no other choice but to go on. A few weeks later  we got the call from the people smuggler to alert us that the boat is ready for us to commence our sea journey. Taken in the night towards the main vessel on a motorboat  we boarded an old fishing boat that was already overloaded. There were    of us  and we were all below deck. No one was allowed up on the top. We all paid       dollars each for this part of the trip. The first night and day went smoothly  but by the second night   the weather turned. Waves tossed the boat around  and the timbers groaned. People below deck were crying  praying  recalling their loved ones. They were screaming. It was a terrible moment. It was like a scene from doomsday  or maybe like one of those scenes from those Hollywood movies that shows that everything is breaking apart and the world is just ending. It was happening to us for real. We didn't have any hope. Our boat was floating like a matchbox on the water without any control. The waves were much higher than our boat  and the water poured in faster than the motor pumps could take it out. We all lost hope. We thought  this is the end. We were watching our deaths  and I was documenting it. The captain told us that we are not going to make it  we have to turn back the boat. We went on the deck and turned our torches on and off to attract the attention of any passing boat. We kept trying to attract their attention by waving our life jackets and whistling. Eventually  we made it to a small island. Our boat crashing onto the rocks  I slipped into the water and destroyed my camera  whatever I had documented. But luckily  the memory card survived. It was a thick forest. We all split up into many groups as we argued over what to do next. We were all scared and confused. Then  after spending the night on the beach  we found a jetty and coconuts. We hailed a boat from a nearby resort  and then were quickly handed over to Indonesian water police. At Serang Detention Center  an immigration officer came and furtively strip searched us. He took our mobile  my      cash  our shoes that we should not be able to escape  but we kept watching the guards  checking their movements  and around   a.m. when they sat around a fire  we removed two glass layers from an outside facing window and slipped through. We climbed a tree next to an outer wall that was topped with the shards of glass. We put the pillow on that and wrapped our forearms with bedsheets and climbed the wall  and we ran away with bare feet. I was free  with an uncertain future  no money. The only thing I had was the memory card with the pictures and footage. When my documentary was aired on SBS Dateline  many of my friends came to know about my situation  and they tried to help me. They did not allow me to take any other boat to risk my life. I also decided to stay in Indonesia and process my case through UNHCR  but I was really afraid that I would end up in Indonesia for many years doing nothing and unable to work  like every other asylum seeker. But it had happened to be a little bit different with me. I was lucky. My contacts worked to expedite my case through UNHCR  and I got resettled in Australia in May     . Not every asylum seeker is lucky like me. It is really difficult to live a life with an uncertain fate  in limbo. The issue of asylum seekers in Australia has been so extremely politicized that it has lost its human face. The asylum seekers have been demonized and then presented to the people. I hope my story and the story of other Hazaras could shed some light to show the people how these people are suffering in their countries of origin  and how they suffer  why they risk their lives to seek asylum. Thank you. Today  I am going to talk about anger. When I was     seeing some of my friends  leaving the school because their parents  could not afford textbooks made me angry. When I was     hearing the plight of a desperate slave father whose daughter was  about to be sold to a brothel made me angry. At the age of     lying on the street  in a pool of blood  along with my own son  made me angry. Dear friends  for centuries we were taught anger is bad. Our parents  teachers  priests    everyone taught us how to control  and suppress our anger. But I ask why  Why can't we convert our anger for the larger good of society  Why can't we use our anger to challenge and change the evils of the world  That I tried to do. Friends  most of the brightest ideas came to my mind out of anger. Like when I was    and sat  in a locked up  tiny prison. The whole night  I was angry. But it has given birth to a new idea. But I will come to that later on. Let me begin with the story of how I got a name for myself. I had been a big admirer  of Mahatma Gandhi since my childhood. Gandhi fought and lead  India's freedom movement. But more importantly  he taught us how to treat  the most vulnerable sections  the most deprived people   with dignity and respect. And so  when India was celebrating Mahatma Gandhi's  birth centenary in         at that time I was       an idea came to my mind. Why can't we celebrate it differently  I knew  as perhaps many of you might know  that in India  a large number of people are born in the lowest segment of caste. And they are treated as untouchables. These are the people    forget about allowing them  to go to the temples  they cannot even go into the houses  and shops of high caste people. So I was very impressed with  the leaders of my town who were speaking very highly against the caste system and untouchability and talking of Gandhian ideals. So inspired by that  I thought  let us set an example by inviting these people to eat food cooked and served by the untouchable community. I went to some low caste  so called untouchable  people  tried to convince them  but it was unthinkable for them. They told me   No  no. It's not possible. It never happened.  I said   Look at these leaders  they are so great   they are against untouchability. They will come. If nobody comes   we can set an example.  These people thought that I was too naive. Finally  they were convinced. My friends and I took our bicycles and invited political leaders. And I was so thrilled  rather  empowered to see that each one of them  agreed to come. I thought   Great idea. We can set an example. We can bring about change in the society.  The day has come. All these untouchables  three women and two men  they agreed to come. I could recall that they had used  the best of their clothes. They brought new utensils. They had taken baths  hundreds of times because it was unthinkable for them to do. It was the moment of change. They gathered. Food was cooked. It was   o'clock. By   o'clock  we kept on waiting  because it's not very uncommon  that the leaders become late  for an hour or so. So after   o'clock  we took our bicycles and went to these leaders' homes  just to remind them. One of the leader's wives told me   Sorry  he is having some headache  perhaps he cannot come.  I went to another leader and his wife told me    Okay  you go  he will definitely join.  So I thought that the dinner will take place  though not at that large a scale. I went back to the venue  which was a newly built Mahatma Gandhi Park. It was    o'clock. None of the leaders showed up. That made me angry. I was standing  leaning against Mahatma Gandhi's statue. I was emotionally drained  rather exhausted. Then I sat down where  the food was lying. I kept my emotions on hold. But then  when I took the first bite  I broke down in tears. And suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder. And it was the healing  motherly touch  of an untouchable woman. And she told me   Kailash  why are you crying  You have done your bit. You have eaten the food cooked by untouchables  which has never happened in our memory.  She said   You won today.  And my friends  she was right. I came back home  a little after midnight  shocked to see that several  high caste elderly people were sitting in my courtyard. I saw my mother and  elderly women were crying and they were pleading  to these elderly people because they had threatened  to outcaste my whole family. And you know  outcasting the family is the biggest social punishment one can think of. Somehow they agreed to punish only me  and the punishment was purification. That means I had to go     miles away from my hometown to the River Ganges to take a holy dip. And after that  I should organize a feast for priests      priests  wash their feet and drink that water. It was total nonsense  and I refused to accept that punishment. How did they punish me  I was barred from entering into my own  kitchen and my own dining room  my utensils were separated. But the night when I was angry  they wanted to outcaste me. But I decided to outcaste  the entire caste system. And that was possible because the beginning would have been to change the family name  or surname  because in India  most of the family names are caste names. So I decided to drop my name. And then  later on  I gave  a new name to myself  Satyarthi  that means   seeker of truth.  And that was the beginning  of my transformative anger. Friends  maybe one of you can tell me  what was I doing before becoming a children's rights activist  Does anybody know  No. I was an engineer  an electrical engineer. And then I learned how the energy of burning fire  coal  the nuclear blast inside the chambers  raging river currents  fierce winds  could be converted into the light  and lives of millions. I also learned how the most uncontrollable form of energy could be harnessed for good  and making society better. So I'll come back to the story of when I was caught in the prison  I was very happy freeing  a dozen children from slavery  handing them over to their parents. I cannot explain my joy  when I free a child. I was so happy. But when I was waiting for my train to come back to my hometown  Delhi  I saw that dozens of children  were arriving  they were being trafficked by someone. I stopped them  those people. I complained to the police. So the policemen  instead of helping me  they threw me in this small   tiny shell  like an animal. And that was the night of anger when one of the brightest  and biggest ideas was born. I thought that if I keep on freeing     children  and    more will join  that's not done. And I believed in the power of consumers  and let me tell you that this was the first time when a campaign was launched by me or anywhere in the world  to educate and sensitize the consumers to create a demand for child labor free rugs. In Europe and America   we have been successful. And it has resulted  in a fall in child labor in South Asian countries by    percent. Not only that  but this first ever  consumer's power  or consumer's campaign has grown in other countries and other industries  maybe chocolate  maybe apparel   maybe shoes    it has gone beyond. My anger at the age of     when I realized how important education is for every child  I got an idea to collect used books and help the poorest children. I created a book bank at the age of   . But I did not stop. Later on  I cofounded the world's single largest civil society campaign for education that is the Global Campaign for Education. That has helped in changing  the whole thinking towards education from the charity mode to the human rights mode  and that has concretely helped  the reduction of out of school children by half in the last    years. My anger at the age of     to free that girl who was about to be sold to a brothel  has given me an idea to go for a new strategy of raid and rescue  freeing children from slavery. And I am so lucky and proud to say that it is not one or    or     but my colleagues and I have been able to physically liberate        child slaves and hand them over back to their families and mothers. I knew that we needed global policies. We organized the worldwide marches against child labor and that has also resulted in  a new international convention to protect the children who are in the worst forms. And the concrete result was that the number of child laborers globally has gone down by one third  in the last    years. So  in each case  it began from anger  turned into an idea  and action. So anger  what next  Idea  and    Audience  Action Kailash Satyarthi  Anger  idea  action. Which I tried to do. Anger is a power  anger is an energy  and the law of nature is that energy can never be created and never  be vanished  can never be destroyed. So why can't the energy of anger be translated and harnessed to create a better and beautiful world  a more just and equitable world  Anger is within each one of you  and I will share a secret for a few seconds  that if we are confined in  the narrow shells of egos  and the circles of selfishness  then the anger will turn out to be hatred  violence  revenge  destruction. But if we are able to break the circles  then the same anger could turn  into a great power. We can break the circles  by using our inherent compassion and connect with the world through  compassion to make this world better. That same anger could be transformed into it. So dear friends  sisters and brothers  again  as a Nobel Laureate  I am urging you to become angry. I am urging you to become angry. And the angriest among us is the one who can transform his anger  into idea and action. Thank you so much. Chris Anderson  For many years   you've been an inspiration to others. Who or what inspires you and why  KS  Good question. Chris  let me tell you   and that is the truth  each time when I free a child  the child who has lost all his hope that he will ever come back to his mother  the first smile of freedom  and the mother who has lost all hope that the son or daughter  can ever come back and sit in her lap  they become so emotional and the first tear of joy  rolls down on her cheek  I see the glimpse of God in it    this is my biggest inspiration. And I am so lucky that not once  as I said before  but thousands of times  I have been able to witness my God in the faces of those children and they are my biggest inspirations. Thank you. This is a kindergarten we designed in     . We made this kindergarten  to be a circle. It's a kind of endless circulation on top of the roof. If you are a parent  you know that kids love to keep making circles. This is how the rooftop looks. And why did we design this  The principal of this kindergarten said   No  I don't want a handrail.  I said   It's impossible.  But he insisted   How about having a net sticking out from the edge of the roof  So that it can catch the children falling off   I said   It's impossible.  And of course  the government official said   Of course you have to have a handrail.  But we could keep  that idea around the trees. There are three trees popping through. And we were allowed to call  this rope as a handrail. But of course  rope has nothing to do with them. They fall into the net. And you get more  and more  more. Sometimes    children  are around a tree. The boy on the branch  he loves the tree so he is eating the tree. And at the time of an event  they sit on the edge. It looks so nice from underneath. Monkeys in the zoo. Feeding time. And we made the roof as low as possible  because we wanted to see children on top of the roof  not only underneath the roof. And if the roof is too high  you see only the ceiling. And the leg washing place    there are many kinds of water taps. You see with the flexible tubes  you want to spray water to your friends  and the shower  and the one in front is quite normal. But if you look at this  the boy is not washing his boots  he's putting water into his boots. This kindergarten is completely open  most of the year. And there is no boundary between inside and outside. So it means basically this architecture is a roof. And also there is no boundary between classrooms. So there is no acoustic barrier at all. When you put many children in a quiet box  some of them get really nervous. But in this kindergarten  there is no reason they get nervous. Because there is no boundary. And the principal says if the boy in the corner doesn't want to stay in the room  we let him go. He will come back eventually  because it's a circle  it comes back. But the point is  in that kind of occasion  usually children try to hide somewhere. But here  just they leave and come back. It's a natural process. And secondly  we consider noise very important. You know that children sleep better in noise. They don't sleep in a quiet space. And in this kindergarten  these children show amazing concentration in class. And you know  our kind grew up in the jungle with noise. They need noise. And you know  you can talk to your friends in a noisy bar. You are not supposed to be in silence. And you know  these days we are trying to make everything under control. You know  it's completely open. And you should know that we can go skiing in     degrees in winter. In summer you go swimming. The sand is    degrees. And also  you should know that you are waterproof. You never melt in rain. So  children are supposed to be outside. So that is how we should treat them. This is how they divide classrooms. They are supposed to help teachers. They don't. I didn't put him in. A classroom. And a washbasin. They talk to each other around the well. And there are always  some trees in the classroom. A monkey trying to fish another monkey from above. Monkeys. And each classroom has at least one skylight. And this is where Santa Claus comes down at the time of Christmas. This is the annex building  right next to that oval shaped kindergarten. The building is only five meters tall with seven floors. And of course  the ceiling height is very low. So you have to consider safety. So  we put our children  a daughter and a son. They tried to go in. He hit his head. He's okay. His skull is quite strong. He is resilient. It's my son. And he is trying to see if it is safe to jump off. And then we put other children. The traffic jam is awful in Tokyo  as you know. The driver in front  she needs to learn how to drive. Now these days  kids need a small dosage of danger. And in this kind of occasion  they learn to help each other. This is society. This is the kind of opportunity we are losing these days. Now  this drawing is showing the movement of a boy between      and     . And the circumference of this building is     meters. So it's not exactly small at all. And this boy did       meters in the morning. But the surprise is yet to come. The children in this kindergarten do       meters on average. And these children have the highest athletic abilities among many kindergartens. The principal says   I don't train them. We leave them on top of the roof. Just like sheep.  They keep running. My point is don't control them  don't protect them too much  and they need to tumble sometimes. They need to get some injury. And that makes them learn how to live in this world. I think architecture is capable of changing this world  and people's lives. And this is one of the attempts to change the lives of children. Thank you very much. This is a story about capitalism. It's a system I love because of the successes and opportunities it's afforded me and millions of others. I started in my   s trading commodities  cotton in particular  in the pits  and if there was ever a free market free for all  this was it  where men wearing ties  but acting like gladiators fought literally  and physically for a profit. Fortunately  I was good enough that by the time I was     I was able to move into the upstairs  world of money management  where I spent the next three decades as a global macro trader. And over that time  I've seen a lot of crazy things in the markets  and I've traded a lot of crazy manias. And unfortunately  I'm sad to report that right now  we might be in the grips of one of the most disastrous  certainly of my career  and one consistent takeaway is manias never end well. Now  over the past    years  we as a society have come to view our companies and corporations in a very narrow  almost monomaniacal fashion with regard to how we value them  and we have put so much emphasis on profits  on short term quarterly earnings and share prices  at the exclusion of all else. It's like we've ripped the humanity out of our companies. Now  we don't do that    conveniently reduce something to a set of numbers that you can play with like Lego toys    we don't do that in our individual life. We don't treat somebody or value them based on their monthly income  or their credit score  but we have this double standard when it comes to the way that we value our businesses  and you know what  It's threatening the very underpinnings of our society. And here's how you'll see. This chart is corporate profit margins going back    years as a percentage of revenues  and you can see that we're at a    year high of   .  percent. Now  hooray if you're a shareholder  but if you're the other side of that  and you're the average American worker  then you can see it's not such a good thing.   U.S. Share of Income Going to Labor vs. CEO to Worker Compensation Ratio   Now  higher profit margins do not increase societal wealth. What they actually do is they exacerbate income inequality  and that's not a good thing. But intuitively  that makes sense  right  Because if the top    percent of American families own    percent of the stocks  as they take a greater share of corporate profits  then there's less wealth left for the rest of society. Again  income inequality is not a good thing. This next chart  made by The Equality Trust  shows    countries from Austria to Japan to New Zealand. On the horizontal axis is income inequality. The further to the right you go  the greater the income inequality. On the vertical axis are nine social and health metrics. The more you go up that  the worse the problems are  and those metrics include life expectancy  teenage pregnancy  literacy  social mobility  just to name a few. Now  those of you in the audience who are Americans may wonder  well  where does the United States rank  Where does it lie on that chart  And guess what  We're literally off the chart. Yes  that's us  with the greatest income inequality and the greatest social problems  according to those metrics. Now  here's a macro forecast that's easy to make  and that's  that gap between the wealthiest and the poorest  it will get closed. History always does it. It typically happens in one of three ways  either through revolution  higher taxes  or wars. None of those are on my bucket list. Now  there's another way to do it  and that's by increasing justness in corporate behavior  but the way that we're operating right now  that would require a tremendous change in behavior  and like an addict trying to kick a habit  the first step is to acknowledge that you have a problem. And let me just say  this profits mania that we're on is so deeply entrenched that we don't even realize how we're harming society. Here's a small but startling example of exactly how we're doing that  this chart shows corporate giving as a percentage of profits   not revenues  over the last    years. Juxtapose that to the earlier chart of corporate profit margins  and I ask you  does that feel right  In all fairness  when I started writing this  I thought   Oh wow  what does my company  what does Tudor do   And I realized we give one percent of corporate profits to charity every year. And I'm supposed to be a philanthropist. When I realized that  I literally wanted to throw up. But the point is  this mania is so deeply entrenched that well intentioned people like myself don't even realize that we're part of it. Now  we're not going to change corporate behavior by simply increasing corporate philanthropy or charitable contributions. And oh  by the way  we've since quadrupled that  but     Applause     Please. But we can do it by driving more just behavior. And one way to do it is actually trusting the system that got us here in the first place  and that's the free market system. About a year ago  some friends of mine and I started a not for profit called Just Capital. Its mission is very simple  to help companies and corporations learn how to operate in a more just fashion by using the public's input to define exactly what the criteria are for just corporate behavior. Now  right now  there's no widely accepted standard that a company or corporation can follow  and that's where Just Capital comes in  because beginning this year and every year we'll be conducting a nationwide survey of a representative sample of        Americans to find out exactly what they think are the criteria for justness in corporate behavior. Now  this is a model that's going to start in the United States but can be expanded anywhere around the globe  and maybe we'll find out that the most important thing for the public is that we create living wage jobs  or make healthy products  or help  not harm  the environment. At Just Capital  we don't know  and it's not for us to decide. We're but messengers  but we have     percent confidence  and faith in the American public to get it right. So we'll release the findings this September for the first time  and then next year  we'll poll again  and we'll take the additive step this time of ranking the       largest U.S. companies from number one to number       and everything in between. We're calling it the Just Index  and remember  we're an independent not for profit with no bias  and we will be giving the American public a voice. And maybe over time  we'll find out that as people come to know which companies are the most just  human and economic resources will be driven towards them  and they'll become the most prosperous and help our country be the most prosperous. Now  capitalism has been responsible for every major innovation that's made this world a more inspiring and wonderful place to live in. Capitalism has to be based on justice. It has to be  and now more than ever  with economic divisions growing wider every day. It's estimated that    percent of American workers can be displaced in the next    years. I'm not against progress. I want the driverless car and the jet pack just like everyone else. But I'm pleading for recognition that with increased wealth and profits has to come greater corporate social responsibility.  If justice is removed   said Adam Smith  the father of capitalism   the great  the immense fabric of human society must in a moment crumble into atoms.  Now  when I was young  and there was a problem  my mama used to always sigh and shake her head and say   Have mercy  have mercy.  Now's not the time for us  for the rest of us to show them mercy. The time is now for us to show them fairness  and we can do that  you and I  by starting where we work  in the businesses that we operate in. And when we put justness on par with profits  we'll get the most wonderful thing in all the world. We'll take back our humanity. Thank you. Well  you know  sometimes the most important things come in the smallest packages. I am going to try to convince you  in the    minutes I have  that microbes have a lot to say about questions such as   Are we alone   and they can tell us more about not only life in our solar system but also maybe beyond  and this is why I am tracking them down in the most impossible places on Earth  in extreme environments where conditions are really pushing them to the brink of survival. Actually  sometimes me too  when I'm trying to follow them too close. But here's the thing  We are the only advanced civilization in the solar system  but that doesn't mean that there is no microbial life nearby. In fact  the planets and moons you see here could host life    all of them    and we know that  and it's a strong possibility. And if we were going to find life on those moons and planets  then we would answer questions such as  are we alone in the solar system  Where are we coming from  Do we have family in the neighborhood  Is there life beyond our solar system  And we can ask all those questions because there has been a revolution in our understanding of what a habitable planet is  and today  a habitable planet is a planet that has a zone where water can stay stable  but to me this is a horizontal definition of habitability  because it involves a distance to a star  but there is another dimension to habitability  and this is a vertical dimension. Think of it as conditions in the subsurface of a planet where you are very far away from a sun  but you still have water  energy  nutrients  which for some of them means food  and a protection. And when you look at the Earth  very far away from any sunlight  deep in the ocean  you have life thriving and it uses only chemistry for life processes. So when you think of it  at that point  all walls collapse. You have no limitations  basically. And if you have been looking at the headlines lately  then you will see that we have discovered a subsurface ocean on Europa  on Ganymede  on Enceladus  on Titan  and now we are finding a geyser and hot springs on Enceladus  Our solar system is turning into a giant spa. For anybody who has gone to a spa knows how much microbes like that  right  So at that point  think also about Mars. There is no life possible at the surface of Mars today  but it might still be hiding underground. So  we have been making progress in our understanding of habitability  but we also have been making progress in our understanding of what the signatures of life are on Earth. And you can have what we call organic molecules  and these are the bricks of life  and you can have fossils  and you can minerals  biominerals  which is due to the reaction between bacteria and rocks  and of course you can have gases in the atmosphere. And when you look at those tiny green algae on the right of the slide here  they are the direct descendants of those who have been pumping oxygen a billion years ago in the atmosphere of the Earth. When they did that  they poisoned    percent of the life at the surface of the Earth  but they are the reason why you are breathing this air today. But as much as our understanding grows of all of these things  there is one question we still cannot answer  and this is  where are we coming from  And you know  it's getting worse  because we won't be able to find the physical evidence of where we are coming from on this planet  and the reason being is that anything that is older than four billion years is gone. All record is gone  erased by plate tectonics and erosion. This is what I call the Earth's biological horizon. Beyond this horizon we don't know where we are coming from. So is everything lost  Well  maybe not. And we might be able to find evidence of our own origin in the most unlikely place  and this place in Mars. How is this possible  Well clearly at the beginning of the solar system  Mars and the Earth were bombarded by giant asteroids and comets  and there were ejecta from these impacts all over the place. Earth and Mars kept throwing rocks at each other for a very long time. Pieces of rocks landed on the Earth. Pieces of the Earth landed on Mars. So clearly  those two planets may have been seeded by the same material. So yeah  maybe Granddady is sitting there on the surface and waiting for us. But that also means that we can go to Mars and try to find traces of our own origin. Mars may hold that secret for us. This is why Mars is so special to us. But for that to happen  Mars needed to be habitable at the time when conditions were right. So was Mars habitable  We have a number of missions telling us exactly the same thing today. At the time when life appeared on the Earth  Mars did have an ocean  it had volcanoes  it had lakes  and it had deltas like the beautiful picture you see here. This picture was sent by the Curiosity  rover only a few weeks ago. It shows the remnants of a delta  and this picture tells us something  water was abundant and stayed founting at the surface for a very long time. This is good news for life. Life chemistry takes a long time to actually happen. So this is extremely good news  but does that mean that if we go there  life will be easy to find on Mars  Not necessarily. Here's what happened  At the time when life exploded at the surface of the Earth  then everything went south for Mars  literally. The atmosphere was stripped away by solar winds  Mars lost its magnetosphere  and then cosmic rays and U.V. bombarded the surface and water escaped to space and went underground. So if we want to be able to understand  if we want to be able to find those traces of the signatures of life at the surface of Mars  if they are there  we need to understand what was the impact of each of these events on the preservation of its record. Only then will we be able to know where those signatures are hiding  and only then will we be able to send our rover to the right places where we can sample those rocks that may be telling us something really important about who we are  or  if not  maybe telling us that somewhere  independently  life has appeared on another planet. So to do that  it's easy. You only need to go back  .  billion years ago in the past of a planet. We just need a time machine. Easy  right  Well  actually  it is. Look around you    that's planet Earth. This is our time machine. Geologists are using it to go back in the past of our own planet. I am using it a little bit differently. I use planet Earth to go in very extreme environments where conditions were similar to those of Mars at the time when the climate changed  and there I'm trying  to understand what happened. What are the signatures of life  What is left  How are we going to find it  So for one moment now I'm going to take you with me on a trip into that time machine. And now  what you see here  we are at       meters in the Andes  but in fact we are less than a billion years after the Earth and Mars formed. The Earth and Mars will have looked pretty much exactly like that    volcanoes everywhere  evaporating lakes everywhere  minerals  hot springs  and then you see those mounds on the shore of those lakes  Those are built by the descendants of the first organisms that gave us the first fossil on Earth. But if we want to understand what's  going on  we need to go a little further. And the other thing about those sites is that exactly like on Mars three and a half billion years ago  the climate is changing very fast  and water and ice are disappearing. But we need to go back to that time when everything changed on Mars  and to do that  we need to go higher. Why is that  Because when you go higher  the atmosphere is getting thinner  it's getting more unstable  the temperature is getting cooler  and you have a lot more U.V. radiation. Basically  you are getting to those conditions on Mars when everything changed. So I was not promising anything about a leisurely trip on the time machine. You are not going to be sitting in that time machine. You have to haul       pounds of equipment to the summit of this        foot volcano in the Andes here. That's about       meters. And you also have to sleep on    degree slopes and really hope that there won't be any earthquake that night. But when we get to the summit  we actually find the lake we came for. At this altitude  this lake is experiencing exactly the same conditions as those on Mars three and a half billion years ago. And now we have to change our voyage into an inner voyage inside that lake  and to do that  we have to remove our mountain gear and actually don suits and go for it. But at the time we enter that lake  at the very moment we enter that lake  we are stepping back three and a half billion years in the past of another planet  and then we are going to get the answer came for. Life is everywhere  absolutely everywhere. Everything you see in this picture is a living organism. Maybe not so the diver  but everything else. But this picture is very deceiving. Life is abundant in those lakes  but like in many places on Earth  right now and due to climate change  there is a huge loss in biodiversity. In the samples that we took back home     percent of the bacteria in those lakes were composed of three species  and those three species are the ones that have survived so far. Here's another lake  right next to the first one. The red color you see here is not due to minerals. It's actually due to the presence of a tiny algae. In this region  the U.V. radiation is really nasty. Anywhere on Earth     is considered to be extreme. During U.V. storms there  the U.V. Index reaches   . SPF    is not going to do anything  to you over there  and the water is so transparent in those lakes that the algae has nowhere to hide  really  and so they are developing their own sunscreen  and this is the red color you see. But they can adapt only so far  and then when all the water is gone from the surface  microbes have only one solution left  They go underground. And those microbes  the rocks you see in that slide here  well  they are actually living inside rocks and they are using the protection of the translucence of the rocks to get the good part of the U.V. and discard the part that could actually damage their DNA. And this is why we are taking our rover to train them to search  for life on Mars in these areas  because if there was life on Mars three and a half billion years ago  it had to use the same strategy to actually protect itself. Now  it is pretty obvious that going to extreme environments is helping us very much for the exploration of Mars  and to prepare missions. So far  it has helped us to understand the geology of Mars. It has helped to understand the past climate of Mars and its evolution  but also its habitability potential. Our most recent rover on Mars has discovered traces of organics. Yeah  there are organics at the surface of Mars. And it also discovered traces of methane. And we don't know yet if the methane in question is really from geology or biology. Regardless  what we know is that because of the discovery  the hypothesis that there is still life present on Mars today remains a viable one. So by now  I think I have convinced you that Mars is very special to us  but it would be a mistake to think that Mars is the only place in the solar system that is interesting to find potential microbial life. And the reason is because Mars and the Earth could have a common root to their tree of life  but when you go beyond Mars  it's not that easy. Celestial mechanics  is not making it so easy for an exchange of material between planets  and so if we were to discover life on those planets  it would be different from us. It would be a different type of life. But in the end  it might be just us  it might be us and Mars  or it can be many trees of life in the solar system. I don't know the answer yet  but I can tell you something  No matter what the result is  no matter what that magic number is  it is going to give us a standard by which we are going to be able  to measure the life potential  abundance and diversity beyond our own solar system. And this can be achieved by our generation. This can be our legacy  but only if we dare to explore. Now  finally  if somebody tells you that looking  for alien microbes is not cool because you cannot have a philosophical conversation with them  let me show you why and how you can tell them they're wrong. Well  organic material is going to tell you about environment  about complexity and about diversity. DNA  or any information carrier  is going to tell you about adaptation  about evolution  about survival  about planetary changes and about the transfer of information. All together  they are telling us what started as a microbial pathway  and why what started as a microbial pathway sometimes ends up as a civilization or sometimes ends up as a dead end. Look at the solar system  and look at the Earth. On Earth  there are many intelligent species  but only one has achieved technology. Right here in the journey of our own solar system  there is a very  very powerful message that says here's how we should look  for alien life  small and big. So yeah  microbes are talking and we are listening  and they are taking us  one planet at a time and one moon at a time  towards their big brothers out there. And they are telling us about diversity  they are telling us about abundance of life  and they are telling us how this life has survived thus far to reach civilization  intelligence  technology and  indeed  philosophy. Thank you. To be honest  by personality  I'm just not much of a crier. But I think in my career that's been a good thing. I'm a civil rights lawyer  and I've seen some  horrible things in the world. I began my career working  police abuse cases in the United States. And then in       I was sent to Rwanda to be the director of the U.N.'s  genocide investigation. It turns out that tears  just aren't much help when you're trying  to investigate a genocide. The things I had to see   and feel and touch were pretty unspeakable. What I can tell you is this  that the Rwandan genocide was one of the world's greatest failures of simple compassion. That word  compassion  actually  comes from two Latin words  cum passio  which simply mean   to suffer with.  And the things that I saw and experienced in Rwanda as I got up close to human suffering  it did  in moments  move me to tears. But I just wish that I   and the rest of the world  had been moved earlier. And not just to tears  but to actually stop the genocide. Now by contrast  I've also been involved with one of the world's greatest successes of compassion. And that's the fight against  global poverty. It's a cause that probably has involved all of us here. I don't know if your first introduction might have been choruses of  We Are the World   or maybe the picture of a sponsored child on your refrigerator door  or maybe the birthday you donated for fresh water. I don't really remember what my first introduction to poverty was but I do remember the most jarring. It was when I met Venus    she's a mom from Zambia. She's got three kids and she's a widow. When I met her  she had walked about    miles in the only garments she owned  to come to the capital city and to share her story. She sat down with me for hours  just ushered me in to  the world of poverty. She described what it was like  when the coals on the cooking fire finally just went completely cold. When that last drop  of cooking oil finally ran out. When the last of the food   despite her best efforts  ran out. She had to watch her youngest son  Peter  suffer from malnutrition  as his legs just slowly bowed  into uselessness. As his eyes grew cloudy and dim. And then as Peter finally grew cold. For over    years  stories like this have been moving us to compassion. We whose kids have plenty to eat. And we're moved not only  to care about global poverty  but to actually try to do our part  to stop the suffering. Now there's plenty of room for critique  that we haven't done enough  and what it is that we've done hasn't been effective enough  but the truth is this  The fight against global poverty is probably the broadest  longest running manifestation of the  human phenomenon of compassion in the history of our species. And so I'd like to share a pretty shattering insight that might forever change the way you think about that struggle. But first  let me begin with what you probably already know. Thirty five years ago  when I would have been graduating from high school  they told us that        kids every day died because of poverty. That number  today  is now  down to       . Way too many  of course  but it does mean that every year  there's eight million kids who don't have to die from poverty. Moreover  the number of  people in our world who are living in extreme poverty  which is defined as living off about a dollar and a quarter a day  that has fallen from    percent  to only    percent. This is massive progress  and this exceeds everybody's  expectations about what is possible. And I think you and I  I think  honestly  that we can  feel proud and encouraged to see the way that compassion  actually has the power to succeed in stopping  the suffering of millions. But here's the part that you  might not hear very much about. If you move that poverty mark just up to two dollars a day  it turns out that virtually  the same two billion people who were stuck in that harsh poverty when I was in high school  are still stuck there     years later. So why  why are so many billions still stuck in such harsh poverty  Well  let's think about Venus for a moment. Now for decades  my wife and I have been moved by common compassion to sponsor kids  to fund microloans  to support generous levels of foreign aid. But until I had actually talked to Venus  I would have had no idea that  none of those approaches actually addressed why she had to watch her son die.  We were doing fine   Venus told me   until Brutus started to cause trouble.  Now  Brutus is Venus' neighbor  and  cause trouble  is what happened the day after Venus' husband died  when Brutus just came and threw Venus and the kids out of the house  stole all their land  and robbed their market stall. You see  Venus was thrown  into destitution by violence. And then it occurred to me  of course  that none of my child sponsorships  none of the microloans  none of the traditional  anti poverty programs were going to stop Brutus  because they weren't meant to. This became even more clear to me when I met Griselda. She's a marvelous young girl living in a very poor community in Guatemala. And one of the things we've learned over the years is that perhaps the most powerful thing that Griselda and her family can do to get Griselda and her family  out of poverty is to make sure that she goes to school. The experts call this the Girl Effect. But when we met Griselda   she wasn't going to school. In fact  she was rarely ever  leaving her home. Days before we met her  while she was walking home from church with her family  in broad daylight  men from her community  just snatched her off the street  and violently raped her. See  Griselda had every opportunity to go to school  it just wasn't safe for her to get there. And Griselda's not the only one. Around the world  poor women and girls between the ages of    and     they are    when victims of  the everyday violence of domestic abuse and sexual violence    those two forms of violence account for more death and disability than malaria  than car accidents  than war combined. The truth is  the poor of our world are trapped in whole systems of violence. In South Asia  for instance  I could drive past this rice mill and see this man hoisting  these     pound sacks of rice upon his thin back. But I would have no idea  until later  that he was actually a slave  held by violence in that rice mill since I was in high school. Decades of anti poverty programs right in his community were never able to rescue him or any of the hundred other slaves from the beatings and the rapes and the torture of violence inside the rice mill. In fact  half a century of  anti poverty programs have left more poor people in slavery than in any other time in human history. Experts tell us that there's about    million people in slavery today. That's about the population  of the entire nation of Canada  where we're sitting today. This is why  over time  I have come to call this epidemic of violence the Locust Effect. Because in the lives of the poor  it just descends like a plague and it destroys everything. In fact  now when you survey very  very poor communities  residents will tell you that their greatest fear is violence. But notice the violence that they fear is not the violence of  genocide or the wars  it's everyday violence. So for me  as a lawyer  of course  my first reaction was to think  well  of course we've got to change all the laws. We've got to make all this violence against the poor illegal. But then I found out  it already is. The problem is not that  the poor don't get laws  it's that they don't get law enforcement. In the developing world  basic law enforcement systems are so broken that recently the U.N. issued  a report that found that  most poor people live outside the protection of the law.  Now honestly  you and I have  just about no idea of what that would mean because we have no  first hand experience of it. Functioning law enforcement for us  is just a total assumption. In fact  nothing expresses that assumption more clearly than three simple numbers         which  of course  is the number for the emergency police operator here in Canada and in the United States  where the average response time  to a police     emergency call is about    minutes. So we take this just  completely for granted. But what if there was no  law enforcement to protect you  A woman in Oregon recently experienced what this would be like. She was home alone in her  dark house on a Saturday night  when a man started to tear  his way into her home. This was her worst nightmare  because this man had actually put her in the hospital from an assault just two weeks before. So terrified  she picks up that phone and does what any of us would do  She calls        but only to learn that because  of budget cuts in her county  law enforcement wasn't available  on the weekends. Listen. Dispatcher  I don't have anybody  to send out there. Woman  OK Dispatcher  Um  obviously if he comes inside the residence and assaults you  can you ask him to go away  Or do you know if he is intoxicated or anything  Woman  I've already asked him. I've already told him I was calling you. He's broken in before  busted down my door  assaulted me. Dispatcher  Uh huh. Woman  Um  yeah  so ... Dispatcher  Is there any way you could safely leave the residence  Woman  No  I can't  because he's blocking pretty much my only way out. Dispatcher  Well  the only thing I can do  is give you some advice  and call the sheriff's office tomorrow. Obviously  if he comes in and unfortunately has a weapon or is trying to cause you physical harm  that's a different story. You know  the sheriff's office doesn't work up there. I don't have anybody to send.  Gary Haugen  Tragically  the woman  inside that house was violently assaulted  choked and raped because this is what it means to live outside the rule of law. And this is where billions of our poorest live. What does that look like  In Bolivia  for example  if a man  sexually assaults a poor child  statistically  he's at greater risk of slipping in the shower and dying than he is of ever going  to jail for that crime. In South Asia  if you  enslave a poor person  you're at greater risk of being  struck by lightning than ever being sent  to jail for that crime. And so the epidemic of everyday  violence  it just rages on. And it devastates our efforts to try to help billions of people out of their two dollar a day hell. Because the data just doesn't lie. It turns out that you can give  all manner of goods and services to the poor  but if you don't restrain the hands  of the violent bullies from taking it all away  you're going to be very disappointed in the long term impact of your efforts. So you would think that the disintegration of basic law enforcement in the developing world would be a huge priority for the global fight against poverty. But it's not. Auditors of international assistance recently couldn't find even one percent of aid going  to protect the poor from the lawless chaos  of everyday violence. And honestly  when we do talk about  violence against the poor  sometimes it's in the weirdest of ways. A fresh water organization tells a heart wrenching story of girls who are raped on the way to fetching water  and then celebrates the solution of a new well that drastically shortens their walk. End of story. But not a word about the rapists who are still right there in the community. If a young woman on one  of our college campuses was raped on her walk to the library  we would never celebrate the solution of moving the library closer to the dorm. And yet  for some reason  this is okay for poor people. Now the truth is  the traditional experts in economic development and poverty alleviation  they don't know how to fix this problem. And so what happens  They don't talk about it. But the more fundamental reason that law enforcement for the poor in the developing world is so neglected  is because the people inside the developing world  with money  don't need it. I was at the World Economic  Forum not long ago talking to corporate executives who have massive businesses in the developing world and I was just asking them   How do you guys protect all your people and property from all the violence   And they looked at each other   and they said  practically in unison   We buy it.  Indeed  private security forces  in the developing world are now  four  five and seven times larger than the public police force. In Africa  the largest employer  on the continent now is private security. But see  the rich can pay for safety and can keep getting richer  but the poor can't pay for it and they're left totally unprotected and they keep getting thrown to the ground. This is a massive and scandalous outrage. And it doesn't have to be this way. Broken law enforcement can be fixed. Violence can be stopped. Almost all criminal justice systems  they start out broken and corrupt  but they can be transformed by fierce effort and commitment. The path forward is really pretty clear. Number one  We have to start making stopping violence indispensable  to the fight against poverty. In fact  any conversation about global poverty that doesn't include the problem  of violence must be deemed not serious. And secondly  we have to begin  to seriously invest resources and share expertise to support  the developing world as they fashion new   public systems of justice  not private security  that give everybody a chance to be safe. These transformations  are actually possible and they're happening today. Recently  the Gates Foundation  funded a project in the second largest city  of the Philippines  where local advocates and local law enforcement were able to transform corrupt police and broken courts so drastically  that in just four short years  they were able to measurably reduce the commercial sexual violence  against poor kids by    percent. You know  from the hindsight of history  what's always most inexplicable and inexcusable are the simple failures of compassion. Because I think history convenes  a tribunal of our grandchildren and they just ask us   Grandma  Grandpa  where were you  Where were you  Grandpa  when  the Jews were fleeing Nazi Germany and were being rejected from our shores  Where were you  And Grandma  where were you when they were marching our Japanese American neighbors off to internment camps  And Grandpa  where were you  when they were beating our African American neighbors just because they were trying to register to vote   Likewise  when our grandchildren ask us   Grandma  Grandpa  where were you when two billion of the world's poorest were drowning in a lawless chaos of everyday violence   I hope we can say that we had compassion  that we raised our voice  and as a generation  we were moved to make the violence stop. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Really powerfully argued. Talk to us a bit about some of the things that have actually been happening to  for example  boost police training. How hard a process is that  GH  Well  one of the glorious  things that's starting to happen now is that the collapse of these systems and the consequences are becoming obvious. There's actually  now   political will to do that. But it just requires now an investment of resources and transfer of expertise. There's a political will struggle  that's going to take place as well  but those are winnable fights  because we've done some examples around the world at International Justice Mission that are very encouraging. CA  So just tell us in one country  how much it costs to make a material difference  to police  for example    I know that's only one piece of it. GH  In Guatemala  for instance  we've started a project there with the local police  and court system  prosecutors  to retrain them so that they can  actually effectively bring these cases. And we've seen prosecutions against perpetrators of sexual violence increase by more than       percent. This project has been very modestly funded at about a million dollars a year  and the kind of bang  you can get for your buck in terms of leveraging a criminal justice system that could function if it were properly trained and motivated and led  and these countries   especially a middle class that is seeing that there's  really no future with this total instability and total privatization of security I think there's an opportunity  a window for change. CA  But to make this happen  you have to look at each part in the chain    the police  who else  GH  So that's the thing  about law enforcement  it starts out with the police  they're the front end of the pipeline of justice  but they hand if off to the prosecutors  and the prosecutors  hand it off to the courts  and the survivors of violence  have to be supported by social services all the way through that. So you have to do an approach  that pulls that all together. In the past  there's been a little bit of training of the courts  but they get crappy evidence  from the police  or a little police intervention  that has to do with narcotics or terrorism but nothing to do with treating the common poor person with excellent law enforcement  so it's about pulling that all together  and you can actually have people in very poor communities experience law enforcement like us  which is imperfect in our  own experience  for sure  but boy  is it a great thing to sense that you can call     and maybe someone will protect you. CA  Gary  I think you've done  a spectacular job of bringing this to the world's attention in your book and right here today. Thanks so much. Gary Haugen. My first love was for the night sky. Love is complicated. You're looking at a fly through of the  Hubble Space Telescope Ultra Deep Field  one of the most distant images of our universe ever observed. Everything you see here is a galaxy  comprised of billions of stars each. And the farthest galaxy is  a trillion  trillion kilometers away. As an astrophysicist  I have the awesome privilege of studying some of the most exotic objects  in our universe. The objects that have captivated me  from first crush throughout my career are supermassive   hyperactive black holes. Weighing one to    billion times  the mass of our own sun  these galactic black holes  are devouring material  at a rate of upwards of        times more than your  average   supermassive black hole. These two characteristics  with a few others  make them quasars. At the same time  the objects I study are producing some of the most powerful particle streams ever observed. These narrow streams  called jets  are moving at   .   percent  of the speed of light  and are pointed directly at the Earth. These jetted  Earth pointed  hyperactive and supermassive black holes are called blazars  or blazing quasars. What makes blazars so special is that they're some of the universe's most efficient particle accelerators  transporting incredible amounts of energy throughout a galaxy. Here  I'm showing an artist's conception of a blazar. The dinner plate by which  material falls onto the black hole is called the accretion disc  shown here in blue. Some of that material is slingshotted around the black hole and accelerated to insanely high speeds in the jet  shown here in white. Although the blazar system is rare  the process by which nature pulls in material via a disk  and then flings some of it out via a jet  is more common. We'll eventually zoom out of  the blazar system to show its approximate relationship to the larger galactic context. Beyond the cosmic accounting of what goes in to what goes out  one of the hot topics in  blazar astrophysics right now is where the highest energy  jet emission comes from. In this image  I'm interested in where this white blob forms and if  as a result  there's any  relationship between the jet and the accretion disc material. Clear answers to this question were almost completely inaccessible until       when NASA launched a new telescope that better detects gamma ray light    that is  light with energies a million times higher than your standard x ray scan. I simultaneously compare variations between the gamma ray light data and the visible light data from day to day and year to year  to better localize these gamma ray blobs. My research shows that in some instances  these blobs form much closer to the black hole than we initially thought. As we more confidently localize where these gamma ray  blobs are forming  we can better understand how jets are being accelerated  and ultimately reveal  the dynamic processes by which some of the most fascinating objects in our universe are formed. This all started as a love story. And it still is. This love transformed me from  a curious  stargazing young girl to a professional astrophysicist  hot on the heels of celestial discovery. Who knew that chasing after the universe would ground me so deeply to my mission here on Earth. Then again  when do we ever know where love's first flutter will truly take us. Thank you. Virtual reality started for me in sort of an unusual place. It was the     s. I got into the field very young  I was seven years old. And the tool that I used  to access virtual reality was the Evel Knievel stunt cycle. This is a commercial for  that particular item  Evel's riding the amazing stunt cycle. That gyro power sends him  over     feet at top speed. Chris Milk  So this was my joy back then. I rode this motorcycle everywhere. And I was there with Evel Knievel  we  jumped the Snake River Canyon together. I wanted the rocket. I never got the rocket  I only got the motorcycle. I felt so connected to this world. I didn't want to be a storyteller  when I grew up  I wanted to be stuntman. I was there. Evel Knievel was my friend. I had so much empathy for him. But it didn't work out.  Laughter  I went to art school. I started making music videos. And this is one of the early music videos that I made  CM  You may notice  some slight similarities here. And I got that rocket. So  now I'm a filmmaker  or  the beginning of a filmmaker  and I started using the tools that are available to me as a filmmaker to try to tell the most compelling stories that I can to an audience. And film is this incredible medium that allows us to feel empathy for people that are very different than us and worlds completely  foreign from our own. Unfortunately  Evel Knievel did not feel the same  empathy for us that we felt for him  and he sued us for this video    shortly thereafter. On the upside  the man  that I worshipped as a child  the man that I wanted  to become as an adult  I was finally able to get his autograph. Let's talk about film now. Film  it's an incredible medium  but essentially  it's the same now as it was then. It's a group of rectangles that are played in a sequence. And we've done incredible things with those rectangles. But I started thinking about  is there a way that I can use modern and developing technologies to tell stories in different ways and tell different kinds of stories that maybe I couldn't tell using the traditional tools of filmmaking that we've been using for     years  So I started experimenting  and what I was trying to do was to build the ultimate empathy machine. And here's one of the early experiments  So this is called  The Wilderness Downtown.  It was a collaboration with Arcade Fire. It asked you to put in the address where you grew up at the beginning of it. It's a website. And out of it starts growing these little boxes with different browser windows. And you see this teenager  running down a street  and then you see Google Street View and Google Maps imagery and you realize the street he's running down is yours. And when he stops in front of a house  he stops in front of your house. And this was great  and I saw people  having an even deeper emotional reaction to this than the things that  I had made in rectangles. And I'm essentially taking  a piece of your history and putting it inside  the framing of the story. But then I started thinking  okay  well that's a part of you  but how do I put all of you inside of the frame  So to do that  I started making art installations. And this is one called   The Treachery of Sanctuary.  It's a triptych. I'm going to show you the third panel. So now I've got you inside of the frame  and I saw people having even more visceral emotional reactions to this work than the previous one. But then I started thinking about frames  and what do they represent  And a frame is just a window. I mean  all the media that we watch    television  cinema    they're these windows into  these other worlds. And I thought  well  great.  I got you in a frame. But I don't want you in the frame  I don't want you in the window  I want you through the window  I want you on the other side  in the world  inhabiting the world. So that leads me back to virtual reality. Let's talk about virtual reality. Unfortunately  talking about virtual reality is like dancing about architecture. And this is actually someone dancing about architecture in virtual reality. So  it's difficult to explain. Why is it difficult to explain  It's difficult because it's a very  experiential medium. You feel your way inside of it. It's a machine  but inside of it  it feels like real life  it feels like truth. And you feel present in the world that you're inside and you feel present with the people that you're inside of it with. So  I'm going to show you a demo of a virtual reality film  a full screen version of all the information that we capture when we shoot virtual reality. So we're shooting in every direction. This is a camera system that we built that has  D cameras that look in every direction and binaural microphones that face in every direction. We take this and we build  basically  a sphere of a world that you inhabit. So what I'm going to show you is not a view into the world  it's basically the whole world stretched into a rectangle. So this film is called   Clouds Over Sidra   and it was made in conjunction with  our virtual reality company called VRSE and the United Nations  and a co collaborator named Gabo Arora. And we went to a Syrian refugee camp in Jordan in December and shot the story of a    year old girl there named Sidra. And she and her family fled Syria through the desert into Jordan and she's been living in this camp for the last year and a half. I am    years old. I am in the fifth grade. I am from Syria  in the Daraa Province  Inkhil City. I have lived here in the Zaatari camp in Jordan for the last year and a half. I have a big family  three brothers  one is a baby. He cries a lot. I asked my father if I cried when  I was a baby and he says I did not. I think I was a stronger baby than my brother. CM  So  when you're inside  of the headset. you're not seeing it like this. You're looking around through this world. You'll notice you see full     degrees  in all directions. And when you're sitting there in her room  watching her  you're not watching it through a television screen  you're not watching it through a window  you're sitting there with her. When you look down  you're sitting on the same ground that she's sitting on. And because of that  you feel her humanity in a deeper way. You empathize with her in a deeper way. And I think that we can change minds with this machine. And we've already started to try to change a few. So we took this film to the World Economic Forum in Davos in January. And we showed it to a group of people whose decisions affect the lives of millions of people. And these are people  who might not otherwise be sitting in a tent  in a refugee camp in Jordan. But in January  one afternoon in Switzerland  they suddenly all found themselves there. And they were affected by it. So we're going to make more of them. We're working with the  United Nations right now to shoot a whole series of these films. We just finished shooting a story in Liberia. And now  we're going  to shoot a story in India. And we're taking these films  and we're showing them  at the United Nations to people that work there and people that are visiting there. And we're showing  them to the people that can actually change the lives of the people inside of the films. And that's where I think we just start to scratch the surface of the true power of virtual reality. It's not a video game peripheral. It connects humans to other humans in a profound way that I've never seen before  in any other form of media. And it can change people's perception of each other. And that's how I think virtual reality has the potential to actually change the world. So  it's a machine  but through this machine we become more compassionate  we become more empathetic  and we become more connected. And ultimately  we become more human. Thank you. Growing up  I didn't always understand why my parents made me follow the rules that they did. Like  why did I really  have to mow the lawn  Why was homework really that important  Why couldn't I put jelly beans  in my oatmeal  My childhood was abound with questions like this. Normal things about being a kid and realizing that sometimes  it was best to listen to my parents even when I didn't exactly understand why. And it's not that they didn't want me to think critically. Their parenting always sought  to reconcile the tension between having my siblings and I understand the realities of the world  while ensuring that we never accepted the status quo as inevitable. I came to realize that this  in and of itself  was a very purposeful form of education. One of my favorite educators  Brazilian author and scholar Paulo Freire  speaks quite explicitly about the need for education to be used as a tool for critical  awakening and shared humanity. In his most famous book   Pedagogy of the Oppressed   he states   No one can be  authentically human while he prevents others from being so.  I've been thinking a lot about this  lately  this idea of humanity  and specifically  who in this world is afforded the privilege of being perceived as fully human. Over the course of  the past several months  the world has watched as unarmed black men  and women  have had their lives taken at the hands of police and vigilante. These events and all that  has transpired after them have brought me back to my own childhood and the decisions that my parents made about raising a black boy in America that growing up  I didn't always understand in the way that I do now. I think of how hard it must have been  how profoundly unfair it must have felt for them to feel like they had  to strip away parts of my childhood just so that I could come home at night. For example  I think of how one night  when I was around    years old  on an overnight field trip to another city  my friends and I bought Super Soakers and turned the hotel parking lot into our own water filled battle zone. We hid behind cars  running through the darkness that lay between the streetlights  boundless laughter ubiquitous  across the pavement. But within    minutes  my father came outside   grabbed me by my forearm and led me into our room with an unfamiliar grip. Before I could say anything  tell him how foolish he had  made me look in front of my friends  he derided me for being so naive. Looked me in the eye   fear consuming his face  and said   Son  I'm sorry  but you can't act the same  as your white friends. You can't pretend to shoot guns. You can't run around in the dark. You can't hide behind anything other than your own teeth.  I know now how scared he must have been  how easily I could have fallen into the empty of the night  that some man would mistake this water for a good reason to wash all of this away. These are the sorts of messages I've been inundated with my entire life  Always keep your hands where they  can see them  don't move too quickly  take off your hood when the sun goes down. My parents raised me and my siblings in an armor of advice  an ocean of alarm bells so someone wouldn't steal the breath from our lungs  so that they wouldn't make a memory of this skin. So that we could be kids   not casket or concrete. And it's not because they thought it would make us better than anyone else it's simply because they wanted  to keep us alive. All of my black friends were raised with the same message  the talk  given to us  when we became old enough to be mistaken for a nail ready to be hammered to the ground  when people made our melanin synonymous with something to be feared. But what does it do to a child to grow up knowing that you cannot simply be a child  That the whims of adolescence are too dangerous for your breath  that you cannot simply be curious  that you are not afforded the luxury of making a mistake  that someone's implicit bias might be the reason you don't wake up in the morning. But this cannot be what defines us. Because we have parents who raised us to understand that our bodies weren't meant for the backside of a bullet  but for flying kites and jumping rope  and laughing until our stomachs burst. We had teachers who taught us  how to raise our hands in class  and not just to signal surrender  and that the only thing we should give up is the idea that we  aren't worthy of this world. So when we say that black lives matter  it's not because others don't  it's simply because we must affirm that we are worthy of existing without fear  when so many things tell us we are not. I want to live in a world where my son will not be presumed guilty the moment he is born  where a toy in his hand isn't mistaken for anything other than a toy. And I refuse to accept that we can't build this world into something new  some place where a child's name doesn't have to be written  on a t shirt  or a tombstone  where the value of someone's life isn't determined by anything other  than the fact that they had lungs  a place where every single  one of us can breathe. Thank you. These dragons from deep time are incredible creatures. They're bizzarre  they're beautiful  and there's very little we know about them. These thoughts were going through my head when I looked at the pages of my first dinosaur book. I was about five years old at the time  and I decided there and then that I would become a paleontologist. Paleontology allowed me  to combine my love for animals with my desire to travel to  far flung corners of the world. And now  a few years later  I've led several expeditions to the ultimate far flung corner  on this planet  the Sahara. I've worked in the Sahara because I've been on a quest to uncover new remains of a bizarre  giant predatory dinosaur called Spinosaurus. A few bones of this animal have been found in the deserts of Egypt and were described about     years ago by a German paleontologist. Unfortunately  all his Spinosaurus bones were destroyed in World War II. So all we're left with are just a few drawings and notes. From these drawings  we know that this creature  which lived  about     million years ago  was very big  it had tall spines on its back  forming a magnificent sail  and it had long  slender jaws   a bit like a crocodile  with conical teeth  that may have been used  to catch slippery prey  like fish. But that was pretty much  all we knew about this animal for the next     years. My fieldwork took me to the border region between Morocco and Algeria  a place called the Kem Kem. It's a difficult place to work in. You have to deal with sandstorms and snakes and scorpions  and it's very difficult to find good fossils there. But our hard work paid off. We discovered many incredible specimens. There's the largest dinosaur bone that had ever been found in this part of the Sahara. We found remains of giant predatory dinosaurs  medium sized predatory dinosaurs  and seven or eight different kinds of crocodile like hunters. These fossils were deposited in a river system. The river system was also home  to a giant  car sized coelacanth  a monster sawfish  and the skies over the river system were filled with pterosaurs  flying reptiles. It was a pretty dangerous place  not the kind of place where you'd want to travel to if you had a time machine. So we're finding all these  incredible fossils of animals that lived alongside Spinosaurus  but Spinosaurus itself proved to be very elusive. We were just finding bits and pieces and I was hoping that we'd find a partial skeleton at some point. Finally  very recently  we were able to track down a dig site where a local fossil hunter found several bones of Spinosaurus. We returned to the site  we collected more bones. And so after     years we finally had another partial skeleton of this bizarre creature. And we were able to reconstruct it. We now know that  Spinosaurus had a head a little bit like a crocodile  very different from other  predatory dinosaurs  very different from the T. rex. But the really interesting information came from the rest of the skeleton. We had long spines  the spines forming the big sail. We had leg bones  we had skull bones  we had paddle shaped feet  wide feet    again  very unusual  no other dinosaur has feet like this    and we think they may have been used to walk on soft sediment  or maybe for paddling in the water. We also looked at the fine microstructure of the bone  the inside structure of Spinosaurus bones  and it turns out that they're very dense and compact. Again  this is something we see in animals that spend a lot of time in the water  it's useful for buoyancy  control in the water. We C.T. scanned all of our bones and built a digital Spinosaurus skeleton. And when we looked  at the digital skeleton  we realized that yes  this was a dinosaur unlike any other. It's bigger than a T. rex  and yes  the head has  fish eating  written all over it  but really the entire skeleton has  water loving  written all over it    dense bone  paddle like feet  and the hind limbs are reduced in size  and again  this is something we see in animals that spend a substantial amount  of time in the water. So  as we fleshed out our Spinosaurus    I'm looking at muscle attachments and wrapping our dinosaur in skin    we realize that we're dealing with a river monster  a predatory dinosaur  bigger than T. rex  the ruler of this ancient river of giants  feeding on the many aquatic animals I showed you earlier on. So that's really what makes this an incredible discovery. It's a dinosaur like no other. And some people told me   Wow  this is a once in a lifetime discovery. There are not many things left to discover in the world.  Well  I think nothing could be  further from the truth. I think the Sahara's  still full of treasures  and when people tell me there are no places left to explore  I like to quote a famous dinosaur hunter  Roy Chapman Andrews  and he said   Always  there has been an adventure just around the corner    and the world is still full of corners.  That was true many decades ago when Roy Chapman Andrews wrote these lines. And it is still true today. Thank you. I work with a bunch of mathematicians  philosophers and computer scientists  and we sit around and think about the future of machine intelligence  among other things. Some people think that some of these things are sort of science fiction y  far out there  crazy. But I like to say  okay  let's look at the modern human condition. This is the normal way for things to be. But if we think about it  we are actually recently arrived guests on this planet  the human species. Think about if Earth was created one year ago  the human species  then   would be    minutes old. The industrial era started two seconds ago. Another way to look at this is to think of world GDP over the last        years  I've actually taken the trouble to plot this for you in a graph. It looks like this. It's a curious shape for a normal condition. I sure wouldn't want to sit on it. Let's ask ourselves  what is the cause of this current anomaly  Some people would say it's technology. Now it's true  technology has accumulated through human history  and right now  technology advances extremely rapidly    that is the proximate cause  that's why we are currently  so very productive. But I like to think back further  to the ultimate cause. Look at these two highly distinguished gentlemen  We have Kanzi    he's mastered     lexical tokens  an incredible feat. And Ed Witten unleashed the second superstring revolution. If we look under the hood   this is what we find  basically the same thing. One is a little larger  it maybe also has a few tricks in the exact way it's wired. These invisible differences cannot be too complicated  however  because there have only been         generations since our last common ancestor. We know that complicated mechanisms take a long time to evolve. So a bunch of relatively minor changes take us from Kanzi to Witten  from broken off tree branches to intercontinental ballistic missiles. So this then seems pretty obvious that everything we've achieved  and everything we care about  depends crucially on some relatively minor changes that made the human mind. And the corollary  of course  is that any further changes that could significantly change the substrate of thinking could have potentially  enormous consequences. Some of my colleagues  think we're on the verge of something that could cause a profound change in that substrate  and that is machine superintelligence. Artificial intelligence used to be about putting commands in a box. You would have human programmers that would painstakingly  handcraft knowledge items. You build up these expert systems  and they were kind of useful  for some purposes  but they were very brittle  you couldn't scale them. Basically  you got out only what you put in. But since then  a paradigm shift has taken place in the field of artificial intelligence. Today  the action is really  around machine learning. So rather than handcrafting knowledge representations and features  we create algorithms that learn  often from raw perceptual data. Basically the same thing that the human infant does. The result is A.I. that is not limited to one domain    the same system can learn to translate  between any pairs of languages  or learn to play any computer game on the Atari console. Now of course  A.I. is still nowhere near having the same powerful  cross domain ability to learn and plan as a human being has. The cortex still has some  algorithmic tricks that we don't yet know how to match in machines. So the question is  how far are we from being able to match those tricks  A couple of years ago  we did a survey of some of the world's  leading A.I. experts  to see what they think  and one of the questions we asked was   By which year do you think there is a    percent probability that we will have achieved  human level machine intelligence   We defined human level here  as the ability to perform almost any job at least as well as an adult human  so real human level  not just within some limited domain. And the median answer was      or       depending on precisely which  group of experts we asked. Now  it could happen much  much later  or sooner  the truth is nobody really knows. What we do know is that the ultimate  limit to information processing in a machine substrate lies far outside  the limits in biological tissue. This comes down to physics. A biological neuron fires  maybe   at     hertz      times a second. But even a present day transistor operates at the Gigahertz. Neurons propagate slowly in axons      meters per second  tops. But in computers  signals can travel at the speed of light. There are also size limitations  like a human brain has  to fit inside a cranium  but a computer can be the size of a warehouse or larger. So the potential for superintelligence  lies dormant in matter  much like the power of the atom  lay dormant throughout human history  patiently waiting there until     . In this century  scientists may learn to awaken the power of artificial intelligence. And I think we might then see an intelligence explosion. Now most people  when they think about what is smart and what is dumb  I think have in mind a picture roughly like this. So at one end we have the village idiot  and then far over at the other side we have Ed Witten  or Albert Einstein  or whoever your favorite guru is. But I think that from the point of view of artificial intelligence  the true picture is actually probably more like this  AI starts out at this point here  at zero intelligence  and then  after many  many  years of really hard work  maybe eventually we get to mouse level artificial intelligence  something that can navigate  cluttered environments as well as a mouse can. And then  after many  many more years of really hard work  lots of investment  maybe eventually we get to chimpanzee level artificial intelligence. And then  after even more years  of really  really hard work  we get to village idiot  artificial intelligence. And a few moments later   we are beyond Ed Witten. The train doesn't stop at Humanville Station. It's likely  rather  to swoosh right by. Now this has profound implications  particularly when it comes  to questions of power. For example  chimpanzees are strong    pound for pound  a chimpanzee is about twice as strong as a fit human male. And yet  the fate of Kanzi  and his pals depends a lot more on what we humans do than on what the chimpanzees do themselves. Once there is superintelligence  the fate of humanity may depend on what the superintelligence does. Think about it  Machine intelligence is the last invention that humanity will ever need to make. Machines will then be better  at inventing than we are  and they'll be doing so  on digital timescales. What this means is basically a telescoping of the future. Think of all the crazy technologies  that you could have imagined maybe humans could have developed in the fullness of time  cures for aging  space colonization  self replicating nanobots or uploading of minds into computers  all kinds of science fiction y stuff that's nevertheless consistent  with the laws of physics. All of this superintelligence could  develop  and possibly quite rapidly. Now  a superintelligence with such  technological maturity would be extremely powerful  and at least in some scenarios  it would be able to get what it wants. We would then have a future that would be shaped by the preferences of this A.I. Now a good question is  what are those preferences  Here it gets trickier. To make any headway with this  we must first of all avoid anthropomorphizing. And this is ironic because  every newspaper article about the future of A.I. has a picture of this  So I think what we need to do is to conceive of the issue more abstractly  not in terms of vivid Hollywood scenarios. We need to think of intelligence  as an optimization process  a process that steers the future into a particular set of configurations. A superintelligence is a really strong optimization process. It's extremely good at using  available means to achieve a state in which its goal is realized. This means that there is no necessary conenction between being highly intelligent in this sense  and having an objective that we humans would find worthwhile or meaningful. Suppose we give an A.I. the goal  to make humans smile. When the A.I. is weak  it performs useful or amusing actions that cause its user to smile. When the A.I. becomes superintelligent  it realizes that there is a more effective way to achieve this goal  take control of the world and stick electrodes into the facial muscles of humans to cause constant  beaming grins. Another example  suppose we give A.I. the goal to solve a difficult mathematical problem. When the A.I. becomes superintelligent  it realizes that the most effective way  to get the solution to this problem is by transforming the planet into a giant computer  so as to increase its thinking capacity. And notice that this gives the A.I.s an instrumental reason to do things to us that we might not approve of. Human beings in this model are threats  we could prevent the mathematical problem from being solved. Of course  perceivably things won't  go wrong in these particular ways  these are cartoon examples. But the general point here is important  if you create a really powerful optimization process to maximize for objective x  you better make sure  that your definition of x incorporates everything you care about. This is a lesson that's also taught in many a myth. King Midas wishes that everything he touches be turned into gold. He touches his daughter   she turns into gold. He touches his food  it turns into gold. This could become practically relevant  not just as a metaphor for greed  but as an illustration of what happens if you create a powerful optimization process and give it misconceived  or poorly specified goals. Now you might say  if a computer starts sticking electrodes into people's faces  we'd just shut it off. A  this is not necessarily so easy to do if we've grown dependent on the system    like  where is the off switch  to the Internet  B  why haven't the chimpanzees flicked the off switch to humanity  or the Neanderthals  They certainly had reasons. We have an off switch   for example  right here. The reason is that we are  an intelligent adversary  we can anticipate threats  and plan around them. But so could a superintelligent agent  and it would be much better  at that than we are. The point is  we should not be confident that we have this under control here. And we could try to make our job a little bit easier by  say  putting the A.I. in a box  like a secure software environment  a virtual reality simulation from which it cannot escape. But how confident can we be that the A.I. couldn't find a bug. Given that merely human hackers find bugs all the time  I'd say  probably not very confident. So we disconnect the ethernet cable to create an air gap  but again  like merely human hackers routinely transgress air gaps using social engineering. Right now  as I speak  I'm sure there is some employee out there somewhere who has been talked into handing out  her account details by somebody claiming to be from the I.T. department. More creative scenarios are also possible  like if you're the A.I.  you can imagine wiggling electrodes around in your internal circuitry to create radio waves that you can use to communicate. Or maybe you could pretend to malfunction  and then when the programmers open you up to see what went wrong with you  they look at the source code    Bam     the manipulation can take place. Or it could output the blueprint to a really nifty technology  and when we implement it  it has some surreptitious side effect that the A.I. had planned. The point here is that we should  not be confident in our ability to keep a superintelligent genie locked up in its bottle forever. Sooner or later  it will out. I believe that the answer here is to figure out how to create superintelligent A.I. such that even if    when    it escapes  it is still safe because it is fundamentally on our side because it shares our values. I see no way around  this difficult problem. Now  I'm actually fairly optimistic that this problem can be solved. We wouldn't have to write down  a long list of everything we care about  or worse yet  spell it out  in some computer language like C   or Python  that would be a task beyond hopeless. Instead  we would create an A.I. that uses its intelligence to learn what we value  and its motivation system is constructed in such a way that it is motivated to pursue our values or to perform actions that it predicts we would approve of. We would thus leverage  its intelligence as much as possible to solve the problem of value loading. This can happen  and the outcome could be  very good for humanity. But it doesn't happen automatically. The initial conditions  for the intelligence explosion might need to be set up  in just the right way if we are to have a controlled detonation. The values that the A.I. has need to match ours  not just in the familiar context  like where we can easily check how the A.I. behaves  but also in all novel contexts that the A.I. might encounter in the indefinite future. And there are also some esoteric issues that would need to be solved  sorted out  the exact details of its decision theory  how to deal with logical uncertainty and so forth. So the technical problems that need to be solved to make this work look quite difficult    not as difficult as making  a superintelligent A.I.  but fairly difficult. Here is the worry  Making superintelligent A.I. is a really hard challenge. Making superintelligent A.I. that is safe involves some additional  challenge on top of that. The risk is that if somebody figures out how to crack the first challenge without also having cracked  the additional challenge of ensuring perfect safety. So I think that we should work out a solution to the control problem in advance  so that we have it available  by the time it is needed. Now it might be that we cannot solve the entire control problem in advance because maybe some elements can only be put in place once you know the details of the  architecture where it will be implemented. But the more of the control problem that we solve in advance  the better the odds that the transition to the machine intelligence era will go well. This to me looks like a thing that is well worth doing and I can imagine that if  things turn out okay  that people a million years from now look back at this century and it might well be that they say that the one thing we did that really mattered was to get this thing right. Thank you. The brain is an amazing and complex organ. And while many people are fascinated by the brain  they can't really tell you that much about the properties about how the brain works because we don't teach neuroscience in schools. And one of the reasons why is that the equipment is so complex and so expensive that it's really only done at major universities and large institutions. And so in order to be able to access the brain  you really need to dedicate your life and spend six and a half years as a graduate student just to become a neuroscientist to get access to these tools. And that's a shame because one out of five of us  that's    percent of the entire world  will have a neurological disorder. And there are zero cures for these diseases. And so it seems that what we should be doing is reaching back earlier in the eduction process and teaching students about neuroscience so that in the future  they may be thinking about possibly becoming a brain scientist. When I was a graduate student  my lab mate Tim Marzullo and myself  decided that what if we took this complex equipment that we have for studying the brain and made it simple enough and affordable enough that anyone that you know  an amateur or a high school student  could learn and actually participate in the discovery of neuroscience. And so we did just that. A few years ago  we started a company called Backyard Brains and we make DIY neuroscience equipment and I brought some here tonight  and I want to do some demonstrations. You guys want to see some  So I need a volunteer. So right before    what is your name   Applause  Sam Kelly  Sam. Greg Gage  All right  Sam  I'm going to record from your brain. Have you had this before  SK  No. GG  I need you to stick out your arm for science  roll up your sleeve a bit  So what I'm going to do  I'm putting electrodes on your arm  and you're probably wondering  I just said I'm going to record from your brain  what am I doing with your arm  Well  you have about    billion neurons inside your brain right now. They're sending electrical messages back and forth  and chemical messages. But some of your neurons right here in your motor cortex are going to send messages down when you move your arm like this. They're going to go down across your corpus callosum  down onto your spinal cord to your lower motor neuron out to your muscles here  and that electrical discharge is going to be picked up by these electrodes right here and we're going to be able to listen to exactly what your brain is going to be doing. So I'm going to turn this on for a second. Have you ever heard what your brain sounds like  SK  No. GG  Let's try it out. So go ahead and squeeze your hand. So what you're listening to  so this is your motor units happening right here. Let's take a look at it as well. So I'm going to stand over here  and I'm going to open up our app here. So now I want you to squeeze. So right here  these are the motor units that are happening from her spinal cord out to her muscle right here  and as she's doing it  you're seeing the electrical activity that's happening here. You can even click here and try to see one of them. So keep doing it really hard. So now we've paused on one motor action potential that's happening right now inside of your brain. Do you guys want to see some more  That's interesting  but let's get it better. I need one more volunteer. What is your name  sir  Miguel Goncalves  Miguel. GG  Miguel  all right. You're going to stand right here. So when you're moving your arm like this  your brain is sending a signal down to your muscles right here. I want you to move your arm as well. So your brain is going to send a signal down to your muscles. And so it turns out that there is a nerve that's right here that runs up here that innervates these three fingers  and it's close enough to the skin that we might be able to stimulate that so that what we can do is copy your brain signals going out to your hand and inject it into your hand  so that your hand will move when your brain tells your hand to move. So in a sense  she will take away your free will and you will no longer have any control over this hand. You with me  So I just need to hook you up. So I'm going to find your ulnar nerve  which is probably right around here. You don't know what you're signing up for when you come up. So now I'm going to move away and we're going to plug it in to our human to human interface over here. Okay  so Sam  I want you to squeeze your hand again. Do it again. Perfect. So now I'm going to hook you up over here so that you get the    It's going to feel a little bit weird at first  this is going to feel like a     Laughter  You know  when you lose your free will  and someone else becomes your agent  it does feel a bit strange. Now I want you to relax your hand. Sam  you're with me  So you're going to squeeze. I'm not going to turn it on yet  so go ahead and give it a squeeze. So now  are you ready  Miguel  MG  Ready as I'll ever be. GG  I've turned it on  so go ahead and turn your hand. Do you feel that a little bit  MG  Nope. GG  Okay  do it again  MG  A little bit. GG  A little bit   Laughter  So relax. So hit it again. Oh  perfect  perfect. So relax  do it again. All right  so right now  your brain is controlling your arm and it's also controlling his arm  so go ahead and just do it one more time. All right  so it's perfect.  Laughter  So now  what would happen if I took over my control of your hand  And so  just relax your hand. What happens  Ah  nothing. Why not  Because the brain has to do it. So you do it again. All right  that's perfect. Thank you guys for being such a good sport. This is what's happening all across the world    electrophysiology  We're going to bring on the neuro revolution. Thank you. Hi. I'm going to talk  to you today about laughter  and I just want to start  by thinking about the first time I can ever remember noticing laughter. This is when I was a little girl. I would've been about six. And I came across my parents doing something unusual  where they were laughing. They were laughing very  very hard. They were lying on the floor laughing. They were screaming with laughter. I did not know what they were  laughing at  but I wanted in. I wanted to be part of that  and I kind of sat around at the edge going   Hoo hoo    Laughter  Now  incidentally  what they were laughing at was a song which people used to sing  which was based around signs in toilets on trains telling you what you could and could not do in toilets on trains. And the thing you have to remember about the English is  of course  we do have an immensely sophisticated sense of humor. At the time  though  I didn't understand anything of that. I just cared about the laughter  and actually  as a neuroscientist  I've come to care about it again. And it is a really weird thing to do. What I'm going to do now is just play some examples of real human beings laughing  and I want you think about the sound people make and how odd that can be  and in fact how primitive laughter is as a sound. It's much more like an animal call than it is like speech. So here we've got some laughter for you. The first one is pretty joyful. Now this next guy  I need him to breathe. There's a point in there where I'm just  like  you've got to get some air in there  mate  because he just sounds like he's breathing out. This hasn't been edited  this is him. And finally we have     this is a human female laughing. And laughter can take us to some pretty odd places in terms of making noises. She actually says   Oh my God  what is that   in French. We're all kind of with her. I have no idea. Now  to understand laughter  you have to look at a part of the body that psychologists and neuroscientists don't normally spend much time looking at  which is the ribcage  and it doesn't seem terribly exciting  but actually you're all using  your ribcage all the time. What you're all doing  at the moment with your ribcage  and don't stop doing it  is breathing. So you use the intercostal muscles  the muscles between your ribs  to bring air in and out of your lungs just by expanding and contracting your ribcage  and if I was to put a strap  around the outside of your chest called a breath belt  and just look  at that movement  you see a rather gentle sinusoidal movement  so that's breathing. You're all doing it. Don't stop. As soon as you start talking  you start using your breathing completely differently. So what I'm doing now is you see something much more like this. In talking  you use very fine movements of the ribcage to squeeze the air out    and in fact  we're the only animals that can do this. It's why we can talk at all. Now  both talking and breathing has a mortal enemy  and that enemy is laughter  because what happens when you laugh is those same muscles start to contract very regularly  and you get this very marked sort of zig zagging  and that's just squeezing the air out of you. It literally is that basic a way of making a sound. You could be stamping on somebody  it's having the same effect. You're just squeezing air out  and each of those contractions    Ha     gives you a sound. And as the contractions run together  you can get these spasms  and that's when you start getting these     Wheezing     things happening. I'm brilliant at this.  Laughter  Now  in terms of the science of laughter  there isn't very much  but it does turn out that pretty much everything we think we know about laughter is wrong. So it's not at all unusual  for example  to hear people to say humans are the only animals that laugh. Nietzsche thought that humans are the only animals that laugh. In fact  you find laughter throughout the mammals. It's been well described and well observed in primates  but you also see it in rats  and wherever you find it    humans  primates  rats    you find it associated with things like tickling. That's the same for humans. You find it associated with play  and all mammals play. And wherever you find it  it's associated with interactions. So Robert Provine  who has done a lot of work on this  has pointed out that you are    times  more likely to laugh if you are with somebody else than if you're on your own  and where you find most laughter is in social interactions like conversation. So if you ask human beings   When do you laugh   they'll talk about comedy and they'll talk about humor and they'll talk about jokes. If you look at when they laugh  they're laughing with their friends. And when we laugh with people  we're hardly ever actually laughing at jokes. You are laughing to show people that you understand them  that you agree with them  that you're part of the same group as them. You're laughing to show that you like them. You might even love them. You're doing all that at the same time as talking to them  and the laughter is doing a lot of that emotional work for you. Something that Robert Provine has pointed out  as you can see here  and the reason why we were laughing when we heard those funny laughs at the start  and why I was laughing when I found my parents laughing  is that it's an enormously behaviorally contagious effect. You can catch laughter from somebody else  and you are more likely to catch laughter off somebody else if you know them. So it's still modulated by this social context. You have to put humor to one side and think about the social  meaning of laughter because that's where its origins lie. Now  something I've got very interested in is different kinds of laughter  and we have some neurobiological evidence about how human beings vocalize that suggests there might be two kinds of laughs that we have. So it seems possible that the neurobiology for helpless  involuntary laughter  like my parents lying on the floor screaming about a silly song  might have a different basis to it than some of that more polite social laughter that you encounter  which isn't horrible laughter  but it's behavior somebody is doing as part of their communicative act to you  part of their interaction with you  they are choosing to do this. In our evolution  we have developed two different ways of vocalizing. Involuntary vocalizations are part of an older system than the more voluntary vocalizations like the speech I'm doing now. So we might imagine that laughter might actually have two different roots. So I've been looking at this in more detail. To do this  we've had to make recordings of people laughing  and we've had to do whatever it takes to make people laugh  and we got those same people to produce more posed  social laughter. So imagine your friend told a joke  and you're laughing because you like your friend  but not really because the joke's all that. So I'm going to play you  a couple of those. I want you to tell me if you think this laughter is real laughter  or if you think it's posed. So is this involuntary laughter or more voluntary laughter  What does that sound like to you  Audience  Posed. Sophie Scott  Posed  Posed. How about this one  I'm the best. Not really. No  that was helpless laughter  and in fact  to record that  all they had to do was record me watching one of my friends listening to something I knew she wanted to laugh at  and I just started doing this. What you find is that people are good at telling the difference between real and posed laughter. They seem to be different things to us. Interestingly  you see something quite similar with chimpanzees. Chimpanzees laugh differently if they're being tickled than if they're playing with each other  and we might be seeing something like that here  involuntary laughter  tickling laughter  being different from social laughter. They're acoustically very different. The real laughs are longer. They're higher in pitch. When you start laughing hard  you start squeezing air out from your lungs under much higher pressures than you could ever produce voluntarily. For example  I could never pitch my voice that high to sing. Also  you start to get these sort of contractions and weird whistling sounds  all of which mean that real laughter is extremely easy  or feels extremely easy to spot. In contrast  posed laughter  we might think it sounds a bit fake. Actually  it's not  it's actually an important social cue. We use it a lot  we're choosing to laugh in a lot of situations  and it seems to be its own thing. So  for example  you find nasality in posed laughter  that kind of  ha ha ha ha ha  sound that you never get  you could not do  if you were laughing involuntarily. So they do seem to be genuinely these two different sorts of things. We took it into the scanner to see how brains respond when you hear laughter. And when you do this  this is a really boring experiment. We just played people real and posed laughs. We didn't tell them it was a study on laughter. We put other sounds in there  to distract them  and all they're doing is lying listening to sounds. We don't tell them to do anything. Nonetheless  when you hear real laughter and when you hear posed laughter  the brains are responding completely differently  significantly differently. What you see in the regions in blue  which lies in auditory cortex  are the brain areas that respond more to the real laughs  and what seems to be the case  when you hear somebody laughing involuntarily  you hear sounds you would never hear in any other context. It's very unambiguous  and it seems to be associated with greater auditory processing of these novel sounds. In contrast  when you hear somebody laughing in a posed way  what you see are these regions in pink  which are occupying brain areas associated with mentalizing  thinking about what somebody else is thinking. And I think what that means is  even if you're having your brain scanned  which is completely boring and not very interesting  when you hear somebody going   A ha ha ha ha ha   you're trying to work out why they're laughing. Laughter is always meaningful. You are always trying to understand it in context  even if  as far as you are concerned  at that point in time  it has not necessarily anything to do with you  you still want to know why those people are laughing. Now  we've had the opportunity to look  at how people hear real and posed laughter across the age range. So this is an online experiment we ran with the Royal Society  and here we just asked people two questions. First of all  they heard some laughs  and they had to say  how real  or posed do these laughs sound  The real laughs are shown in red and the posed laughs are shown in blue. What you see is there is a rapid onset. As you get older  you get better and better at spotting real laughter. So six year olds are at chance  they can't really hear the difference. By the time you are older  you get better  but interestingly  you do not hit peak performance in this dataset until you are in your late   s and early   s. You don't understand laughter fully by the time you hit puberty. You don't understand laughter fully by the time your brain has matured at the end of your teens. You're learning about laughter throughout your entire early adult life. If we turn the question around and now say not  what does the laughter sound like in terms of being real or posed  but we say  how much does this laughter make you want to laugh  how contagious is this laughter to you  we see a different profile. And here  the younger you are  the more you want to join in when you hear laughter. Remember me laughing with my parents when I had no idea what was going on. You really can see this. Now everybody  young and old  finds the real laughs more contagious than the posed laughs  but as you get older  it all becomes  less contagious to you. Now  either we're all just becoming really grumpy as we get older  or it may mean that as you understand laughter better  and you are getting better at doing that  you need more than just hearing people laugh to want to laugh. You need the social stuff there. So we've got a very interesting behavior about which a lot of our lay assumptions are incorrect  but I'm coming to see that actually there's even more to laughter than it's an important social emotion we should look at  because it turns out people are phenomenally nuanced in terms of how we use laughter. There's a really lovely set of studies coming out from Robert Levenson's lab in California  where he's doing a longitudinal study with couples. He gets married couples  men and women  into the lab  and he gives them stressful conversations to have while he wires them up to a polygraph so he can see them becoming stressed. So you've got the two of them in there  and he'll say to the husband   Tell me something that your wife does that irritates you.  And what you see is immediately    just run that one through your head briefly  you and your partner    you can imagine everybody gets a bit more stressed as soon as that starts. You can see physically  people become more stressed. What he finds is that the couples who manage that feeling of stress with laughter  positive emotions like laughter  not only immediately become less stressed  they can see them physically feeling better  they're dealing with this unpleasant situation better together  they are also the couples that report high levels of satisfaction in their relationship and they stay together for longer. So in fact  when you look at close relationships  laughter is a phenomenally useful index of how people are regulating their emotions together. We're not just emitting it at each other to show that we like each other  we're making ourselves feel better together. Now  I don't think this is going to be limited to romantic relationships. I think this is probably going to be a characteristic of close emotional relationships such as you might have with friends  which explains my next clip  which is of a YouTube video of some young men in the former East Germany on making a video to promote their heavy metal band  and it's extremely macho  and the mood is very serious  and I want you to notice what happens in terms of laughter when things go wrong and how quickly that happens  and how that changes the mood. He's cold. He's about to get wet. He's got swimming trunks on  got a towel. Ice. What might possibly happen  Video starts. Serious mood. And his friends are already laughing. They are already laughing  hard. He's not laughing yet. He's starting to go now. And now they're all off. They're on the floor. The thing I really like about that is it's all very serious until he jumps onto the ice  and as soon as he doesn't go through the ice  but also there isn't blood and bone everywhere  his friends start laughing. And imagine if that had played him out with him standing there going   No seriously  Heinrich  I think this is broken   we wouldn't enjoy watching that. That would be stressful. Or if he was running around with a visibly broken leg laughing  and his friends are going   Heinrich  I think we need to go to the hospital now   that also wouldn't be funny. The fact that the laughter works  it gets him from a painful  embarrassing  difficult situation  into a funny situation  into what we're  actually enjoying there  and I think that's  a really interesting use  and it's actually happening all the time. For example  I can remember something like this happening at my father's funeral. We weren't jumping around on the ice in our underpants. We're not Canadian. These events are always difficult  I had a relative who was being a bit difficult  my mum was not in a good place  and I can remember finding myself just before the whole thing started telling this story about something that happened in a     s sitcom  and I just thought at the time  I don't know why I'm doing this  and what I realized I was doing was I was coming up with something from somewhere I could use to make her laugh together with me. It was a very basic reaction to find some reason we can do this. We can laugh together. We're going to get through this. We're going to be okay. And in fact  all of us are doing this all the time. You do it so often  you don't even notice it. Everybody underestimates how often they laugh  and you're doing something  when you laugh with people  that's actually letting you access a really ancient evolutionary system that mammals have evolved to make and maintain social bonds  and clearly to regulate emotions  to make ourselves feel better. It's not something specific to humans    it's a really ancient behavior which really helps us regulate how we feel and makes us feel better. In other words  when it comes to laughter  you and me  baby  ain't nothing  but mammals.  Laughter  Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  On the path that American children  travel to adulthood  two institutions oversee the journey. The first is the one we hear  a lot about  college. Some of you may remember the excitement that you felt when you first set off for college. Some of you may be in college right now and you're feeling this excitement at this very moment. College has some shortcomings. It's expensive  it leaves young people in debt. But all in all  it's a pretty good path. Young people emerge from college with pride and with great friends and with a lot of knowledge  about the world. And perhaps most importantly  a better chance in the labor market than they had before they got there. Today I want to talk about the second institution overseeing the journey from childhood to adulthood in the United States. And that institution is prison. Young people on this journey are meeting with probation officers instead of with teachers. They're going to court dates instead of to class. Their junior year abroad is instead a trip to a state correctional facility. And they're emerging from their   s not with degrees in business and English  but with criminal records. This institution is also costing us a lot  about        dollars a year to send a young person to prison in New Jersey. But here  taxpayers are footing the bill and what kids are getting is a cold prison cell and a permanent mark against them when they come home and apply for work. There are more and more kids on this journey to adulthood than ever before in the United States and that's because in the past    years  our incarceration rate  has grown by     percent. I have one slide for this talk. Here it is. Here's our incarceration rate  about     people per         in the population. Here's the OECD countries. What's more  it's poor kids that we're sending to prison  too many drawn from African American and Latino communities so that prison now stands firmly between the young people trying to make it and the fulfillment of the American Dream. The problem's actually  a bit worse than this 'cause we're not just sending  poor kids to prison  we're saddling poor kids with court fees  with probation and parole restrictions  with low level warrants  we're asking them to live  in halfway houses and on house arrest  and we're asking them  to negotiate a police force that is entering poor communities of color  not for the purposes  of promoting public safety  but to make arrest counts  to line city coffers. This is the hidden underside to our historic experiment in punishment  young people worried that at any moment  they will be stopped  searched and seized. Not just in the streets   but in their homes  at school and at work. I got interested in this  other path to adulthood when I was myself a college student attending the University of Pennsylvania in the early     s. Penn sits within a historic  African American neighborhood. So you've got these two parallel journeys going on simultaneously  the kids attending  this elite  private university  and the kids from  the adjacent neighborhood  some of whom are making it to college  and many of whom  are being shipped to prison. In my sophomore year  I started tutoring a young woman who was in high school who lived about    minutes away from the university. Soon  her cousin came home  from a juvenile detention center. He was     a freshman in high school. I began to get to know him  and his friends and family  and I asked him what he thought  about me writing about his life for my senior thesis in college. This senior thesis became a dissertation at Princeton and now a book. By the end of my sophomore year  I moved into the neighborhood and I spent the next six years trying to understand what young people were facing as they came of age. The first week I spent in this neighborhood  I saw two boys  five and seven years old  play this game of chase  where the older boy ran after the other boy. He played the cop. When the cop caught up to the younger boy  he pushed him down  handcuffed him with imaginary handcuffs  took a quarter out of  the other child's pocket  saying   I'm seizing that.  He asked the child if  he was carrying any drugs or if he had a warrant. Many times  I saw this game repeated  sometimes children would  simply give up running  and stick their bodies flat  against the ground with their hands above their heads  or flat up against a wall. Children would yell at each other   I'm going to lock you up  I'm going to lock you up and you're never coming home   Once I saw a six year old child pull another child's pants down and try to do a cavity search. In the first    months that I lived in this neighborhood  I wrote down every time I saw any contact between police and people that were my neighbors. So in the first    months  I watched the police stop  pedestrians or people in cars  search people  run people's names  chase people through the streets  pull people in for questioning  or make an arrest every single day  with five exceptions. Fifty two times  I watched the police break down doors  chase people through houses or make an arrest of someone in their home. Fourteen times in this first year and a half  I watched the police punch  choke  kick  stomp on or beat young men after they had caught them. Bit by bit  I got to know two brothers  Chuck and Tim. Chuck was    when we met  a senior in high school. He was playing on the basketball team and making C's and B's. His younger brother  Tim  was   . And Tim loved Chuck  he followed him around a lot  looked to Chuck to be a mentor. They lived with their mom and grandfather in a two story row home  with a front lawn and a back porch. Their mom was struggling with addiction all while the boys were growing up. She never really was able  to hold down a job for very long. It was their grandfather's pension that supported the family  not really enough to pay for food and clothes and school supplies for growing boys. The family was really struggling. So when we met  Chuck was a senior in high school. He had just turned   . That winter  a kid in the schoolyard called Chuck's mom a crack whore. Chuck pushed the kid's face into the snow and the school cops charged him  with aggravated assault. The other kid was fine the next day  I think it was his pride that was injured more than anything. But anyway  since Chuck was     this agg. assault case sent him  to adult county jail on State Road in northeast Philadelphia  where he sat  unable to pay the bail    he couldn't afford it    while the trial dates  dragged on and on and on through almost his entire senior year. Finally  near the end of this season  the judge on this assault case threw out most of the charges and Chuck came home with only a few hundred dollars' worth of court fees hanging over his head. Tim was pretty happy that day. The next fall  Chuck tried  to re enroll as a senior  but the school secretary told him that he was then    and too old  to be readmitted. Then the judge on his assault case issued him a warrant for his arrest because he couldn't pay  the     dollars in court fees that came due a few weeks after the case ended. Then he was a high school dropout living on the run. Tim's first arrest came later that year after he turned   . Chuck had managed to get his warrant lifted and he was on a payment plan for the court fees and he was driving Tim to school in his girlfriend's car. So a cop pulls them over  runs the car  and the car comes up  as stolen in California. Chuck had no idea where in the history of this car it had been stolen. His girlfriend's uncle bought it from a used car auction in northeast Philly. Chuck and Tim had never been outside of the tri state  let alone to California. But anyway  the cops down at the precinct charged Chuck with  receiving stolen property. And then a juvenile judge   a few days later  charged Tim  age     with accessory to receiving a stolen property and then he was placed on  three years of probation. With this probation sentence  hanging over his head  Chuck sat his little brother down and began teaching him how to run from the police. They would sit side by side  on their back porch looking out into the shared alleyway and Chuck would coach Tim how to spot undercover cars  how to negotiate a late night police raid  how and where to hide. I want you to imagine for a second what Chuck and Tim's lives would be like if they were living in a neighborhood where kids were going to college  not prison. A neighborhood like the one  I got to grow up in. Okay  you might say. But Chuck and Tim  kids like them  they're committing crimes  Don't they deserve to be in prison  Don't they deserve to be  living in fear of arrest  Well  my answer would be no. They don't. And certainly not for the same things  that other young people with more privilege are doing with impunity. If Chuck had gone to my high school  that schoolyard fight  would have ended there  as a schoolyard fight. It never would have become an aggravated assault case. Not a single kid that I went to college with has a criminal record right now. Not a single one. But can you imagine how many might have if the police had stopped those kids and searched their pockets for drugs as they walked to class  Or had raided their frat parties in the middle of the night  Okay  you might say. But doesn't this high incarceration rate partly account for our  really low crime rate  Crime is down. That's a good thing. Totally  that is a good thing. Crime is down. It dropped precipitously in the '  s and through the     s. But according to a committee of academics convened by the National Academy of Sciences last year  the relationship between our historically high incarceration rates and our low crime rate is pretty shaky. It turns out that the crime rate goes up and down irrespective of how many young people we send to prison. We tend to think about justice in a pretty narrow way  good and bad  innocent and guilty. Injustice is about being  wrongfully convicted. So if you're convicted  of something you did do  you should be punished for it. There are innocent and guilty people  there are victims and  there are perpetrators. Maybe we could think a little bit more broadly than that. Right now  we're asking kids who live in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods  who have the least amount of family resources  who are attending  the country's worst schools  who are facing the toughest time in the labor market  who are living in neighborhoods where violence is an everyday problem  we're asking these kids to walk the thinnest possible line    to basically never do anything wrong. Why are we not providing support to young kids facing these challenges  Why are we offering only handcuffs  jail time and this fugitive existence  Can we imagine something better  Can we imagine a criminal justice system that prioritizes recovery  prevention  civic inclusion  rather than punishment  A criminal justice system  that acknowledges the legacy of exclusion that poor people of color in the U.S. have faced and that does not promote and perpetuate those exclusions. And finally  a criminal justice system that believes in black young people  rather than treating black young people  as the enemy to be rounded up. The good news is that we already are. A few years ago  Michelle Alexander wrote  The New Jim Crow   which got Americans to see  incarceration as a civil rights issue of historic proportions in a way they had not seen it before. President Obama and Attorney General  Eric Holder have come out very strongly on sentencing reform  on the need to address  racial disparity in incarceration. We're seeing states throw out Stop and Frisk as the civil rights violation that it is. We're seeing cities and states decriminalize possession of marijuana. New York  New Jersey and California have been dropping their  prison populations  closing prisons  while also seeing a big drop in crime. Texas has gotten into the game now  also closing prisons   investing in education. This curious coalition is building  from the right and the left  made up of former prisoners and fiscal conservatives  of civil rights activists and libertarians  of young people taking to the streets to protest police violence against unarmed black teenagers  and older  wealthier people    some of you are here in the audience    pumping big money into  decarceration initiatives In a deeply divided Congress  the work of reforming  our criminal justice system is just about the only thing that the right and the left are coming together on. I did not think I would see this political moment in my lifetime. I think many of the people who have been working tirelessly to write about the causes and consequences of our historically  high incarceration rates did not think we would see this moment in our lifetime. The question for us now is  how much can we make of it  How much can we change  I want to end with a call to young people  the young people attending college and the young people struggling to stay out of prison or to make it through prison and return home. It may seem like these paths to adulthood are worlds apart  but the young people participating in these two institutions conveying us to adulthood  they have one thing in common  Both can be leaders in the work of reforming our criminal justice system. Young people have always been leaders in the fight for equal rights  the fight for more people  to be granted dignity and a fighting chance at freedom. The mission for the generation  of young people coming of age in this  a sea change moment  potentially  is to end mass incarceration and  build a new criminal justice system  emphasis on the word justice. Thanks. I am a plant geneticist. I study genes that make plants resistant to disease and tolerant of stress. In recent years  millions of people around the world have come to believe that there's something sinister about genetic modification. Today  I am going to provide a different perspective. First  let me introduce my husband  Raoul. He's an organic farmer. On his farm  he plants a variety of different crops. This is one of the many ecological farming practices he uses to keep his farm healthy. Imagine some of the reactions we get   Really  An organic farmer and a plant geneticist  Can you agree on anything   Well  we can  and it's not difficult  because we have the same goal. We want to help nourish the growing population without further destroying the environment. I believe this is the greatest challenge of our time. Now  genetic modification is not new  virtually everything we eat has been genetically modified in some manner. Let me give you a few examples. On the left is an image of the ancient ancestor of modern corn. You see a single roll of grain that's covered in a hard case. Unless you have a hammer  teosinte isn't good for making tortillas. Now  take a look at the ancient ancestor of banana. You can see the large seeds. And unappetizing brussel sprouts  and eggplant  so beautiful. Now  to create these varieties  breeders have used many different genetic techniques over the years. Some of them are quite creative  like mixing two different species together using a process called grafting to create this variety that's half tomato and half potato. Breeders have also used other types of genetic techniques  such as random mutagenesis  which induces uncharacterized mutations into the plants. The rice in the cereal that many of us fed our babies was developed using this approach. Now  today  breeders have even more options to choose from. Some of them are extraordinarily precise. I want to give you a couple examples from my own work. I work on rice  which is a staple food for more than half the world's people. Each year     percent of the potential harvest is lost to pest and disease. For this reason  farmers plant rice varieties that carry genes for resistance. This approach has been used for nearly     years. Yet  when I started graduate school  no one knew what these genes were. It wasn't until the     s that scientists finally uncovered the genetic basis of resistance. In my laboratory  we isolated a gene for immunity to a very serious bacterial disease in Asia and Africa. We found we could engineer the gene into a conventional rice variety that's normally susceptible  and you can see the two leaves on the bottom here are highly resistant to infection. Now  the same month that my laboratory published our discovery on the rice immunity gene  my friend and colleague Dave Mackill stopped by my office. He said   Seventy million rice farmers are having trouble growing rice.  That's because their fields are flooded  and these rice farmers are living on less than two dollars a day. Although rice grows well in standing water  most rice varieties will die if they're submerged for more than three days. Flooding is expected to be increasingly problematic as the climate changes. He told me that his graduate student Kenong Xu and himself were studying an ancient variety of rice that had an amazing property. It could withstand two weeks of complete submergence. He asked if I would be willing to help them isolate this gene. I said yes    I was very excited  because I knew if we were successful  we could potentially help millions of farmers grow rice even when their fields were flooded. Kenong spent    years looking for this gene. Then one day  he said   Come look at this experiment. You've got to see it.  I went to the greenhouse and I saw that the conventional variety that was flooded for    days had died  but the rice variety that we had genetically engineered with a new gene we had discovered  called Sub   was alive. Kenong and I were amazed and excited that a single gene could have this dramatic effect. But this is just a greenhouse experiment. Would this work in the field  Now  I'm going to show you a four month time lapse video taken at the International Rice Research Institute. Breeders there developed a rice variety carrying the Sub  gene using another genetic technique called precision breeding. On the left  you can see the Sub  variety  and on the right is the conventional variety. Both varieties do very well at first  but then the field is flooded for    days. You can see the Sub  variety does great. In fact  it produces three and a half times more grain than the conventional variety. I love this video because it shows the power of plant genetics to help farmers. Last year  with the help of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation  three and a half million farmers grew Sub  rice. Thank you. Now  many people don't mind genetic modification when it comes to moving rice genes around  rice genes in rice plants  or even when it comes to mixing species together through grafting or random mutagenesis. But when it comes to taking genes from viruses and bacteria and putting them into plants  a lot of people say   Yuck.  Why would you do that  The reason is that sometimes it's the cheapest  safest  and most effective technology for enhancing food security and advancing sustainable agriculture. I'm going to give you three examples. First  take a look at papaya. It's delicious  right  But now  look at this papaya. This papaya is infected with papaya ringspot virus. In the     s  this virus nearly wiped out the entire production of papaya on the island of Oahu in Hawaii. Many people thought that the Hawaiian papaya was doomed  but then  a local Hawaiian  a plant pathologist named Dennis Gonsalves  decided to try to fight this disease using genetic engineering. He took a snippet of viral DNA and he inserted it into the papaya genome. This is kind of like a human getting a vaccination. Now  take a look at his field trial. You can see the genetically engineered papaya in the center. It's immune to infection. The conventional papaya around the outside is severely infected with the virus. Dennis' pioneering work is credited with rescuing the papaya industry. Today     years later  there's still no other method to control this disease. There's no organic method. There's no conventional method. Eighty percent of Hawaiian papaya is genetically engineered. Now  some of you may still feel a little queasy about viral genes in your food  but consider this  The genetically engineered papaya carries just a trace amount of the virus. If you bite into an organic or conventional papaya that is infected with the virus  you will be chewing on tenfold more viral protein. Now  take a look at this pest feasting on an eggplant. The brown you see is frass  what comes out the back end of the insect. To control this serious pest  which can devastate the entire eggplant crop in Bangladesh  Bangladeshi farmers spray insecticides two to three times a week  sometimes twice a day  when pest pressure is high. But we know that some insecticides are very harmful to human health  especially when farmers and their families cannot afford proper protection  like these children. In less developed countries  it's estimated that         people die every year because of insecticide misuse and exposure. Cornell and Bangladeshi scientists decided to fight this disease using a genetic technique that builds on an organic farming approach. Organic farmers like my husband Raoul spray an insecticide called B.T.  which is based on a bacteria. This pesticide is very specific to caterpillar pests  and in fact  it's nontoxic to humans  fish and birds. It's less toxic than table salt. But this approach does not work well in Bangladesh. That's because these insecticide sprays are difficult to find  they're expensive  and they don't prevent the insect from getting inside the plants. In the genetic approach  scientists cut the gene out of the bacteria and insert it directly into the eggplant genome. Will this work to reduce insecticide sprays in Bangladesh  Definitely. Last season  farmers reported they were able to reduce their insecticide use by a huge amount  almost down to zero. They're able to harvest and replant for the next season. Now  I've given you a couple examples of how genetic engineering can be used to fight pests and disease and to reduce the amount of insecticides. My final example is an example where genetic engineering can be used to reduce malnutrition. In less developed countries          children go blind every year because of lack of Vitamin A. More than half will die. For this reason  scientists supported by the Rockefeller Foundation genetically engineered a golden rice to produce beta carotene  which is the precursor of Vitamin A. This is the same pigment that we find in carrots. Researchers estimate that just one cup of golden rice per day will save the lives of thousands of children. But golden rice is virulently opposed by activists who are against genetic modification. Just last year  activists invaded and destroyed a field trial in the Philippines. When I heard about the destruction  I wondered if they knew that they were destroying much more than a scientific research project  that they were destroying medicines that children desperately needed to save their sight and their lives. Some of my friends and family still worry  How do you know genes in the food are safe to eat  I explained the genetic engineering  the process of moving genes between species  has been used for more than    years in wines  in medicine  in plants  in cheeses. In all that time  there hasn't been a single case of harm to human health or the environment. But I say  look  I'm not asking you to believe me. Science is not a belief system. My opinion doesn't matter. Let's look at the evidence. After    years of careful study and rigorous peer review by thousands of independent scientists  every major scientific organization in the world has concluded that the crops currently on the market are safe to eat and that the process of genetic engineering is no more risky than older methods of genetic modification. These are precisely the same organizations that most of us trust when it comes to other important scientific issues such as global climate change or the safety of vaccines. Raoul and I believe that  instead of worrying about the genes in our food  we must focus on how we can help children grow up healthy. We must ask if farmers in rural communities can thrive  and if everyone can afford the food. We must try to minimize environmental degradation. What scares me most about the loud arguments and misinformation about plant genetics is that the poorest people who most need the technology may be denied access because of the vague fears and prejudices of those who have enough to eat. We have a huge challenge in front of us. Let's celebrate scientific innovation and use it. It's our responsibility to do everything we can to help alleviate human suffering and safeguard the environment. Thank you. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Powerfully argued. The people who argue against GMOs  as I understand it  the core piece comes from two things. One  complexity and unintended consequence. Nature is this incredibly complex machine. If we put out these brand new genes that we've created  that haven't been challenged by years of evolution  and they started mixing up with the rest of what's going on  couldn't that trigger some kind of cataclysm or problem  especially when you add in the commercial incentive that some companies have to put them out there  The fear is that those incentives mean that the decision is not made on purely scientific grounds  and even if it was  that there would be unintended consequences. How do we know that there isn't a big risk of some unintended consequence  Often our tinkerings with nature do lead to big  unintended consequences and chain reactions. Pamela Ronald  Okay  so on the commercial aspects  one thing that's really important to understand is that  in the developed world  farmers in the United States  almost all farmers  whether they're organic or conventional  they buy seed produced by seed companies. So there's definitely a commercial interest to sell a lot of seed  but hopefully they're selling seed that the farmers want to buy. It's different in the less developed world. Farmers there cannot afford the seed. These seeds are not being sold. These seeds are being distributed freely through traditional kinds of certification groups  so it is very important in less developed countries that the seed be freely available. CA  Wouldn't some activists say that this is actually part of the conspiracy  This is the heroin strategy. You seed the stuff  and people have no choice but to be hooked on these seeds forever  PR  There are a lot of conspiracy theories for sure  but it doesn't work that way. For example  the seed that's being distributed  the flood tolerant rice  this is distributed freely through Indian and Bangladeshi seed certification agencies  so there's no commercial interest at all. The golden rice was developed through support of the Rockefeller Foundation. Again  it's being freely distributed. There are no commercial profits in this situation. And now to address your other question about  well  mixing genes  aren't there some unintended consequences  Absolutely    every time we do something different  there's an unintended consequence  but one of the points I was trying to make is that we've been doing kind of crazy things to our plants  mutagenesis using radiation or chemical mutagenesis. This induces thousands of uncharacterized mutations  and this is even a higher risk of unintended consequence than many of the modern methods. And so it's really important not to use the term GMO because it's scientifically meaningless. I feel it's very important to talk about a specific crop and a specific product  and think about the needs of the consumer. CA  So part of what's happening here is that there's a mental model in a lot of people that nature is nature  and it's pure and pristine  and to tinker with it is Frankensteinian. It's making something that's pure dangerous in some way  and I think you're saying that that whole model just misunderstands how nature is. Nature is a much more chaotic interplay of genetic changes that have been happening all the time anyway. PR  That's absolutely true  and there's no such thing as pure food. I mean  you could not spray eggplant with insecticides or not genetically engineer it  but then you'd be stuck eating frass. So there's no purity there. CA  Pam Ronald  thank you.  That was powerfully argued. PR  Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Most of us think of motion as a very visual thing. If I walk across this stage or gesture with my hands while I speak  that motion is something that you can see. But there's a world of important motion that's too subtle for the human eye  and over the past few years  we've started to find that cameras can often see this motion even when humans can't. So let me show you what I mean. On the left here  you see video of a person's wrist  and on the right  you see video of a sleeping infant  but if I didn't tell you that these were videos  you might assume that you were looking at two regular images  because in both cases  these videos appear to be almost completely still. But there's actually a lot of subtle motion going on here  and if you were to touch the wrist on the left  you would feel a pulse  and if you were to hold the infant on the right  you would feel the rise and fall of her chest as she took each breath. And these motions carry a lot of significance  but they're usually too subtle for us to see  so instead  we have to observe them through direct contact  through touch. But a few years ago  my colleagues at MIT developed what they call a motion microscope  which is software that finds these subtle motions in video and amplifies them so that they become large enough for us to see. And so  if we use their software on the left video  it lets us see the pulse in this wrist  and if we were to count that pulse  we could even figure out this person's heart rate. And if we used the same software on the right video  it lets us see each breath that this infant takes  and we can use this as a contact free way to monitor her breathing. And so this technology is really powerful because it takes these phenomena that we normally have to experience through touch and it lets us capture them visually and non invasively. So a couple years ago  I started working with the folks that created that software  and we decided to pursue a crazy idea. We thought  it's cool that we can use software to visualize tiny motions like this  and you can almost think of it as a way to extend our sense of touch. But what if we could do the same thing with our ability to hear  What if we could use video to capture the vibrations of sound  which are just another kind of motion  and turn everything that we see into a microphone  Now  this is a bit of a strange idea  so let me try to put it in perspective for you. Traditional microphones work by converting the motion of an internal diaphragm into an electrical signal  and that diaphragm is designed to move readily with sound so that its motion can be recorded and interpreted as audio. But sound causes all objects to vibrate. Those vibrations are just usually too subtle and too fast for us to see. So what if we record them with a high speed camera and then use software to extract tiny motions from our high speed video  and analyze those motions to figure out what sounds created them  This would let us turn visible objects into visual microphones from a distance. And so we tried this out  and here's one of our experiments  where we took this potted plant that you see on the right and we filmed it with a high speed camera while a nearby loudspeaker played this sound. And so here's the video that we recorded  and we recorded it at thousands of frames per second  but even if you look very closely  all you'll see are some leaves that are pretty much just sitting there doing nothing  because our sound only moved those leaves by about a micrometer. That's one ten thousandth of a centimeter  which spans somewhere between a hundredth and a thousandth of a pixel in this image. So you can squint all you want  but motion that small is pretty much perceptually invisible. But it turns out that something can be perceptually invisible and still be numerically significant  because with the right algorithms  we can take this silent  seemingly still video and we can recover this sound. So how is this possible  How can we get so much information out of so little motion  Well  let's say that those leaves move by just a single micrometer  and let's say that that shifts our image by just a thousandth of a pixel. That may not seem like much  but a single frame of video may have hundreds of thousands of pixels in it  and so if we combine all of the tiny motions that we see from across that entire image  then suddenly a thousandth of a pixel can start to add up to something pretty significant. On a personal note  we were pretty psyched when we figured this out. But even with the right algorithm  we were still missing a pretty important piece of the puzzle. You see  there are a lot of factors that affect when and how well this technique will work. There's the object and how far away it is  there's the camera and the lens that you use  how much light is shining on the object and how loud your sound is. And even with the right algorithm  we had to be very careful with our early experiments  because if we got any of these factors wrong  there was no way to tell what the problem was. We would just get noise back. And so a lot of our early experiments looked like this. And so here I am  and on the bottom left  you can kind of see our high speed camera  which is pointed at a bag of chips  and the whole thing is lit by these bright lamps. And like I said  we had to be very careful in these early experiments  so this is how it went down. Mary had a little lamb  Little lamb  Little lamb  AD  So this experiment looks completely ridiculous. I mean  I'm screaming at a bag of chips    and we're blasting it with so much light  we literally melted the first bag we tried this on.  Laughter  But ridiculous as this experiment looks  it was actually really important  because we were able to recover this sound. AD  And this was really significant  because it was the first time we recovered intelligible human speech from silent video of an object. And so it gave us this point of reference  and gradually we could start to modify the experiment  using different objects or moving the object further away  using less light or quieter sounds. And we analyzed all of these experiments until we really understood the limits of our technique  because once we understood those limits  we could figure out how to push them. And that led to experiments like this one  where again  I'm going to speak to a bag of chips  but this time we've moved our camera about    feet away  outside  behind a soundproof window  and the whole thing is lit by only natural sunlight. And so here's the video that we captured. And this is what things sounded like from inside  next to the bag of chips. and everywhere that Mary went  that lamb was sure to go. AD  And here's what we were able to recover from our silent video captured outside behind that window. and everywhere that Mary went  that lamb was sure to go. AD  And there are other ways that we can push these limits as well. So here's a quieter experiment where we filmed some earphones plugged into a laptop computer  and in this case  our goal was to recover the music that was playing on that laptop from just silent video of these two little plastic earphones  and we were able to do this so well that I could even Shazam our results. And we can also push things by changing the hardware that we use. Because the experiments I've shown you so far were done with a camera  a high speed camera  that can record video about a     times faster than most cell phones  but we've also found a way to use this technique with more regular cameras  and we do that by taking advantage of what's called a rolling shutter. You see  most cameras record images one row at a time  and so if an object moves during the recording of a single image  there's a slight time delay between each row  and this causes slight artifacts that get coded into each frame of a video. And so what we found is that by analyzing these artifacts  we can actually recover sound using a modified version of our algorithm. So here's an experiment we did where we filmed a bag of candy while a nearby loudspeaker played the same  Mary Had a Little Lamb  music from before  but this time  we used just a regular store bought camera  and so in a second  I'll play for you the sound that we recovered  and it's going to sound distorted this time  but listen and see if you can still recognize the music. And so  again  that sounds distorted  but what's really amazing here is that we were able to do this with something that you could literally run out and pick up at a Best Buy. So at this point  a lot of people see this work  and they immediately think about surveillance. And to be fair  it's not hard to imagine how you might use this technology to spy on someone. But keep in mind that there's already a lot of very mature technology out there for surveillance. In fact  people have been using lasers to eavesdrop on objects from a distance for decades. But what's really new here  what's really different  is that now we have a way to picture the vibrations of an object  which gives us a new lens through which to look at the world  and we can use that lens to learn not just about forces like sound that cause an object to vibrate  but also about the object itself. And so I want to take a step back and think about how that might change the ways that we use video  because we usually use video to look at things  and I've just shown you how we can use it to listen to things. But there's another important way that we learn about the world  that's by interacting with it. We push and pull and poke and prod things. We shake things and see what happens. And that's something that video still won't let us do  at least not traditionally. So I want to show you some new work  and this is based on an idea I had just a few months ago  so this is actually the first time I've shown it to a public audience. And the basic idea is that we're going to use the vibrations in a video to capture objects in a way that will let us interact with them and see how they react to us. So here's an object  and in this case  it's a wire figure in the shape of a human  and we're going to film that object with just a regular camera. So there's nothing special about this camera. In fact  I've actually done this with my cell phone before. But we do want to see the object vibrate  so to make that happen  we're just going to bang a little bit on the surface where it's resting while we record this video. So that's it  just five seconds of regular video  while we bang on this surface  and we're going to use the vibrations in that video to learn about the structural and material properties of our object  and we're going to use that information to create something new and interactive. And so here's what we've created. And it looks like a regular image  but this isn't an image  and it's not a video  because now I can take my mouse and I can start interacting with the object. And so what you see here is a simulation of how this object would respond to new forces that we've never seen before  and we created it from just five seconds of regular video. And so this is a really powerful way to look at the world  because it lets us predict how objects will respond to new situations  and you could imagine  for instance  looking at an old bridge and wondering what would happen  how would that bridge hold up if I were to drive my car across it. And that's a question that you probably want to answer before you start driving across that bridge. And of course  there are going to be limitations to this technique  just like there were with the visual microphone  but we found that it works in a lot of situations that you might not expect  especially if you give it longer videos. So for example  here's a video that I captured of a bush outside of my apartment  and I didn't do anything to this bush  but by capturing a minute long video  a gentle breeze caused enough vibrations that we could learn enough about this bush to create this simulation. And so you could imagine giving this to a film director  and letting him control  say  the strength and direction of wind in a shot after it's been recorded. Or  in this case  we pointed our camera at a hanging curtain  and you can't even see any motion in this video  but by recording a two minute long video  natural air currents in this room created enough subtle  imperceptible motions and vibrations that we could learn enough to create this simulation. And ironically  we're kind of used to having this kind of interactivity when it comes to virtual objects  when it comes to video games and  D models  but to be able to capture this information from real objects in the real world using just simple  regular video  is something new that has a lot of potential. So here are the amazing people who worked with me on these projects. And what I've shown you today is only the beginning. We've just started to scratch the surface of what you can do with this kind of imaging  because it gives us a new way to capture our surroundings with common  accessible technology. And so looking to the future  it's going to be really exciting to explore what this can tell us about the world. Thank you. You may not realize this  but there are more bacteria in your body than stars in our entire galaxy. This fascinating universe of bacteria inside of us is an integral part of our health  and our technology is evolving so rapidly that today we can program these bacteria like we program computers. Now  the diagram that you see here  I know it looks like some kind of sports play  but it is actually a blueprint of the first bacterial program I developed. And like writing software  we can print and write DNA into different algorithms and programs inside of bacteria. What this program does is produces fluorescent proteins in a rhythmic fashion and generates a small molecule that allows bacteria to communicate and synchronize  as you're seeing in this movie. The growing colony of bacteria that you see here is about the width of a human hair. Now  what you can't see is that our genetic program instructs these bacteria to each produce small molecules  and these molecules travel between the thousands of individual bacteria telling them when to turn on and off. And the bacteria synchronize quite well at this scale  but because the molecule that synchronizes them together can only travel so fast  in larger colonies of bacteria  this results in traveling waves between bacteria that are far away from each other  and you can see these waves going from right to left across the screen. Now  our genetic program relies on a natural phenomenon called quorum sensing  in which bacteria trigger coordinated and sometimes virulent behaviors once they reach a critical density. You can observe quorum sensing in action in this movie  where a growing colony of bacteria only begins to glow once it reaches a high or critical density. Our genetic program continues producing these rhythmic patterns of fluorescent proteins as the colony grows outwards. This particular movie and experiment we call The Supernova  because it looks like an exploding star. Now  besides programming these beautiful patterns  I wondered  what else can we get these bacteria to do  And I decided to explore how we can program bacteria to detect and treat diseases in our bodies like cancer. One of the surprising facts about bacteria is that they can naturally grow inside of tumors. This happens because typically tumors are areas where the immune system has no access  and so bacteria find these tumors and use them as a safe haven to grow and thrive. We started using probiotic bacteria which are safe bacteria that have a health benefit  and found that when orally delivered to mice  these probiotics would selectively grow inside of liver tumors. We realized that the most convenient way to highlight the presence of the probiotics  and hence  the presence of the tumors  was to get these bacteria to produce a signal that would be detectable in the urine  and so we specifically programmed these probiotics to make a molecule that would change the color of your urine to indicate the presence of cancer. We went on to show that this technology could sensitively and specifically detect liver cancer  one that is challenging to detect otherwise. Now  since these bacteria specifically localize to tumors  we've been programming them to not only detect cancer but also to treat cancer by producing therapeutic molecules from within the tumor environment that shrink the existing tumors  and we've been doing this using quorum sensing programs like you saw in the previous movies. Altogether  imagine in the future taking a programmed probiotic that could detect and treat cancer  or even other diseases. Our ability to program bacteria and program life opens up new horizons in cancer research  and to share this vision  I worked with artist Vik Muniz to create the symbol of the universe  made entirely out of bacteria or cancer cells. Ultimately  my hope is that the beauty and purpose of this microscopic universe can inspire new and creative approaches for the future of cancer research. Thank you. In June of       Tori Murden McClure left Nags Head  North Carolina for France. That's her boat  the American Pearl. It's    feet long and just six feet across at its widest point. The deck was the size of a cargo bed of a Ford F     pickup truck. Tori and her friends built it by hand  and it weighed about       pounds. Her plan was to row it alone across the Atlantic Ocean    no motor  no sail    something no woman and no American had ever done before. This would be her route  over       miles across the open North Atlantic Ocean. Professionally  Tori worked as a project administrator for the city of Louisville  Kentucky  her hometown  but her real passion was exploring. This was not her first big expedition. Several years earlier  she'd become the first woman to ski to the South Pole. She was an accomplished rower in college  even competed for a spot on the      U.S. Olympic team  but this  this was different. Sector time   a.m. So that's Kentucky time now. Dawn Landes  Tori made these videos as she rowed. This is her   st day at sea. At this point  she'd covered over       miles  had had no radio contact in more than two weeks following a storm that disabled all her long range communications systems just five days in. Most days looked like this. At this point  she'd rowed over         strokes  fighting the current and the wind. Some days  she traveled as little as    feet. Yeah. And as frustrating as those days were  other days were like this. DL  She saw fish  dolphins  whales  sharks  and even some sea turtles. After two weeks with no human contact  Tori was able to contact a local cargo ship via VHF radio. Man  Heading up to a low ahead of you but it's heading  and you're obviously going northeast and there's a high behind us. That'd be coming east northeast also. TMM  Good. DL  She's pretty happy to talk to another human at this point. is going to happen soon. DL  What the weather report didn't tell her was that she was rowing right into the path of Hurricane Danielle in the worst hurricane season on record in the North Atlantic. There's a very strong wind from the east now. It's blowing about. It's blowing  After    days of storm I get to row for four hours without a flagging wind. I'm not very happy right now. As happy as I was this morning  I am unhappy now  so ... DL  After nearly three months at sea  she'd covered over       miles. She was two thirds of the way there  but in the storm  the waves were the size of a seven story building. Her boat kept capsizing. Some of them were pitchpole capsizes  flipping her end over end  and rowing became impossible. I'm in something big  bad and ugly. Two capsizes. Last capsize  I took the rib off the top of my ceiling with my back. I've had about six capsizes now. The last one was a pitchpole. I have the Argus beacon with me. I would set off the distress signal  but quite frankly  I don't think they'd ever be able to find this little boat. It's so far underwater right now  the only part that's showing pretty much is the cabin. It's about    a.m. I've lost track of the number of capsizes. I seem to capsize about every    minutes. I think I may have broken my left arm. The waves are tearing the boat to shreds. I keep praying because I'm not sure I'm going to make it through this. DL  Tori set off her distress beacon and was rescued by a passing container ship. They found her abandoned boat two months later adrift near France. I read about it in the newspaper. In       I was a high school student living in Louisville  Kentucky. Now  I live in New York City. I'm a songwriter. And her bravery stuck with me  and I'm adapting her story into a musical called  Row.  When Tori returned home  she was feeling disheartened  she was broke. She was having a hard time making the transition back into civilization. In this scene  she sits at home. The phone is ringing  her friends are calling  but she doesn't know how to talk to them. She sings this song. It's called  Dear Heart.  When I was dreaming  I took my body to beautiful places I'd never been. I saw Gibraltar  and stars of Kentucky burned in the moonlight  making me smile. And when I awoke here  the sky was so cloudy. I walked to a party where people I know try hard to know me and ask where I've been  but I can't explain what I've seen to them. Ah  listen  dear heart. Just pay attention  go right from the start. Ah  listen  dear heart. You can fall off the map  but don't fall apart. Ooh ooh ooh  ah ah ah ah ah. Ah ah  ah ah ah. When I was out there  the ocean would hold me  rock me and throw me  light as a child. But now I'm so heavy  nothing consoles me. My mind floats like driftwood  wayward and wild. Ah  listen  dear heart. Just pay attention  go right from the start. Ah  listen  dear heart. You can fall off the map  but don't fall apart. Ooh. Eventually  Tori starts to get her feet under her. She starts hanging out with her friends again. She meets a guy and falls in love for the first time. She gets a new job working for another Louisville native  Muhammad Ali. One day  at lunch with her new boss  Tori shares the news that two other women are setting out to row across the mid Atlantic  to do something that she almost died trying to do. His response was classic Ali   You don't want to go through life as the woman who almost rowed across the ocean.  He was right. Tori rebuilt the American Pearl  and in December of       she did it. Thank you. These bees are in my backyard in Berkeley  California. Until last year  I'd never kept bees before  but National Geographic asked me to photograph a story about them  and I decided  to be able to take compelling images  I should start keeping bees myself. And as you may know  bees pollinate one third of our food crops  and lately they've been having a really hard time. So as a photographer  I wanted to explore what this problem really looks like. So I'm going to show you what I found over the last year. This furry little creature is a fresh young bee halfway emerged from its brood cell  and bees right now are dealing with several different problems  including pesticides  diseases  and habitat loss  but the single greatest threat is a parasitic mite from Asia  Varroa destructor. And this pinhead sized mite crawls onto young bees and sucks their blood. This eventually destroys a hive because it weakens the immune system of the bees  and it makes them more vulnerable to stress and disease. Now  bees are the most sensitive when they're developing inside their brood cells  and I wanted to know what that process really looks like  so I teamed up with a bee lab at U.C. Davis and figured out how to raise bees in front of a camera. I'm going to show you the first    days of a bee's life condensed into    seconds. This is a bee egg as it hatches into a larva  and those newly hatched larvae swim around their cells feeding on this white goo that nurse bees secrete for them. Then  their head and their legs slowly differentiate as they transform into pupae. Here's that same pupation process  and you can actually see the mites running around in the cells. Then the tissue in their body reorganizes and the pigment slowly develops in their eyes. The last step of the process is their skin shrivels up and they sprout hair. So     Applause  As you can see halfway through that video  the mites were running around on the baby bees  and the way that beekeepers typically manage these mites is they treat their hives with chemicals. In the long run  that's bad news  so researchers are working on finding alternatives to control these mites. This is one of those alternatives. It's an experimental breeding program at the USDA Bee Lab in Baton Rouge  and this queen and her attendant bees are part of that program. Now  the researchers figured out that some of the bees have a natural ability to fight mites  so they set out to breed a line of mite resistant bees. This is what it takes to breed bees in a lab. The virgin queen is sedated and then artificially inseminated using this precision instrument. Now  this procedure allows the researchers to control exactly which bees are being crossed  but there's a tradeoff in having this much control. They succeeded in breeding mite resistant bees  but in that process  those bees started to lose traits like their gentleness and their ability to store honey  so to overcome that problem  these researchers are now collaborating with commercial beekeepers. This is Bret Adee opening one of his        beehives. He and his brother run the largest beekeeping operation in the world  and the USDA is integrating their mite resistant bees into his operation with the hope that over time  they'll be able to select the bees that are not only mite resistant but also retain all of these qualities that make them useful to us. And to say it like that makes it sound like we're manipulating and exploiting bees  and the truth is  we've been doing that for thousands of years. We took this wild creature and put it inside of a box  practically domesticating it  and originally that was so that we could harvest their honey  but over time we started losing our native pollinators  our wild pollinators  and there are many places now where those wild pollinators can no longer meet the pollination demands of our agriculture  so these managed bees have become an integral part of our food system. So when people talk about saving bees  my interpretation of that is we need to save our relationship to bees  and in order to design new solutions  we have to understand the basic biology of bees and understand the effects of stressors that we sometimes cannot see. In other words  we have to understand bees up close. Thank you. When I was nine years old  my mom asked me what I would want my house to look like  and I drew this fairy mushroom. And then she actually built it. I don't think I realized this was so unusual at the time  and maybe I still haven't  because I'm still designing houses. This is a six story bespoke home on the island of Bali. It's built almost entirely from bamboo. The living room overlooks the valley from the fourth floor. You enter the house by a bridge. It can get hot in the tropics  so we make big curving roofs to catch the breezes. But some rooms have tall windows to keep the air conditioning in and the bugs out. This room we left open. We made an air conditioned  tented bed. And one client wanted a TV room in the corner of her living room. Boxing off an area with tall walls just didn't feel right  so instead  we made this giant woven pod. Now  we do have all the necessary luxuries  like bathrooms. This one is a basket in the corner of the living room  and I've got tell you  some people actually hesitate to use it. We have not quite figured out our acoustic insulation. So there are lots of things that we're still working on  but one thing I have learned is that bamboo will treat you well if you use it right. It's actually a wild grass. It grows on otherwise unproductive land    deep ravines  mountainsides. It lives off of rainwater  spring water  sunlight  and of the       species of bamboo that grow across the world  we use just seven of them. That's my dad. He's the one who got me building with bamboo  and he is standing in a clump of Dendrocalamus asper niger that he planted just seven years ago. Each year  it sends up a new generation of shoots. That shoot  we watched it grow a meter in three days just last week  so we're talking about sustainable timber in three years. Now  we harvest from hundreds of family owned clumps. Betung  as we call it  it's really long  up to    meters of usable length. Try getting that truck down the mountain. And it's strong  it has the tensile strength of steel  the compressive strength of concrete. Slam four tons straight down on a pole  and it can take it. Because it's hollow  it's lightweight  light enough to be lifted by just a few men  or  apparently  one woman. And when my father built Green School in Bali  he chose bamboo for all of the buildings on campus  because he saw it as a promise. It's a promise to the kids. It's one sustainable material that they will not run out of. And when I first saw these structures under construction about six years ago  I just thought  this makes perfect sense. It is growing all around us. It's strong. It's elegant. It's earthquake resistant. Why hasn't this happened sooner  and what can we do with it next  So along with some of the original builders of Green School  I founded Ibuku. Ibu means  mother   and ku means  mine   so it represents my Mother Earth  and at Ibuku  we are a team of artisans  architects and designers  and what we're doing together is creating a new way of building. Over the past five years together  we have built over    unique structures  most of them in Bali. Nine of them are at Green Village    you've just seen inside some of these homes    and we fill them with bespoke furniture  we surround them with veggie gardens  we would love to invite you all to come visit someday. And while you're there  you can also see Green School    we keep building classrooms there each year    as well as an updated fairy mushroom house. We're also working on a little house for export. This is a traditional Sumbanese home that we replicated  right down to the details and textiles. A restaurant with an open air kitchen. It looks a lot like a kitchen  right  And a bridge that spans    meters across a river. Now  what we're doing  it's not entirely new. From little huts to elaborate bridges like this one in Java  bamboo has been in use across the tropical regions of the world for literally tens of thousands of years. There are islands and even continents that were first reached by bamboo rafts. But until recently  it was almost impossible to reliably protect bamboo from insects  and so  just about everything that was ever built out of bamboo is gone. Unprotected bamboo weathers. Untreated bamboo gets eaten to dust. And so that's why most people  especially in Asia  think that you couldn't be poor enough or rural enough to actually want to live in a bamboo house. And so we thought  what will it take to change their minds  to convince people that bamboo is worth building with  much less worth aspiring to  First  we needed safe treatment solutions. Borax is a natural salt. It turns bamboo into a viable building material. Treat it properly  design it carefully  and a bamboo structure can last a lifetime. Second  build something extraordinary out of it. Inspire people. Fortunately  Balinese culture fosters craftsmanship. It values the artisan. So combine those with the adventurous outliers from new generations of locally trained architects and designers and engineers  and always remember that you are designing for curving  tapering  hollow poles. No two poles alike  no straight lines  no two by fours here. The tried and true  well crafted formulas and vocabulary of architecture do not apply here. We have had to invent our own rules. We ask the bamboo what it's good at  what it wants to become  and what it says is  respect it  design for its strengths  protect it from water  and to make the most of its curves. So we design in real  D  making scale structural models out of the same material that we'll later use to build the house. And bamboo model making  it's an art  as well as some hardcore engineering. So that's the blueprint of the house. And we bring it to site  and with tiny rulers  we measure each pole  and consider each curve  and we choose a piece of bamboo from the pile to replicate that house on site. When it comes down to the details  we consider everything. Why are doors so often rectangular  Why not round  How could you make a door better  Well  its hinges battle with gravity  and gravity will always win in the end  so why not have it pivot on the center where it can stay balanced  And while you're at it  why not doors shaped like teardrops  To reap the selective benefits and work within the constraints of this material  we have really had to push ourselves  and within that constraint  we have found space for something new. It's a challenge  how do you make a ceiling if you don't have any flat boards to work with  Let me tell you  sometimes I dream of sheet rock and plywood. But if what you've got is skilled craftsmen and itsy bitsy little splits  weave that ceiling together  stretch a canvas over it  lacquer it. How do you design durable kitchen countertops that do justice to this curving structure you've just built  Slice up a boulder like a loaf of bread  hand carve each to fit the other  leave the crusts on  and what we're doing  it is almost entirely handmade. The structural connections of our buildings are reinforced by steel joints  but we use a lot of hand whittled bamboo pins. There are thousands of pins in each floor. This floor is made of glossy and durable bamboo skin. You can feel the texture under bare feet. And the floor that you walk on  can it affect the way that you walk  Can it change the footprint that you'll ultimately leave on the world  I remember being nine years old and feeling wonder  and possibility  and a little bit of idealism. And we've got a really long way to go  there's a lot left to learn  but one thing I know is that with creativity and commitment  you can create beauty and comfort and safety and even luxury out of a material that will grow back. Thank you. I know what you're thinking   Why does that guy get to sit down   That's because this is radio. I tell radio stories about design  and I report on all kinds of stories  buildings and toothbrushes and mascots and wayfinding and fonts. My mission is to get people to engage with the design that they care about so they begin to pay attention to all forms of design. When you decode the world with design intent in mind  the world becomes kind of magical. Instead of seeing the broken things  you see all the little bits of genius that anonymous designers have sweated over to make our lives better. And that's essentially the definition of design  making life better and providing joy. And few things give me greater joy than a well designed flag. Yeah  Happy   th anniversary on your flag  Canada. It is beautiful  gold standard. Love it. I'm kind of obsessed with flags. Sometimes I bring up the topic of flags  and people are like   I don't care about flags   and then we start talking about flags  and trust me      percent of people care about flags. There's just something about them that works on our emotions. My family wrapped my Christmas presents as flags this year  including the blue gift bag that's dressed up as the flag of Scotland. I put this picture online  and sure enough  within the first few minutes  someone left a comment that said   You can take that Scottish Saltire and shove it up your ass.   Laughter  Which    see  people are passionate about flags  you know  That's the way it is. What I love about flags is that once you understand the design of flags  what makes a good flag  what makes a bad flag  you can understand the design of almost anything. So what I'm going to do here is  I cracked open an episode of my radio show       Invisible   and I'm going to reconstruct it here on stage  so when I press a button over here    Voice  S for Sound    Roman Mars  It's going to make a sound  and so whenever you hear a sound or a voice or a piece of music  it's because I pressed a button. Voice  Sssssound. RM  All right  got it  Here we go. Three  two. This is     Invisible. I'm Roman Mars. Narrator  The five basic principles of flag design. Roman Mars  According to the North American Vexillological Association. Vexillological. Ted Kaye  Vexillology is the study of flags. RM  It's that extra  lol  that makes it sound weird. Narrator  Number one  keep it simple. The flag should be so simple that a child can draw it from memory. RM  Before I moved to Chicago in       I didn't even know cities had their own flags. TK  Most larger cities do have flags. RM  Well  I didn't know that. That's Ted Kaye  by the way. TK  Hello. RM  He's a flag expert. He's a totally awesome guy. TK  I'm Ted Kaye. I have edited a scholarly journal on flag studies  and I am currently involved with the Portland Flag Association and the North American Vexillological Association. RM  Ted literally wrote the book on flag design. Narrator   Good Flag  Bad Flag.  RM  It's more of a pamphlet  really. It's about    pages. TK  Yes  it's called  Good Flag  Bad Flag  How to Design a Great Flag.  RM  And that first city flag I discovered in Chicago is a beaut  white field  two horizontal blue stripes  and four six pointed red stars down the middle. Narrator  Number two  use meaningful symbolism. TK  The blue stripes represent the water  the river and the lake. Narrator  The flag's images  colors or pattern should relate to what it symbolizes. TK  The red stars represent significant events in Chicago's history. RM  Namely  the founding of Fort Dearborn on the future site of Chicago  the Great Chicago Fire  the World Columbian Exposition  which everyone remembers because of the White City  and the Century of Progress Exposition  which no one remembers at all. Narrator  Number three  use two to three basic colors. TK  The basic rule for colors is to use two to three colors from the standard color set  red  white  blue  green  yellow and black. RM  The design of the Chicago flag has complete buy in with an entire cross section of the city. It is everywhere  every municipal building flies the flag. Whet Moser  Like  there's probably at least one store on every block near where I work that sells some sort of Chicago flag paraphernalia. RM  That's Whet Moser from Chicago magazine. WM  Today  just for example  I went to get a haircut  and when I sat down in the barber's chair  there was a Chicago flag on the box that the barber kept all his tools in  and then in the mirror there was a Chicago flag on the wall behind me. When I left  a guy passed me who had a Chicago flag badge on his backpack. RM  It's adaptable and remixable. The six pointed stars in particular show up in all kinds of places. WM  The coffee I bought the other day had a Chicago star on it. RM  It's a distinct symbol of Chicago pride. TK  When a police officer or a firefighter dies in Chicago  often it's not the flag of the  United States on his casket. It can be the flag of the city of Chicago. That's how deeply the flag has gotten into the civic imagery of Chicago. RM  And it isn't just that people love Chicago and therefore love the flag. I also think that people love Chicago more because the flag is so cool. TK  A positive feedback loop there between great symbolism and civic pride. RM  Okay. So when I moved back to San Francisco in       I researched its flag  because I had never seen it in the previous eight years I lived there. And I found it  I am sorry to say  sadly lacking. I know. It hurts me  too. TK  Well  let me start from the top. Narrator  Number one  keep it simple. TK  Keeping it simple. Narrator  The flag should be so simple that a child can draw it from memory. TK  It's a relatively complex flag. RM  Okay  here we go. Okay. The main component of the San Francisco flag is a phoenix representing the city rising from the ashes after the devastating fires of the     s. TK  A powerful symbol for San Francisco. RM  I still don't really dig the phoenix. Design wise  it manages to both be too crude and have too many details at the same time  which if you were trying for that  you wouldn't be able to do it  and it just looks bad at a distance  but having deep meaning puts that element in the plus column. Behind the phoenix  the background is mostly white  and then it has a substantial gold border around it. TK  Which is a very attractive design element. RM  I think it's okay. But     Laughter     here come the big no nos of flag design. Narrator  Number four  no lettering or seals. Never use writing of any kind. RM  Underneath the phoenix  there's a motto on a ribbon that translates to  Gold in peace  iron in war   plus    and this is the big problem    it says San Francisco across the bottom. TK  If you need to write the name of what you're representing on your flag  your symbolism has failed. RM  The United States flag doesn't say  USA  across the front. In fact  country flags  they tend to behave. Like  hats off to South Africa and Turkey and Israel and Somalia and Japan and Gambia. There's a bunch of really great country flags  but they obey good design principles because the stakes are high. They're on the international stage. But city  state and regional flags are another story. There is a scourge of bad flags  and they must be stopped. That is the truth and that is the dare. The first step is to recognize that we have a problem. A lot of people tend to think that good design is just a matter of taste  and quite honestly  sometimes it is  actually  but sometimes it isn't  all right  Here's the full list of NAVA flag design principles. Narrator  The five basic principles of flag design. Number one. TK  Keep it simple. Narrator  Number two. TK  Use meaningful symbolism. Narrator  Number three. TK  Use two to three basic colors. Narrator  Number four. TK  No lettering or seals. Narrator  Never use writing of any kind. TK  Because you can't read that at a distance. Narrator  Number five. TK  And be distinctive. RM  All the best flags tend to stick to these principles. And like I said before  most country flags are okay. But here's the thing  if you showed this list of principles to any designer of almost anything  they would say these principles    simplicity  deep meaning  having few colors or being thoughtful about colors  uniqueness  don't have  writing you can't read    all those principles apply to them  too. But sadly  good design principles are rarely invoked in U.S. city flags. Our biggest problem seems to be that fourth one. We just can't stop ourselves from putting our names on our flags  or little municipal seals with tiny writing on them. Here's the thing about municipal seals  They were designed to be on pieces of paper where you can read them  not on flags     feet away flapping in the breeze. So here's a bunch of flags again. Vexillologists call these SOBs  seals on a bedsheet     Laughter     and if you can't tell what city they go to  yeah  that's exactly the problem  except for Anaheim  apparently. They fixed it.  Laughter  These flags are everywhere in the U.S. The European equivalent of the municipal seal is the city coat of arms  and this is where we can learn a lesson for how to do things right. So this is the city coat of arms of Amsterdam. Now  if this were a United States city  the flag would probably look like this. You know  yeah.  Laughter  But instead  the flag of Amsterdam looks like this. Rather than plopping the whole coat of arms on a solid background and writing  Amsterdam  below it  they just take the key elements of the escutcheon  the shield  and they turn it into the most badass city flag in the world. And because it's so badass  those flags and crosses are found throughout Amsterdam  just like Chicago  they're used. Even though seal on a bedsheet flags are particularly painful and offensive to me  nothing can quite prepare you for one of the biggest train wrecks in vexillological history. Are you ready  It's the flag of Milwaukee  Wisconsin. I mean  it's distinctive  I'll give them that. Steve Kodis  It was adopted in     . RM  The city ran a contest and gathered a bunch of submissions with all kinds of designs. SK  And an alderman by the name of Fred Steffan cobbled together parts of the submissions to make what is now the Milwaukee flag. RM  It's a kitchen sink flag. There's a gigantic gear representing industry  there's a ship recognizing the port  a giant stalk of wheat paying homage to the brewing industry. It's a hot mess  and Steve Kodis  a graphic designer from Milwaukee  wants to change it. SK  It's really awful. It's a misstep on the city's behalf  to say the least. RM  But what puts the Milwaukee flag over the top  almost to the point of self parody  is on it is a picture of the Civil War battle flag of the Milwaukee regiment. SK  So that's the final element in it that just makes it that much more ridiculous  that there is a flag design within the Milwaukee flag. RM  On the flag. Yeah. Yeah.  Laughter  Yeah. Now  Milwaukee is a fantastic city. I've been there. I love it. The most depressing part of this flag  though  is that there have been two major redesign contests. The last one was held in     . One hundred and five entries were received. TK  But in the end  the members of the Milwaukee Arts Board decided that none of the new entries were worthy of flying over the city. RM  They couldn't agree to change that thing   Laughter  That's discouraging enough  to make you think that good design and democracy just simply do not go together. But Steve Kotas is going to try one more time to redesign the Milwaukee flag. SK  I believe Milwaukee is a great city. Every great city deserves a great flag. RM  Steve isn't ready to reveal his design yet. One of the things about proposing one of these things is you have to get people on board  and then you reveal your design. But here's the trick  If you want to design a great flag  a kickass flag like Chicago's or D.C.'s  which also has a great flag  start by drawing a one by one and a half  inch rectangle on a piece of paper. Your design has to fit within that tiny rectangle. Here's why. TK  A three by five foot flag on a pole     feet away looks about the same size as a one by one and a half inch rectangle seen about    inches from your eye. You'd be surprised by how compelling and simple the design can be when you hold yourself to that limitation. RM  Meanwhile  back in San Francisco. Is there anything we can do  TK  I like to say that in every bad flag there's a good flag trying to get out.  Laughter  The way to make  San Francisco's flag a good flag is to take the motto off because you can't read that at a distance. Take the name off  and the border might even be made thicker  so it's more a part of the flag. And I would simply take the phoenix and make it a great big element in the middle of the flag. RM  But the current phoenix  that's got to go. TK  I would simplify or stylize the phoenix. Depict a big  wide winged bird coming out of flames. Emphasize those flames. RM  So this San Francisco flag was designed by Frank Chimero based on Ted Kaye's suggestions. I don't know what he would do if we was completely unfettered and didn't follow those guidelines. Fans of my radio show and podcast  they've heard me complain about bad flags. They've sent me other suggested designs. This one's by Neil Mussett. Both are so much better. And I think if they were adopted  I would see them around the city. In my crusade to make flags of the world more beautiful  many listeners have taken it upon themselves to redesign their flags and look into the feasibility of getting them officially adopted. If you see your city flag and like it  fly it  even if it violates  a design rule or two. I don't care. But if you don't see your city flag  maybe it doesn't exist  but maybe it does  and it just sucks  and I dare you to join the effort to try to change that. As we move more and more into cities  the city flag will become not just a symbol of that city as a place  but also it could become a symbol of how that city considers design itself  especially today  as the populace is becoming more design aware. And I think design awareness is at an all time high. A well designed flag could be seen as an indicator of how a city considers all of its design systems  its public transit  its parks  its signage. It might seem frivolous  but it's not. TK  Often when city leaders say   We have more important things to do than worry about a city flag   my response is   If you had a great city flag  you would have a banner for people to rally under to face those more important things.  RM  I've seen firsthand what a good city flag can do in the case of Chicago. The marriage of good design and civic pride is something that we need in all places. The best part about municipal flags is that we own them. They are an open source  publicly owned design language of the community. When they are done well  they are remixable  adaptable  and they are powerful. We could control the branding and graphical imagery of our cities with a good flag  but instead  by having bad flags we don't use  we cede that territory to sports teams and chambers of commerce and tourism boards. Sports teams can leave and break our hearts. And besides  some of us don't really care about sports. And tourism campaigns can just be cheesy. But a great city flag is something that represents a city to its people and its people to the world at large. And when that flag is a beautiful thing  that connection is a beautiful thing. So maybe all the city flags can be as inspiring as Hong Kong or Portland or Trondheim  and we can do away with all the bad flags like San Francisco  Milwaukee  Cedar Rapids  and finally  when we're all done  we can do something about Pocatello  Idaho  considered by the North American Vexillological Association as the worst city flag in North America. Yeah. That thing has a trademark symbol on it  people.  Laughter  That hurts me just to look at. Thank you so much for listening.   Music by  Melodium   melodiumbox  and Keegan DeWitt   keegandewitt    Dannielle Hadley  Life in Pennsylvania means just that  life without the possibility of parole. For us lifers  as we call ourselves  our only chance for release is through commutation  which has only been granted to two women since       close to    years ago.

Will I see my family or die alone  Or die alone  Chris Anderson  So I guess what we're going to do is we're going to talk about your life  and using some pictures that you shared with me. And I think we should start right here with this one. Okay  now who is this  Martine Rothblatt  This is me with our oldest son Eli. He was about age five. This is taken in Nigeria right after having taken the Washington  D.C. bar exam. CA  Okay. But this doesn't really look like a Martine. MR  Right. That was myself as a male  the way I was brought up. Before I transitioned from male to female and Martin to Martine. CA  You were brought up Martin Rothblatt. MR  Correct. CA  And about a year after this picture  you married a beautiful woman. Was this love at first sight  What happened there  MR  It was love at the first sight. I saw Bina at a discotheque in Los Angeles  and we later began living together  but the moment I saw her  I saw just an aura of energy around her. I asked her to dance. She said she saw an aura of energy around me. I was a single male parent. She was a single female parent. We showed each other our kids' pictures  and we've been happily married for a third of a century now. CA  And at the time  you were kind of this hotshot entrepreneur  working with satellites. I think you had two successful companies  and then you started addressing this problem of how could you use satellites to revolutionize radio. Tell us about that. MR  Right. I always loved space technology  and satellites  to me  are sort of like the canoes that our ancestors first pushed out into the water. So it was exciting for me to be part of the navigation of the oceans of the sky  and as I developed different types of satellite communication systems  the main thing I did was to launch bigger and more powerful satellites  the consequence of which was that the receiving antennas could be smaller and smaller  and after going through direct television broadcasting  I had the idea that if we could make a more powerful satellite  the receiving dish could be so small that it would just be a section of a parabolic dish  a flat little plate embedded into the roof of an automobile  and it would be possible to have nationwide satellite radio  and that's Sirius XM today. CA  Wow. So who here has used Sirius  MR  Thank you for your monthly subscriptions. CA  So that succeeded despite all predictions at the time. It was a huge commercial success  but soon after this  in the early     s  there was this big transition in your life and you became Martine. MR  Correct. CA  So tell me  how did that happen  MR  It happened in consultation with Bina and our four beautiful children  and I discussed with each of them that I felt my soul was always female  and as a woman  but I was afraid people would laugh at me if I expressed it  so I always kept it bottled up and just showed my male side. And each of them had a different take on this. Bina said   I love your soul  and whether the outside is Martin and Martine  it doesn't it matter to me  I love your soul.  My son said   If you become a woman  will you still be my father   And I said   Yes  I'll always be your father   and I'm still his father today. My youngest daughter did an absolutely brilliant five year old thing. She told people   I love my dad and she loves me.  So she had no problem with a gender blending whatsoever. CA  And a couple years after this  you published this book   The Apartheid of Sex.  What was your thesis in this book  MR  My thesis in this book is that there are seven billion people in the world  and actually  seven billion unique ways to express one's gender. And while people may have the genitals of a male or a female  the genitals don't determine your gender or even really your sexual identity. That's just a matter of anatomy and reproductive tracts  and people could choose whatever gender they want if they weren't forced by society into categories of either male or female the way South Africa used to force people into categories of black or white. We know from anthropological science that race is fiction  even though racism is very  very real  and we now know from cultural studies that separate male or female genders is a constructed fiction. The reality is a gender fluidity that crosses the entire continuum from male to female. CA  You yourself don't always feel     percent female. MR  Correct. I would say in some ways I change my gender about as often as I change my hairstyle. CA   Laughs  Okay  now  this is your gorgeous daughter  Jenesis. And I guess she was about this age when something pretty terrible happened. MR  Yes  she was finding herself unable to walk up the stairs in our house to her bedroom  and after several months of doctors  she was diagnosed to have a rare  almost invariably fatal disease called pulmonary arterial hypertension. CA  So how did you respond to that  MR  Well  we first tried to get her to the best doctors we could. We ended up at Children's National Medical Center in Washington  D.C. The head of pediatric cardiology told us that he was going to refer her to get a lung transplant  but not to hold out any hope  because there are very few lungs available  especially for children. He said that all people with this illness died  and if any of you have seen the film  Lorenzo's Oil   there's a scene when the protagonist kind of rolls down the stairway crying and bemoaning the fate of his son  and that's exactly how we felt about Jenesis. CA  But you didn't accept that as the limit of what you could do. You started trying to research and see if you could find a cure somehow. MR  Correct. She was in the intensive care ward for weeks at a time  and Bina and I would tag team to stay at the hospital while the other watched the rest of the kids  and when I was in the hospital and she was sleeping  I went to the hospital library. I read every article that I could find on pulmonary hypertension. I had not taken any biology  even in college  so I had to go from a biology textbook to a college level textbook and then medical textbook and the journal articles  back and forth  and eventually I knew enough to think that it might be possible that somebody could find a cure. So we started a nonprofit foundation. I wrote a description asking people to submit grants and we would pay for medical research. I became an expert on the condition    doctors said to me  Martine  we really appreciate all the funding you've provided us  but we are not going to be able to find a cure in time to save your daughter. However  there is a medicine that was developed at the Burroughs Wellcome Company that could halt the progression of the disease  but Burroughs Wellcome has just been acquired by Glaxo Wellcome. They made a decision not to develop any medicines for rare and orphan diseases  and maybe you could use your expertise in satellite communications to develop this cure for pulmonary hypertension. CA  So how on earth did you get access to this drug  MR  I went to Glaxo Wellcome and after three times being rejected and having the door slammed in my face because they weren't going to out license the drug to a satellite communications expert  they weren't going to send the drug out to anybody at all  and they thought I didn't have the expertise  finally I was able to persuade a small team of people to work with me and develop enough credibility. I wore down their resistance  and they had no hope this drug would even work  by the way  and they tried to tell me   You're just wasting your time. We're sorry about your daughter.  But finally  for        dollars and agreement to pay    percent of any revenues we might ever get  they agreed to give me worldwide rights to this drug. CA  And so you put this drug on the market in a really brilliant way  by basically charging what it would take to make the economics work. MR  Oh yes  Chris  but this really wasn't a drug that I ended up    after I wrote the check for         and I said   Okay  where's the medicine for Jenesis   they said   Oh  Martine  there's no medicine for Jenesis. This is just something we tried in rats.  And they gave me  like  a little plastic Ziploc bag of a small amount of powder. They said   Don't give it to any human   and they gave me a piece of paper which said it was a patent  and from that  we had to figure out a way to make this medicine. A hundred chemists in the U.S. at the top universities all swore that little patent could never be turned into a medicine. If it was turned into a medicine  it could never be delivered because it had a half life of only    minutes. CA  And yet  a year or two later  you were there with a medicine that worked for Jenesis. MR  Chris  the astonishing thing is that this absolutely worthless piece of powder that had the sparkle of a promise of hope for Jenesis is not only keeping Jenesis and other people alive today  but produces almost a billion and a half dollars a year in revenue. CA  So here you go. So you took this company public  right  And made an absolute fortune. And how much have you paid Glaxo  by the way  after that         MR  Yeah  well  every year we pay them    percent of  .  billion      million dollars  last year     million dollars. It's the best return on investment they ever received.  Laughter  CA  And the best news of all  I guess  is this. MR  Yes. Jenesis is an absolutely brilliant young lady. She's alive  healthy today at   . You see me  Bina and Jenesis there. The most amazing thing about Jenesis is that while she could do anything with her life  and believe me  if you grew up your whole life with people in your face saying that you've got a fatal disease  I would probably run to Tahiti and just not want to run into anybody again. But instead she chooses to work in United Therapeutics. She says she wants to do all she can to help other people with orphan diseases get medicines  and today  she's our project leader for all telepresence activities  where she helps digitally unite the entire company to work together to find cures for pulmonary hypertension. CA  But not everyone who has this disease has been so fortunate. There are still many people dying  and you are tackling that too. How  MR  Exactly  Chris. There's some       people a year in the United States alone  perhaps    times that number worldwide  who continue to die of this illness because the medicines slow down the progression but they don't halt it. The only cure for pulmonary hypertension  pulmonary fibrosis  cystic fibrosis  emphysema  COPD  what Leonard Nimoy just died of  is a lung transplant  but sadly  there are only enough available lungs for       people in the U.S. a year to get a lung transplant  whereas nearly a half million people a year die of end stage lung failure. CA  So how can you address that  MR  So I conceptualize the possibility that just like we keep cars and planes and buildings going forever with an unlimited supply of building parts and machine parts  why can't we create an unlimited supply of transplantable organs to keep people living indefinitely  and especially people with lung disease. So we've teamed up with the decoder of the human genome  Craig Venter  and the company he founded with Peter Diamandis  the founder of the X Prize  to genetically modify the pig genome so that the pig's organs will not be rejected by the human body and thereby to create an unlimited supply of transplantable organs. We do this through our company  United Therapeutics. CA  So you really believe that within  what  a decade  that this shortage of transplantable lungs maybe be cured  through these guys  MR  Absolutely  Chris. I'm as certain of that as I was of the success that we've had with direct television broadcasting  Sirius XM. It's actually not rocket science. It's straightforward engineering away one gene after another. We're so lucky to be born in the time that sequencing genomes is a routine activity  and the brilliant folks at Synthetic Genomics are able to zero in on the pig genome  find exactly the genes that are problematic  and fix them. CA  But it's not just bodies that    though that is amazing. It's not just long lasting bodies that are of interest to you now. It's long lasting minds. And I think this graph for you says something quite profound. What does this mean  MR  What this graph means  and it comes from Ray Kurzweil  is that the rate of development in computer processing hardware  firmware and software  has been advancing along a curve such that by the     s  as we saw in earlier presentations today  there will be information technology that processes information and the world around us at the same rate as a human mind. CA  And so that being so  you're actually getting ready for this world by believing that we will soon be able to  what  actually take the contents of our brains and somehow preserve them forever  How do you describe that  MR  Well  Chris  what we're working on is creating a situation where people can create a mind file  and a mind file is the collection of their mannerisms  personality  recollection  feelings  beliefs  attitudes and values  everything that we've poured today into Google  into Amazon  into Facebook  and all of this information stored there will be able  in the next couple decades  once software is able to recapitulate consciousness  be able to revive the consciousness which is imminent in our mind file. CA  Now you're not just messing around with this. You're serious. I mean  who is this  MR  This is a robot version of my beloved spouse  Bina. And we call her Bina   . She was programmed by Hanson Robotics out of Texas. There's the centerfold from National Geographic magazine with one of her caregivers  and she roams the web and has hundreds of hours of Bina's mannerisms  personalities. She's kind of like a two year old kid  but she says things that blow people away  best expressed by perhaps a New York Times Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Amy Harmon who says her answers are often frustrating  but other times as compelling as those of any flesh person she's interviewed. CA  And is your thinking here  part of your hope here  is that this version of Bina can in a sense live on forever  or some future upgrade to this version can live on forever  MR  Yes. Not just Bina  but everybody. You know  it costs us virtually nothing to store our mind files on Facebook  Instagram  what have you. Social media is I think one of the most extraordinary inventions of our time  and as apps become available that will allow us to out Siri Siri  better and better  and develop consciousness operating systems  everybody in the world  billions of people  will be able to develop mind clones of themselves that will have their own life on the web. CA  So the thing is  Martine  that in any normal conversation  this would sound stark staring mad  but in the context of your life  what you've done  some of the things we've heard this week  the constructed realities that our minds give  I mean  you wouldn't bet against it. MR  Well  I think it's really nothing coming from me. If anything  I'm perhaps a bit of a communicator of activities that are being undertaken by the greatest companies in China  Japan  India  the U.S.  Europe. There are tens of millions of people working on writing code that expresses more and more aspects of our human consciousness  and you don't have to be a genius to see that all these threads are going to come together and ultimately create human consciousness  and it's something we'll value. There are so many things to do in this life  and if we could have a simulacrum  a digital doppelg nger of ourselves that helps us process books  do shopping  be our best friends  I believe our mind clones  these digital versions of ourselves  will ultimately be our best friends  and for me personally and Bina personally  we love each other like crazy. Each day  we are always saying  like   Wow  I love you even more than    years ago. And so for us  the prospect of mind clones and regenerated bodies is that our love affair  Chris  can go on forever. And we never get bored of each other. I'm sure we never will. CA  I think Bina's here  right  MR  She is  yeah. CA  Would it be too much  I don't know  do we have a handheld mic  Bina  could we invite you to the stage  I just have to ask you one question. Besides  we need to see you. Thank you  thank you. Come and join Martine here. I mean  look  when you got married  if someone had told you that  in a few years time  the man you were marrying would become a woman  and a few years after that  you would become a robot    how has this gone  How has it been  Bina Rothblatt  It's been really an exciting journey  and I would have never thought that at the time  but we started making goals and setting those goals and accomplishing things  and before you knew it  we just keep going up and up and we're still not stopping  so it's great. CA  Martine told me something really beautiful  just actually on Skype before this  which was that he wanted to live for hundreds of years as a mind file  but not if it wasn't with you. BR  That's right  we want to do it together. We're cryonicists as well  and we want to wake up together. CA  So just so as you know  from my point of view  this isn't only one of the most astonishing lives I have heard  it's one of the most astonishing love stories I've ever heard. It's just a delight to have you both here at TED. Thank you so much. MR  Thank you. When I was growing up  I really  liked playing hide and seek a lot. One time  though  I thought climbing a tree would lead to a great hiding spot  but I fell and broke my arm. I actually started first grade with a big cast all over my torso. It was taken off six weeks later  but even then  I couldn't extend my elbow  and I had to do physical therapy to flex and extend it      times per day  seven days per week. I barely did it  because I found it boring and painful  and as a result  it took me another six weeks to get better. Many years later  my mom developed frozen shoulder  which leads to pain and stiffness in the shoulder. The person I believed for half of my life to have superpowers suddenly needed help to get dressed or to cut food. She went each week to physical therapy  but just like me  she barely followed the home treatment  and it took her over five months to feel better. Both my mom and I required physical therapy  a process of doing a suite of repetitive exercises in order to regain the range of movement lost due to an accident or injury. At first  a physical therapist works with patients  but then it's up to the patients to do their exercises at home. But patients find physical therapy boring  frustrating  confusing and lengthy before seeing results. Sadly  patient noncompliance can be as high as    percent. This means the majority of patients don't do their exercises and therefore take a lot longer to get better. All physical therapists agree that special exercises reduce the time needed for recovery  but patients lack the motivation to do them. So together with three friends  all of us software geeks  we asked ourselves  wouldn't it be interesting if patients could play their way to recovery  We started building MIRA  A P.C. software platform that uses this Kinect device  a motion capture camera  to transform traditional exercises into video games. My physical therapist has already set up a schedule for my particular therapy. Let's see how this looks. The first game asks me to fly a bee up and down to gather pollen to deposit in beehives  all while avoiding the other bugs. I control the bee by doing elbow extension and flexion  just like when I was seven years old after the cast was taken off. When designing a game  we speak to physical therapists at first to understand what movement patients need to do. We then make that a video game to give patients simple  motivating objectives to follow. But the software is very customizable  and physical therapists can also create their own exercises. Using the software  my physical therapist recorded herself performing a shoulder abduction  which is one of the movements my mom had to do when she had frozen shoulder. I can follow my therapist's example on the left side of the screen  while on the right  I see myself doing the recommended movement. I feel more engaged and confident  as I'm exercising alongside my therapist with the exercises my therapist thinks are best for me. This basically extends the application for physical therapists to create whatever exercises they think are best. This is an auction house game for preventing falls  designed to strengthen muscles and improve balance. As a patient  I need to do sit and stand movements  and when I stand up  I bid for the items I want to buy. In two days  my grandmother will be    years old  and there's a    percent chance for people over    to fall at least once per year  which could lead to a broken hip or even worse. Poor muscle tone and impaired balance are the number one cause of falls  so reversing these problems through targeted exercise will help keep older people like my grandmother safer and independent for longer. When my schedule ends  MIRA briefly shows me how I progressed throughout my session. I have just shown you three different games for kids  adults and seniors. These can be used with orthopedic or neurologic patients  but we'll soon have options for children with autism  mental health or speech therapy. My physical therapist can go back to my profile and see the data gathered during my sessions. She can see how much I moved  how many points I scored  with what speed I moved my joints  and so on. My physical therapist can use all of this to adapt my treatment. I'm so pleased this version is now in use in over    clinics across Europe and the U.S.  and we're working on the home version. We want to enable physical therapists to prescribe this digital treatment and help patients play their way to recovery at home. If my mom or I had a tool like this when we needed physical therapy  then we would have been more successful following the treatment  and perhaps gotten better a lot sooner. Thank you. Tom Rielly  So Cosmin  tell me what hardware is this that they're rapidly putting away  What is that made of  and how much does it cost  Cosmin Milhau  So it's a Microsoft Surface Pro   for the demo  but you just need a computer and a Kinect  which is     dollars. TR  Right  and the Kinect is the thing that people use for their Xboxes to do  D games  right  CM  Exactly  but you don't need the Xbox  you only need a camera. TR  Right  so this is less than a        solution. CM  Definitely      dollars  you can definitely use it. TR  So right now  you're doing clinical trials in clinics. CM  Yes. TR  And then the hope is to get it so it's a home version and I can do my exercise remotely  and the therapist at the clinic can see how I'm doing and stuff like that. CM  Exactly. TR  Cool. Thanks so much. CM  Thank you. I'd like to have you look at this pencil. It's a thing. It's a legal thing. And so are books you might have or the cars you own. They're all legal things. The great apes that you'll see behind me  they too are legal things. Now  I can do that to a legal thing. I can do whatever I want to my book or my car. These great apes  you'll see. The photographs are taken by a man named James Mollison who wrote a book called  James   Other Apes.  And he tells in his book how every single one them  almost every one of them  is an orphan who saw his mother and father die before his eyes. They're legal things. So for centuries  there's been a great legal wall that separates legal things from legal persons. On one hand  legal things are invisible to judges. They don't count in law. They don't have any legal rights. They don't have the capacity for legal rights. They are the slaves. On the other side of that legal wall are the legal persons. Legal persons are very visible to judges. They count in law. They may have many rights. They have the capacity for an infinite number of rights. And they're the masters. Right now  all nonhuman animals are legal things. All human beings are legal persons. But being human and being a legal person has never been  and is not today  synonymous with a legal person. Humans and legal persons are not synonymous. On the one side  there have been many human beings over the centuries who have been legal things. Slaves were legal things. Women  children  were sometimes legal things. Indeed  a great deal of civil rights struggle over the last centuries has been to punch a hole through that wall and begin to feed these human things through the wall and have them become legal persons. But alas  that hole has closed up. Now  on the other side are legal persons  but they've never only been limited to human beings. There are  for example  there are many legal persons who are not even alive. In the United States  we're aware of the fact that corporations are legal persons. In pre independence India  a court held that a Hindu idol was a legal person  that a mosque was a legal person. In       the Indian Supreme Court held that the holy books of the Sikh religion was a legal person  and in       just recently  there was a treaty between the indigenous peoples of New Zealand and the crown  in which it was agreed that a river was a legal person who owned its own riverbed. Now  I read Peter Singer's book in       when I had a full head of lush  brown hair  and indeed I was moved by it  because I had become a lawyer because I wanted to speak for the voiceless  defend the defenseless  and I'd never realized how voiceless and defenseless the trillions  billions of nonhuman animals are. And I began to work as an animal protection lawyer. And by       I realized that I was trying to accomplish something that was literally impossible  the reason being that all of my clients  all the animals whose interests I was trying to defend  were legal things  they were invisible. It was not going to work  so I decided that the only thing that was going to work was they had  at least some of them  had to also be moved through a hole that we could open up again in that wall and begin feeding the appropriate nonhuman animals through that hole onto the other side of being legal persons. Now  at that time  there was very little known about or spoken about truly animal rights  about the idea of having legal personhood or legal rights for a nonhuman animal  and I knew it was going to take a long time. And so  in       I figured that it would take about    years before we'd be able to even begin a strategic litigation  long term campaign  in order to be able to punch another hole through that wall. It turned out that I was pessimistic  that it only took   . So what we had to do in order to begin was not only to write law review articles and teach classes  write books  but we had to then begin to get down to the nuts and bolts of how you litigate that kind of case. So one of the first things we needed to do was figure out what a cause of action was  a legal cause of action. And a legal cause of action is a vehicle that lawyers use to put their arguments in front of courts. It turns out there's a very interesting case that had occurred almost     years ago in London called Somerset vs. Stewart  whereby a black slave had used the legal system and had moved from a legal thing to a legal person. I was so interested in it that I eventually wrote an entire book about it. James Somerset was an eight year old boy when he was kidnapped from West Africa. He survived the Middle Passage  and he was sold to a Scottish businessman named Charles Stewart in Virginia. Now     years later  Stewart brought James Somerset to London  and after he got there  James decided he was going to escape. And so one of the first things he did was to get himself baptized  because he wanted to get a set of godparents  because to an   th century slave  they knew that one of the major responsibilities of godfathers was to help you escape. And so in the fall of       James Somerset had a confrontation with Charles Stewart. We don't know exactly what happened  but then James dropped out of sight. An enraged Charles Stewart then hired slave catchers to canvass the city of London  find him  bring him not back to Charles Stewart  but to a ship  the Ann and Mary  that was floating in London Harbour  and he was chained to the deck  and the ship was to set sail for Jamaica where James was to be sold in the slave markets and be doomed to the three to five years of life that a slave had harvesting sugar cane in Jamaica. Well now James' godparents swung into action. They approached the most powerful judge  Lord Mansfield  who was chief judge of the court of King's Bench  and they demanded that he issue a common law writ of habeus corpus on behalf of James Somerset. Now  the common law is the kind of law that English speaking judges can make when they're not cabined in by statutes or constitutions  and a writ of habeus corpus is called the Great Writ  capital G  capital W  and it's meant to protect any of us who are detained against our will. A writ of habeus corpus is issued. The detainer is required to bring the detainee in and give a legally sufficient reason for depriving him of his bodily liberty. Well  Lord Mansfield had to make a decision right off the bat  because if James Somerset was a legal thing  he was not eligible for a writ of habeus corpus  only if he could be a legal person. So Lord Mansfield decided that he would assume  without deciding  that James Somerset was indeed a legal person  and he issued the writ of habeus corpus  and James's body was brought in by the captain of the ship. There were a series of hearings over the next six months. On June           Lord Mansfield said that slavery was so odious  and he used the word  odious   that the common law would not support it  and he ordered James free. At that moment  James Somerset underwent a legal transubstantiation. The free man who walked out of the courtroom looked exactly like the slave who had walked in  but as far as the law was concerned  they had nothing whatsoever in common. The next thing we did is that the Nonhuman Rights Project  which I founded  then began to look at what kind of values and principles do we want to put before the judges  What values and principles did they imbibe with their mother's milk  were they taught in law school  do they use every day  do they believe with all their hearts    and we chose liberty and equality. Now  liberty right is the kind of right to which you're entitled because of how you're put together  and a fundamental liberty right protects a fundamental interest. And the supreme interest in the common law are the rights to autonomy and self determination. So they are so powerful that in a common law country  if you go to a hospital and you refuse life saving medical treatment  a judge will not order it forced upon you  because they will respect your self determination and your autonomy. Now  an equality right is the kind of right to which you're entitled because you resemble someone else in a relevant way  and there's the rub  relevant way. So if you are that  then because they have the right  you're like them  you're entitled to the right. Now  courts and legislatures draw lines all the time. Some are included  some are excluded. But you have to  at the bare minimum you must    that line has to be a reasonable means to a legitimate end. The Nonhuman Rights Project argues that drawing a line in order to enslave an autonomous and self determining being like you're seeing behind me  that that's a violation of equality. We then searched through    jurisdictions  it took us seven years  to find the jurisdiction where we wanted to begin filing our first suit. We chose the state of New York. Then we decided upon who our plaintiffs are going to be. We decided upon chimpanzees  not just because Jane Goodall was on our board of directors  but because they  Jane and others  have studied chimpanzees intensively for decades. We know the extraordinary cognitive capabilities that they have  and they also resemble the kind that human beings have. And so we chose chimpanzees  and we began to then canvass the world to find the experts in chimpanzee cognition. We found them in Japan  Sweden  Germany  Scotland  England and the United States  and amongst them  they wrote     pages of affidavits in which they set out more than    ways in which their complex cognitive capability  either individually or together  all added up to autonomy and self determination. Now  these included  for example  that they were conscious. But they're also conscious that they're conscious. They know they have a mind. They know that others have minds. They know they're individuals  and that they can live. They understand that they lived yesterday and they will live tomorrow. They engage in mental time travel. They remember what happened yesterday. They can anticipate tomorrow  which is why it's so terrible to imprison a chimpanzee  especially alone. It's the thing that we do to our worst criminals  and we do that to chimpanzees without even thinking about it. They have some kind of moral capacity. When they play economic games with human beings  they'll spontaneously make fair offers  even when they're not required to do so. They are numerate. They understand numbers. They can do some simple math. They can engage in language    or to stay out of the language wars  they're involved in intentional and referential communication in which they pay attention to the attitudes of those with whom they are speaking. They have culture. They have a material culture  a social culture. They have a symbolic culture. Scientists in the Ta  Forests in the Ivory Coast found chimpanzees who were using these rocks to smash open the incredibly hard hulls of nuts. It takes a long time to learn how to do that  and they excavated the area and they found that this material culture  this way of doing it  these rocks  had passed down for at least       years through     chimpanzee generations. So now we needed to find our chimpanzee. Our chimpanzee  first we found two of them in the state of New York. Both of them would die before we could even get our suits filed. Then we found Tommy. Tommy is a chimpanzee. You see him behind me. Tommy was a chimpanzee. We found him in that cage. We found him in a small room that was filled with cages in a larger warehouse structure on a used trailer lot in central New York. We found Kiko  who is partially deaf. Kiko was in the back of a cement storefront in western Massachusetts. And we found Hercules and Leo. They're two young male chimpanzees who are being used for biomedical  anatomical research at Stony Brook. We found them. And so on the last week of December       the Nonhuman Rights Project filed three suits all across the state of New York using the same common law writ of habeus corpus argument that had been used with James Somerset  and we demanded that the judges issue these common law writs of habeus corpus. We wanted the chimpanzees out  and we wanted them brought to Save the Chimps  a tremendous chimpanzee sanctuary in South Florida which involves an artificial lake with    or    islands    there are two or three acres where two dozen chimpanzees live on each of them. And these chimpanzees would then live the life of a chimpanzee  with other chimpanzees in an environment that was as close to Africa as possible. Now  all these cases are still going on. We have not yet run into our Lord Mansfield. We shall. We shall. This is a long term strategic litigation campaign. We shall. And to quote Winston Churchill  the way we view our cases is that they're not the end  they're not even the beginning of the end  but they are perhaps the end of the beginning. Thank you. Why do we cheat  And why do happy people cheat  And when we say  infidelity   what exactly do we mean  Is it a hookup  a love story  paid sex  a chat room  a massage with a happy ending  Why do we think that men cheat out of boredom and fear of intimacy  but women cheat out of loneliness and hunger for intimacy  And is an affair always the end of a relationship  For the past    years  I have traveled the globe and worked extensively with hundreds of couples who have been shattered by infidelity. There is one simple act of transgression that can rob a couple of their relationship  their happiness and their very identity  an affair. And yet  this extremely common act is so poorly understood. So this talk is for anyone who has ever loved. Adultery has existed since marriage was invented  and so  too  the taboo against it. In fact  infidelity has a tenacity that marriage can only envy  so much so  that this is the only commandment that is repeated twice in the Bible  once for doing it  and once just for thinking about it. So how do we reconcile what is universally forbidden  yet universally practiced  Now  throughout history  men practically had a license to cheat with little consequence  and supported by a host of biological and evolutionary theories that justified their need to roam  so the double standard is as old as adultery itself. But who knows what's really going on under the sheets there  right  Because when it comes to sex  the pressure for men is to boast and to exaggerate  but the pressure for women is to hide  minimize and deny  which isn't surprising when you consider that there are still nine countries where women can be killed for straying. Now  monogamy used to be one person for life. Today  monogamy is one person at a time. I mean  many of you probably have said   I am monogamous in all my relationships.  We used to marry  and had sex for the first time. But now we marry  and we stop having sex with others. The fact is that monogamy had nothing to do with love. Men relied on women's fidelity in order to know whose children these are  and who gets the cows when I die. Now  everyone wants to know what percentage of people cheat. I've been asked that question since I arrived at this conference. It applies to you. But the definition of infidelity keeps on expanding  sexting  watching porn  staying secretly active on dating apps. So because there is no universally agreed upon definition of what even constitutes an infidelity  estimates vary widely  from    percent to    percent. But on top of it  we are walking contradictions. So    percent of us will say that it is terribly wrong for our partner to lie about having an affair  but just about the same amount of us will say that that's exactly what we would do if we were having one. Now  I like this definition of an affair    it brings together the three key elements  a secretive relationship  which is the core structure of an affair  an emotional connection to one degree or another  and a sexual alchemy. And alchemy is the key word here  because the erotic frisson is such that the kiss that you only imagine giving  can be as powerful and as enchanting as hours of actual lovemaking. As Marcel Proust said  it's our imagination that is responsible for love  not the other person. So it's never been easier to cheat  and it's never been more difficult to keep a secret. And never has infidelity exacted such a psychological toll. When marriage was an economic enterprise  infidelity threatened our economic security. But now that marriage is a romantic arrangement  infidelity threatens our emotional security. Ironically  we used to turn to adultery    that was the space where we sought pure love. But now that we seek love in marriage  adultery destroys it. Now  there are three ways that I think infidelity hurts differently today. We have a romantic ideal in which we turn to one person to fulfill an endless list of needs  to be my greatest lover  my best friend  the best parent  my trusted confidant  my emotional companion  my intellectual equal. And I am it  I'm chosen  I'm unique  I'm indispensable  I'm irreplaceable  I'm the one. And infidelity tells me I'm not. It is the ultimate betrayal. Infidelity shatters the grand ambition of love. But if throughout history  infidelity has always been painful  today it is often traumatic  because it threatens our sense of self. So my patient Fernando  he's plagued. He goes on   I thought I knew my life. I thought I knew who you were  who we were as a couple  who I was. Now  I question everything.  Infidelity    a violation of trust  a crisis of identity.  Can I ever trust you again   he asks.  Can I ever trust anyone again   And this is also what my patient Heather is telling me  when she's talking to me about her story with Nick. Married  two kids. Nick just left on a business trip  and Heather is playing on his iPad with the boys  when she sees a message appear on the screen   Can't wait to see you.  Strange  she thinks  we just saw each other. And then another message   Can't wait to hold you in my arms.  And Heather realizes these are not for her. She also tells me that her father had affairs  but her mother  she found one little receipt in the pocket  and a little bit of lipstick on the collar. Heather  she goes digging  and she finds hundreds of messages  and photos exchanged and desires expressed. The vivid details of Nick's two year affair unfold in front of her in real time  And it made me think  Affairs in the digital age are death by a thousand cuts. But then we have another paradox that we're dealing with these days. Because of this romantic ideal  we are relying on our partner's fidelity with a unique fervor. But we also have never been more inclined to stray  and not because we have new desires today  but because we live in an era where we feel that we are entitled to pursue our desires  because this is the culture where I deserve to be happy. And if we used to divorce because we were unhappy  today we divorce because we could be happier. And if divorce carried all the shame  today  choosing to stay when you can leave is the new shame. So Heather  she can't talk to her friends because she's afraid that they will judge her for still loving Nick  and everywhere she turns  she gets the same advice  Leave him. Throw the dog on the curb. And if the situation were reversed  Nick would be in the same situation. Staying is the new shame. So if we can divorce  why do we still have affairs  Now  the typical assumption is that if someone cheats  either there's something wrong in your relationship or wrong with you. But millions of people can't all be pathological. The logic goes like this  If you have everything you need at home  then there is no need to go looking elsewhere  assuming that there is such a thing as a perfect marriage that will inoculate us against wanderlust. But what if passion has a finite shelf life  What if there are things that even a good relationship can never provide  If even happy people cheat  what is it about  The vast majority of people that I actually work with are not at all chronic philanderers. They are often people who are deeply monogamous in their beliefs  and at least for their partner. But they find themselves in a conflict between their values and their behavior. They often are people who have actually been faithful for decades  but one day they cross a line that they never thought they would cross  and at the risk of losing everything. But for a glimmer of what  Affairs are an act of betrayal  and they are also an expression of longing and loss. At the heart of an affair  you will often find a longing and a yearning for an emotional connection  for novelty  for freedom  for autonomy  for sexual intensity  a wish to recapture lost parts of ourselves or an attempt to bring back vitality in the face of loss and tragedy. I'm thinking about another patient of mine  Priya  who is blissfully married  loves her husband  and would never want to hurt the man. But she also tells me that she's always done what was expected of her  good girl  good wife  good mother  taking care of her immigrant parents. Priya  she fell for the arborist who removed the tree from her yard after Hurricane Sandy. And with his truck and his tattoos  he's quite the opposite of her. But at     Priya's affair is about the adolescence that she never had. And her story highlights for me that when we seek the gaze of another  it isn't always our partner that we are turning away from  but the person that we have ourselves become. And it isn't so much that we're looking for another person  as much as we are looking for another self. Now  all over the world  there is one word that people who have affairs always tell me. They feel alive. And they often will tell me stories of recent losses    of a parent who died  and a friend that went too soon  and bad news at the doctor. Death and mortality often live in the shadow of an affair  because they raise these questions. Is this it  Is there more  Am I going on for another    years like this  Will I ever feel that thing again  And it has led me to think that perhaps these questions are the ones that propel people to cross the line  and that some affairs are an attempt to beat back deadness  in an antidote to death. And contrary to what you may think  affairs are way less about sex  and a lot more about desire  desire for attention  desire to feel special  desire to feel important. And the very structure of an affair  the fact that you can never have your lover  keeps you wanting. That in itself is a desire machine  because the incompleteness  the ambiguity  keeps you wanting that which you can't have. Now some of you probably think that affairs don't happen in open relationships  but they do. First of all  the conversation about monogamy is not the same as the conversation about infidelity. But the fact is that it seems that even when we have the freedom to have other sexual partners  we still seem to be lured by the power of the forbidden  that if we do that which we are not supposed to do  then we feel like we are really doing what we want to. And I've also told quite a few of my patients that if they could bring into their relationships one tenth of the boldness  the imagination and the verve that they put into their affairs  they probably would never need to see me. So how do we heal from an affair  Desire runs deep. Betrayal runs deep. But it can be healed. And some affairs are death knells for relationships that were already dying on the vine. But others will jolt us into new possibilities. The fact is  the majority of couples who have experienced affairs stay together. But some of them will merely survive  and others will actually be able to turn a crisis into an opportunity. They'll be able to turn this into a generative experience. And I'm actually thinking even more so for the deceived partner  who will often say   You think I didn't want more  But I'm not the one who did it.  But now that the affair is exposed  they  too  get to claim more  and they no longer have to uphold the status quo that may not have been working for them that well  either. I've noticed that a lot of couples  in the immediate aftermath of an affair  because of this new disorder that may actually lead to a new order  will have depths of conversations with honesty and openness that they haven't had in decades. And  partners who were sexually indifferent find themselves suddenly so lustfully voracious  they don't know where it's coming from. Something about the fear of loss will rekindle desire  and make way for an entirely new kind of truth. So when an affair is exposed  what are some of the specific things that couples can do  We know from trauma that healing begins when the perpetrator acknowledges their wrongdoing. So for the partner who had the affair  for Nick  one thing is to end the affair  but the other is the essential  important act of expressing guilt and remorse for hurting his wife. But the truth is that I have noticed that quite a lot of people who have affairs may feel terribly guilty for hurting their partner  but they don't feel guilty for the experience of the affair itself. And that distinction is important. And Nick  he needs to hold vigil for the relationship. He needs to become  for a while  the protector of the boundaries. It's his responsibility to bring it up  because if he thinks about it  he can relieve Heather from the obsession  and from having to make sure that the affair isn't forgotten  and that in itself begins to restore trust. But for Heather  or deceived partners  it is essential to do things that bring back a sense of self worth  to surround oneself with love and with friends and activities that give back joy and meaning and identity. But even more important  is to curb the curiosity to mine for the sordid details    Where were you  Where did you do it  How often  Is she better than me in bed     questions that only inflict more pain  and keep you awake at night. And instead  switch to what I call the investigative questions  the ones that mine the meaning and the motives    What did this affair mean for you  What were you able to express or experience there that you could no longer do with me  What was it like for you when you came home  What is it about us that you value  Are you pleased this is over  Every affair will redefine a relationship  and every couple will determine what the legacy of the affair will be. But affairs are here to stay  and they're not going away. And the dilemmas of love and desire  they don't yield just simple answers of black and white and good and bad  and victim and perpetrator. Betrayal in a relationship comes in many forms. There are many ways that we betray our partner  with contempt  with neglect  with indifference  with violence. Sexual betrayal is only one way to hurt a partner. In other words  the victim of an affair is not always the victim of the marriage. Now  you've listened to me  and I know what you're thinking  She has a French accent  she must be pro affair. So  you're wrong. I am not French. And I'm not pro affair. But because I think that good can come out of an affair  I have often been asked this very strange question  Would I ever recommend it  Now  I would no more recommend you have an affair than I would recommend you have cancer  and yet we know that people who have been ill often talk about how their illness has yielded them a new perspective. The main question that I've been asked since I arrived at this conference when I said I would talk about infidelity is  for or against  I said   Yes.  I look at affairs from a dual perspective  hurt and betrayal on one side  growth and self discovery on the other    what it did to you  and what it meant for me. And so when a couple comes to me in the aftermath of an affair that has been revealed  I will often tell them this  Today in the West  most of us are going to have two or three relationships or marriages  and some of us are going to do it with the same person. Your first marriage is over. Would you like to create a second one together  Thank you. So if I told you that this was the face of pure joy  would you call me crazy  I wouldn't blame you  because every time I look at this Arctic selfie  I shiver just a little bit. I want to tell you a little bit about this photograph. I was swimming around in the Lofoten Islands in Norway  just inside the Arctic Circle  and the water was hovering right at freezing. The air  A brisk     with windchill  and I could literally feel the blood trying to leave my hands  feet and face  and rush to protect my vital organs. It was the coldest I've ever been. But even with swollen lips  sunken eyes  and cheeks flushed red  I have found that this place right here is somewhere I can find great joy. Now  when it comes to pain  psychologist Brock Bastian probably said it best when he wrote   Pain is a kind of shortcut to mindfulness. It makes us suddenly aware of everything in the environment. It brutally draws us in to a virtual sensory awareness of the world much like meditation.  If shivering is a form of meditation  then I would consider myself a monk. Now  before we get into the why would anyone ever want to surf in freezing cold water  I would love to give you a little perspective on what a day in my life can look like. but I don't think anybody thought that was going to happen. I can't stop shaking. I am so cold. Chris Burkard  So  surf photographer  right  I don't even know if it's a real job title  to be honest. My parents definitely didn't think so when I told them at    I was quitting my job to pursue this dream career  blue skies  warm tropical beaches  and a tan that lasts all year long. I mean  to me  this was it. Life could not get any better. Sweating it out  shooting surfers in these exotic tourist destinations. But there was just this one problem. You see  the more time I spent traveling to these exotic locations  the less gratifying it seemed to be. I set out seeking adventure  and what I was finding was only routine. It was things like wi fi  TV  fine dining  and a constant cellular connection that to me were all the trappings of places heavily touristed in and out of the water  and it didn't take long for me to start feeling suffocated. I began craving wild  open spaces  and so I set out to find the places others had written off as too cold  too remote  and too dangerous to surf  and that challenge intrigued me. I began this sort of personal crusade against the mundane  because if there's one thing I've realized  it's that any career  even one as seemingly glamorous as surf photography  has the danger of becoming monotonous. So in my search to break up this monotony  I realized something  There's only about a third of the Earth's oceans that are warm  and it's really just that thin band around the equator. So if I was going to find perfect waves  it was probably going to happen somewhere cold  where the seas are notoriously rough  and that's exactly where I began to look. And it was my first trip to Iceland that I felt like I found exactly what I was looking for. I was blown away by the natural beauty of the landscape  but most importantly  I couldn't believe we were finding perfect waves in such a remote and rugged part of the world. At one point  we got to the beach only to find massive chunks of ice had piled on the shoreline. They created this barrier between us and the surf  and we had to weave  through this thing like a maze just to get out into the lineup. and once we got there  we were pushing aside these ice chunks trying to get into waves. It was an incredible experience  one I'll never forget  because amidst those harsh conditions  I felt like I stumbled onto one of the last quiet places  somewhere that I found a clarity and a connection with the world I knew I would never find on a crowded beach. I was hooked. I was hooked.  Laughter  Cold water was constantly on my mind  and from that point on  my career focused on these types of harsh and unforgiving environments  and it took me to places like Russia  Norway  Alaska  Iceland  Chile  the Faroe Islands  and a lot of places in between. And one of my favorite things about these places was simply the challenge and the creativity it took just to get there  hours  days  weeks spent on Google Earth trying to pinpoint any remote stretch of beach or reef we could actually get to. And once we got there  the vehicles were just as creative  snowmobiles  six wheel Soviet troop carriers  and a couple of super sketchy helicopter flights. Helicopters really scare me  by the way. There was this one particularly bumpy boat ride up the coast of Vancouver Island to this kind of remote surf spot  where we ended up watching helplessly from the water as bears ravaged our camp site. They walked off with our food and bits of our tent  clearly letting us know that we were at the bottom of the food chain and that this was their spot  not ours. But to me  that trip was a testament to the wildness I traded for those touristy beaches. Now  it wasn't until I traveled to Norway     Laughter     that I really learned to appreciate the cold. So this is the place where some of the largest  the most violent storms in the world send huge waves smashing into the coastline. We were in this tiny  remote fjord  just inside the Arctic Circle. It had a greater population of sheep than people  so help if we needed it was nowhere to be found. I was in the water  taking pictures of surfers  and it started to snow. And then the temperature began to drop. And I told myself  there's not a chance you're getting out of the water. You traveled all this way  and this is exactly what you've been waiting for  freezing cold conditions with perfect waves. And although I couldn't even feel my finger to push the trigger  I knew I wasn't getting out. So I just did whatever I could. I shook it off  whatever. But that was the point that I felt this wind gush through the valley and hit me  and what started as this light snowfall quickly became a full on blizzard  and I started to lose perception of where I was. I didn't know if I was drifting out to sea or towards shore  and all I could really make out was the faint sound of seagulls and crashing waves. Now  I knew this place had a reputation for sinking ships and grounding planes  and while I was out there floating  I started to get a little bit nervous. Actually  I was totally freaking out    and my friends eventually had to help me out of the water. And I don't know if it was delirium setting in or what  but they told me later I had a smile on my face the entire time. Now  it was this trip and probably that exact experience where I really began to feel like every photograph was precious  because all of a sudden in that moment  it was something I was forced to earn. And I realized  all this shivering had actually taught me something  In life  there are no shortcuts to joy. Anything that is worth pursuing is going to require us to suffer just a little bit  and that tiny bit of suffering that I did for my photography  it added a value to my work that was so much more meaningful to me than just trying to fill the pages of magazines. See  I gave a piece of myself in these places  and what I walked away with was a sense of fulfillment I had always been searching for. So I look back at this photograph. It's easy to see frozen fingers and cold wetsuits and even the struggle that it took just to get there  but most of all  what I see is just joy. Thank you so much. I've learned some of my most important life lessons from drug dealers and gang members and prostitutes  and I've had some of my most profound theological conversations not in the hallowed halls of a seminary but on a street corner on a Friday night  at   a.m. That's a little unusual  since I am a Baptist minister  seminary trained  and pastored a church for over    years  but it's true. It came as a part of my participation in a public safety crime reduction strategy that saw a    percent reduction in violent crime over an eight year period in a major city. But I didn't start out wanting to be a part of somebody's crime reduction strategy. I was     had my first church. If you would have asked me what my ambition was  I would have told you I wanted to be a megachurch pastor. I wanted a             member church. I wanted my own television ministry. I wanted my own clothing line. I wanted to be your long distance carrier. You know  the whole nine yards. After about a year of pastoring  my membership went up about    members. So megachurchdom was way down the road. But seriously  if you'd have said   What is your ambition   I would have said just to be a good pastor  to be able to be with people through all the passages of life  to preach messages that would have an everyday meaning for folks  and in the African American tradition  to be able to represent the community that I serve. But there was something else that was happening in my city and in the entire metro area  and in most metro areas in the United States  and that was the homicide rate started to rise precipitously. And there were young people who were killing each other for reasons that I thought were very trivial  like bumping into someone in a high school hallway  and then after school  shooting the person. Someone with the wrong color shirt on  on the wrong street corner at the wrong time. And something needed to be done about that. It got to the point where it started to change the character of the city. You could go to any housing project  for example  like the one that was down the street from my church  and you would walk in  and it would be like a ghost town  because the parents wouldn't allow their kids to come out and play  even in the summertime  because of the violence. You would listen in the neighborhoods on any given night  and to the untrained ear  it sounded like fireworks  but it was gunfire. You'd hear it almost every night  when you were cooking dinner  telling your child a bedtime story  or just watching TV. And you can go to any emergency room at any hospital  and you would see lying on gurneys young black and Latino men shot and dying. And I was doing funerals  but not of the venerated matriarchs and patriarchs who'd lived a long life and there's a lot to say. I was doing funerals of    year olds     year olds  and    year olds  and I was standing in a church or at a funeral home struggling to say something that would make some meaningful impact. And so while my colleagues were building these cathedrals great and tall and buying property outside of the city and moving their congregations out so that they could create or recreate their cities of God  the social structures in the inner cities were sagging under the weight of all of this violence. And so I stayed  because somebody needed to do something  and so I had looked at what I had and moved on that. I started to preach decrying the violence in the community. And I started to look at the programming in my church  and I started to build programs that would catch the at risk youth  those who were on the fence to the violence. I even tried to be innovative in my preaching. You all have heard of rap music  right  Rap music  I even tried to rap sermon one time. It didn't work  but at least I tried it. I'll never forget the young person who came to me after that sermon. He waited until everybody was gone  and he said   Rev  rap sermon  huh   And I was like   Yeah  what do you think   And he said   Don't do that again  Rev.  But I preached and I built these programs  and I thought maybe if my colleagues did the same that it would make a difference. But the violence just careened out of control  and people who were not involved in the violence were getting shot and killed  somebody going to buy a pack of cigarettes at a convenience store  or someone who was sitting at a bus stop just waiting for a bus  or kids who were playing in the park  oblivious to the violence on the other side of the park  but it coming and visiting them. Things were out of control  and I didn't know what to do  and then something happened that changed everything for me. It was a kid by the name of Jesse McKie  walking home with his friend Rigoberto Carrion to the housing project down the street from my church. They met up with a group of youth who were from a gang in Dorchester  and they were killed. But as Jesse was running from the scene mortally wounded  he was running in the direction of my church  and he died some          yards away. If he would have gotten to the church  it wouldn't have made a difference  because the lights were out  nobody was home. And I took that as a sign. When they caught some of the youth that had done this deed  to my surprise  they were around my age  but the gulf that was between us was vast. It was like we were in two completely different worlds. And so as I contemplated all of this and looked at what was happening  I suddenly realized that there was a paradox that was emerging inside of me  and the paradox was this  in all of those sermons that I preached decrying the violence  I was also talking about building community  but I suddenly realized that there was a certain segment of the population that I was not including in my definition of community. And so the paradox was this  If I really wanted the community that I was preaching for  I needed to reach out and embrace this group that I had cut out of my definition. Which meant not about building programs to catch those who were on the fences of violence  but to reach out and to embrace those who were committing the acts of violence  the gang bangers  the drug dealers. As soon as I came to that realization  a quick question came to my mind. Why me  I mean  isn't this a law enforcement issue  This is why we have the police  right  As soon as the question   Why me   came  the answer came just as quickly  Why me  Because I'm the one who can't sleep at night thinking about it. Because I'm the one looking around saying somebody needs to do something about this  and I'm starting to realize that that someone is me. I mean  isn't that how movements start anyway  They don't start with a grand convention and people coming together and then walking in lockstep with a statement. But it starts with just a few  or maybe just one. It started with me that way  and so I decided to figure out the culture of violence in which these young people who were committing them existed  and I started to volunteer at the high school. After about two weeks of volunteering at the high school  I realized that the youth that I was trying to reach  they weren't going to high school. I started to walk in the community  and it didn't take a rocket scientist to realize that they weren't out during the day. So I started to walk the streets at night  late at night  going into the parks where they were  building the relationship that was necessary. A tragedy happened in Boston that brought a number of clergy together  and there was a small cadre of us who came to the realization that we had to come out of the four walls of our sanctuary and meet the youth where they were  and not try to figure out how to bring them in. And so we decided to walk together  and we would get together in one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in the city on a Friday night and on a Saturday night at    p.m.  and we would walk until   or   in the morning. I imagine we were quite the anomaly when we first started walking. I mean  we weren't drug dealers. We weren't drug customers. We weren't the police. Some of us would have collars on. It was probably a really odd thing. But they started speaking to us after a while  and what we found out is that while we were walking  they were watching us  and they wanted to make sure of a couple of things  that number one  we were going to be consistent in our behavior  that we would keep coming out there  and then secondly  they had wanted to make sure that we weren't out there to exploit them. Because there was always somebody who would say   We're going to take back the streets   but they would always seem to have a television camera with them  or a reporter  and they would enhance their own reputation to the detriment of those on the streets. So when they saw that we had none of that  they decided to talk to us. And then we did an amazing thing for preachers. We decided to listen and not preach. Come on  give it up for me. All right  come on  you're cutting into my time now  okay   Laughter  But it was amazing. We said to them   We don't know our own communities after   p.m. at night  between   p.m. and   a.m.  but you do. You are the subject matter experts  if you will  of that period of time. So talk to us. Teach us. Help us to see what we're not seeing. Help us to understand what we're not understanding.  And they were all too happy to do that  and we got an idea of what life on the streets was all about  very different than what you see on the    o'clock news  very different than what is portrayed in popular media and even social media. And as we were talking with them  a number of myths were dispelled about them with us. And one of the biggest myths was that these kids were cold and heartless and uncharacteristically bold in their violence. What we found out was the exact opposite. Most of the young people who were out there on the streets are just trying to make it on the streets. And we also found out that some of the most intelligent and creative and magnificent and wise people that we've ever met were on the street  engaged in a struggle. And I know some of them call it survival  but I call them overcomers  because when you're in the conditions that they're in  to be able to live every day is an accomplishment of overcoming. And as a result of that  we said to them   How do you see this church  how do you see this institution helping this situation   And we developed a plan in conversation with these youths. We stopped looking at them as the problem to be solved  and we started looking at them as partners  as assets  as co laborers in the struggle to reduce violence in the community. Imagine developing a plan  you have one minister at one table and a heroin dealer at the other table  coming up with a way in which the church can help the entire community. The Boston Miracle was about bringing people together. We had other partners. We had law enforcement partners. We had police officers. It wasn't the entire force  because there were still some who still had that lock 'em up mentality  but there were other cops who saw the honor in partnering with the community  who saw the responsibility from themselves to be able to work as partners with community leaders and faith leaders in order to reduce violence in the community. Same with probation officers  same with judges  same with folks who were up that law enforcement chain  because they realized  like we did  that we'll never arrest ourselves out of this situation  that there will not be enough prosecutions made  and you cannot fill these jails up enough in order to alleviate the problem. I helped to start an organization    years ago  a faith based organization  to deal with this issue. I left it about four years ago and started working in cities across the United States     in total  and what I found out was that in those cities  there was always this component of community leaders who put their heads down and their nose to the grindstone  who checked their egos at the door and saw the whole as greater than the sum of its parts  and came together and found ways to work with youth out on the streets  that the solution is not more cops  but the solution is mining the assets that are there in the community  to have a strong community component in the collaboration around violence reduction. Now  there is a movement in the United States of young people who I am very proud of who are dealing with the structural issues that need to change if we're going to be a better society. But there is this political ploy to try to pit police brutality and police misconduct against black on black violence. But it's a fiction. It's all connected. When you think about decades of failed housing policies and poor educational structures  when you think about persistent unemployment and underemployment in a community  when you think about poor healthcare  and then you throw drugs into the mix and duffel bags full of guns  little wonder that you would see this culture of violence emerge. And then the response that comes from the state is more cops and more suppression of hot spots. It's all connected  and one of the wonderful things that we've been able to do is to be able to show the value of partnering together    community  law enforcement  private sector  the city    in order to reduce violence. You have to value that community component. I believe that we can end the era of violence in our cities. I believe that it is possible and that people are doing it even now. But I need your help. It can't just come from folks who are burning themselves out in the community. They need support. They need help. Go back to your city. Find those people.  You need some help  I'll help you out.  Find those people. They're there. Bring them together with law enforcement  the private sector  and the city  with the one aim of reducing violence  but make sure that that community component is strong. Because the old adage that comes from Burundi is right  that you do for me  without me  you do to me. God bless you. Thank you. Someone who looks like me walks past you in the street. Do you think they're a mother  a refugee or a victim of oppression  Or do you think they're a cardiologist  a barrister or maybe your local politician  Do you look me up and down  wondering how hot I must get or if my husband has forced me to wear this outfit  What if I wore my scarf like this  I can walk down the street in the exact same outfit and what the world expects of me and the way I'm treated depends on the arrangement of this piece of cloth. But this isn't going to be another monologue about the hijab because Lord knows  Muslim women are so much more than the piece of cloth they choose  or not  to wrap their head in. This is about looking beyond your bias. What if I walked past you and later on you'd found out that actually I was a race car engineer  and that I designed my own race car and I ran my university's race team  because it's true. What if I told you that I was actually trained as a boxer for five years  because that's true  too. Would it surprise you  Why  Ladies and gentlemen  ultimately  that surprise and the behaviors associated with it are the product of something  called unconscious bias  or implicit prejudice. And that results in the ridiculously detrimental lack of diversity in our workforce  particularly in areas of influence. Hello  Australian Federal Cabinet. Let me just set something out from the outset  Unconscious bias is not the same as conscious discrimination. I'm not saying that in all of you   there's a secret sexist or racist or ageist lurking within   waiting to get out. That's not what I'm saying. We all have our biases. They're the filters through which we see the world around us. I'm not accusing anyone  bias is not an accusation. Rather  it's something that  has to be identified  acknowledged and mitigated against. Bias can be about race  it can be about gender. It can also be about class  education  disability. The fact is  we all have biases against what's different  what's different to our social norms. The thing is  if we want  to live in a world where the circumstances of your birth do not dictate your future and where equal opportunity is ubiquitous  then each and every one of us has a role to play in making sure unconscious bias does not determine our lives. There's this really famous experiment in the space of unconscious bias and that's in the space of gender in the     s and     s. So orchestras  back in the day  were made up mostly of dudes  up to only five percent were female. And apparently  that was because men played it differently  presumably better  presumably. But in       The Boston Symphony Orchestra started an experiment. They started blind auditions. So rather than face to face auditions  you would have to play behind a screen. Now funnily enough  no immediate change was registered until they asked the audition ers to take their shoes off before they entered the room. because the clickity clack  of the heels against the hardwood floors was enough to give the ladies away. Now get this  there results of the audition showed that there was a    percent increased chance a woman would progress past the preliminary stage. And it almost tripled  their chances of getting in. What does that tell us  Well  unfortunately for the guys  men actually didn't play differently  but there was the perception that they did. And it was that bias that was determining their outcome. So what we're doing here  is identifying and acknowledging that a bias exists. And look  we all do it. Let me give you an example. A son and his father are in  a horrible car accident. The father dies on impact and the son  who's severely injured  is rushed to hospital. The surgeon looks at the son when they arrive and is like   I can't operate.  Why   The boy is my son.  How can that be  Ladies and gentlemen  the surgeon is his mother. Now hands up    and it's okay    but hands up if you initially assumed the surgeon was a guy  There's evidence that that unconscious bias exists  but we all just have to acknowledge that it's there and then look at ways  that we can move past it so that we can look at solutions. Now one of the interesting things around the space of unconscious bias is the topic of quotas. And this something  that's often brought up. And of of the criticisms  is this idea of merit. Look  I don't want to be picked  because I'm a chick  I want to be picked because  I have merit  because I'm the best person for the job. It's a sentiment that's pretty common among female engineers that I work with and that I know. And yeah  I get it  I've been there. But  if the merit idea was true  why would identical resumes   in an experiment done in      by Yale  identical resumes sent out for a lab technician  why would Jennifers be deemed less competent  be less likely to be offered the job  and be paid less than Johns. The unconscious bias is there  but we just have to look at how we can move past it. And  you know  it's interesting  there's some research that talks about why this is the case and it's called the merit paradox. And in organizations    and this is kind of ironic    in organizations that talk about merit being their primary value driver in terms of who they hire  they were more likely to hire dudes and more likely to pay the guys more because apparently merit  is a masculine quality. But  hey. So you guys think you've got  a good read on me  you kinda think you know what's up. Can you imagine me running one of these  Can you imagine me walking in and being like   Hey boys  this is what's up. This is how it's done.  Well  I'm glad you can. Because ladies and gentlemen  that's my day job. And the cool thing about it is that it's pretty entertaining. Actually  in places like Malaysia  Muslim women on rigs  isn't even comment worthy. There are that many of them. But  it is entertaining. I remember  I was telling one of the guys   Hey  mate  look  I really want  to learn how to surf.  And he's like   Yassmin  I don't know how you can surf with all that gear you've got on  and I don't know any women only beaches.  And then  the guy came up  with a brilliant idea  he was like   I know  you run that organization Youth Without Borders  right  Why don't you start a clothing line for Muslim chicks in beaches. You can call it  Youth Without Boardshorts.  And I was like   Thanks  guys.  And I remember another bloke  telling me that I should eat all the yogurt I could because that was the only culture  I was going to get around there. But  the problem is  it's kind of true because there's an intense  lack of diversity in our workforce  particularly in places of influence. Now  in       The Australian National University did an experiment where they sent out       identical applications to entry level jobs  essentially. To get the same number of interviews as someone with an Anglo Saxon name  if you were Chinese  you had  to send out    percent more applications. If you were Middle Eastern    Abdel Magied    you had to send out    percent  and if you're Italian   you're pretty lucky  you only have to send out    percent more. In places like Silicon Valley  it's not that much better. In Google  they put out  some diversity results and    percent white     percent Asian and nine  a bunch of blacks  Hispanics  all that kind of thing. And the rest of the tech world is not that much better and they've acknowledged it  but I'm not really sure what they're doing about it. The thing is  it doesn't trickle up. In a study done by Green Park  who are a British senior exec supplier  they said that over half of the FTSE     companies don't have a nonwhite leader at their board level  executive or non executive. And two out of every three don't have an executive who's from a minority. And most of the minorities  that are at that sort of level are non executive board directors. So their influence isn't that great. I've told you a bunch of terrible things. You're like   Oh my god  how bad is that  What can I do about it   Well  fortunately  we've identified that there's a problem. There's a lack of opportunity  and that's due to unconscious bias. But you might be sitting  there thinking   I ain't brown. What's that got to do with me   Let me offer you a solution. And as I've said before  we live in a world where we're looking for an ideal. And if we want to create a world where the circumstances of your birth don't matter  we all have to be part of the solution. And interestingly  the author of the lab resume experiment offered some sort of a solution. She said the one thing that brought the successful women together  the one thing that they had in common  was the fact that they had good mentors. So mentoring  we've all kind of heard that before  it's in the vernacular. Here's another challenge for you. I challenge each and every one of you to mentor someone different. Think about it. Everyone wants to mentor someone who kind of is familiar  who looks like us  we have shared experiences. If I see a Muslim chick  who's got a bit of attitude  I'm like   What's up  We can hang out.  You walk into a room and there's someone who went to the same school  you play the same sports  there's a high chance that you're going to want to help that person out. But for the person in the room who has no shared experiences with you it becomes extremely difficult  to find that connection. The idea of finding someone  different to mentor  someone who doesn't come from the same background as you  whatever that background is  is about opening doors  for people who couldn't even get to the damn hallway. Because ladies and gentlemen  the world is not just. People are not born  with equal opportunity. I was born in one of the poorest cities in the world  Khartoum. I was born brown  I was born female  and I was born Muslim in a world that is pretty suspicious of us for reasons I can't control. However  I also acknowledge the fact that I was born with privilege. I was born with amazing parents  I was given an education and had the blessing of migrating to Australia. But also  I've been blessed with amazing mentors who've opened doors for me  that I didn't even know were there. A mentor who said to me   Hey  your story's interesting. Let's write something about it so that I can share it with people.  A mentor who said   I know you're all those things that don't belong on an Australian rig  but come on anyway.  And here I am  talking to you. And I'm not the only one. There's all sorts of people in my communities that I see have been helped out by mentors. A young Muslim man in Sydney who ended up using his mentor's help to start up a poetry slam in Bankstown and now it's a huge thing. And he's able to change the lives of so many other young people. Or a lady here in Brisbane  an Afghan lady who's a refugee  who could barely speak English when she came to Australia  her mentors helped her become a doctor and she took our Young Queenslander  of the Year Award in     . She's an inspiration. This is so not smooth. This is me. But I'm also the woman in the rig clothes  and I'm also the woman who was in the abaya at the beginning. Would you have chosen to mentor me if you had seen me in one of those other versions of who I am  Because I'm that same person. We have to look past our unconscious bias  find someone to mentor who's at the opposite end of your spectrum because structural change takes time  and I don't have that level of patience. So if we're going to create a change  if we're going to create a world where we all have those kinds of opportunities  then choose to open doors for people. Because you might think that diversity has nothing to do with you  but we are all part of this system and we can all be part of that solution. And if you don't know where to find someone different  go to the places you wouldn't usually go. If you enroll in private high school tutoring  go to your local state school or maybe just drop into your local refugee tutoring center. Or perhaps you work at an office. Take out that new grad who looks totally out of place    'cause that was me    and open doors for them  not in a tokenistic way  because we're not victims  but show them the opportunities because opening up your world will make you realize that  you have access to doors that they didn't even know existed and you didn't even know they didn't have. Ladies and gentlemen  there is a problem in our community with lack of opportunity  especially due to unconscious bias. But each and every one one of you has the potential to change that. I know you've been given a lot of challenges today  but if you can take this one piece and think about it a little differently  because diversity is magic. And I encourage you to look past your initial perceptions because I bet you  they're probably wrong. Thank you. I'm here to tell you about the real search for alien life. Not little green humanoids arriving in shiny UFOs  although that would be nice. But it's the search for planets orbiting stars far away. Every star in our sky is a sun. And if our sun has planets    Mercury  Venus  Earth  Mars  etc.  surely those other stars should have planets also  and they do. And in the last two decades  astronomers have found thousands of exoplanets. Our night sky is literally teeming with exoplanets. We know  statistically speaking  that every star has at least one planet. And in the search for planets  and in the future  planets that might be like Earth  we're able to help address some of the most amazing and mysterious questions that have faced humankind for centuries. Why are we here  Why does our universe exist  How did Earth form and evolve  How and why did life originate and populate our planet  The second question that we often think about is  Are we alone  Is there life out there  Who is out there  You know  this question has been around for thousands of years  since at least the time of the Greek philosophers. But I'm here to tell you just how close we're getting to finding out the answer to this question. It's the first time in human history that this really is within reach for us. Now when I think about the possibilities for life out there  I think of the fact that our sun is but one of many stars. This is a photograph of a real galaxy  we think our Milky Way looks like this galaxy. It's a collection of bound stars. But our  sun  is one of hundreds of billions of stars and our galaxy is one of upwards of hundreds of billions of galaxies. Knowing that small planets are very common  you can just do the math. And there are just so many stars and so many planets out there  that surely  there must be life somewhere out there. Well  the biologists get furious with me for saying that  because we have absolutely no evidence for life beyond Earth yet. Well  if we were able to look at our galaxy from the outside and zoom in to where our sun is  we see a real map of the stars. And the highlighted stars are those with known exoplanets. This is really just the tip of the iceberg. Here  this animation is zooming in onto our solar system. And you'll see here the planets as well as some spacecraft that are also orbiting our sun. Now if we can imagine going to the West Coast of North America  and looking out at the night sky  here's what we'd see on a spring night. And you can see the constellations overlaid and again  so many stars with planets. There's a special patch of the sky where we have thousands of planets. This is where the Kepler Space Telescope focused for many years. Let's zoom in and look at one of the favorite exoplanets. This star is called Kepler    f. It's a system of about five planets. And by the way  most of these exoplanets  we don't know too much about. We know their size  and their orbit and things like that. But there's a very special planet here called Kepler    f. This planet is in a zone that is not too far from the star  so that the temperature may be just right for life. Here  the artist's conception is just zooming in and showing you what that planet might be like. So  many people have this romantic notion of astronomers going to the telescope on a lonely mountaintop and looking at the spectacular night sky through a big telescope. But actually  we just work on our computers like everyone else  and we get our data by email or downloading from a database. So instead of coming here to tell you about the somewhat tedious nature of the data and data analysis and the complex computer models we make  I have a different way to try to explain to you some of the things that we're thinking about exoplanets. Here's a travel poster   Kepler    f  Where the grass is always redder on the other side.  That's because Kepler    f orbits a red star  and we're just speculating that perhaps the plants there  if there is vegetation that does photosynthesis  it has different pigments and looks red.  Enjoy the gravity on HD      g  a Super Earth.  This planet is more massive than Earth and has a higher surface gravity.  Relax on Kepler   b  where your shadow always has company.  We know of a dozen planets that orbit two stars  and there's likely many more out there. If we could visit one of those planets  you literally would see two sunsets and have two shadows. So actually  science fiction got some things right. Tatooine from Star Wars. And I have a couple of other favorite exoplanets to tell you about. This one is Kepler   b  it's a hot  hot planet. It orbits over    times closer to its star than our Earth does to our sun. And actually  it's so hot  we can't visit any of these planets  but if we could  we would melt long before we got there. We think the surface is hot enough to melt rock and has liquid lava lakes. Gliese     b. This planet  we know the mass and the size and it has a fairly low density. It's somewhat warm. We actually don't know really anything about this planet  but one possibility is that it's a water world  like a scaled up version of one of Jupiter's icy moons that might be    percent water by mass. And in this case  it would have a thick steam atmosphere overlaying an ocean  not of liquid water  but of an exotic form of water  a superfluid    not quite a gas  not quite a liquid. And under that wouldn't be rock  but a form of high pressure ice  like ice IX. So out of all these planets out there  and the variety is just simply astonishing  we mostly want to find the planets that are Goldilocks planets  we call them. Not too big  not too small  not too hot  not too cold    but just right for life. But to do that  we'd have to be able to look at the planet's atmosphere  because the atmosphere acts like a blanket trapping heat    the greenhouse effect. We have to be able to assess the greenhouse gases on other planets. Well  science fiction got some things wrong. The Star Trek Enterprise had to travel vast distances at incredible speeds to orbit other planets so that First Officer Spock could analyze the atmosphere to see if the planet was habitable or if there were lifeforms there. Well  we don't need to travel at warp speeds to see other planet atmospheres  although I don't want to dissuade any budding engineers from figuring out how to do that. We actually can and do study planet atmospheres from here  from Earth orbit. This is a picture  a photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope taken by the shuttle Atlantis as it was departing after the last human space flight to Hubble. They installed a new camera  actually  that we use for exoplanet atmospheres. And so far  we've been able to study dozens of exoplanet atmospheres  about six of them in great detail. But those are not small planets like Earth. They're big  hot planets that are easy to see. We're not ready  we don't have the right technology yet to study small exoplanets. But nevertheless  I wanted to try to explain to you how we study exoplanet atmospheres. I want you to imagine  for a moment  a rainbow. And if we could look at this rainbow closely  we would see that some dark lines are missing. And here's our sun  the white light of our sun split up  not by raindrops  but by a spectrograph. And you can see all these dark  vertical lines. Some are very narrow  some are wide  some are shaded at the edges. And this is actually how astronomers have studied objects in the heavens  literally  for over a century. So here  each different atom and molecule has a special set of lines  a fingerprint  if you will. And that's how we study exoplanet atmospheres. And I'll just never forget when I started working on exoplanet atmospheres    years ago  how many people told me   This will never happen. We'll never be able to study them. Why are you bothering   And that's why I'm pleased to tell you about all the atmospheres studied now  and this is really a field of its own. So when it comes to other planets  other Earths  in the future when we can observe them  what kind of gases would we be looking for  Well  you know  our own Earth has oxygen in the atmosphere to    percent by volume. That's a lot of oxygen. But without plants and photosynthetic life  there would be no oxygen  virtually no oxygen in our atmosphere. So oxygen is here because of life. And our goal then is to look for gases in other planet atmospheres  gases that don't belong  that we might be able to attribute to life. But which molecules should we search for  I actually told you how diverse exoplanets are. We expect that to continue in the future when we find other Earths. And that's one of the main things I'm working on now  I have a theory about this. It reminds me that nearly every day  I receive an email or emails from someone with a crazy theory about physics of gravity or cosmology or some such. So  please don't email me one of your crazy theories. Well  I had my own crazy theory. But  who does the MIT professor go to  Well  I emailed a Nobel Laureate in Physiology or Medicine and he said   Sure  come and talk to me.  So I brought my two biochemistry friends and we went to talk to him about our crazy theory. And that theory was that life produces all small molecules  so many molecules. Like  everything I could think of  but not being a chemist. Think about it  carbon dioxide  carbon monoxide  molecular hydrogen  molecular nitrogen  methane  methyl chloride    so many gases. They also exist for other reasons  but just life even produces ozone. So we go to talk to him about this  and immediately  he shot down the theory. He found an example that didn't exist. So  we went back to the drawing board and we think we have found something very interesting in another field. But back to exoplanets  the point is that life produces so many different types of gases  literally thousands of gases. And so what we're doing now is just trying to figure out on which types of exoplanets  which gases could be attributed to life. And so when it comes time when we find gases in exoplanet atmospheres that we won't know if they're being produced by intelligent aliens or by trees  or a swamp  or even just by simple  single celled microbial life. So working on the models and thinking about biochemistry  it's all well and good. But a really big challenge ahead of us is  how  How are we going to find these planets  There are actually many ways to find planets  several different ways. But the one that I'm most focused on is how can we open a gateway so that in the future  we can find hundreds of Earths. We have a real shot at finding signs of life. And actually  I just finished leading a two year project in this very special phase of a concept we call the starshade. And the starshade is a very specially shaped screen and the goal is to fly that starshade so it blocks out the light of a star so that the telescope can see the planets directly. Here  you can see myself and two team members holding up one small part of the starshade. It's shaped like a giant flower  and this is one of the prototype petals. The concept is that a starshade and telescope could launch together  with the petals unfurling from the stowed position. The central truss would expand  with the petals snapping into place. Now  this has to be made very precisely  literally  the petals to microns and they have to deploy to millimeters. And this whole structure would have to fly tens of thousands of kilometers away from the telescope. It's about tens of meters in diameter. And the goal is to block out the starlight to incredible precision so that we'd be able to see the planets directly. And it has to be a very special shape  because of the physics of defraction. Now this is a real project that we worked on  literally  you would not believe how hard. Just so you believe it's not just in movie format  here's a real photograph of a second generation starshade deployment test bed in the lab. And in this case  I just wanted you to know that that central truss has heritage left over from large radio deployables in space. So after all of that hard work where we try to think of all the crazy gases that might be out there  and we build the very complicated space telescopes that might be out there  what are we going to find  Well  in the best case  we will find an image of another exo Earth. Here is Earth as a pale blue dot. And this is actually a real photograph of Earth taken by the Voyager   spacecraft  four billion miles away. And that red light is just scattered light in the camera optics. But what's so awesome to consider is that if there are intelligent aliens orbiting on a planet around a star near to us and they build complicated space telescopes of the kind that we're trying to build  all they'll see is this pale blue dot  a pinprick of light. And so sometimes  when I pause to think about my professional struggle and huge ambition  it's hard to think about that in contrast to the vastness of the universe. But nonetheless  I am devoting the rest of my life to finding another Earth. And I can guarantee that in the next generation of space telescopes  in the second generation  we will have the capability to find and identity other Earths. And the capability to split up the starlight so that we can look for gases and assess the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere  estimate the surface temperature  and look for signs of life. But there's more. In this case of searching for other planets like Earth  we are making a new kind of map of the nearby stars and of the planets orbiting them  including  planets  that actually might be inhabitable by humans. And so I envision that our descendants  hundreds of years from now  will embark on an interstellar journey to other worlds. And they will look back at all of us as the generation who first found the Earth like worlds. Thank you. June Cohen  And I give you  for a question  Rosetta Mission Manager Fred Jansen. Fred Jansen  You mentioned halfway through that the technology to actually look at the spectrum of an exoplanet like Earth is not there yet. When do you expect this will be there  and what's needed  Actually  what we expect is what we call our next generation Hubble telescope. And this is called the James Webb Space Telescope  and that will launch in       and that's what we're going to do  we're going to look at a special kind of planet called transient exoplanets  and that will be our first shot at studying small planets for gases that might indicate the planet is habitable. JC  I'm going to ask you one follow up question  too  Sara  as the generalist. So I am really struck by the notion in your career of the opposition you faced  that when you began thinking about exoplanets  there was extreme skepticism in the scientific community that they existed  and you proved them wrong. What did it take to take that on  SS  Well  the thing is that as scientists  we're supposed to be skeptical  because our job to make sure that what the other person is saying actually makes sense or not. But being a scientist  I think you've seen it from this session  it's like being an explorer. You have this immense curiosity  this stubbornness  this sort of resolute will that you will go forward no matter what other people say. JC  I love that. Thank you  Sara. Now  I've been making pictures for quite a long time  and normally speaking  a picture like this  for me  should be straightforward. I'm in southern Ethiopia. I'm with the Daasanach. There's a big family  there's a very beautiful tree  and I make these pictures with this very large  extremely cumbersome  very awkward technical plate film camera. Does anybody know  x  and   x  sheets of film  and you're setting it up  putting it on the tripod. I've got the family  spent the better part of a day talking with them. They sort of understand what I'm on about. They think I'm a bit crazy  but that's another story. And what's most important for me is the beauty and the aesthetic  and that's based on the light. So the light's setting on my left hand side  and there's a balance in the communication with the Daasanach  the family of     all ages. There's babies and there's grandparents  I'm getting them in the tree and waiting for the light to set  and it's going  going  and I've got one sheet of film left  and I think  I'm okay  I'm in control  I'm in control. I'm setting it up and I'm setting up  and the light's just about to go  and I want it to be golden  I want it to be beautiful. I want it to be hanging on the horizon so it lights these people  in all the potential glory that they could be presented. And it's about to go  and it's about to go  and I put my sheet in the camera  it's all focused  and all of a sudden there's a massive  whack   and I'm looking around  and in the top corner of the tree  one of the girls slaps the girl next to her  and the girl next to her pulls her hair  and all hell breaks loose  and I'm standing there going   But the light  the light. Wait  I need the light. Stay still  Stay still   And they start screaming  and then one of the men turns around and starts screaming  shouting  and the whole tree collapses  not the tree  but the people in the tree. They're all running around screaming  and they run back off into the village in this sort of cloud of smoke  and I'm left there standing behind my tripod. I've got my sheet  and the light's gone  and I can't make the picture. Where have they all gone  I had no idea. It took me a week  it took me a week to make the picture which you see here today  and I'll tell you why.  Applause  It's very  very  very simple    I spent a week going around the village  and I went to every single one   Hello  can you meet at the tree  What's your story  Who are you   And it all turned out to be about a boyfriend  for crying out loud. I mean  I have teenage kids. I should know. It was about a boyfriend. The girl on the top  she'd kissed the wrong boy  and they'd started having a fight. And there was a very  very beautiful lesson for me in that  If I was going to photograph these people in the dignified  respectful way that I had intended  and put them on a pedestal  I had to understand them. It wasn't just about turning up. It wasn't just about shaking a hand. It wasn't about just saying   I'm Jimmy  I'm a photographer.  I had to get to know every single one of them  right down to whose boyfriend is who and who is allowed to kiss who. So in the end  a week later  and I was absolutely exhausted  I mean on my knees going   Please get back up in that tree. It's a picture I need to make.  They all came back. I put them all back up in the tree. I made sure the girls were in the right position  and the ones that slapped  one was over there. They did look at each other. If you look at it later  they're staring at each other very angrily  and I've got the tree and everything  and then at the last minute  I go   The goat  the goat  I need something for the eye to look at. I need a white goat in the middle.  So I swapped all the goats around. I put the goats in. But even then I got it wrong  because if you can see on the left hand side  another little boy storms off because I didn't choose his goat. So the moral being I have to learn to speak Goat as well as Daasanach. But anyway  the effort that goes into that picture and the story that I've just related to you  as you can imagine  there are hundreds of other bizarre  eccentric stories of hundreds of other people around the world. And this was about four years ago  and I set off on a journey  to be honest  a very indulgent journey. I'm a real romantic. I'm an idealist  perhaps in some ways naive. But I truly believe that there are people on the planet that are beautiful. It's very  very simple. It's not rocket science. I wanted to put these people on a pedestal. I wanted to put them on a pedestal like they'd never been seen before. So  I chose about    different groups  tribes  indigenous cultures. They were chosen purely because of their aesthetic  and I'll talk more about that later. I'm not an anthropologist  I have no technical study with the subject  but I do have a very  very  very deep passion  and I believe that I had to choose the most beautiful people on the planet in the most beautiful environment that they lived in  and put the two together and present them to you. About a year ago  I published the first pictures  and something extraordinarily exciting happened. The whole world came running  and it was a bizarre experience  because everybody  from everywhere   Who are they  What are they  How many are they  Where did you find them  Are they real  You faked it. Tell me. Tell me. Tell me. Tell me.  Millions of questions for which  to be honest  I don't have the answers. I really didn't have the answers  and I could sort of understand  okay  they're beautiful  that was my intention  but the questions that I was being fired at  I could not answer them. Until  it was quite amusing  about a year ago somebody said   You've been invited to do a TED Talk.  And I said   Ted  Ted  Who's Ted  I haven't met Ted before.  He said   No  a TED Talk.  I said   But who's Ted  Do I have to talk to him or do we sit with each other on the stage   And   No  no  the TED group. You must know about it.  And I said   I've been in a teepee and in a yurt for the last five years. How do I know who Ted is  Introduce me to him.  Anyway  to cut a long story short  he said   We have to do a TED Talk.  Researched. Oh  exciting. That's great  And then eventually you're going to go to TEDGlobal. Even more exciting. But what you need to do  you need to teach the people lessons  lessons that you've learned on your travels around the world with these tribes. I thought  lessons  okay  well  what did I learn  Good question. Three. You need three lessons  and they need to be terribly profound. And I thought  three lessons  well  I'm going to think about it. So I thought long and hard  and I stood here two days ago  and I had my test run  and I had my cards and my clicker in my hands and my pictures were on the screen  and I had my three lessons  and I started presenting them  and I had this very odd out of body experience. I sort of looked at myself standing there  going   Oh  Jimmy  this is complete loads of codswallop. All these people sitting here  they've had more of these talks  they've heard more lessons in their life. Who are you to tell them what you've learned  Who are you to guide them and who are you to show them what is right  what is wrong  what these people have to say   And I had a little bit of a  it was very private  a little bit of a meltdown. I went back  and a little bit like the boy walking away from the tree with his goats  very disgruntled  going  that didn't work  It wasn't what I wanted to communicate. And I thought long and hard about it  and I thought  well  the only thing I can communicate is very  very basic. You have to turn it all the way around. There's only one person I know here  and that's me. I'm still getting to know myself  and it's a lifelong journey  and I probably won't have all the answers  but I did learn some extraordinary things on this journey. So what I'm going to do is share with you my lessons. It's a very  as I explained at the beginning  very indulgent  very personal  how and why I made these pictures  and I leave it to you as the audience to interpret what these lessons have meant to me  what they could perhaps mean to you. I traveled enormously as a child. I was very nomadic. It was actually very exciting. All around the world  and I had this feeling that I was pushed off at great speed to become somebody  become that individual  Jimmy. Go off into the planet  and so I ran  and I ran  and my wife sometimes kids me   Jimmy  you look a bit like Forrest Gump   but I'm   No  it's all about something  trust me.  So I kept running and I kept running  and I sort of got somewhere and I sort of stood there and looked around me and I thought  well  where do I belong  Where do I fit  What am I  Where am I from  I had no idea. So I hope there aren't too many psychologists in this audience. Perhaps part of this journey is about me trying to find out where I belonged. So whilst going  and don't worry  I didn't when I arrived with these tribes  I didn't paint myself yellow and run around with these spears and loincloths. But what I did find were people that belonged themselves  and they inspired me  some extraordinary people  and I'd like to introduce you to some heroes of mine. They're the Huli. Now  the Huli are some of the most extraordinarily beautiful people on the planet. They're proud. They live in the Papua New Guinean highlands. There's not many of them left  and they're called the Huli wigmen. And images like this  I mean  this is what it's all about for me. And you've spent weeks and months there talking with them  getting there  and I want to put them on a pedestal  and I said   You have something that many people have not seen. You sit in this stunning nature.  And it really does look like this  and they really do look like this. This is the real thing. And you know why they're proud  You know why they look like this  and why I broke my back literally to photograph them and present them to you  It's because they have these extraordinary rituals. And the Huli have this ritual  When they're teenagers  becoming a man  they have to shave their heads  and they spend the rest of their life shaving their heads every single day  and what they do with that hair  they make it into a creation  a creation that's a very personal creation. It's their creation. It's their Huli creation. So they're called the Huli wigmen. That's a wig on his head. It's all made out of his human hair. And then they decorate that wig with the feathers of the birds of paradise  and don't worry  there are many birds there. There's very few people living  so nothing to get too upset about  and they spend the rest of their life recreating these hats and getting further and further  and it's extraordinary  and there's another group  they're called the Kalam  and they live in the next valley  but they speak a completely different language  they look completely different  and they wear a hat  and it's built out of scarabs  these fantastic emerald green little scarabs  and sometimes there are       or       scarabs in this hat  and they spend the whole of their life collecting these scarabs to build these hats. So the Huli inspired me in that they belong. Perhaps I have to work harder at finding a ritual which matters for me and going back into my past to see where I actually fit. An extremely important part of this project was about how I photograph these extraordinary people. And it's basically beauty. I think beauty matters. We spend the whole of our existence revolving around beauty  beautiful places  beautiful things  and ultimately  beautiful people. It's very  very  very significant. I've spent all of my life analyzing what do I look like  Am I perceived as beautiful  Does it matter if I'm a beautiful person or not  or is it purely based on my aesthetic  And then when I went off  I came to a very narrow conclusion. Do I have to go around the world photographing  excuse me  women between the age of    and     Is that what beauty is going to be  Is everything before and after that utterly irrelevant  And it was only until I went on a journey  a journey that was so extreme  I still get shivers when I think about it. I went to a part of the world  and I don't know whether any of you have ever heard of Chukotka. Has anybody ever heard of Chukotka  Chukotka probably is  technically  as far as one can go and still be on the living planet. It's    hours' flight from Moscow. First you've got to get to Moscow  and then    hours' flight nonstop from Moscow. And that's if you get there. As you can see  some people sort of miss the runway. And then when you land there  in Chukotka are the Chukchis. Now  the Chukchis are the last indigenous Inuits of Siberia  and they're people I'd heard about  I'd hardly seen any images of  but I knew they were there  and I'd been in touch with this guide  and this guide said   There's this fantastic tribe. There's only about    of them. You'll be okay. We'll find them.  So off we went on this journey. When we arrived there  after a month of traveling across the ice  and we'd got to them  but then I was not allowed to photograph them. They said   You cannot photograph us. You have to wait. You have to wait until you get to know us. You have to wait until you understand us. You have to wait until you see how we interact with one another.  And only then  it was many  many weeks later  I saw a respect. They had zero judgment. They observed one another  from the youth  from the middle aged to the old. They need each other. The children need to chew the meat all day because the adults don't have any teeth  but at the same time  the children take the old aged people out to the toilet because they're infirm  so there's this fantastic community of respect. And they adore and admire one another  and they truly taught me what beauty was. Now I'm going to ask for a little bit of audience interaction. This is extremely important for the end of my talk. If you could look at somebody left to the right of you  and I want you to observe them  and I want you to give them a compliment. This is very important. Now  it may be their nose or their hair or even their aura  I don't mind  but please look at each other  give them a compliment. You have to be quick  because I'm running out of time. And you have to remember it. Okay  thank you  thank you  thank you  you've given each other compliments. Hold that compliment very  very tightly. Hold it for later. And the last thing  it was extraordinarily profound  and it happened only two weeks ago. Two weeks ago I went back to the Himba. Now  the Himba live in northern Namibia on the border of Angola  and I'd been there a few times before  and I'd gone back to present this book I'd made  to show them the pictures  to get into a discussion with them  to say   This is how I saw you. This is how I love you. This is how I respect you. What do you think  Am I right  Am I wrong   So I wanted this debate. It was very  very  very emotional  and one night we were sitting around the campfire  and I have to be honest  I think I'd had a little bit too much to drink  and I was sort of sitting under the stars going   This is great  you've seen my pictures  we love each other.   Laughter  And I'm a little bit slow  and I looked around me  and I said  I thought  maybe  the fence is missing. Wasn't there a fence here last time I came  You know  this big protective fence around the village  and they sort of looked at me and go   Yeah  chief die.  And I thought  okay  chief dying  right  you know  look up at the stars again  look at the campfire. Chief die. What on Earth does chief die have to do with the fence   Chief die. First we destroy  yeah  Then we reflect. Then we rebuild. Then we respect.  And I burst out in tears  because my father had only just died prior to this journey  and I didn't ever acknowledge him  I didn't ever appreciate him for the fact that I'm probably standing here today because of him. These people taught me that we are only who we are because of our parents and our grandparents and our forefathers going on and on and on before that  and I  no matter how romantic or how idealistic I am on this journey  I did not know that until two weeks ago. I did not know that until two weeks ago. So what's this all about  Well  there's an image I'd like to show you  quite a special image  and it wasn't essentially the image I wanted to choose. I was sitting there the other day  and I have to finish on a strong image. And somebody said   You have to show them the picture of the Nenets. The Nenets.  I was like  yeah  but that's not my favorite picture. She went   No no no no no no no. It's an amazing picture. You're in his eyes.  I said   What do you mean I'm in his eyes  It's a picture of the Nenets.  She said   No  look  look closely  you're in his eyes.  And when you look closely at this picture  there is a reflection of me in his eyes  so I think perhaps he has my soul  and I'm in his soul  and whilst these pictures look at you  I ask you to look at them. You may not be reflected in his eyes  but there is something extraordinarily important about these people. I don't ultimately have the answers  as I've just shared with you  but you must do. There must be something there. So if you can briefly reflect on what I was discussing about beauty and about belonging and about our ancestors and our roots  and I need you all to stand for me  please. Now you have no excuse. It's almost lunchtime  and this is not a standing ovation  so don't worry  I'm not fishing for compliments. But you were given a compliment a few minutes ago. Now I want you to stand tall. I want you to breathe in. This is what I say. I'm not going to get on my knees for two weeks. I'm not going to ask you to carry a goat  and I know you don't have any camels. Photography's extraordinarily powerful. It's this language which we now all understand. We truly do all understand it  and we have this global digital fireplace  don't we  but I want to share you with the world  because you are also a tribe. You are the TED tribe  yeah  But you have to remember that compliment. You have to stand tall  breathe in through your nose  and I'm going to photograph you. Okay  I need to do a panoramic shot  so it's going to take a minute  so you have to concentrate  okay  Breathe in  stand tall  no laughing. Shh  breathe through your nose. I'm going to photograph. Thank you. I'm really excited to share with you some findings that really surprise me about what makes companies  succeed the most  what factors actually matter the most for startup success. I believe that the startup organization is one of the greatest forms to make the world a better place. If you take a group of people  with the right equity incentives and organize them in a startup  you can unlock human potential in a way never before possible. You get them to achieve  unbelievable things. But if the startup  organization is so great  why do so many fail  That's what I wanted to find out. I wanted to find out what actually matters most for startup success. And I wanted to try  to be systematic about it  avoid some of my instincts and maybe misperceptions I have from so many companies I've seen over the years. I wanted to know this because I've been starting businesses since I was    years old when I sold candy at the bus stop in junior high school  to high school  when I made solar energy devices  to college  when I made loudspeakers. And when I graduated from college  I started software companies. And    years ago  I started Idealab  and in the last    years  we started more than     companies  many successes  and many big failures. We learned a lot from those failures. So I tried to look across what factors accounted the most for company success and failure. So I looked at these five. First  the idea. I used to think that  the idea was everything. I named my company Idealab for how much I worship the  aha   moment when you first come up with the idea. But then over time  I came to think that maybe the team  the execution  adaptability  that mattered even more than the idea. I never thought I'd be quoting boxer Mike Tyson on the TED stage  but he once said   Everybody has a plan  until they get punched in the face.   Laughter  And I think that's so true about business as well. So much about a team's execution is its ability to adapt to getting punched in the face by the customer. The customer is the true reality. And that's why I came to think that the team maybe was the most important thing. Then I started looking at the business model. Does the company have a very clear path generating customer revenues  That started rising to the top in my thinking about maybe what mattered most for success. Then I looked at the funding. Sometimes companies received intense amounts of funding. Maybe that's the most important thing  And then of course  the timing. Is the idea way too early and the world's not ready for it  Is it early  as in  you're in advance and you have to educate the world  Is it just right  Or is it too late  and there's already too many competitors  So I tried to look very carefully at these five factors across many companies. And I looked across all     Idealab companies  and     non Idealab companies to try and come up with  something scientific about it. So first  on these Idealab companies  the top five companies    Citysearch  CarsDirect  GoTo  NetZero  Tickets.com    those all became billion dollar successes. And the five companies on the bottom    Z.com  Insider Pages  MyLife  Desktop Factory  Peoplelink    we all had high hopes for  but didn't succeed. So I tried to rank across all  of those attributes how I felt those companies scored on each of those dimensions. And then for non Idealab companies  I looked at wild successes  like Airbnb and Instagram and Uber and Youtube and LinkedIn. And some failures  Webvan  Kozmo  Pets.com Flooz and Friendster. The bottom companies had intense funding  they even had business models in some cases  but they didn't succeed. I tried to look at what factors actually accounted the most for success and failure across all of these companies  and the results really surprised me. The number one thing was timing. Timing accounted for    percent of the difference between success and failure. Team and execution came in second  and the idea  the differentiability of the idea  the uniqueness of the idea  that actually came in third. Now  this isn't absolutely definitive  it's not to say that  the idea isn't important  but it very much surprised me that the idea wasn't the most important thing. Sometimes it mattered more when  it was actually timed. The last two  business model and funding  made sense to me actually. I think business model makes sense to be that low because you can start out without a business model and add one later if your customers are demanding what you're creating. And funding  I think as well  if you're underfunded at first but you're gaining traction  especially in today's age  it's very  very easy to get intense funding. So now let me give you some specific examples about each of these. So take a wild success like Airbnb that everybody knows about. Well  that company was famously passed on by many smart investors because people thought   No one's going to rent out a space in their home to a stranger.  Of course  people proved that wrong. But one of the reasons it succeeded  aside from a good business model  a good idea  great execution  is the timing. That company came out right during the height of the recession when people really needed extra money  and that maybe helped people overcome their objection to renting out their own home to a stranger. Same thing with Uber. Uber came out  incredible company  incredible business model  great execution  too. But the timing was so perfect for their need to get drivers into the system. Drivers were looking for extra money  it was very  very important. Some of our early successes  Citysearch  came out when people needed web pages. GoTo.com  which we announced actually at TED in       was when companies were looking for cost effective ways to get traffic. We thought the idea was so great  but actually  the timing was probably maybe more important. And then some of our failures. We started a company called Z.com  it was an online entertainment company. We were so excited about it    we raised enough money  we had a great business model  we even signed incredibly great Hollywood talent to join the company. But broadband penetration was too low in          . It was too hard to watch video content online  you had to put codecs in your browser and do all this stuff  and the company eventually went out of business in     . Just two years later  when the codec problem was solved by Adobe Flash and when broadband penetration crossed    percent in America  YouTube was perfectly timed. Great idea  but unbelievable timing. In fact  YouTube didn't even have a business model when it first started. It wasn't even certain that  that would work out. But that was beautifully   beautifully timed. So what I would say  in summary  is execution definitely matters a lot. The idea matters a lot. But timing might matter even more. And the best way to really assess timing is to really look at whether  consumers are really ready for what you have to offer them. And to be really  really honest about it  not be in denial about any results that you see  because if you have something you love  you want to push it forward  but you have to be very  very honest about that factor on timing. As I said earlier  I think startups can change the world and make the world a better place. I hope some of these insights can maybe help you have a slightly higher success ratio  and thus make something great come to the world that wouldn't have happened otherwise. Thank you very much  you've been a great audience. Mark Twain summed up what I take to be one of the fundamental problems of cognitive science with a single witticism. He said   There's something fascinating about science. One gets such wholesale returns of conjecture out of such a trifling investment in fact.  Twain meant it as a joke  of course  but he's right  There's something fascinating about science. From a few bones  we infer the existence of dinosuars. From spectral lines  the composition of nebulae. From fruit flies  the mechanisms of heredity  and from reconstructed images of blood flowing through the brain  or in my case  from the behavior of very young children  we try to say something about the fundamental mechanisms of human cognition. In particular  in my lab in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT  I have spent the past decade trying to understand the mystery of how children learn so much from so little so quickly. Because  it turns out that the fascinating thing about science is also a fascinating thing about children  which  to put a gentler spin on Mark Twain  is precisely their ability to draw rich  abstract inferences rapidly and accurately from sparse  noisy data. I'm going to give you just two examples today. One is about a problem of generalization  and the other is about a problem of causal reasoning. And although I'm going to talk about work in my lab  this work is inspired by and indebted to a field. I'm grateful to mentors  colleagues  and collaborators around the world. Let me start with the problem of generalization. Generalizing from small samples of data is the bread and butter of science. We poll a tiny fraction of the electorate and we predict the outcome of national elections. We see how a handful of patients responds to treatment in a clinical trial  and we bring drugs to a national market. But this only works if our sample is randomly drawn from the population. If our sample is cherry picked in some way    say  we poll only urban voters  or say  in our clinical trials for treatments for heart disease  we include only men    the results may not generalize to the broader population. So scientists care whether evidence is randomly sampled or not  but what does that have to do with babies  Well  babies have to generalize from small samples of data all the time. They see a few rubber ducks and learn that they float  or a few balls and learn that they bounce. And they develop expectations about ducks and balls that they're going to extend to rubber ducks and balls for the rest of their lives. And the kinds of generalizations babies have to make about ducks and balls they have to make about almost everything  shoes and ships and sealing wax and cabbages and kings. So do babies care whether the tiny bit of evidence they see is plausibly representative of a larger population  Let's find out. I'm going to show you two movies  one from each of two conditions of an experiment  and because you're going to see just two movies  you're going to see just two babies  and any two babies differ from each other in innumerable ways. But these babies  of course  here stand in for groups of babies  and the differences you're going to see represent average group differences in babies' behavior across conditions. In each movie  you're going to see a baby doing maybe just exactly what you might expect a baby to do  and we can hardly make babies more magical than they already are. But to my mind the magical thing  and what I want you to pay attention to  is the contrast between these two conditions  because the only thing that differs between these two movies is the statistical evidence the babies are going to observe. We're going to show babies a box of blue and yellow balls  and my then graduate student  now colleague at Stanford  Hyowon Gweon  is going to pull three blue balls in a row out of this box  and when she pulls those balls out  she's going to squeeze them  and the balls are going to squeak. And if you're a baby  that's like a TED Talk. It doesn't get better than that. But the important point is it's really easy to pull three blue balls in a row out of a box of mostly blue balls. You could do that with your eyes closed. It's plausibly a random sample from this population. And if you can reach into a box at random and pull out things that squeak  then maybe everything in the box squeaks. So maybe babies should expect those yellow balls to squeak as well. Now  those yellow balls have funny sticks on the end  so babies could do other things with them if they wanted to. They could pound them or whack them. But let's see what the baby does. Did you see that   Ball squeaks  Cool. See this one  Wow. Laura Schulz  Told you.  Laughs  Hey Clara  this one's for you. You can go ahead and play. LS  I don't even have to talk  right  All right  it's nice that babies will generalize properties of blue balls to yellow balls  and it's impressive that babies can learn from imitating us  but we've known those things about babies for a very long time. The really interesting question is what happens when we show babies exactly the same thing  and we can ensure it's exactly the same because we have a secret compartment and we actually pull the balls from there  but this time  all we change is the apparent population from which that evidence was drawn. This time  we're going to show babies three blue balls pulled out of a box of mostly yellow balls  and guess what  You  probably won't  randomly draw three blue balls in a row out of a box of mostly yellow balls. That is not plausibly randomly sampled evidence. That evidence suggests that maybe Hyowon was deliberately sampling the blue balls. Maybe there's something special about the blue balls. Maybe only the blue balls squeak. Let's see what the baby does. See this toy   Ball squeaks  Oh  that was cool. See   Ball squeaks  Now this one's for you to play. You can go ahead and play. LS  So you just saw two    month old babies do entirely different things based only on the probability of the sample they observed. Let me show you the experimental results. On the vertical axis  you'll see the percentage of babies who squeezed the ball in each condition  and as you'll see  babies are much more likely to generalize the evidence when it's plausibly representative of the population than when the evidence is clearly cherry picked. And this leads to a fun prediction  Suppose you pulled just one blue ball out of the mostly yellow box. You  probably won't  pull three blue balls in a row at random out of a yellow box  but you could randomly sample just one blue ball. That's not an improbable sample. And if you could reach into a box at random and pull out something that squeaks  maybe everything in the box squeaks. So even though babies are going to see much less evidence for squeaking  and have many fewer actions to imitate in this one ball condition than in the condition you just saw  we predicted that babies themselves would squeeze more  and that's exactly what we found. So    month old babies  in this respect  like scientists  care whether evidence is randomly sampled or not  and they use this to develop expectations about the world  what squeaks and what doesn't  what to explore and what to ignore. Let me show you another example now  this time about a problem of causal reasoning. And it starts with a problem of confounded evidence that all of us have  which is that we are part of the world. And this might not seem like a problem to you  but like most problems  it's only a problem when things go wrong. Take this baby  for instance. Things are going wrong for him. He would like to make this toy go  and he can't. I'll show you a few second clip. And there's two possibilities  broadly  Maybe he's doing something wrong  or maybe there's something wrong with the toy. So in this next experiment  we're going to give babies just a tiny bit of statistical data supporting one hypothesis over the other  and we're going to see if babies can use that to make different decisions about what to do. Here's the setup. Hyowon is going to try to make the toy go and succeed. I am then going to try twice and fail both times  and then Hyowon is going to try again and succeed  and this roughly sums up my relationship to my graduate students in technology across the board. But the important point here is it provides a little bit of evidence that the problem isn't with the toy  it's with the person. Some people can make this toy go  and some can't. Now  when the baby gets the toy  he's going to have a choice. His mom is right there  so he can go ahead and hand off the toy and change the person  but there's also going to be another toy at the end of that cloth  and he can pull the cloth towards him and change the toy. So let's see what the baby does. LS  One  two  three  go  Arthur  I'm going to try again. One  two  three  go  YG  Arthur  let me try again  okay  One  two  three  go   Music  Look at that. Remember these toys  See these toys  Yeah  I'm going to put this one over here  and I'm going to give this one to you. You can go ahead and play. LS  Okay  Laura  but of course  babies love their mommies. Of course babies give toys to their mommies when they can't make them work. So again  the really important question is what happens when we change the statistical data ever so slightly. This time  babies are going to see the toy work and fail in exactly the same order  but we're changing the distribution of evidence. This time  Hyowon is going to succeed once and fail once  and so am I. And this suggests it doesn't matter who tries this toy  the toy is broken. It doesn't work all the time. Again  the baby's going to have a choice. Her mom is right next to her  so she can change the person  and there's going to be another toy at the end of the cloth. Let's watch what she does. Let me try one more time. One  two  three  go  Hmm. LS  Let me try  Clara. One  two  three  go  Hmm  let me try again. One  two  three  go   Music  HG  I'm going to put this one over here  and I'm going to give this one to you. You can go ahead and play. LS  Let me show you the experimental results. On the vertical axis  you'll see the distribution of children's choices in each condition  and you'll see that the distribution of the choices children make depends on the evidence they observe. So in the second year of life  babies can use a tiny bit of statistical data to decide between two fundamentally different strategies for acting in the world  asking for help and exploring. I've just shown you two laboratory experiments out of literally hundreds in the field that make similar points  because the really critical point is that children's ability to make rich inferences from sparse data underlies all the species specific cultural learning that we do. Children learn about new tools from just a few examples. They learn new causal relationships from just a few examples. They even learn new words  in this case in American Sign Language. I want to close with just two points. If you've been following my world  the field of brain and cognitive sciences  for the past few years  three big ideas will have come to your attention. The first is that this is the era of the brain. And indeed  there have been staggering discoveries in neuroscience  localizing functionally specialized regions of cortex  turning mouse brains transparent  activating neurons with light. A second big idea is that this is the era of big data and machine learning  and machine learning promises to revolutionize our understanding of everything from social networks to epidemiology. And maybe  as it tackles problems of scene understanding and natural language processing  to tell us something about human cognition. And the final big idea you'll have heard is that maybe it's a good idea we're going to know so much about brains and have so much access to big data  because left to our own devices  humans are fallible  we take shortcuts  we err  we make mistakes  we're biased  and in innumerable ways  we get the world wrong. I think these are all important stories  and they have a lot to tell us about what it means to be human  but I want you to note that today I told you a very different story. It's a story about minds and not brains  and in particular  it's a story about the kinds of computations that uniquely human minds can perform  which involve rich  structured knowledge and the ability to learn from small amounts of data  the evidence of just a few examples. And fundamentally  it's a story about how starting as very small children and continuing out all the way to the greatest accomplishments of our culture  we get the world right. Folks  human minds do not only learn from small amounts of data. Human minds think of altogether new ideas. Human minds generate research and discovery  and human minds generate art and literature and poetry and theater  and human minds take care of other humans  our old  our young  our sick. We even heal them. In the years to come  we're going to see technological innovations beyond anything I can even envision  but we are very unlikely to see anything even approximating the computational power of a human child in my lifetime or in yours. If we invest in these most powerful learners and their development  in babies and children and mothers and fathers and caregivers and teachers the ways we invest in our other most powerful and elegant forms of technology  engineering and design  we will not just be dreaming of a better future  we will be planning for one. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Laura  thank you. I do actually have a question for you. First of all  the research is insane. I mean  who would design an experiment like that   Laughter  I've seen that a couple of times  and I still don't honestly believe that that can truly be happening  but other people have done similar experiments  it checks out. The babies really are that genius. LS  You know  they look really impressive in our experiments  but think about what they look like in real life  right  It starts out as a baby. Eighteen months later  it's talking to you  and babies' first words aren't just things like balls and ducks  they're things like  all gone   which refer to disappearance  or  uh oh   which refer to unintentional actions. It has to be that powerful. It has to be much more powerful than anything I showed you. They're figuring out the entire world. A four year old can talk to you about almost anything. CA  And if I understand you right  the other key point you're making is  we've been through these years where there's all this talk of how quirky and buggy our minds are  that behavioral economics and the whole theories behind that that we're not rational agents. You're really saying that the bigger story is how extraordinary  and there really is genius there that is underappreciated. LS  One of my favorite quotes in psychology comes from the social psychologist Solomon Asch  and he said the fundamental task of psychology is to remove the veil of self evidence from things. There are orders of magnitude more decisions you make every day that get the world right. You know about objects and their properties. You know them when they're occluded. You know them in the dark. You can walk through rooms. You can figure out what other people are thinking. You can talk to them. You can navigate space. You know about numbers. You know causal relationships. You know about moral reasoning. You do this effortlessly  so we don't see it  but that is how we get the world right  and it's a remarkable and very difficult to understand accomplishment. CA  I suspect there are people in the audience who have this view of accelerating technological power who might dispute your statement that never in our lifetimes will a computer do what a three year old child can do  but what's clear is that in any scenario  our machines have so much to learn from our toddlers. LS  I think so. You'll have some machine learning folks up here. I mean  you should never bet against babies or chimpanzees or technology as a matter of practice  but it's not just a difference in quantity  it's a difference in kind. We have incredibly powerful computers  and they do do amazingly sophisticated things  often with very big amounts of data. Human minds do  I think  something quite different  and I think it's the structured  hierarchical nature of human knowledge that remains a real challenge. CA  Laura Schulz  wonderful food for thought. Thank you so much. LS  Thank you.  Applause  In the great     s movie   The Blues Brothers   there's a scene where John Belushi goes to visit Dan Aykroyd in his apartment in Chicago for the very first time. It's a cramped  tiny space and it's just three feet away from the train tracks. As John sits on Dan's bed  a train goes rushing by  rattling everything in the room. John asks   How often does that train go by   Dan replies   So often  you won't even notice it.  And then  something falls off the wall. We all know what he's talking about. As human beings  we get used to everyday things really fast. As a product designer  it's my job to see those everyday things  to feel them  and try to improve upon them. For example  see this piece of fruit  See this little sticker  That sticker wasn't there when I was a kid. But somewhere as the years passed  someone had the bright idea to put that sticker on the fruit. Why  So it could be easier for us to check out  at the grocery counter. Well that's great  we can get in and out of the store quickly. But now  there's a new problem. When we get home and we're hungry and we see this ripe  juicy piece of fruit on the counter  we just want to pick it up and eat it. Except now  we have to look for this little sticker. And dig at it with our nails  damaging the flesh. Then rolling up that sticker    you know what I mean. And then trying to flick it off your fingers. It's not fun  not at all. But something interesting happened. See the first time you did it  you probably felt those feelings. You just wanted to eat the piece of fruit. You felt upset. You just wanted to dive in. By the   th time  you started to become less upset and you just started peeling the label off. By the    th time  at least for me  I became numb to it. I simply picked up the piece of fruit  dug at it with my nails  tried to flick it off  and then wondered   Was there another sticker   So why is that  Why do we get used to everyday things  Well as human beings  we have limited brain power. And so our brains encode the  everyday things we do into habits so we can free up space  to learn new things. It's a process called habituation and it's one of the most basic ways  as humans  we learn. Now  habituation isn't always bad. Remember learning to drive  I sure do. Your hands clenched at    and   on the wheel  looking at every single object out there    the cars  the lights  the pedestrians. It's a nerve wracking experience. So much so  that I couldn't even talk to anyone else in the car and I couldn't even listen to music. But then something interesting happened. As the weeks went by  driving became easier and easier. You habituated it. It started to become  fun and second nature. And then  you could talk  to your friends again and listen to music. So there's a good reason why our brains habituate things. If we didn't  we'd notice every little detail  all the time. It would be exhausting  and we'd have no time to learn about new things. But sometimes  habituation isn't good. If it stops us from noticing  the problems that are around us  well  that's bad. And if it stops us from noticing  and fixing those problems  well  then that's really bad. Comedians know all about this. Jerry Seinfeld's entire career was built on noticing those little details  those idiotic things we do every day that we don't even remember. He tells us about the time  he visited his friends and he just wanted to take  a comfortable shower. He'd reach out and grab the handle and turn it slightly one way  and it was     degrees too hot. And then he'd turn it the other way  and it was     degrees too cold. He just wanted a comfortable shower. Now  we've all been there  we just don't remember it. But Jerry did  and that's a comedian's job. But designers  innovators  and entrepreneurs  it's our job to not just notice those things  but to go one step further and try to fix them. See this  this person  this is Mary Anderson. In      in New York City  she was visiting. It was a cold  wet  snowy day and she was warm inside a streetcar. As she was going to her destination  she noticed the driver opening the window to clean off the excess snow so he could drive safely. When he opened the window  though  he let all this cold  wet air inside  making all the passengers miserable. Now probably  most of those  passengers just thought   It's a fact of life  he's got to open the window to clean it. That's just how it is.  But Mary didn't. Mary thought   What if the diver could actually clean the windshield from the inside so that he could stay safe and drive and the passengers could  actually stay warm   So she picked up her sketchbook right then and there  and began drawing what would become the world's first windshield wiper. Now as a product designer  I try to learn from people like Mary to try to see the world  the way it really is  not the way we think it is. Why  Because it's easy to solve a problem that almost everyone sees. But it's hard to solve a problem that almost no one sees. Now some people think you're born with this ability or you're not  as if Mary Anderson was hardwired at birth to see the world more clearly. That wasn't the case for me. I had to work at it. During my years at Apple  Steve Jobs challenged us to come into work every day  to see our products through  the eyes of the customer  the new customer  the one that has fears  and possible frustrations and hopeful exhilaration that their new technology product could work straightaway for them. He called it staying beginners  and wanted to make sure that we focused on those tiny little details to make them faster  easier and seamless for the new customers. So I remember this clearly in the very earliest days of the iPod. See  back in the '  s  being a gadget freak like I am  I would rush out to the store for the very  very latest gadget. I'd take all the time to get to the store  I'd check out  I'd come back home  I'd start to unbox it. And then  there was  another little sticker  the one that said   Charge before use.  What  I can't believe it  I just spent all this time buying this product and now I have to charge before use. I have to wait what felt like an eternity to use that coveted new toy. It was crazy. But you know what  Almost every product back then did that. When it had batteries in it  you had to charge it before you used it. Well  Steve noticed that and he said   We're not going to let that  happen to our product.  So what did we do  Typically  when you have a product that has a hard drive in it  you run it for about     minutes in the factory to make sure that hard drive's going  to be working years later for the customer after they  pull it out of the box. What did we do instead  We ran that product for over two hours. Why  Well  first off  we could make a higher quality product  be easy to test  and make sure it was great for the customer. But most importantly  the battery came fully charged right out of the box  ready to use. So that customer   with all that exhilaration  could just start using the product. It was great  and it worked. People liked it. Today  almost every product that you get that's battery powered comes out of the box fully charged  even if it doesn't have a hard drive. But back then  we noticed  that detail and we fixed it  and now everyone else does that as well. No more   Charge before use.  So why am I telling you this  Well  it's seeing the invisible problem  not just the obvious problem  that's important  not just for product design  but for everything we do. You see  there are invisible problems all around us  ones we can solve. But first we need to see them  to feel them. So  I'm hesitant to give you any tips about neuroscience or psychology. There's far too many experienced people in the TED community who would know much more about that than I ever will. But let me leave you with a few tips that I do  that we all can do  to fight habituation. My first tip is to look broader. You see  when you're tackling a problem  sometimes  there are a lot of steps that lead up to that problem. And sometimes  a lot  of steps after it. If you can take a step back and look broader  maybe you can change some of those boxes before the problem. Maybe you can combine them. Maybe you can remove them altogether to make that better. Take thermostats  for instance. In the     s when they first came out  they were really simple to use. You could turn them up or turn them down. People understood them. But in the     s  the energy crisis struck  and customers started thinking about how to save energy. So what happened  Thermostat designers decided  to add a new step. Instead of just turning up and down  you now had to program it. So you could tell it the temperature you wanted at a certain time. Now that seemed great. Every thermostat had started adding that feature. But it turned out that no one saved any energy. Now  why is that  Well  people couldn't predict the future. They just didn't know how their weeks would change season to season  year to year. So no one was saving energy  and what happened  Thermostat designers went back to the drawing board and they focused on that programming step. They made better U.I.s  they made better documentation. But still  years later  people were not saving any energy because they just couldn't predict the future. So what did we do  We put a machine learning algorithm in instead of the programming that would simply watch when you turned it up and down  when you liked a certain temperature when you got up  or when you went away. And you know what  It worked. People are saving energy  without any programming. So  it doesn't matter what you're doing. If you take a step back  and look at all the boxes  maybe there's a way to remove one or combine them so that you can make  that process much simpler. So that's my first tip  look broader. For my second tip  it's to look closer. One of my greatest teachers  was my grandfather. He taught me all about the world. He taught me how things were built and how they were repaired  the tools and techniques necessary to make a successful project. I remember one story  he told me about screws  and about how you need to have the right screw for the right job. There are many different screws  wood screws  metal screws  anchors  concrete screws  the list went on and on. Our job is to make products that are easy to install for all of our customs themselves without professionals. So what did we do  I remembered that story  that my grandfather told me  and so we thought   How many different screws  can we put in the box  Was it going to be two  three  four  five  Because there's so many different wall types.  So we thought about it  we optimized it  and we came up with three different screws to put in the box. We thought that was going to solve the problem. But it turned out  it didn't. So we shipped the product  and people weren't having a great experience. So what did we do  We went back to the drawing board just instantly after we figured out we didn't get it right. And we designed a special screw  a custom screw  much to the chagrin of our investors. They were like   Why are you spending so much time on a little screw  Get out there and sell more   And we said   We will sell more if we get this right.  And it turned out  we did. With that custom little screw  there was just one screw in the box  that was easy to mount and put on the wall. So if we focus on those tiny details  the ones we may not see and we look at them as we say   Are those important or is that the way we've always done it  Maybe there's a way to get rid of those.  So my last piece of advice is to think younger. Every day  I'm confronted with interesting questions from my three young kids. They come up with questions like   Why can't cars fly around traffic   Or   Why don't my shoelaces have Velcro instead   Sometimes  those questions are smart. My son came to me the other day and I asked him   Go run out to the mailbox  and check it.  He looked at me  puzzled  and said   Why doesn't the mailbox just check itself and tell us when it has mail    Laughter  I was like   That's a pretty  good question.  So  they can ask tons of questions and sometimes we find out we just don't have the right answers. We say   Son  that's just the way the world works.  So the more we're exposed to something  the more we get used to it. But kids haven't been around  long enough to get used to those things. And so when they run into problems  they immediately try to solve them  and sometimes they find a better way  and that way really is better. So my advice that we take to heart is to have young people on your team  or people with young minds. Because if you have those young minds  they cause everyone in the room to think younger. Picasso once said    Every child is an artist. The problem is when he or she grows up  is how to remain an artist.  We all saw the world more clearly when we saw it for the first time  before a lifetime of habits  got in the way. Our challenge is to get back there  to feel that frustration  to see those little details  to look broader  look closer  and to think younger so we can stay beginners. It's not easy. It requires us pushing back against one of the most basic ways we make sense of the world. But if we do  we could do some pretty amazing things. For me  hopefully  that's better product design. For you  that could mean something else  something powerful. Our challenge is to wake up  each day and say   How can I experience the world better   And if we do  maybe  just maybe  we can get rid of these dumb little stickers. Thank you very much. The FBI is responsible for more terrorism plots in the United States than any other organization. More than al Qaeda  more than al Shabaab  more than the Islamic State  more than all of them combined. This isn't likely how you think about the FBI. You probably think of FBI agents gunning down bad guys like John Dillinger  or arresting corrupt politicians. After the      terrorist attacks  the FBI became less concerned with gangsters and  crooked elected officials. The new target became terrorists  and the pursuit of terrorists  has consumed the FBI. Every year  the Bureau spends  .  billion dollars on domestic counterterrorism activities. Compare than to just  .  billion dollars combined for organized crime  financial fraud  public corruption and all other types of traditional criminal activity. I've spent years pouring through the case files of terrorism prosecutions in  the United States  and I've come to  the conclusion that the FBI is much better at creating terrorists than it is at catching terrorists. In the    years since       you can count about six real  terrorist attacks in the United States. These include the Boston Marathon  bombings in       as well as failed attacks  such as the time when  a man named Faisal Shahzad tried to deliver a car bomb to Times Square. In those same    years  the Bureau  however  has bragged about how it's foiled dozens of terrorism plots. In all  the FBI has arrested more than     people in aggressive  undercover  conterterrorism stings. These operations  which are usually led by an informant  provide the means and opportunity  and sometimes even the idea  for mentally ill and  economically desperate people to become what we now term terrorists. After       the FBI was given an edict  never again. Never another attack on American soil. FBI agents were told to find terrorists before they struck. To do this  agents recruited a network of more than        informants nationwide  all looking for anyone who  might be dangerous. An informant can earn          dollars or more for every terrorism case  they bring to the FBI. That's right  the FBI is paying mostly criminals and con men six figures to spy on communities in the United States  but mostly Muslim American communities. These informants nab people like  Abu Khalid Abdul Latif and Walli Mujahidh. Both are mentally ill. Abdul Latif had a history of huffing gasoline and attempting suicide. Mujahidh had schizoaffective disorder  he had trouble distinguishing between reality and fantasy. In       the FBI arrested these two men for conspiring to attack a military recruiting station outside Seattle with weapons provided   of course  by the FBI. The FBI's informant was Robert Childs  a convicted rapist and child molester who was paid        dollars  for his work on the case. This isn't an outlier. In       an FBI informant who had fled Pakistan on murder charges led four men in a plot to bomb  synagogues in the Bronx. The lead defendant was James Cromitie  a broke Walmart employee with a history of mental problems. And the informant had offered  him         dollars if he participated in that plot. There are many more examples. Today  The Intercept published my new story about a counterterrorism sting in Tampa involving Sami Osmakac  a young man who was living  near Tampa  Florida. Osmakac also had  schizoaffective disorder. He too was broke  and he had no connections to  international terrorist groups. Nonetheless  an FBI informant gave him a job  handed him money  introduced him to an undercover agent posing as a terrorist  and lured him in a plot to bomb an Irish bar. But here's what's interesting  The lead undercover agent    you can see him in this picture with his face blurred    would go back to the Tampa field office with his recording equipment on. Behind closed doors  FBI agents admitted that what they were doing was farcical. A federal judge doesn't want you to hear about these conversations. He sealed the transcripts and placed them under a protective order in an attempt to prevent someone like me from doing something like this. Behind closed doors  the lead agent  the squad supervisor  described their would be terrorist as a  retarded fool who didn't have a pot to piss in.  They described his terrorist ambitions as wishy washy and a pipe dream scenario. But that didn't stop the FBI. They provided Sami Osmakac  everything he needed. They gave him a car bomb  they gave him an AK     they helped him make a so called martyrdom video  and they even gave  him money for a taxi cab so that he could get to where they wanted him to go. As they were working the sting  the squad supervisor tells his agents he wanted a Hollywood ending. And he got a Hollywood ending. When Sami Osmakac attempted to deliver what he thought was a car bomb  he was arrested  convicted and  sentenced to    years in prison. Sami Osmakac isn't alone. He's one of more than      so called terrorists  for whom the FBI has created  Hollywood endings. U.S. government officials call this the War on Terror. It's really just theater  a national security theater  with mentally ill men like Sami Osmakac unwitting actors in a  carefully choreographed production brought to you by the FBI. Thank you. Tom Rielly  So  those are some pretty strong accusations  pretty strong charges. How can you back this up  Trevor Aaronson  My research began in      when I received a grant from the  Investigative Reporting Program at U.C. Berkeley  and a research assistant and I put together a database of all terrorism prosecutions at the time during  the first decade after     . And we used the court file to find out whether the defendants had any connections to international terrorist groups  whether an informant was used  and whether the informant played the role of an agent provocateur by providing the means and opportunity. And we submitted that to the FBI and we asked them to respond to our database. If they believed there were any errors  we asked them to tell us what they were and we'd go back and check and they never challenged any of our findings. Later  I used that data  in a magazine article and later in my book  and on appearances on places like CBS and NPR  they were offered that opportunity again to say   Trevor Aaronson's  findings are wrong.  And they've never come forward and said   These are the problems with those findings.  So the data has since been used  by groups like Human Rights Watch on its recent report on  these types of sting operations. And so far  the FBI has never  really responded to these charges that it's really not catching terrorists so much as it's catching mentally ill people that it can dress up as terrorists  in these types of sting operations. TR  So The Intercept is that new investigative journalism website  that's cofounded by Glenn Greenwald. Tell us about your article  and why there. TA  The Intercept seemed to be the most logical place for this because my article is  really leveraging the fact that a source had leaked to me transcripts of these private FBI conversations that a federal judge had sealed based on the government's claim  that their release would irreparably damage  the U.S. government's law enforcement strategy. So a place like The Intercept was set up to protect journalists and publish their work when they're dealing with  very sensitive matters like this. So my story in The Intercept   which was just published today  tells the story of how Sami Osmakac was set up in this FBI sting and goes into much greater detail. In this talk  I could only highlight the things that they said  such as calling him a  retarded fool.  But it was much more elaborate  they went to great lengths to put money in Sami Osmakac's hands  which he then used to purchase weapons from the undercover agent. When he went to trial  the central piece of evidence  was that he paid for these weapons  when in truth  these transcripts show how the FBI orchestrated someone who was essentially mentally ill and broke to get money to then  pay for weapons that they could then charge him in a conspiracy for. TR  One final question. Less than    days ago  the FBI arrested some potential  ISIS suspects in Brooklyn  saying that they might be headed to Syria  and were those real  or examples of more of the same  TA  Well so far  we only know what's come out in the court file  but they seem to suggest it's another example of the same. These types of sting operations  have moved from flavor to flavor. So initially it was al Qaeda plots  and now the Islamic State is the current flavor. What's worth noting about that case is that the three men that were charged only began the plot to go to Syria after the introduction of the FBI informant  and in fact  the FBI informant had helped them with the travel documents that they needed. In kind of a comical turn  in that particular case  one of the defendant's mother had found out that he was interested in going to Syria and had hid his passport. So it's unclear that even if he had showed up at the airport  that he ever could have gone anywhere. So yes  there are people who might be interested in joining the Islamic State in the United States  and those are people that the United  States government should be looking at to see if they're interested in violence here. In this particular case  given the evidence that's so far come out  it suggests the FBI made it possible for these guys to move along in a plan to go to Syria when they were never close  to that in the first place. TR  Thanks a lot  that's amazing. TA  Thank you. It was November          my first day as a principal  but hardly my first day in the school district of Philadelphia. I graduated from Philadelphia public schools  and I went on to teach special education for    years in a low income  low performing school in North Philadelphia  where crime is rampant and deep poverty is among the highest in the nation. Shortly after I walked into my new school  a huge fight broke out among the girls. After things were quickly under control  I immediately called a meeting in the school's auditorium to introduce myself as the school's new principal. I walked in angry  a little nervous    but I was determined to set the tone for my new students. I started listing as forcefully as I could my expectations for their behavior and my expectations for what they would learn in school. When  all of a sudden  a girl way in the back of the auditorium  she stood up and she said   Miss  Miss   When our eyes locked  she said   Why do you keep calling this a school  This is not a school.  In one outburst  Ashley had expressed what I felt and never quite was able to articulate about my own experience when I attended a low performing school in the same neighborhood  many  many  many years earlier. That school was definitely not a school. Fast forwarding a decade later to       I was entering my third low performing school as principal. I was to be Strawberry Mansion's fourth principal in four years. It was labeled  low performing and persistently dangerous  due to its low test scores and high number of weapons  drugs  assaults and arrests. Shortly as I approached the door of my new school and attempted to enter  and found the door locked with chains  I could hear Ashley's voice in my ears going   Miss  Miss  This is not a school.  The halls were dim and dark from poor lighting. There were tons of piles of broken old furniture and desks in the classrooms  and there were thousands of unused materials and resources. This was not a school. As the year progressed  I noticed that the classrooms were nearly empty. The students were just scared  scared to sit in rows in fear that something would happen  scared because they were often teased in the cafeteria for eating free food. They were scared from all the fighting and all the bullying. This was not a school. And then  there were the teachers  who were incredibly afraid for their own safety  so they had low expectations for the students and themselves  and they were totally unaware of their role in the destruction of the school's culture. This was the most troubling of all. You see  Ashley was right  and not just about her school. For far too many schools  for kids who live in poverty  their schools are really not schools at all. But this can change. Let me tell you how it's being done at Strawberry Mansion High School. Anybody who's ever worked with me will tell you I am known for my slogans. So today  I am going to use three that have been paramount in our quest for change. My first slogan is  if you're going to lead  lead. I always believed that what happens in a school and what does not happen in a school is up to the principal. I am the principal  and having that title required me to lead. I was not going to stay in my office  I was not going to delegate my work  and I was not going to be afraid to address anything that was not good for children  whether that made me liked or not. I am a leader  so I know I cannot do anything alone. So  I assembled a top notch leadership team who believed in the possibility of all the children  and together  we tackled the small things  like resetting every single locker combination by hand so that every student could have a secure locker. We decorated every bulletin board in that building with bright  colorful  and positive messages. We took the chains off the front doors of the school. We got the lightbulbs replaced  and we cleaned every classroom to its core  recycling every  every textbook that was not needed  and discarded thousands of old materials and furniture. We used two dumpsters per day. And  of course  of course  we tackled the big stuff  like rehauling the entire school budget so that we can reallocate funds to have more teachers and support staff. We rebuilt the entire school day schedule from scratch to add a variety of start and end times  remediation  honors courses  extracurricular activities  and counseling  all during the school day. All during the school day. We created a deployment plan that specified where every single support person and police officer would be every minute of the day  and we monitored at every second of the day  and  our best invention ever  we devised a schoolwide discipline program titled  Non negotiables.  It was a behavior system    designed to promote positive behavior at all times. The results  Strawberry Mansion was removed from the Persistently Dangerous List our first year after being    after being on the Persistently Dangerous List for five consecutive years. Leaders make the impossible possible. That brings me to my second slogan  So what  Now what  When we looked at the data  and we met with the staff  there were many excuses for why Strawberry Mansion was low performing and persistently dangerous. They said that only    percent of the kids come to school on a regular basis      percent of them live in poverty  only one percent of the parents participate  many of the children come from incarceration and single parent homes     percent of the students have special needs  and the state data revealed that six percent of the students were proficient in algebra  and    were proficient in literature. After they got through telling us all the stories of how awful the conditions and the children were  I looked at them  and I said   So what. Now what  What are we gonna do about it   Eliminating excuses at every turn became my primary responsibility. We addressed every one of those excuses through a mandatory professional development  paving the way for intense focus on teaching and learning. After many observations  what we determined was that teachers knew what to teach but they did not know how to teach so many children with so many vast abilities. So  we developed a lesson delivery model for instruction that focused on small group instruction  making it possible for all the students to get their individual needs met in the classroom. The results  After one year  state data revealed that our scores have grown by     percent in Algebra and     percent in literature. We have a very long way to go  a very long way to go  but we now approach every obstacle with a  So What. Now What   attitude. And that brings me to my third and final slogan. If nobody told you they loved you today  you remember I do  and I always will. My students have problems  social  emotional and economic problems you could never imagine. Some of them are parents themselves  and some are completely alone. If someone asked me my real secret for how I truly keep Strawberry Mansion moving forward  I would have to say that I love my students and I believe in their possibilities unconditionally. When I look at them  I can only see what they can become  and that is because I am one of them. I grew up poor in North Philadelphia too. I know what it feels like to go to a school that's not a school. I know what it feels like to wonder if there's ever going to be any way out of poverty. But because of my amazing mother  I got the ability to dream despite the poverty that surrounded me. So    if I'm going to push my students toward their dream and their purpose in life  I've got to get to know who they are. So I have to spend time with them  so I manage the lunchroom every day. And while I'm there  I talk to them about deeply personal things  and when it's their birthday  I sing  Happy Birthday  even though I cannot sing at all. I often ask them   Why do you want me to sing when I cannot sing at all   And they respond by saying   Because we like feeling special.  We hold monthly town hall meetings to listen to their concerns  to find out what is on their minds. They ask us questions like   Why do we have to follow rules    Why are there so many consequences    Why can't we just do what we want to do   They ask  and I answer each question honestly  and this exchange in listening helps to clear up any misconceptions. Every moment is a teachable moment. My reward  my reward for being non negotiable in my rules and consequences is their earned respect. I insist on it  and because of this  we can accomplish things together. They are clear about my expectations for them  and I repeat those expectations every day over the P.A. system. I remind them    I remind them of those core values of focus  tradition  excellence  integrity and perseverance  and I remind them every day how education can truly change their lives. And I end every announcement the same   If nobody told you they loved you today  you remember I do  and I always will.  Ashley's words of  Miss  Miss  this is not a school   is forever etched in my mind. If we are truly going to make real progress in addressing poverty  then we have to make sure that every school that serves children in poverty is a real school  a school  a school    a school that provides them with knowledge and mental training to navigate the world around them. I do not know all the answers  but what I do know is for those of us who are privileged and have the responsibility of leading a school that serves children in poverty  we must truly lead  and when we are faced with unbelievable challenges  we must stop and ask ourselves   So what. Now what  What are we going to do about it   And as we lead  we must never forget that every single one of our students is just a child  often scared by what the world tells them they should be  and no matter what the rest of the world tells them they should be  we should always provide them with hope  our undivided attention  unwavering belief in their potential  consistent expectations  and we must tell them often  if nobody told them they loved them today  remember we do  and we always will. Thank you. Thank you  Jesus. In       during the final six months of Kim Jong Il's life  I lived undercover in North Korea. I was born and raised in South Korea  their enemy. I live in America  their other enemy. Since       I had visited North Korea a few times. And I had come to realize that to write about it with any meaning  or to understand the place beyond the regime's propaganda  the only option was total immersion. So I posed as a teacher and a missionary at an all male university in Pyongyang. The Pyongyang University of Science and Technology was founded by Evangelical Christians who cooperate with the regime to educate the sons of the North Korean elite  without proselytizing  which is a capital crime there. The students were     young men  expected to be the future leaders of the most isolated and brutal dictatorship in existence. When I arrived  they became my students.      was a special year  marking the    th anniversary of the birth of North Korea's original Great Leader  Kim Il Sung. To celebrate the occasion  the regime shut down all universities  and sent students off to the fields to build the DPRK's much heralded ideal as the world's most powerful and prosperous nation. My students were the only ones spared from that fate. North Korea is a gulag posing as a nation. Everything there is about the Great Leader. Every book  every newspaper article  every song  every TV program    there is just one subject. The flowers are named after him  the mountains are carved with his slogans. Every citizen wears the badge of the Great Leader at all times. Even their calendar system begins with the birth of Kim Il Sung. The school was a heavily guarded prison  posing as a campus. Teachers could only leave on group outings accompanied by an official minder. Even then  our trips were limited to sanctioned national monuments celebrating the Great Leader. The students were not allowed to leave the campus  or communicate with their parents. Their days were meticulously mapped out  and any free time they had was devoted to honoring their Great Leader. Lesson plans had to meet the approval of North Korean staff  every class was recorded and reported on  every room was bugged  and every conversation  overheard. Every blank space was covered with the  portraits of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il  like everywhere else in North Korea. We were never allowed to discuss the outside world. As students of science and technology  many of them were computer majors but they did not know the existence of the Internet. They had never heard of Mark Zuckerberg or Steve Jobs. Facebook  Twitter    none of those things would have meant a thing. And I could not tell them. I went there looking for truth. But where do you even start when an entire nation's ideology  my students' day to day realities  and even my own position at the universities  were all built on lies  I started with a game. We played  Truth and Lie.  A volunteer would write a sentence on the chalkboard  and the other students had to guess whether it was a truth or a lie. Once a student wrote   I visited China last year on vacation   and everyone shouted   Lie   They all knew this wasn't possible. Virtually no North Korean is allowed to leave the country. Even traveling within their own country requires a travel pass. I had hoped that this game would reveal some truth about my students  because they lie so often and so easily  whether about the mythical accomplishments of their Great Leader  or the strange claim that they cloned a rabbit as fifth graders. The difference between truth and lies seemed at times hazy to them. It took me a while to understand the different types of lies  they lie to shield their system from the world  or they were taught lies  and were just regurgitating them. Or  at moments  they lied out of habit. But if all they have ever known were lies  how could we expect them to be otherwise  Next  I tried to teach them essay writing. But that turned out to be nearly impossible. Essays are about coming up with one's own thesis  and making an evidence based argument to prove it. These students  however  were simply told what to think  and they obeyed. In their world  critical thinking was not allowed. I also gave them the weekly assignment of writing a personal letter  to anybody. It took a long time  but eventually some of them began to write to their mothers  their friends  their girlfriends. Although those were just homework  and would never reach their intended recipients  my students slowly began to reveal their true feelings in them. They wrote that they were fed up with the sameness of everything. They were worried about their future. In those letters  they rarely ever mentioned their Great Leader. I was spending all of my time with these young men. We all ate meals together  played basketball together. I often called them gentlemen  which made them giggle. They blushed at the mention of girls. And I came to adore them. And watching them open up even in the tiniest of ways  was deeply moving. But something also felt wrong. During those months of living in their world  I often wondered if the truth would  in fact  improve their lives. I wanted so much to tell them the truth  of their country and of the outside world  where Arab youth were turning their rotten regime inside out  using the power of social media  where everyone except them was connected through the world wide web  which wasn't worldwide after all. But for them  the truth was dangerous. By encouraging them to run after it  I was putting them at risk    of persecution  of heartbreak. When you're not allowed to express anything in the open  you become good at reading what is unspoken. In one of their personal letters to me  a student wrote that he understood why I always called them gentlemen. It was because I was wishing them to be gentle in life  he said. On my last day in December of       the day Kim Jong Il's death was announced  their world shattered. I had to leave without a proper goodbye. But I think they knew how sad I was for them. Once  toward the end of my stay  a student said to me   Professor  we never think of you as being different from us. Our circumstances are different  but you're the same as us. We want you to know that we truly think of you as being the same.  Today  if I could respond to my students with a letter of my own  which is of course impossible  I would tell them this   My dear gentlemen  It's been a bit over three years since I last saw you. And now  you must be       maybe even as old as   . At our final class  I asked you if there was anything you wanted. The only wish you expressed  the only thing you ever asked of me in all those months we spent together  was for me to speak to you in Korean. Just once. I was there to teach you English  you knew it wasn't allowed. But I understood then  you wanted to share that bond of our mother tongue. I called you my gentlemen  but I don't know if being gentle in Kim Jong Un's merciless North Korea is a good thing. I don't want you to lead a revolution    let some other young person do it. The rest of the world might casually encourage or even expect some sort of North Korean Spring  but I don't want you to do anything risky  because I know in your world  someone is always watching. I don't want to imagine what might happen to you. If my attempts to reach you have inspired something new in you  I would rather you forget me. Become soldiers of your Great Leader  and live long  safe lives. You once asked me if I thought your city of Pyongyang was beautiful  and I could not answer truthfully then. But I know why you asked. I know that it was important for you to hear that I  your teacher  the one who has seen the world that you are forbidden from  declare your city as the most beautiful. I know hearing that would make your lives there a bit more bearable  but no  I don't find your capital beautiful. Not because it's monotone and concrete  but because of what it symbolizes  a monster that feeds off the rest of the country  where citizens are soldiers and slaves. All I see there is darkness. But it's your home  so I cannot hate it. And I hope instead that you  my lovely young gentlemen  will one day help make it beautiful. Thank you. This is a play called  Sell Buy Date.  It's my first since  Bridge and Tunnel   which I did on Broadway  and this one  I    thank you    I've excerpted it just for you  so here we go. Right. Class  let's be absolutely certain all electronic devices are switched off before we begin. So class  hopefully you'll recognize what you just heard me say as the      Very good  the cellular phone announcement. Right  This was also known as a mobile phone. So you'll remember  people of that era would have had an external electronic device  right  something like this  and they all would have carried one of these around with them  and amongst their biggest fears was the sheer mortification that one of these might ring at some inopportune moment. Right  So a bit of trivia about that era for you. So the format of today's class is I will be presenting multiple BERT modules today from that period in history  right  so starting circa     . And remember  this was the very first year of the BERT program. So we've got quite a few of these to get through. Bear in mind  I will be living into various different bodies  different ages  also what were then called races  or ethnic groups  as you'll remember from Unit  . And     Laughter     and along the gender continuum  I will be living into males as well. It was quite binary at that time. Also  don't forget  we are reading the book module for next week's focus on gender. Now  I know some of you have requested the book in pill form. I know people still believe ingesting it is better for retention  but since we are trying to experience what our forebears did  right  let's please just consider doing the actual ocular reading  okay  And also  how many people have your emotional shunts engaged  Right. Please toggle them off. Okay  I know it's challenging  but I want you to be able to feel the entire natural emo range  all right  It is essential to this part of the syllabus. Yes  Macy  All right. I understand. If you're unwilling to    All right  well  we can discuss that after class. All right  we will discuss your concerns. Just relax. Nobody's died and gone to composting. Okay. After class. Okay  After class. Let's just get started  okay. This first subject identified as a middle class homemaker. Remember  these early modules in these people's full identities were protected  and this allowed them to speak more freely on our topic  which for many of them was taboo. Okay honey  now  I'm ready when you are. No  sweetheart  I said  I'm ready when you are. I'm freezing. It's like a meat locker in here in this recording studio. I should have brought a shmata. All this fancy technology but they can't afford heat. What is he saying  I can't hear you  I can't hear you through the glass  honey  There you are in my ear. Oh  you can hear me  The whole time. Oh  yes  I am a little chilly. Yes  oh the cold is for the machines  the new technology. Okay. Yes  now remind me again  you're recording not only my voice but my feelings and my memories  Right. Yes  BERT  yes  I read about it. Bio Empathetic Resonant Technology. Right  right  so people will be able to feel my experience and my memory  Okay. No  right  I'm ready. I just thought you were going to give me a test to see how my memory's doing. I was going to tell you you're too late  it's already bad news. No  no  go ahead  honey. Oh  that's the first question  What do I think of prostitution  Are you soliciting me  young man  I've heard of May December romances  but what are you  about    years old  Eighteen  Eighteen years. I think I have candies in my purse older than    years old. I'm teasing you  sweetheart. No  I'm comfortable with any question. Sure. So about the prostitution    oh  sex worker  sex worker. No  just in my day  they called it prostitution  not sex work. Oh  because it includes pornography also  Okay. No  well  I guess when I was a girl  we didn't really have a name for that either. We would have said dirty magazines  I suppose  or dirty movies. Well  it's not like what you have with the Internet. No  well  I don't mind sharing. My late husband and I  we were a very romantic couple. Lots of tenderness  you understand. Well  as you get older  you know  at one point I thought my husband might be helped by using some of the pills men can take  but he wasn't interested in those  so I thought  what about maybe watching an adult movie on the Internet  Just for inspiration  you understand. Well  at the time  neither of us were very good on the computer  so usually  if we needed help with the Internet  we would just call our children or our grandchildren  but obviously  in this case  that wasn't an option  so I thought  I'll have a look myself  just to see. How difficult could it be  You search for certain key words and you look    Oh wow is right  young man. You can't imagine what I saw. Well  first of all  I was just trying to find  you know  couples  normal couples making love  but this  so many people together at one time. You couldn't tell which part belonged to which body. How they even got the cameras to capture some of this  I couldn't tell you. But the one thing they didn't capture was making love. There was lots of making of something  but they took the love part right out of it  you know  the fun. It was all very extreme  you know  Like you would say  with the extreme sports. Lots of endurance  but never tenderness. So anyway  needless to say  that was    .   I'll never get back again  but it only showed up on the credit card as  entertainment services   so my husband was never the wiser  and after all of that  well  you could say it turned out he didn't need the extra inspiration after all. Right  so next subject is a young woman     Applause     Next subject  class  is a young woman called Bella  a university student interviewed in      during what was called an Intro to Feminist Porn class as part of her major in sex work at a college in the Bay Area. Yeah  I just want to  like  get a recording of  like  you guys recording me  like a meta recording  or whatever. It's just like this whole experience is just  like  really amazing  and I'd like to capture that for  like  Instagram and my Tumblr. So  like  hi guys  it's me  Bella  and I am  like  being interviewed right now for this  like  really amazing Bio Empathetic Resonance Technology  which is  like  basically where they are  like  recording  as you can see from these  whatever  like  electrodes  the formation of  like  neuropeptides in my hippocampus  or whatever. They will later be able to reconstitute these as  like  my own actual memory  like actual experiences  so other people can  like  actually feel what I'm feeling right now. Okay. Okay. So  like  hello  BERT person of the future who is experiencing me. This is what it feels like to be  like  a college freshman  and also the  like  headache that you are experiencing through me is the  like  residual effect of the Jell O shots which I had last night at the bi weekly feminist pole dancing party which I cohost on Wednesdays. It's called  Don't Get All Pole emical      Laughter     and it's in Beekman Hall  and  what else  like  non Jell O shots are also available for vegans  and  oh  okay  yeah  totally  yeah  we should also focus on your questions also. So for your record  I am  like  a sex work studies major but minoring in social media with a concentration on notable YouTube memes. Yes  well  of course  like  I consider myself to be  like  obviously  like  a feminist. I was named for Bella Abzug  who was  like  a famous  like  feminist from history  and  like  also I feel that it is  like  important to  like  represent women who are  like  sex positive feminists. What is sex negative  Well  like  I guess I would ask  like  what do you think sex negative is   Laughter  Yeah  because  like  the terms that we use are  like  so important  because  like  we call it sex work because it helps people understand that  like  it's work  and  like  you know  just like there are  like  healthcare providers and  like  insurance providers  like  we think of these workers as  like  sex care providers. Yeah  but like  I don't think of myself like  providing direct sex care services per se as  like  being a requirement for me to be  like  an advocate. Like  I support other women's right to choose it voluntarily  like  if they enjoy it. Yeah  but  like  I see myself going forward as more likely  like  protecting sex workers'  like  legal freedoms and rights. Yeah  so  like  basically  I'm planning on becoming a lawyer. Right  class.  Laughter   Applause  So these next two modules are also circa     . One subject is an Irishwoman with a particularly noteworthy relationship to this issue  but first will be a West Indian woman  a self described escort who was recorded at a sex workers' rights rally and parade. She was interviewed whilst marching in full carnival headdress and very little else. All right  you want me to start talking now. Yeah  I told you  you can put those wires anywhere you want to as long as it don't get in the way. Yeah  no  but  tell me again what the name of    BERT  BERT. Yeah  I was telling you  you know  I think I have in all my time I have had at least one client with that name  so this won't be the first time I had BERT all over me. Oh  I'm sorry  but you got to get into the spirit of it if you're going to interview me. All right  You can say it. No justice  no piece  No justice  no piece  But you see the sign  You get it  P I E C E. No justice  no piece of us. You understand  Right  so that's the part where I was telling you is that when I first came to this country  I worked every job I could find. I was a nanny  I was a home care attendant for all these different old people  and then I said  child  if I have to touch another white man's backside  I might as well get paid a lot more money for it than this  you understand  Pshh  you know how hard it is being a domestic worker  Some of these men  they're heavy. You have to pick them up and flip them over. Now  I let them pick me up and flip me over  you understand  Well  you have to have a sense of humor about it  that's what I think. No  but see  listen  you find me somebody who don't hate some part of their job. I mean  there's a lot of things about this job that I hate  but the money is not one of them  and I will tell you  as long as this is the best possibility for me to make real money  I am going to be Jamaican No Fakin' if that's what they want to call me. No  I'm not even from Jamaica. That's how they market me. My family is from Trinidad and the Virgin Islands. They don't know what I do  but you know what  My children  they know that their school fees are paid  they have their books and their computer  and this way  I know that they have a chance. So I'm not going to tell you that what I do  it's easy  I'm not going to tell you that I feel    what's that you said  liberated  But I'm going to tell you that I feel paid. Right.  Applause  Thanks  that's lovely  and just the cup of tea  love  and just a splash of the whiskey. It's perfect  that's grand. Just a drop more. A splash. Perfect. What was your name  Peter  Is that right  so  Peter  Right. So that  that is the unique part of it for me  right  is that I ended up in both  first in the convent  and then in the prostitution after. That's right. So one woman at the university here in Dublin  she wrote about me. She said  Maureen Fitzroy is the living embodiment of the whore virgin dichotomy. Right   Laughter  Doesn't it sound like something you need to go into hospital  Well  I've got this terrible dichotomy. Doesn't it. Right. Well  for me though  it was  as a girl  it started with me dad. I mean  half the time  when he spoke to us  it was just a sort of tell us we were all useless rotten idiots and we had no morals  that type of thing. And I certainly didn't do myself any favors. By the time I was     I had started messing about with this older fella  and he wanted it to be our little secret  and I did as I was told  didn't I  and when that got back to me dad  he had me sent straightaway to the convent. Well no  that older fella  he would still come to find me in the convent. Yeah  he'd leave me notes tucked into the holes in the brick at the back of the charity shop so we could meet. And he'd tell me how he's leaving his wife  and I believed him  until I got pregnant. I did  Peter  and I left him a note about it in our special place there  and I never did hear from him again. No  I gave it up for adoption so it could have a decent life  and then they wouldn't let me back into the convent. No  my one sister Virginia gave me a fiver for the coach to Dublin  and that's how I ended up here. Well  surprise  surprise  I fell in love with another fella much older than me  and I always say I was just so happy because he didn't drink  I married the bastard. Well  he didn't drink  but he did have just the wee heroin problem  didn't he  and    That's right  and before I knew it  he was the one who turned me on to the prostitution  my own husband. He had me supporting the both of us. I was   . Well  it wasn't Pretty Woman  I can tell you that. That Julia Roberts  if she'd ever had to sleep with a man to put a few pounds in her pocket  I don't think she'd ever have made that film. Well  for your record  my opinion of the legalization  I'd say I'm against it. I just  I don't care what these young girls say. You know  living like that  you're just lost  and  you know  I'm    years old. I'm still trying to find who I am. You know  I never was a wife or a nun  or a prostitute even  really  not really. Nobody ever asked who I wanted to be. They just told me  and if you legalize it  then you're really telling these girls   Go on and get lost for a living   and a lot of them  they'll do as they're told. All right  so four perspectives from four quite     Applause     four quite different voices there  right  One woman saying sex itself is natural but the sex industry seems to mechanize or industrialize it. Then the second woman considered sex work to be empowering  liberating  and feminist  though she  herself  notably  did not seem keen to do it. The third woman  who actually was a so called sex worker did not agree that it was liberating but she wanted the right to the economic empowerment  and then we hear the fourth woman saying not only prostitution itself but proscribed roles for women in general prevented her from ever finding who she was  right  So another fact most people did not know was the average age of an at risk girl being introduced to the sex industry was    or   . Also consider that the age when all girls in that society first became exposed to sexualized images of women was quite a bit earlier  right  This was a doll called Barbie  right  I initially thought she was an educational tool for anorexia prevention    but actually she was considered by many to be a wholesome symbol of femininity  and often young girls began what was called dieting. Remember this  This was restricting food intake on purpose by the age of six  and defining themselves based on attractiveness by around that same time. Right  Yes  Right  Bradley  okay  excellent point. So there was a lucrative market in that society in convincing all people they had to look a certain way to even have a sex life  right  But girls  especially  were expected to be  sexy  while avoiding being perceived as  sluts  for being sexual. Right  So there's that shame piece we've heard about. Yes. Valerie  right  Okay  very good. Of course  men were having sex as well  but you'll remember from the reading  what were male sluts called  Very good  they were called men. So not easy living in a world like that  right  Though it was not all bad news either. Most women in the early     s considered themselves empowered  and men generally felt they were also evolved in this area  and  in fact  most people would have been aware of issues like human trafficking  for example  but they would have seen that as quite separate from more recreational adult entertainment. And so we'll just very briefly  class    we don't have a lot of time    we'll just very briefly hear from a man on our topic at this stage. So this next subject was interviewed on the night of his bachelor party. Dude  can you  all right  can you just keep it down  I'm trying to talk to BERT right now. Oh  your name's not BERT. BERT's the name of the  oh  all right. No  no  no  totally  it's totally fine. I'm mostly sober  so I just want to be helpful. Yeah  and I totally believe in causes  yeah  like  all that stuff. And actually  I'm wearing Toms right now. Yeah  Toms  like  the shoes  like  you buy a pair and then a kid in Africa gets clean water. Yeah. Totally. But what was the question again  Sorry. Of course I believe in women's rights. I'm marrying a woman. No  but I mean  like  just because I'm in a strip club parking lot doesn't mean that I'm  like  a sexist or whatever. My fiancee is totally amazing  she's totally a strong girl  woman  smart woman  like  the whole thing. Yeah  she knows I'm here. She's probably at a strip club herself right now  like  as a joke  same as me. My best man  I told him he could surprise me  and he thought this would be hilarious  but this is not something. Yeah  we all went to B school together. Wharton. Yeah  so  dude  can you guys    All right  but it's my bachelor party  and I can spend it in the parking lot with Anderson Cooper if I want to. All right  I'll see you in there. All right  okay  so Anderson  so  like  first of all  stripping  but then  like  all the other things you're talking about  prostitution and all that stuff  that's  like  not the same thing at all. You know  Like  you keep calling it the sex industry or whatever  but it's like  if the girl wants to be an exotic dancer and she's     like  that's her right. Whoa  whoa  I hear what you're saying  but I just feel like people  they just want to make it seem like all dudes are just  like  predators  that we would just automatically go to a prostitute  or whatever. Even  like  when I pledged  you know  like when I rushed my fraternity. My brothers who I'm close to  those guys  they're all like me. We're just normal people  but  like  there's this myth that you must be that guy who is kind of an asshole  and like  all bros before hos or whatever. And actually  like  bros before hos  it doesn't mean like what it sounds like. It's actually just like a joking way of saying that you care about your brothers and you put them first. Yeah  but  you can't blame the media  either. I mean  like  if you go watch  Hangover     and you think that's an instruction manual for your life  like  I don't know what to tell you. You know  You don't watch  Bourne Identity  and go drive your car over a gondola in Venice.  Laughter  Well  yeah  okay  like  if you're a little kid or whatever  of course it's different  but    Yeah  all right  I remember one thing like that. I was at this kid's house one time playing GTA  uh  Grand Theft Auto  Dude  are you from Canada   Laughter  So  like  whatever  with Grand Theft Auto  you're this kid  like  you're this guy walking around or whatever  and you can basically  like  the more cops you kill  the more points you get  and stuff like that. But also  you can find prostitutes and obviously you can do sexual stuff with them  but you can  like  kill them and take your money back. Yeah  this kid  I remember he ran over a couple of them a few times with his car and he got all these points. We were  like      I think. It felt pretty terrible  actually. No  I don't think I said anything  I just finished playing and went home. All right class  so then there were men who had more than just a passing relationship to this issue.  Laughter  The next subject described himself as a reformed and remorseful pimp turned motivational speaker  life coach and therapist  but if you want to know more about him  you'll have to come to the entire play. Thank you so much  you beautiful TED audience. I will see you for  Sell Buy Date.  I love a great mystery  and I'm fascinated by the greatest unsolved mystery in science  perhaps because it's personal. It's about who we are  and I can't help but be curious. The mystery is this  What is the relationship between your brain and your conscious experiences  such as your experience of the taste of chocolate or the feeling of velvet  Now  this mystery is not new. In       Thomas Huxley wrote   How it is that anything so remarkable as a state of consciousness comes about as the result of irritating nervous tissue is just as unaccountable as the appearance of the genie when Aladdin rubbed his lamp.  Now  Huxley knew that brain activity and conscious experiences are correlated  but he didn't know why. To the science of his day  it was a mystery. In the years since Huxley  science has learned a lot about brain activity  but the relationship between brain activity and conscious experiences is still a mystery. Why  Why have we made so little progress  Well  some experts think that we can't solve this problem because we lack the necessary concepts and intelligence. We don't expect monkeys to solve problems in quantum mechanics  and as it happens  we can't expect our species to solve this problem either. Well  I disagree. I'm more optimistic. I think we've simply made a false assumption. Once we fix it  we just might solve this problem. Today  I'd like tell you what that assumption is  why it's false  and how to fix it. Let's begin with a question  Do we see reality as it is  I open my eyes and I have an experience that I describe as a red tomato a meter away. As a result  I come to believe that in reality  there's a red tomato a meter away. I then close my eyes  and my experience changes to a gray field  but is it still the case that in reality  there's a red tomato a meter away  I think so  but could I be wrong  Could I be misinterpreting the nature of my perceptions  We have misinterpreted our perceptions before. We used to think the Earth is flat  because it looks that way. Pythagorus discovered that we were wrong. Then we thought that the Earth is the unmoving center of the Universe  again because it looks that way. Copernicus and Galileo discovered  again  that we were wrong. Galileo then wondered if we might be misinterpreting our experiences in other ways. He wrote   I think that tastes  odors  colors  and so on reside in consciousness. Hence if the living creature were removed  all these qualities would be annihilated.  Now  that's a stunning claim. Could Galileo be right  Could we really be misinterpreting our experiences that badly  What does modern science have to say about this  Well  neuroscientists tell us that about a third of the brain's cortex is engaged in vision. When you simply open your eyes and look about this room  billions of neurons and trillions of synapses are engaged. Now  this is a bit surprising  because to the extent that we think about vision at all  we think of it as like a camera. It just takes a picture of objective reality as it is. Now  there is a part of vision that's like a camera  the eye has a lens that focuses an image on the back of the eye where there are     million photoreceptors  so the eye is like a     megapixel camera. But that doesn't explain the billions of neurons and trillions of synapses that are engaged in vision. What are these neurons up to  Well  neuroscientists tell us that they are creating  in real time  all the shapes  objects  colors  and motions that we see. It feels like we're just taking a snapshot of this room the way it is  but in fact  we're constructing everything that we see. We don't construct the whole world at once. We construct what we need in the moment. Now  there are many demonstrations that are quite compelling that we construct what we see. I'll just show you two. In this example  you see some red discs with bits cut out of them  but if I just rotate the disks a little bit  suddenly  you see a  D cube pop out of the screen. Now  the screen of course is flat  so the three dimensional cube that you're experiencing must be your construction. In this next example  you see glowing blue bars with pretty sharp edges moving across a field of dots. In fact  no dots move. All I'm doing from frame to frame is changing the colors of dots from blue to black or black to blue. But when I do this quickly  your visual system creates the glowing blue bars with the sharp edges and the motion. There are many more examples  but these are just two that you construct what you see. But neuroscientists go further. They say that we reconstruct reality. So  when I have an experience that I describe as a red tomato  that experience is actually an accurate reconstruction of the properties of a real red tomato that would exist even if I weren't looking. Now  why would neuroscientists say that we don't just construct  we reconstruct  Well  the standard argument given is usually an evolutionary one. Those of our ancestors who saw more accurately had a competitive advantage compared to those who saw less accurately  and therefore they were more likely to pass on their genes. We are the offspring of those who saw more accurately  and so we can be confident that  in the normal case  our perceptions are accurate. You see this in the standard textbooks. One textbook says  for example   Evolutionarily speaking  vision is useful precisely because it is so accurate.  So the idea is that accurate perceptions are fitter perceptions. They give you a survival advantage. Now  is this correct  Is this the right interpretation of evolutionary theory  Well  let's first look at a couple of examples in nature. The Australian jewel beetle is dimpled  glossy and brown. The female is flightless. The male flies  looking  of course  for a hot female. When he finds one  he alights and mates. There's another species in the outback  Homo sapiens. The male of this species has a massive brain that he uses to hunt for cold beer. And when he finds one  he drains it  and sometimes throws the bottle into the outback. Now  as it happens  these bottles are dimpled  glossy  and just the right shade of brown to tickle the fancy of these beetles. The males swarm all over the bottles trying to mate. They lose all interest in the real females. Classic case of the male leaving the female for the bottle. The species almost went extinct. Australia had to change its bottles to save its beetles. Now  the males had successfully found females for thousands  perhaps millions of years. It looked like they saw reality as it is  but apparently not. Evolution had given them a hack. A female is anything dimpled  glossy and brown  the bigger the better. Even when crawling all over the bottle  the male couldn't discover his mistake. Now  you might say  beetles  sure  they're very simple creatures  but surely not mammals. Mammals don't rely on tricks. Well  I won't dwell on this  but you get the idea.  Laughter  So this raises an important technical question  Does natural selection really favor seeing reality as it is  Fortunately  we don't have to wave our hands and guess  evolution is a mathematically precise theory. We can use the equations of evolution to check this out. We can have various organisms in artificial worlds compete and see which survive and which thrive  which sensory systems are more fit. A key notion in those equations is fitness. Consider this steak  What does this steak do for the fitness of an animal  Well  for a hungry lion looking to eat  it enhances fitness. For a well fed lion looking to mate  it doesn't enhance fitness. And for a rabbit in any state  it doesn't enhance fitness  so fitness does depend on reality as it is  yes  but also on the organism  its state and its action. Fitness is not the same thing as reality as it is  and it's fitness  and not reality as it is  that figures centrally in the equations of evolution. So  in my lab  we have run hundreds of thousands of evolutionary game simulations with lots of different randomly chosen worlds and organisms that compete for resources in those worlds. Some of the organisms see all of the reality  others see just part of the reality  and some see none of the reality  only fitness. Who wins  Well  I hate to break it to you  but perception of reality goes extinct. In almost every simulation  organisms that see none of reality but are just tuned to fitness drive to extinction all the organisms that perceive reality as it is. So the bottom line is  evolution does not favor veridical  or accurate perceptions. Those perceptions of reality go extinct. Now  this is a bit stunning. How can it be that not seeing the world accurately gives us a survival advantage  That is a bit counterintuitive. But remember the jewel beetle. The jewel beetle survived for thousands  perhaps millions of years  using simple tricks and hacks. What the equations of evolution are telling us is that all organisms  including us   are in the same boat as the jewel beetle. We do not see reality as it is. We're shaped with tricks and hacks that keep us alive. Still  we need some help with our intuitions. How can not perceiving reality as it is be useful  Well  fortunately  we have a very helpful metaphor  the desktop interface on your computer. Consider that blue icon for a TED Talk that you're writing. Now  the icon is blue and rectangular and in the lower right corner of the desktop. Does that mean that the text file itself in the computer is blue  rectangular  and in the lower right hand corner of the computer  Of course not. Anyone who thought that misinterprets the purpose of the interface. It's not there to show you the reality of the computer. In fact  it's there to hide that reality. You don't want to know about the diodes and resistors and all the megabytes of software. If you had to deal with that  you could never write your text file or edit your photo. So the idea is that evolution has given us an interface that hides reality and guides adaptive behavior. Space and time  as you perceive them right now  are your desktop. Physical objects are simply icons in that desktop. There's an obvious objection. Hoffman  if you think that train coming down the track at     MPH is just an icon of your desktop  why don't you step in front of it  And after you're gone  and your theory with you  we'll know that there's more to that train than just an icon. Well  I wouldn't step in front of that train for the same reason that I wouldn't carelessly drag that icon to the trash can  not because I take the icon literally    the file is not literally blue or rectangular    but I do take it seriously. I could lose weeks of work. Similarly  evolution has shaped us with perceptual symbols that are designed to keep us alive. We'd better take them seriously. If you see a snake  don't pick it up. If you see a cliff  don't jump off. They're designed to keep us safe  and we should take them seriously. That does not mean that we should take them literally. That's a logical error. Another objection  There's nothing really new here. Physicists have told us for a long time that the metal of that train looks solid but really it's mostly empty space with microscopic particles zipping around. There's nothing new here. Well  not exactly. It's like saying  I know that that blue icon on the desktop is not the reality of the computer  but if I pull out my trusty magnifying glass and look really closely  I see little pixels  and that's the reality of the computer. Well  not really    you're still on the desktop  and that's the point. Those microscopic particles are still in space and time  they're still in the user interface. So I'm saying something far more radical than those physicists. Finally  you might object  look  we all see the train  therefore none of us constructs the train. But remember this example. In this example  we all see a cube  but the screen is flat  so the cube that you see is the cube that you construct. We all see a cube because we all  each one of us  constructs the cube that we see. The same is true of the train. We all see a train because we each see the train that we construct  and the same is true of all physical objects. We're inclined to think that perception is like a window on reality as it is. The theory of evolution is telling us that this is an incorrect interpretation of our perceptions. Instead  reality is more like a  D desktop that's designed to hide the complexity of the real world and guide adaptive behavior. Space as you perceive it is your desktop. Physical objects are just the icons in that desktop. We used to think that the Earth is flat because it looks that way. Then we thought that the Earth is the unmoving center of reality because it looks that way. We were wrong. We had misinterpreted our perceptions. Now we believe that spacetime and objects are the nature of reality as it is. The theory of evolution is telling us that once again  we're wrong. We're misinterpreting the content of our perceptual experiences. There's something that exists when you don't look  but it's not spacetime and physical objects. It's as hard for us to let go of spacetime and objects as it is for the jewel beetle to let go of its bottle. Why  Because we're blind to our own blindnesses. But we have an advantage over the jewel beetle  our science and technology. By peering through the lens of a telescope we discovered that the Earth is not the unmoving center of reality  and by peering through the lens of the theory of evolution we discovered that spacetime and objects are not the nature of reality. When I have a perceptual experience that I describe as a red tomato  I am interacting with reality  but that reality is not a red tomato and is nothing like a red tomato. Similarly  when I have an experience that I describe as a lion or a steak  I'm interacting with reality  but that reality is not a lion or a steak. And here's the kicker  When I have a perceptual experience that I describe as a brain  or neurons  I am interacting with reality  but that reality is not a brain or neurons and is nothing like a brain or neurons. And that reality  whatever it is  is the real source of cause and effect in the world    not brains  not neurons. Brains and neurons have no causal powers. They cause none of our perceptual experiences  and none of our behavior. Brains and neurons are a species specific set of symbols  a hack. What does this mean for the mystery of consciousness  Well  it opens up new possibilities. For instance  perhaps reality is some vast machine that causes our conscious experiences. I doubt this  but it's worth exploring. Perhaps reality is some vast  interacting network of conscious agents  simple and complex  that cause each other's conscious experiences. Actually  this isn't as crazy an idea as it seems  and I'm currently exploring it. But here's the point  Once we let go of our massively intuitive but massively false assumption about the nature of reality  it opens up new ways to think about life's greatest mystery. I bet that reality will end up turning out to be more fascinating and unexpected than we've ever imagined. The theory of evolution presents us with the ultimate dare  Dare to recognize that perception is not about seeing truth  it's about having kids. And by the way  even this TED is just in your head. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  If that's really you there  thank you. So there's so much from this. I mean  first of all  some people may just be profoundly depressed at the thought that  if evolution does not favor reality  I mean  doesn't that to some extent undermine all our endeavors here  all our ability to think that we can think the truth  possibly even including your own theory  if you go there  Donald Hoffman  Well  this does not stop us from a successful science. What we have is one theory that turned out to be false  that perception is like reality and reality is like our perceptions. That theory turns out to be false. Okay  throw that theory away. That doesn't stop us from now postulating all sorts of other theories about the nature of reality  so it's actually progress to recognize that one of our theories was false. So science continues as normal. There's no problem here. CA  So you think it's possible     Laughter     This is cool  but what you're saying I think is it's possible that evolution can still get you to reason. DH  Yes. Now that's a very  very good point. The evolutionary game simulations that I showed were specifically about perception  and they do show that our perceptions have been shaped not to show us reality as it is  but that does not mean the same thing about our logic or mathematics. We haven't done these simulations  but my bet is that we'll find that there are some selection pressures for our logic and our mathematics to be at least in the direction of truth. I mean  if you're like me  math and logic is not easy. We don't get it all right  but at least the selection pressures are not uniformly away from true math and logic. So I think that we'll find that we have to look at each cognitive faculty one at a time and see what evolution does to it. What's true about perception may not be true about math and logic. CA  I mean  really what you're proposing is a kind of modern day Bishop Berkeley interpretation of the world  consciousness causes matter  not the other way around. DH  Well  it's slightly different than Berkeley. Berkeley thought that  he was a deist  and he thought that the ultimate nature of reality is God and so forth  and I don't need to go where Berkeley's going  so it's quite a bit different from Berkeley. I call this conscious realism. It's actually a very different approach. CA  Don  I could literally talk with you for hours  and I hope to do that. Thanks so much for that. DH  Thank you.  Applause  The first time I uttered a prayer was in a glass stained cathedral. I was kneeling long after the congregation was on its feet  dip both hands into holy water  trace the trinity across my chest  my tiny body drooping  like a question mark all over the wooden pew. I asked Jesus to fix me  and when he did not answer I befriended silence in the hopes that my sin would burn and salve my mouth would dissolve like sugar on tongue  but shame lingered as an aftertaste. And in an attempt to reintroduce me to sanctity  my mother told me of the miracle I was  said I could grow up  to be anything I want. I decided to be a boy. It was cute. I had snapback  toothless grin  used skinned knees as street cred  played hide and seek with  what was left of my goal. I was it. The winner to a game  the other kids couldn't play  I was the mystery of an anatomy  a question asked but not answered  tightroping between awkward boy and apologetic girl  and when I turned     the boy phase wasn't deemed cute anymore. It was met with nostalgic aunts who missed seeing my knees in the shadow of skirts  who reminded me that my kind of attitude would never bring a husband home  that I exist for heterosexual marriage and child bearing. And I swallowed their insults along with their slurs. Naturally  I did not come out of the closet. The kids at my school opened it without my permission. Called me by a name I did not recognize  said  lesbian   but I was more boy than girl  more Ken than Barbie. It had nothing to do with hating my body  I just love it enough to let it go  I treat it like a house  and when your house is falling apart  you do not evacuate  you make it comfortable enough to house all your insides  you make it pretty enough to invite guests over  you make the floorboards strong enough to stand on. My mother fears I have named myself after fading things. As she counts the echoes left behind by Mya Hall  Leelah Alcorn  Blake Brockington. She fears that I'll die without a whisper  that I'll turn into  what a shame  conversations at the bus stop. She claims I have turned myself into a mausoleum  that I am a walking casket  news headlines have turned my identity into a spectacle  Bruce Jenner on everyone's lips while the brutality of living in this body becomes an asterisk  at the bottom of equality pages. No one ever thinks of us as human because we are more ghost than flesh  because people fear that my gender expression is a trick  that it exists to be perverse  that it ensnares them without their consent  that my body is a feast for their eyes and hands and once they have fed off my queer  they'll regurgitate all the parts they did not like. They'll put me back into the closet  hang me with all the other skeletons. I will be the best attraction. Can you see how easy it is to talk people into coffins  to misspell their names on gravestones. And people still wonder why there are boys rotting  they go away in high school hallways they are afraid of becoming another hashtag in a second afraid of classroom discussions becoming like judgment day and now oncoming traffic is embracing more transgender children than parents. I wonder how long it will be before the trans suicide notes start to feel redundant  before we realize that our bodies become lessons about sin way before we learn how to love them. Like God didn't save all this breath and mercy  like my blood is not the wine that washed over Jesus' feet. My prayers are now getting stuck in my throat. Maybe I am finally fixed  maybe I just don't care  maybe God finally listened to my prayers. Thank you. Our emotions influence every aspect of our lives  from our health and how we learn  to how we do business and make decisions  big ones and small. Our emotions also influence how we connect with one another. We've evolved to live in a world like this  but instead  we're living more and more of our lives like this    this is the text message from my daughter last night    in a world that's devoid of emotion. So I'm on a mission to change that. I want to bring emotions back into our digital experiences. I started on this path    years ago. I was a computer scientist in Egypt  and I had just gotten accepted to a Ph.D. program at Cambridge University. So I did something quite unusual for a young newlywed Muslim Egyptian wife  With the support of my husband  who had to stay in Egypt  I packed my bags and I moved to England. At Cambridge  thousands of miles away from home  I realized I was spending more hours with my laptop than I did with any other human. Yet despite this intimacy  my laptop had absolutely no idea how I was feeling. It had no idea if I was happy  having a bad day  or stressed  confused  and so that got frustrating. Even worse  as I communicated online with my family back home  I felt that all my emotions disappeared in cyberspace. I was homesick  I was lonely  and on some days I was actually crying  but all I had to communicate these emotions was this. Today's technology has lots of I.Q.  but no E.Q.  lots of cognitive intelligence  but no emotional intelligence. So that got me thinking  what if our technology could sense our emotions  What if our devices could sense how we felt and reacted accordingly  just the way an emotionally intelligent friend would  Those questions led me and my team to create technologies that can read and respond to our emotions  and our starting point was the human face. So our human face happens to be one of the most powerful channels that we all use to communicate social and emotional states  everything from enjoyment  surprise  empathy and curiosity. In emotion science  we call each facial muscle movement an action unit. So for example  action unit     it's not a Hollywood blockbuster  it is actually a lip corner pull  which is the main component of a smile. Try it everybody. Let's get some smiles going on. Another example is action unit  . It's the brow furrow. It's when you draw your eyebrows together and you create all these textures and wrinkles. We don't like them  but it's a strong indicator of a negative emotion. So we have about    of these action units  and they combine to express hundreds of emotions. Teaching a computer to read these facial emotions is hard  because these action units  they can be fast  they're subtle  and they combine in many different ways. So take  for example  the smile and the smirk. They look somewhat similar  but they mean very different things. So the smile is positive  a smirk is often negative. Sometimes a smirk can make you become famous. But seriously  it's important for a computer to be able to tell the difference between the two expressions. So how do we do that  We give our algorithms tens of thousands of examples of people we know to be smiling  from different ethnicities  ages  genders  and we do the same for smirks. And then  using deep learning  the algorithm looks for all these textures and wrinkles and shape changes on our face  and basically learns that all smiles have common characteristics  all smirks have subtly different characteristics. And the next time it sees a new face  it essentially learns that this face has the same characteristics of a smile  and it says   Aha  I recognize this. This is a smile expression.  So the best way to demonstrate how this technology works is to try a live demo  so I need a volunteer  preferably somebody with a face. Cloe's going to be our volunteer today. So over the past five years  we've moved from being a research project at MIT to a company  where my team has worked really hard to make this technology work  as we like to say  in the wild. And we've also shrunk it so that the core emotion engine works on any mobile device with a camera  like this iPad. So let's give this a try. As you can see  the algorithm has essentially found Cloe's face  so it's this white bounding box  and it's tracking the main feature points on her face  so her eyebrows  her eyes  her mouth and her nose. The question is  can it recognize her expression  So we're going to test the machine. So first of all  give me your poker face. Yep  awesome.  Laughter  And then as she smiles  this is a genuine smile  it's great. So you can see the green bar go up as she smiles. Now that was a big smile. Can you try a subtle smile to see if the computer can recognize  It does recognize subtle smiles as well. We've worked really hard to make that happen. And then eyebrow raised  indicator of surprise. Brow furrow  which is an indicator of confusion. Frown. Yes  perfect. So these are all the different action units. There's many more of them. This is just a slimmed down demo. But we call each reading an emotion data point  and then they can fire together to portray different emotions. So on the right side of the demo    look like you're happy. So that's joy. Joy fires up. And then give me a disgust face. Try to remember what it was like when Zayn left One Direction. Yeah  wrinkle your nose. Awesome. And the valence is actually quite negative  so you must have been a big fan. So valence is how positive or negative an experience is  and engagement is how expressive she is as well. So imagine if Cloe had access to this real time emotion stream  and she could share it with anybody she wanted to. Thank you. So  so far  we have amassed    billion of these emotion data points. It's the largest emotion database in the world. We've collected it from  .  million face videos  people who have agreed to share their emotions with us  and from    countries around the world. It's growing every day. It blows my mind away that we can now quantify something as personal as our emotions  and we can do it at this scale. So what have we learned to date  Gender. Our data confirms something that you might suspect. Women are more expressive than men. Not only do they smile more  their smiles last longer  and we can now really quantify what it is that men and women respond to differently. Let's do culture  So in the United States  women are    percent more expressive than men  but curiously  we don't see any difference in the U.K. between men and women. Age  People who are    years and older are    percent more emotive than younger people. Women in their   s smile a lot more than men the same age  perhaps a necessity for dating. But perhaps what surprised us the most about this data is that we happen to be expressive all the time  even when we are sitting in front of our devices alone  and it's not just when we're watching cat videos on Facebook. We are expressive when we're emailing  texting  shopping online  or even doing our taxes. Where is this data used today  In understanding how we engage with media  so understanding virality and voting behavior  and also empowering or emotion enabling technology  and I want to share some examples that are especially close to my heart. Emotion enabled wearable glasses can help individuals who are visually impaired read the faces of others  and it can help individuals on the autism spectrum interpret emotion  something that they really struggle with. In education  imagine if your learning apps sense that you're confused and slow down  or that you're bored  so it's sped up  just like a great teacher would in a classroom. What if your wristwatch tracked your mood  or your car sensed that you're tired  or perhaps your fridge knows that you're stressed  so it auto locks to prevent you from binge eating.  Laughter  I would like that  yeah. What if  when I was in Cambridge  I had access to my real time emotion stream  and I could share that with my family back home in a very natural way  just like I would've if we were all in the same room together  I think five years down the line  all our devices are going to have an emotion chip  and we won't remember what it was like when we couldn't just frown at our device and our device would say   Hmm  you didn't like that  did you   Our biggest challenge is that there are so many applications of this technology  my team and I realize that we can't build them all ourselves  so we've made this technology available so that other developers can get building and get creative. We recognize that there are potential risks and potential for abuse  but personally  having spent many years doing this  I believe that the benefits to humanity from having emotionally intelligent technology far outweigh the potential for misuse. And I invite you all to be part of the conversation. The more people who know about this technology  the more we can all have a voice in how it's being used. So as more and more of our lives become digital  we are fighting a losing battle trying to curb our usage of devices in order to reclaim our emotions. So what I'm trying to do instead is to bring emotions into our technology and make our technologies more responsive. So I want those devices that have separated us to bring us back together. And by humanizing technology  we have this golden opportunity to reimagine how we connect with machines  and therefore  how we  as human beings  connect with one another. Thank you. An evolutionary biologist at Purdue University named William Muir studied chickens. He was interested in productivity    I think it's something that concerns all of us    but it's easy to measure in chickens because you just count the eggs. He wanted to know what could make his chickens more productive  so he devised a beautiful experiment. Chickens live in groups  so first of all  he selected just an average flock  and he let it alone for six generations. But then he created a second group of the individually most productive chickens    you could call them superchickens    and he put them together in a superflock  and each generation  he selected only the most productive for breeding. After six generations had passed  what did he find  Well  the first group  the average group  was doing just fine. They were all plump and fully feathered and egg production had increased dramatically. What about the second group  Well  all but three were dead. They'd pecked the rest to death. The individually productive chickens had only achieved their success by suppressing the productivity of the rest. Now  as I've gone around the world talking about this and telling this story in all sorts of organizations and companies  people have seen the relevance almost instantly  and they come up and they say things to me like   That superflock  that's my company.  Or   That's my country.  Or   That's my life.  All my life I've been told that the way we have to get ahead is to compete  get into the right school  get into the right job  get to the top  and I've really never found it very inspiring. I've started and run businesses because invention is a joy  and because working alongside brilliant  creative people is its own reward. And I've never really felt very motivated by pecking orders or by superchickens or by superstars. But for the past    years  we've run most organizations and some societies along the superchicken model. We've thought that success is achieved by picking the superstars  the brightest men  or occasionally women  in the room  and giving them all the resources and all the power. And the result has been just the same as in William Muir's experiment  aggression  dysfunction and waste. If the only way the most productive can be successful is by suppressing the productivity of the rest  then we badly need to find a better way to work and a richer way to live. So what is it that makes some groups obviously more successful and more productive than others  Well  that's the question a team at MIT took to research. They brought in hundreds of volunteers  they put them into groups  and they gave them very hard problems to solve. And what happened was exactly what you'd expect  that some groups were very much more successful than others  but what was really interesting was that the high achieving groups were not those where they had one or two people with spectacularly high I.Q. Nor were the most successful groups the ones that had the highest aggregate I.Q. Instead  they had three characteristics  the really successful teams. First of all  they showed high degrees of social sensitivity to each other. This is measured by something called the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test. It's broadly considered a test for empathy  and the groups that scored highly on this did better. Secondly  the successful groups gave roughly equal time to each other  so that no one voice dominated  but neither were there any passengers. And thirdly  the more successful groups had more women in them. Now  was this because women typically score more highly on the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test  so you're getting a doubling down on the empathy quotient  Or was it because they brought a more diverse perspective  We don't really know  but the striking thing about this experiment is that it showed what we know  which is some groups do better than others  but what's key to that is their social connectedness to each other. So how does this play out in the real world  Well  it means that what happens between people really counts  because in groups that are highly attuned and sensitive to each other  ideas can flow and grow. People don't get stuck. They don't waste energy down dead ends. An example  Arup is one of the world's most successful engineering firms  and it was commissioned to build the equestrian center for the Beijing Olympics. Now  this building had to receive two and a half thousand really highly strung thoroughbred horses that were coming off long haul flights  highly jet lagged  not feeling their finest. And the problem the engineer confronted was  what quantity of waste to cater for  Now  you don't get taught this in engineering school     Laughter     and it's not really the kind of thing you want to get wrong  so he could have spent months talking to vets  doing the research  tweaking the spreadsheet. Instead  he asked for help and he found someone who had designed the Jockey Club in New York. The problem was solved in less than a day. Arup believes that the culture of helpfulness is central to their success. Now  helpfulness sounds really anemic  but it's absolutely core to successful teams  and it routinely outperforms individual intelligence. Helpfulness means I don't have to know everything  I just have to work among people who are good at getting and giving help. At SAP  they reckon that you can answer any question in    minutes. But there isn't a single high tech company I've worked with that imagines for a moment that this is a technology issue  because what drives helpfulness is people getting to know each other. Now that sounds so obvious  and we think it'll just happen normally  but it doesn't. When I was running my first software company  I realized that we were getting stuck. There was a lot of friction  but not much else  and I gradually realized the brilliant  creative people that I'd hired didn't know each other. They were so focused on their own individual work  they didn't even know who they were sitting next to  and it was only when I insisted that we stop working and invest time in getting to know each other that we achieved real momentum. Now  that was    years ago  and now I visit companies that have banned coffee cups at desks because they want people to hang out around the coffee machines and talk to each other. The Swedes even have a special term for this. They call it fika  which means more than a coffee break. It means collective restoration. At Idexx  a company up in Maine  they've created vegetable gardens on campus so that people from different parts of the business can work together and get to know the whole business that way. Have they all gone mad  Quite the opposite    they've figured out that when the going gets tough  and it always will get tough if you're doing breakthrough work that really matters  what people need is social support  and they need to know who to ask for help. Companies don't have ideas  only people do. And what motivates people are the bonds and loyalty and trust they develop between each other. What matters is the mortar  not just the bricks. Now  when you put all of this together  what you get is something called social capital. Social capital is the reliance and interdependency that builds trust. The term comes from sociologists who were studying communities that proved particularly resilient in times of stress. Social capital is what gives companies momentum  and social capital is what makes companies robust. What does this mean in practical terms  It means that time is everything  because social capital compounds with time. So teams that work together longer get better  because it takes time to develop the trust you need for real candor and openness. And time is what builds value. When Alex Pentland suggested to one company that they synchronize coffee breaks so that people would have time to talk to each other  profits went up    million dollars  and employee satisfaction went up    percent. Not a bad return on social capital  which compounds even as you spend it. Now  this isn't about chumminess  and it's no charter for slackers  because people who work this way tend to be kind of scratchy  impatient  absolutely determined to think for themselves because that's what their contribution is. Conflict is frequent because candor is safe. And that's how good ideas turn into great ideas  because no idea is born fully formed. It emerges a little bit as a child is born  kind of messy and confused  but full of possibilities. And it's only through the generous contribution  faith and challenge that they achieve their potential. And that's what social capital supports. Now  we aren't really used to talking about this  about talent  about creativity  in this way. We're used to talking about stars. So I started to wonder  well  if we start working this way  does that mean no more stars  So I went and I sat in on the auditions at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London. And what I saw there really surprised me  because the teachers weren't looking for individual pyrotechnics. They were looking for what happened between the students  because that's where the drama is. And when I talked to producers of hit albums  they said   Oh sure  we have lots of superstars in music. It's just  they don't last very long. It's the outstanding collaborators who enjoy the long careers  because bringing out the best in others is how they found the best in themselves.  And when I went to visit companies that are renowned for their ingenuity and creativity  I couldn't even see any superstars  because everybody there really mattered. And when I reflected on my own career  and the extraordinary people I've had the privilege to work with  I realized how much more we could give each other if we just stopped trying to be superchickens. Once you appreciate truly how social work is  a lot of things have to change. Management by talent contest has routinely pitted employees against each other. Now  rivalry has to be replaced by social capital. For decades  we've tried to motivate people with money  even though we've got a vast amount of research that shows that money erodes social connectedness. Now  we need to let people motivate each other. And for years  we've thought that leaders were heroic soloists who were expected  all by themselves  to solve complex problems. Now  we need to redefine leadership as an activity in which conditions are created in which everyone can do their most courageous thinking together. We know that this works. When the Montreal Protocol called for the phasing out of CFCs  the chlorofluorocarbons implicated in the hole in the ozone layer  the risks were immense. CFCs were everywhere  and nobody knew if a substitute could be found. But one team that rose to the challenge adopted three key principles. The first was the head of engineering  Frank Maslen  said  there will be no stars in this team. We need everybody. Everybody has a valid perspective. Second  we work to one standard only  the best imaginable. And third  he told his boss  Geoff Tudhope  that he had to butt out  because he knew how disruptive power can be. Now  this didn't mean Tudhope did nothing. He gave the team air cover  and he listened to ensure that they honored their principles. And it worked  Ahead of all the other companies tackling this hard problem  this group cracked it first. And to date  the Montreal Protocol is the most successful international environmental agreement ever implemented. There was a lot at stake then  and there's a lot at stake now  and we won't solve our problems if we expect it to be solved by a few supermen or superwomen. Now we need everybody  because it is only when we accept that everybody has value that we will liberate the energy and imagination and momentum we need to create the best beyond measure. Thank you. Just after Christmas last year      kids in California got the measles by either visiting Disneyland or being exposed to someone who'd been there. The virus then hopped the Canadian border  infecting more than     children in Quebec. One of the tragic things about this outbreak is that measles  which can be fatal to a child with a weakened immune system  is one of the most easily preventable diseases in the world. An effective vaccine against it has been available for more than half a century  but many of the kids involved in the Disneyland outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something allegedly even worse  autism. But wait    wasn't the paper that sparked the controversy about autism and vaccines debunked  retracted  and branded a deliberate fraud by the British Medical Journal  Don't most science savvy people know that the theory that vaccines cause autism is B.S.  I think most of you do  but millions of parents worldwide continue to fear that vaccines put their kids at risk for autism. Why  Here's why. This is a graph of autism prevalence estimates rising over time. For most of the   th century  autism was considered an incredibly rare condition. The few psychologists and pediatricians who'd even heard of it figured they would get through their entire careers without seeing a single case. For decades  the prevalence estimates remained stable at just three or four children in       . But then  in the     s  the numbers started to skyrocket. Fundraising organizations like Autism Speaks routinely refer to autism as an epidemic  as if you could catch it from another kid at Disneyland. So what's going on  If it isn't vaccines  what is it  If you ask the folks down at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta what's going on  they tend to rely on phrases like  broadened diagnostic criteria  and  better case finding  to explain these rising numbers. But that kind of language doesn't do much to allay the fears of a young mother who is searching her two year old's face for eye contact. If the diagnostic criteria had to be broadened  why were they so narrow in the first place  Why were cases of autism so hard to find before the     s  Five years ago  I decided to try to uncover the answers to these questions. I learned that what happened has less to do with the slow and cautious progress of science than it does with the seductive power of storytelling. For most of the   th century  clinicians told one story about what autism is and how it was discovered  but that story turned out to be wrong  and the consequences of it are having a devastating impact on global public health. There was a second  more accurate story of autism which had been lost and forgotten in obscure corners of the clinical literature. This second story tells us everything about how we got here and where we need to go next. The first story starts with a child psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins Hospital named Leo Kanner. In       Kanner published a paper describing    young patients who seemed to inhabit private worlds  ignoring the people around them  even their own parents. They could amuse themselves for hours by flapping their hands in front of their faces  but they were panicked by little things like their favorite toy being moved from its usual place without their knowledge. Based on the patients who were brought to his clinic  Kanner speculated that autism is very rare. By the     s  as the world's leading authority on the subject  he declared that he had seen less than     true cases of his syndrome while fielding referrals from as far away as South Africa. That's actually not surprising  because Kanner's criteria for diagnosing autism were incredibly selective. For example  he discouraged giving the diagnosis to children who had seizures but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism. He once bragged that he had turned nine out of    kids referred to his office as autistic by other clinicians without giving them an autism diagnosis. Kanner was a smart guy  but a number of his theories didn't pan out. He classified autism as a form of infantile psychosis caused by cold and unaffectionate parents. These children  he said  had been kept neatly in a refrigerator that didn't defrost. At the same time  however  Kanner noticed that some of his young patients had special abilities that clustered in certain areas like music  math and memory. One boy in his clinic could distinguish between    symphonies before he turned two. When his mother put on one of his favorite records  he would correctly declare   Beethoven   But Kanner took a dim view of these abilities  claiming that the kids were just regurgitating things they'd heard their pompous parents say  desperate to earn their approval. As a result  autism became a source of shame and stigma for families  and two generations of autistic children were shipped off to institutions for their own good  becoming invisible to the world at large. Amazingly  it wasn't until the     s that researchers began to test Kanner's theory that autism was rare. Lorna Wing was a cognitive psychologist in London who thought that Kanner's theory of refrigerator parenting were  bloody stupid   as she told me. She and her husband John were warm and affectionate people  and they had a profoundly autistic daughter named Susie. Lorna and John knew how hard it was to raise a child like Susie without support services  special education  and the other resources that are out of reach without a diagnosis. To make the case to the National Health Service that more resources were needed for autistic children and their families  Lorna and her colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that should have been done    years earlier. They undertook a study of autism prevalence in the general population. They pounded the pavement in a London suburb called Camberwell to try to find autistic children in the community. What they saw made clear that Kanner's model was way too narrow  while the reality of autism was much more colorful and diverse. Some kids couldn't talk at all  while others waxed on at length about their fascination with astrophysics  dinosaurs or the genealogy of royalty. In other words  these children didn't fit into nice  neat boxes  as Judith put it  and they saw lots of them  way more than Kanner's monolithic model would have predicted. At first  they were at a loss to make sense of their data. How had no one noticed these children before  But then Lorna came upon a reference to a paper that had been published in German in       the year after Kanner's paper  and then forgotten  buried with the ashes of a terrible time that no one wanted to remember or think about. Kanner knew about this competing paper  but scrupulously avoided mentioning it in his own work. It had never even been translated into English  but luckily  Lorna's husband spoke German  and he translated it for her. The paper offered an alternate story of autism. Its author was a man named Hans Asperger  who ran a combination clinic and residential school in Vienna in the     s. Asperger's ideas about teaching children with learning differences were progressive even by contemporary standards. Mornings at his clinic began with exercise classes set to music  and the children put on plays on Sunday afternoons. Instead of blaming parents for causing autism  Asperger framed it as a lifelong  polygenetic disability that requires compassionate forms of support and accommodations over the course of one's whole life. Rather than treating the kids in his clinic like patients  Asperger called them his little professors  and enlisted their help in developing methods of education that were particularly suited to them. Crucially  Asperger viewed autism as a diverse continuum that spans an astonishing range of giftedness and disability. He believed that autism and autistic traits are common and always have been  seeing aspects of this continuum in familiar archetypes from pop culture like the socially awkward scientist and the absent minded professor. He went so far as to say  it seems that for success in science and art  a dash of autism is essential. Lorna and Judith realized that Kanner had been as wrong about autism being rare as he had been about parents causing it. Over the next several years  they quietly worked with the American Psychiatric Association to broaden the criteria for diagnosis to reflect the diversity of what they called  the autism spectrum.  In the late '  s and early     s  their changes went into effect  swapping out Kanner's narrow model for Asperger's broad and inclusive one. These changes weren't happening in a vacuum. By coincidence  as Lorna and Judith worked behind the scenes to reform the criteria  people all over the world were seeing an autistic adult for the first time. Before  Rain Man  came out in       only a tiny  ingrown circle of experts knew what autism looked like  but after Dustin Hoffman's unforgettable performance as Raymond Babbitt earned  Rain Man  four Academy Awards  pediatricians  psychologists  teachers and parents all over the world knew what autism looked like. Coincidentally  at the same time  the first easy to use clinical tests for diagnosing autism were introduced. You no longer had to have a connection to that tiny circle of experts to get your child evaluated. The combination of  Rain Man   the changes to the criteria  and the introduction of these tests created a network effect  a perfect storm of autism awareness. The number of diagnoses started to soar  just as Lorna and Judith predicted  indeed hoped  that it would  enabling autistic people and their families to finally get the support and services they deserved. Then Andrew Wakefield came along to blame the spike in diagnoses on vaccines  a simple  powerful  and seductively believable story that was as wrong as Kanner's theory that autism was rare. If the CDC's current estimate  that one in    kids in America are on the spectrum  is correct  autistics are one of the largest minority groups in the world. In recent years  autistic people have come together on the Internet to reject the notion that they are puzzles to be solved by the next medical breakthrough  coining the term  neurodiversity  to celebrate the varieties of human cognition. One way to understand neurodiversity is to think in terms of human operating systems. Just because a P.C. is not running Windows doesn't mean that it's broken. By autistic standards  the normal human brain is easily distractable  obsessively social  and suffers from a deficit of attention to detail. To be sure  autistic people have a hard time living in a world not built for them.  Seventy  years later  we're still catching up to Asperger  who believed that the  cure  for the most disabling aspects of autism is to be found in understanding teachers  accommodating employers  supportive communities  and parents who have faith in their children's potential. An autistic  man  named Zosia Zaks once said   We need all hands on deck to right the ship of humanity.  As we sail into an uncertain future  we need every form of human intelligence on the planet working together to tackle the challenges that we face as a society. We can't afford to waste a brain. Thank you. Along the ancient path of the Monongahela River  Braddock  Pennsylvania sits in the eastern region of Allegheny County  approximately nine miles outside of Pittsburgh. An industrial suburb  Braddock is home to Andrew Carnegie's first steel mill  the Edgar Thomson Works. Operating since       it is the last functioning steel mill in the region. For    years  I have produced collaborative portraits  still lifes  landscapes and aerial views in order to build a visual archive to address the intersection of the steel industry  the environment  and the health care system's impact on the bodies of my family and community. The tradition and grand narrative of Braddock is mostly comprised of stories of industrialists and trade unions. Currently  the new narrative about Braddock  a poster child for Rust Belt revitalization  is a story of urban pioneers discovering a new frontier. Mass media has omitted the fact that Braddock is predominantly black. Our existence has been co opted  silenced and erased. Fourth generation in a lineage of women  I was raised under the protection and care of Grandma Ruby  off  th Street at     Washington Avenue. She worked as a manager for Goodwill. Mom was a nurse's aid. She watched the steel mills close and white flight to suburban developments. By the time my generation walked the streets  disinvestment at the local  state and federal level  eroded infrastructure  and the War on Drugs dismantled my family and community. Grandma Ruby's stepfather Gramps was one of few black men to retire from Carnegie's mill with his pension. He worked in high temperatures  tearing down and rebuilding furnaces  cleaning up spilt metal and slag. The history of a place is written on the body and the landscape. Areas of heavy truck traffic  exposure to benzene and atomized metals  risk cancer and lupus. One hundred twenty three licensed beds      employees  rehabilitation programs decimated. A housing discrimination lawsuit against Allegheny County removed where the projects Talbot Towers once stood. Recent rezoning for more light industry has since appeared. Google Maps and Google Earth pixelations conceal the flammable waste being used to squeeze the Bunn family off their home and land. In       I chartered a helicopter with my cameras to document this aggressive dispossession. In flight  my observation reveals thousands of plastic white bundles owned by a conservation industry that claims it's eco friendly and recycles millions of tires to preserve people's lives and to improve people's lives. My work spirals from the micro to the macro level  excavating hidden histories. Recently  at the Seattle Art Museum  Isaac Bunn and I mounted this exhibition  and the exhibition was used as a platform to launch his voice. Through reclamation of our narrative  we will continue to fight historic erasure and socioeconomic inequality. Thank you. I am failing as a woman  I am failing as a feminist. I have passionate opinions about gender equality  but I worry that to freely accept the label of  feminist   would not be fair to good feminists. I'm a feminist  but I'm a rather bad one. Oh  so I call myself a Bad Feminist. Or at least  I wrote an essay  and then I wrote a book called  Bad Feminist   and then in interviews  people started calling me The Bad Feminist. So  what started as a bit of an inside joke with myself and a willful provocation  has become a thing. Let me take a step back. When I was younger  mostly in my teens and   s  I had strange ideas about feminists as hairy  angry  man hating  sex hating women    as if those are bad things. These days  I look at how women are treated the world over  and anger  in particular  seems like a perfectly reasonable response. But back then  I worried about the tone people used when suggesting I might be a feminist. The feminist label was an accusation  it was an  F  word  and not a nice one. I was labeled a woman who doesn't play by the rules  who expects too much  who thinks far too highly of myself  by daring to believe I'm equal     Coughs     superior to a man. You don't want to be that rebel woman  until you realize that you very much are that woman  and cannot imagine being anyone else. As I got older  I began to accept that I am  indeed  a feminist  and a proud one. I hold certain truths to be self evident  Women are equal to men. We deserve equal pay for equal work. We have the right to move through the world as we choose  free from harassment or violence. We have the right to easy  affordable access to birth control  and reproductive services. We have the right to make choices about our bodies  free from legislative oversight or evangelical doctrine. We have the right to respect. There's more. When we talk about the needs of women  we have to consider the other identities we inhabit. We are not just women. We are people with different bodies  gender expressions  faiths  sexualities  class backgrounds  abilities  and so much more. We need to take into account these differences and how they affect us  as much as we account for what we have in common. Without this kind of inclusion  our feminism is nothing. I hold these truths to be self evident  but let me be clear  I'm a mess. I am full of contradictions. There are many ways in which I'm doing feminism wrong. I have another confession. When I drive to work  I listen to thuggish rap at a very loud volume. Even though the lyrics are degrading to women    these lyrics offend me to my core    the classic Yin Yang Twins song  Salt Shaker     it is amazing.  Make it work with your wet t shirt. Bitch  you gotta shake it 'til your camel starts to hurt   Think about it. Poetry  right  I am utterly mortified by my music choices. I firmly believe in man work  which is anything I don't want to do  including    all domestic tasks  but also  bug killing  trash removal  lawn care and vehicle maintenance. I want no part of any of that. Pink is my favorite color. I enjoy fashion magazines and pretty things. I watch  The Bachelor  and romantic comedies  and I have absurd fantasies about fairy tales coming true. Some of my transgressions are more flagrant. If a woman wants to take her husband's name  that is her choice  and it is not my place to judge. If a woman chooses to stay home to raise her children  I embrace that choice  too. The problem is not that she makes herself economically vulnerable in that choice  the problem is that our society is set up to make women economically vulnerable when they choose. Let's deal with that. I reject the mainstream feminism that has historically ignored or deflected the needs of women of color  working class women  queer women and transgender women  in favor of supporting white  middle  and upper class straight women. Listen  if that's good feminism    I am a very bad feminist. There is also this  As a feminist  I feel a lot of pressure. We have this tendency to put visible feminists on a pedestal. We expect them to pose perfectly. When they disappoint us  we gleefully knock them from the very pedestal we put them on. Like I said  I am a mess    consider me knocked off that pedestal before you ever try to put me up there. Too many women  particularly groundbreaking women and industry leaders  are afraid to be labeled as feminists. They're afraid to stand up and say   Yes  I am a feminist   for fear of what that label means  for fear of being unable to live up to unrealistic expectations. Take  for example  Beyonc   or as I call her  The Goddess. She has emerged  in recent years  as a visible feminist. At the      MTV Video Music Awards  she performed in front of the word  feminist     feet high. It was a glorious spectacle to see this pop star openly embracing feminism and letting young women and men know that being a feminist is something to celebrate. As the moment faded  cultural critics began endlessly debating whether or not Beyonc  was  indeed  a feminist. They graded her feminism  instead of simply taking a grown  accomplished woman at her word. We demand perfection from feminists  because we are still fighting for so much  we want so much  we need so damn much. We go far beyond reasonable  constructive criticism  to dissecting any given woman's feminism  tearing it apart until there's nothing left. We do not need to do that. Bad feminism    or really  more inclusive feminism    is a starting point. But what happens next  We go from acknowledging our imperfections to accountability  or walking the walk  and being a little bit brave. If I listen to degrading music  I am creating a demand for which artists are more than happy to contribute a limitless supply. These artists are not going to change how they talk about women in their songs until we demand that change by affecting their bottom line. Certainly  it is difficult. Why must it be so catchy  It's hard to make the better choice  and it is so easy to justify a lesser one. But    when I justify bad choices  I make it harder for women to achieve equality  the equality that we all deserve  and I need to own that. I think of my nieces  ages three and four. They are gorgeous and headstrong  brilliant girls  who are a whole lot of brave. I want them to thrive in a world where they are valued for the powerful creatures they are. I think of them  and suddenly  the better choice becomes far easier to make. We can all make better choices. We can change the channel when a television show treats sexual violence against women like sport  Game of Thrones. We can change the radio station when we hear songs that treat women as nothing. We can spend our box office dollars elsewhere when movies don't treat women as anything more than decorative objects. We can stop supporting professional sports where the athletes treat  their partners like punching bags. In other ways  men    and especially straight white men    can say   No  I will not publish with your magazine  or participate in your project  or otherwise work with you  until you include a fair number of women  both as participants and decision makers. I won't work with you until your publication  or your organization  is more inclusive of all kinds of difference.  Those of us who are underrepresented and invited to participate in such projects  can also decline to be included until more of us are invited through the glass ceiling  and we are tokens no more. Without these efforts  without taking these stands  our accomplishments are going to mean very little. We can commit these small acts of bravery and hope that our choices trickle upward to the people in power    editors  movie and music producers  CEOs  lawmakers    the people who can make bigger  braver choices to create lasting  meaningful change. We can also boldly claim our feminism    good  bad  or anywhere in between. The last line of my book  Bad Feminist  says   I would rather be a bad feminist than no feminist at all.  This is true for so many reasons  but first and foremost  I say this because once upon a time  my voice was stolen from me  and feminism helped me to get my voice back. There was an incident. I call it an incident so I can carry the burden of what happened. Some boys broke me  when I was so young  I did not know what boys can do to break a girl. They treated me like I was nothing. I began to believe I was nothing. They stole my voice  and in the after  I did not dare to believe that anything I might say could matter. But    I had writing. And there  I wrote myself back together. I wrote myself toward a stronger version of myself. I read the words of women who might understand a story like mine  and women who looked like me  and understood what it was like to move through the world with brown skin. I read the words of women who showed me I was not nothing. I learned to write like them  and then I learned to write as myself. I found my voice again  and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond measure. Through writing and feminism  I also found that if I was a little bit brave  another woman might hear me and see me and recognize that none of us are the nothing the world tries to tell us we are. In one hand  I hold the power to accomplish anything. And in my other  I hold the humbling reality that I am just one woman. I am a bad feminist  I am a good woman  I am trying to become better in how I think  and what I say  and what I do  without abandoning everything that makes me human. I hope that we can all do the same. I hope that we can all be a little bit brave  when we most need such bravery. Blah blah blah blah blah. Blah blah blah blah  blah blah  blah blah blah blah blah blah. Blah blah blah  blah. So what the hell was that  Well  you don't know because you couldn't understand it. It wasn't clear. But hopefully  it was said with enough conviction that it was at least alluringly mysterious. Clarity or mystery  I'm balancing these two things in my daily work as a graphic designer  as well as my daily life as a New Yorker every day  and there are two elements that absolutely fascinate me. Here's an example. Now  how many people know what this is  Okay. Now how many people know what this is  Okay. Thanks to two more deft strokes by the genius Charles M. Schulz  we now have seven deft strokes that in and of themselves create an entire emotional life  one that has enthralled hundreds of millions of fans for over    years. This is actually a cover of a book that I designed about the work of Schulz and his art  which will be coming out this fall  and that is the entire cover. There is no other typographic information or visual information on the front  and the name of the book is  Only What's Necessary.  So this is sort of symbolic about the decisions I have to make every day about the design that I'm perceiving  and the design I'm creating. So clarity. Clarity gets to the point. It's blunt. It's honest. It's sincere. We ask ourselves this.   When should you be clear    Now  something like this  whether we can read it or not  needs to be really  really clear. Is it  This is a rather recent example of urban clarity that I just love  mainly because I'm always late and I am always in a hurry. So when these meters started showing up a couple of years ago on street corners  I was thrilled  because now I finally knew how many seconds I had to get across the street before I got run over by a car. Six  I can do that.  Laughter  So let's look at the yin to the clarity yang  and that is mystery. Mystery is a lot more complicated by its very definition. Mystery demands to be decoded  and when it's done right  we really  really want to.   When should you be mysterious    In World War II  the Germans really  really wanted to decode this  and they couldn't. Here's an example of a design that I've done recently for a novel by Haruki Murakami  who I've done design work for for over    years now  and this is a novel about a young man who has four dear friends who all of a sudden  after their freshman year of college  completely cut him off with no explanation  and he is devastated. And the friends' names each have a connotation in Japanese to a color. So there's Mr. Red  there's Mr. Blue  there's Ms. White  and Ms. Black. Tsukuru Tazaki  his name does not correspond to a color  so his nickname is Colorless  and as he's looking back on their friendship  he recalls that they were like five fingers on a hand. So I created this sort of abstract representation of this  but there's a lot more going on underneath the surface of the story  and there's more going on underneath the surface of the jacket. The four fingers are now four train lines in the Tokyo subway system  which has significance within the story. And then you have the colorless subway line intersecting with each of the other colors  which basically he does later on in the story. He catches up with each of these people to find out why they treated him the way they did. And so this is the three dimensional finished product sitting on my desk in my office  and what I was hoping for here is that you'll simply be allured by the mystery of what this looks like  and will want to read it to decode and find out and make more clear why it looks the way it does.   The Visual Vernacular.   This is a way to use a more familiar kind of mystery. What does this mean  This is what it means.   Make it look like something else.   The visual vernacular is the way we are used to seeing a certain thing applied to something else so that we see it in a different way. This is an approach I wanted to take to a book of essays by David Sedaris that had this title at the time.   All the Beauty You Will Ever Need   Now  the challenge here was that this title actually means nothing. It's not connected to any of the essays in the book. It came to the author's boyfriend in a dream. Thank you very much  so     Laughter     so usually  I am creating a design that is in some way based on the text  but this is all the text there is. So you've got this mysterious title that really doesn't mean anything  so I was trying to think  Where might I see a bit of mysterious text that seems to mean something but doesn't  And sure enough  not long after  one evening after a Chinese meal  this arrived  and I thought   Ah  bing  ideagasm    Laughter  I've always loved the hilariously mysterious tropes of fortune cookies that seem to mean something extremely deep but when you think about them    if you think about them    they really don't. This says   Hardly anyone knows how much is gained by ignoring the future.  Thank you.  Laughter  But we can take this visual vernacular and apply it to Mr. Sedaris  and we are so familiar with how fortune cookie fortunes look that we don't even need the bits of the cookie anymore. We're just seeing this strange thing and we know we love David Sedaris  and so we're hoping that we're in for a good time.   'Fraud' Essays by David Rakoff   David Rakoff was a wonderful writer and he called his first book  Fraud  because he was getting sent on assignments by magazines to do things that he was not equipped to do. So he was this skinny little urban guy and GQ magazine would send him down the Colorado River whitewater rafting to see if he would survive. And then he would write about it  and he felt that he was a fraud and that he was misrepresenting himself. And so I wanted the cover of this book to also misrepresent itself and then somehow show a reader reacting to it. This led me to graffiti. I'm fascinated by graffiti. I think anybody who lives in an urban environment encounters graffiti all the time  and there's all different sorts of it. This is a picture I took on the Lower East Side of just a transformer box on the sidewalk and it's been tagged like crazy. Now whether you look at this and think   Oh  that's a charming urban affectation   or you look at it and say   That's illegal abuse of property   the one thing I think we can all agree on is that you cannot read it. Right  There is no clear message here. There is another kind of graffiti that I find far more interesting  which I call editorial graffiti. This is a picture I took recently in the subway  and sometimes you see lots of prurient  stupid stuff  but I thought this was interesting  and this is a poster that is saying rah rah Airbnb  and someone has taken a Magic Marker and has editorialized about what they think about it. And it got my attention. So I was thinking  how do we apply this to this book  So I get the book by this person  and I start reading it  and I'm thinking  this guy is not who he says  he is  he's a fraud. And I get out a red Magic Marker  and out of frustration just scribble this across the front. Design done.  Laughter  And they went for it   Laughter  Author liked it  publisher liked it  and that is how the book went out into the world  and it was really fun to see people reading this on the subway and walking around with it and what have you  and they all sort of looked like they were crazy.   'Perfidia' a novel by James Ellroy   Okay  James Ellroy  amazing crime writer  a good friend  I've worked with him for many years. He is probably best known as the author of  The Black Dahlia  and  L.A. Confidential.  His most recent novel was called this  which is a very mysterious name that I'm sure a lot of people know what it means  but a lot of people don't. And it's a story about a Japanese American detective in Los Angeles in      investigating a murder. And then Pearl Harbor happens  and as if his life wasn't difficult enough  now the race relations have really ratcheted up  and then the Japanese American internment camps are quickly created  and there's lots of tension and horrible stuff as he's still trying to solve this murder. And so I did at first think very literally about this in terms of all right  we'll take Pearl Harbor and we'll add it to Los Angeles and we'll make this apocalyptic dawn on the horizon of the city. And so that's a picture from Pearl Harbor just grafted onto Los Angeles. My editor in chief said   You know  it's interesting but I think you can do better and I think you can make it simpler.  And so I went back to the drawing board  as I often do. But also  being alive to my surroundings  I work in a high rise in Midtown  and every night  before I leave the office  I have to push this button to get out  and the big heavy glass doors open and I can get onto the elevator. And one night  all of a sudden  I looked at this and I saw it in a way that I hadn't really noticed it before. Big red circle  danger. And I thought this was so obvious that it had to have been done a zillion times  and so I did a Google image search  and I couldn't find another book cover that looked quite like this  and so this is really what solved the problem  and graphically it's more interesting and creates a bigger tension between the idea of a certain kind of sunrise coming up over L.A. and America.   'Gulp' A tour of the human digestive system by Mary Roach.   Mary Roach is an amazing writer who takes potentially mundane scientific subjects and makes them not mundane at all  she makes them really fun. So in this particular case  it's about the human digestive system. So I'm trying to figure out what is the cover of this book going to be. This is a self portrait.  Laughter  Every morning I look at myself in the medicine cabinet mirror to see if my tongue is black. And if it's not  I'm good to go. I recommend you all do this. But I also started thinking  here's our introduction. Right  Into the human digestive system. But I think what we can all agree on is that actual photographs of human mouths  at least based on this  are off putting.  Laughter  So for the cover  then  I had this illustration done which is literally more palatable and reminds us that it's best to approach the digestive system from this end. I don't even have to complete the sentence. All right.   Unuseful mystery   What happens when clarity and mystery get mixed up  And we see this all the time. This is what I call unuseful mystery. I go down into the subway    I take the subway a lot    and this piece of paper is taped to a girder. Right  And now I'm thinking  uh oh  and the train's about to come and I'm trying to figure out what this means  and thanks a lot. Part of the problem here is that they've compartmentalized the information in a way they think is helpful  and frankly  I don't think it is at all. So this is mystery we do not need. What we need is useful clarity  so just for fun  I redesigned this. This is using all the same elements. Thank you. I am still waiting for a call from the MTA.  Laughter  You know  I'm actually not even using more colors than they use. They just didn't even bother to make the   and the   green  those idiots.  Laughter  So the first thing we see is that there is a service change  and then  in two complete sentences with a beginning  a middle and an end  it tells us what the change is and what's going to be happening. Call me crazy   Laughter    Useful mystery   All right. Now  here is a piece of mystery that I love  packaging. This redesign of the Diet Coke can by Turner Duckworth is to me truly a piece of art. It's a work of art. It's beautiful. But part of what makes it so heartening to me as a designer is that he's taken the visual vernacular of Diet Coke    the typefaces  the colors  the silver background    and he's reduced them to their most essential parts  so it's like going back to the Charlie Brown face. It's like  how can you give them just enough information so they know what it is but giving them the credit for the knowledge that they already have about this thing  It looks great  and you would go into a delicatessen and all of a sudden see that on the shelf  and it's wonderful. Which makes the next thing      Unuseful clarity      all the more disheartening  at least to me. So okay  again  going back down into the subway  after this came out  these are pictures that I took. Times Square subway station  Coca Cola has bought out the entire thing for advertising. Okay  And maybe some of you know where this is going. Ahem.  You moved to New York with the clothes on your back  the cash in your pocket  and your eyes on the prize. You're on Coke.   Laughter   You moved to New York with an MBA  one clean suit  and an extremely firm handshake. You're on Coke.   Laughter  These are real   Laughter  Not even the support beams were spared  except they switched into Yoda mode.  Laughter   Coke you're on.   Laughter    Excuse me  I'm on WHAT     This campaign was a huge misstep. It was pulled almost instantly due to consumer backlash and all sorts of unflattering parodies on the web    and also that dot next to  You're on   that's not a period  that's a trademark. So thanks a lot. So to me  this was just so bizarre about how they could get the packaging so mysteriously beautiful and perfect and the message so unbearably  clearly wrong. It was just incredible to me. So I just hope that I've been able to share with you some of my insights on the uses of clarity and mystery in my work  and maybe how you might decide to be more clear in your life  or maybe to be a bit more mysterious and not so over sharing. And if there's just one thing that I leave you with from this talk  I hope it's this  Blih blih blih blah. Blah blah blih blih.   'Judge This ' Chip Kidd   Blih blih blah blah blah. Blah blah blah. Blah blah. This is my great uncle  my father's father's younger brother. His name was Joe McKenna. He was a young husband and a semi pro basketball player and a fireman in New York City. Family history says he loved being a fireman  and so in       on one of his days off  he elected to hang out at the firehouse. To make himself useful that day  he started polishing all the brass  the railings on the fire truck  the fittings on the walls  and one of the fire hose nozzles  a giant  heavy piece of metal  toppled off a shelf and hit him. A few days later  his shoulder started to hurt. Two days after that  he spiked a fever. The fever climbed and climbed. His wife was taking care of him  but nothing she did made a difference  and when they got the local doctor in  nothing he did mattered either. They flagged down a cab and took him to the hospital. The nurses there recognized right away that he had an infection  what at the time they would have called  blood poisoning   and though they probably didn't say it  they would have known right away that there was nothing they could do. There was nothing they could do because the things we use now to cure infections didn't exist yet. The first test of penicillin  the first antibiotic  was three years in the future. People who got infections either recovered  if they were lucky  or they died. My great uncle was not lucky. He was in the hospital for a week  shaking with chills  dehydrated and delirious  sinking into a coma as his organs failed. His condition grew so desperate that the people from his firehouse lined up to give him transfusions hoping to dilute the infection surging through his blood. Nothing worked. He died. He was    years old. If you look back through history  most people died the way my great uncle died. Most people didn't die of cancer or heart disease  the lifestyle diseases that afflict us in the West today. They didn't die of those diseases because they didn't live long enough to develop them. They died of injuries    being gored by an ox  shot on a battlefield  crushed in one of the new factories of the Industrial Revolution    and most of the time from infection  which finished what those injuries began. All of that changed when antibiotics arrived. Suddenly  infections that had been a death sentence became something you recovered from in days. It seemed like a miracle  and ever since  we have been living inside the golden epoch of the miracle drugs. And now  we are coming to an end of it. My great uncle died in the last days of the pre antibiotic era. We stand today on the threshold of the post antibiotic era  in the earliest days of a time when simple infections such as the one Joe had will kill people once again. In fact  they already are. People are dying of infections again because of a phenomenon called antibiotic resistance. Briefly  it works like this. Bacteria compete against each other for resources  for food  by manufacturing lethal compounds that they direct against each other. Other bacteria  to protect themselves  evolve defenses against that chemical attack. When we first made antibiotics  we took those compounds into the lab and made our own versions of them  and bacteria responded to our attack the way they always had. Here is what happened next  Penicillin was distributed in       and widespread penicillin resistance arrived by     . Vancomycin arrived in       vancomycin resistance in     . Imipenem in       and resistance to in     . Daptomycin  one of the most recent drugs  in       and resistance to it just a year later in     . For    years  we played a game of leapfrog    our drug and their resistance  and then another drug  and then resistance again    and now the game is ending. Bacteria develop resistance so quickly that pharmaceutical companies have decided making antibiotics is not in their best interest  so there are infections moving across the world for which  out of the more than     antibiotics available on the market  two drugs might work with side effects  or one drug  or none. This is what that looks like. In       the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  the CDC  identified a single case in a hospital in North Carolina of an infection resistant to all but two drugs. Today  that infection  known as KPC  has spread to every state but three  and to South America  Europe and the Middle East. In       doctors in Sweden diagnosed a man from India with a different infection resistant to all but one drug that time. The gene that creates that resistance  known as NDM  has now spread from India into China  Asia  Africa  Europe and Canada  and the United States. It would be natural to hope that these infections are extraordinary cases  but in fact  in the United States and Europe         people a year die of infections which no drugs can help. A project chartered by the British government known as the Review on Antimicrobial Resistance estimates that the worldwide toll right now is         deaths a year. That is a lot of deaths  and yet  the chances are good that you don't feel at risk  that you imagine these people were hospital patients in intensive care units or nursing home residents near the ends of their lives  people whose infections are remote from us  in situations we can't identify with. What you didn't think about  none of us do  is that antibiotics support almost all of modern life. If we lost antibiotics  here's what else we'd lose  First  any protection for people with weakened immune systems    cancer patients  AIDS patients  transplant recipients  premature babies. Next  any treatment that installs foreign objects in the body  stents for stroke  pumps for diabetes  dialysis  joint replacements. How many athletic baby boomers need new hips and knees  A recent study estimates that without antibiotics  one out of ever six would die. Next  we'd probably lose surgery. Many operations are preceded by prophylactic doses of antibiotics. Without that protection  we'd lose the ability to open the hidden spaces of the body. So no heart operations  no prostate biopsies  no Cesarean sections. We'd have to learn to fear infections that now seem minor. Strep throat used to cause heart failure. Skin infections led to amputations. Giving birth killed  in the cleanest hospitals  almost one woman out of every    . Pneumonia took three children out of every   . More than anything else  we'd lose the confident way we live our everyday lives. If you knew that any injury could kill you  would you ride a motorcycle  bomb down a ski slope  climb a ladder to hang your Christmas lights  let your kid slide into home plate  After all  the first person to receive penicillin  a British policeman named Albert Alexander  who was so ravaged by infection that his scalp oozed pus and doctors had to take out an eye  was infected by doing something very simple. He walked into his garden and scratched his face on a thorn. That British project I mentioned which estimates that the worldwide toll right now is         deaths a year also predicts that if we can't get this under control by       not long  the worldwide toll will be    million deaths a year. How did we get to this point where what we have to look forward to is those terrifying numbers  The difficult answer is  we did it to ourselves. Resistance is an inevitable biological process  but we bear the responsibility for accelerating it. We did this by squandering antibiotics with a heedlessness that now seems shocking. Penicillin was sold over the counter until the     s. In much of the developing world  most antibiotics still are. In the United States     percent of the antibiotics given in hospitals are unnecessary. Forty five percent of the prescriptions written in doctor's offices are for conditions that antibiotics cannot help. And that's just in healthcare. On much of the planet  most meat animals get antibiotics every day of their lives  not to cure illnesses  but to fatten them up and to protect them against the factory farm conditions they are raised in. In the United States  possibly    percent of the antibiotics sold every year go to farm animals  not to humans  creating resistant bacteria that move off the farm in water  in dust  in the meat the animals become. Aquaculture depends on antibiotics too  particularly in Asia  and fruit growing relies on antibiotics to protect apples  pears  citrus  against disease. And because bacteria can pass their DNA to each other like a traveler handing off a suitcase at an airport  once we have encouraged that resistance into existence  there is no knowing where it will spread. This was predictable. In fact  it was predicted by Alexander Fleming  the man who discovered penicillin. He was given the Nobel Prize in      in recognition  and in an interview shortly after  this is what he said   The thoughtless person playing with penicillin treatment is morally responsible for the death of a man who succumbs to infection with a pencillin resistant organism.  He added   I hope this evil can be averted.  Can we avert it  There are companies working on novel antibiotics  things the superbugs have never seen before. We need those new drugs badly  and we need incentives  discovery grants  extended patents  prizes  to lure other companies into making antibiotics again. But that probably won't be enough. Here's why  Evolution always wins. Bacteria birth a new generation every    minutes. It takes pharmaceutical chemistry    years to derive a new drug. Every time we use an antibiotic  we give the bacteria billions of chances to crack the codes of the defenses we've constructed. There has never yet been a drug they could not defeat. This is asymmetric warfare  but we can change the outcome. We could build systems to harvest data to tell us automatically and specifically how antibiotics are being used. We could build gatekeeping into drug order systems so that every prescription gets a second look. We could require agriculture to give up antibiotic use. We could build surveillance systems to tell us where resistance is emerging next. Those are the tech solutions. They probably aren't enough either  unless we help. Antibiotic resistance is a habit. We all know how hard it is to change a habit. But as a society  we've done that in the past. People used to toss litter into the streets  used to not wear seatbelts  used to smoke inside public buildings. We don't do those things anymore. We don't trash the environment or court devastating accidents or expose others to the possibility of cancer  because we decided those things were expensive  destructive  not in our best interest. We changed social norms. We could change social norms around antibiotic use too. I know that the scale of antibiotic resistance seems overwhelming  but if you've ever bought a fluorescent lightbulb because you were concerned about climate change  or read the label on a box of crackers because you think about the deforestation from palm oil  you already know what it feels like to take a tiny step to address an overwhelming problem. We could take those kinds of steps for antibiotic use too. We could forgo giving an antibiotic if we're not sure it's the right one. We could stop insisting on a prescription for our kid's ear infection before we're sure what caused it. We could ask every restaurant  every supermarket  where their meat comes from. We could promise each other never again to buy chicken or shrimp or fruit raised with routine antibiotic use  and if we did those things  we could slow down the arrival of the post antibiotic world. But we have to do it soon. Penicillin began the antibiotic era in     . In just    years  we walked ourselves up to the edge of disaster. We won't get    years to find our way back out again. Thank you very much. So in       Karl Benz invented the automobile. Later that year  he took it out for the first public test drive  and    true story    crashed into a wall. For the last     years  we've been working around that least reliable part of the car  the driver. We've made the car stronger. We've added seat belts  we've added air bags  and in the last decade  we've actually started trying to make the car smarter to fix that bug  the driver. Now  today I'm going to talk to you a little bit about the difference between patching around the problem with driver assistance systems and actually having fully self driving cars and what they can do for the world. I'm also going to talk to you a little bit about our car and allow you to see how it sees the world and how it reacts and what it does  but first I'm going to talk a little bit about the problem. And it's a big problem   .  million people are killed on the world's roads every year. In America alone         people are killed each year. To put that in perspective  that's the same as a     falling out of the sky every working day. It's kind of unbelievable. Cars are sold to us like this  but really  this is what driving's like. Right  It's not sunny  it's rainy  and you want to do anything other than drive. And the reason why is this  Traffic is getting worse. In America  between      and       the vehicle miles traveled increased by    percent. We grew by six percent of roads  so it's not in your brains. Traffic really is substantially worse than it was not very long ago. And all of this has a very human cost. So if you take the average commute time in America  which is about    minutes  you multiply that by the     million workers we have  that turns out to be about six billion minutes wasted in commuting every day. Now  that's a big number  so let's put it in perspective. You take that six billion minutes and you divide it by the average life expectancy of a person  that turns out to be     lifetimes spent every day  wasted  just getting from A to B. It's unbelievable. And then  there are those of us who don't have the privilege of sitting in traffic. So this is Steve. He's an incredibly capable guy  but he just happens to be blind  and that means instead of a    minute drive to work in the morning  it's a two hour ordeal of piecing together bits of public transit or asking friends and family for a ride. He doesn't have that same freedom that you and I have to get around. We should do something about that. Now  conventional wisdom would say that we'll just take these driver assistance systems and we'll kind of push them and incrementally improve them  and over time  they'll turn into self driving cars. Well  I'm here to tell you that's like me saying that if I work really hard at jumping  one day I'll be able to fly. We actually need to do something a little different. And so I'm going to talk to you about three different ways that self driving systems are different than driver assistance systems. And I'm going to start with some of our own experience. So back in       we had the first test of a self driving car where we let regular people use it. Well  almost regular    they were     Googlers  but they weren't working on the project. And we gave them the car and we allowed them to use it in their daily lives. But unlike a real self driving car  this one had a big asterisk with it  They had to pay attention  because this was an experimental vehicle. We tested it a lot  but it could still fail. And so we gave them two hours of training  we put them in the car  we let them use it  and what we heard back was something awesome  as someone trying to bring a product into the world. Every one of them told us they loved it. In fact  we had a Porsche driver who came in and told us on the first day   This is completely stupid. What are we thinking   But at the end of it  he said   Not only should I have it  everyone else should have it  because people are terrible drivers.  So this was music to our ears  but then we started to look at what the people inside the car were doing  and this was eye opening. Now  my favorite story is this gentleman who looks down at his phone and realizes the battery is low  so he turns around like this in the car and digs around in his backpack  pulls out his laptop  puts it on the seat  goes in the back again  digs around  pulls out the charging cable for his phone  futzes around  puts it into the laptop  puts it on the phone. Sure enough  the phone is charging. All the time he's been doing    miles per hour down the freeway. Right  Unbelievable. So we thought about this and we said  it's kind of obvious  right  The better the technology gets  the less reliable the driver is going to get. So by just making the cars incrementally smarter  we're probably not going to see the wins we really need. Let me talk about something a little technical for a moment here. So we're looking at this graph  and along the bottom is how often does the car apply the brakes when it shouldn't. You can ignore most of that axis  because if you're driving around town  and the car starts stopping randomly  you're never going to buy that car. And the vertical axis is how often the car is going to apply the brakes when it's supposed to to help you avoid an accident. Now  if we look at the bottom left corner here  this is your classic car. It doesn't apply the brakes for you  it doesn't do anything goofy  but it also doesn't get you out of an accident. Now  if we want to bring a driver assistance system into a car  say with collision mitigation braking  we're going to put some package of technology on there  and that's this curve  and it's going to have some operating properties  but it's never going to avoid all of the accidents  because it doesn't have that capability. But we'll pick some place along the curve here  and maybe it avoids half of accidents that the human driver misses  and that's amazing  right  We just reduced accidents on our roads by a factor of two. There are now        less people dying every year in America. But if we want a self driving car  we need a technology curve that looks like this. We're going to have to put more sensors in the vehicle  and we'll pick some operating point up here where it basically never gets into a crash. They'll happen  but very low frequency. Now you and I could look at this and we could argue about whether it's incremental  and I could say something like        rule   and it's really hard to move up to that new curve. But let's look at it from a different direction for a moment. So let's look at how often the technology has to do the right thing. And so this green dot up here is a driver assistance system. It turns out that human drivers make mistakes that lead to traffic accidents about once every         miles in America. In contrast  a self driving system is probably making decisions about    times per second  so order of magnitude  that's about       times per mile. So if you compare the distance between these two  it's about    to the eighth  right  Eight orders of magnitude. That's like comparing how fast I run to the speed of light. It doesn't matter how hard I train  I'm never actually going to get there. So there's a pretty big gap there. And then finally  there's how the system can handle uncertainty. So this pedestrian here might be stepping into the road  might not be. I can't tell  nor can any of our algorithms  but in the case of a driver assistance system  that means it can't take action  because again  if it presses the brakes unexpectedly  that's completely unacceptable. Whereas a self driving system can look at that pedestrian and say  I don't know what they're about to do  slow down  take a better look  and then react appropriately after that. So it can be much safer than a driver assistance system can ever be. So that's enough about the differences between the two. Let's spend some time talking about how the car sees the world. So this is our vehicle. It starts by understanding where it is in the world  by taking a map and its sensor data and aligning the two  and then we layer on top of that what it sees in the moment. So here  all the purple boxes you can see are other vehicles on the road  and the red thing on the side over there is a cyclist  and up in the distance  if you look really closely  you can see some cones. Then we know where the car is in the moment  but we have to do better than that  we have to predict what's going to happen. So here the pickup truck in top right is about to make a left lane change because the road in front of it is closed  so it needs to get out of the way. Knowing that one pickup truck is great  but we really need to know what everybody's thinking  so it becomes quite a complicated problem. And then given that  we can figure out how the car should respond in the moment  so what trajectory it should follow  how quickly it should slow down or speed up. And then that all turns into just following a path  turning the steering wheel left or right  pressing the brake or gas. It's really just two numbers at the end of the day. So how hard can it really be  Back when we started in       this is what our system looked like. So you can see our car in the middle and the other boxes on the road  driving down the highway. The car needs to understand where it is and roughly where the other vehicles are. It's really a geometric understanding of the world. Once we started driving on neighborhood and city streets  the problem becomes a whole new level of difficulty. You see pedestrians crossing in front of us  cars crossing in front of us  going every which way  the traffic lights  crosswalks. It's an incredibly complicated problem by comparison. And then once you have that problem solved  the vehicle has to be able to deal with construction. So here are the cones on the left forcing it to drive to the right  but not just construction in isolation  of course. It has to deal with other people moving through that construction zone as well. And of course  if anyone's breaking the rules  the police are there and the car has to understand that that flashing light on the top of the car means that it's not just a car  it's actually a police officer. Similarly  the orange box on the side here  it's a school bus  and we have to treat that differently as well. When we're out on the road  other people have expectations  So  when a cyclist puts up their arm  it means they're expecting the car to yield to them and make room for them to make a lane change. And when a police officer stood in the road  our vehicle should understand that this means stop  and when they signal to go  we should continue. Now  the way we accomplish this is by sharing data between the vehicles. The first  most crude model of this is when one vehicle sees a construction zone  having another know about it so it can be in the correct lane to avoid some of the difficulty. But we actually have a much deeper understanding of this. We could take all of the data that the cars have seen over time  the hundreds of thousands of pedestrians  cyclists  and vehicles that have been out there and understand what they look like and use that to infer what other vehicles should look like and other pedestrians should look like. And then  even more importantly  we could take from that a model of how we expect them to move through the world. So here the yellow box is a pedestrian crossing in front of us. Here the blue box is a cyclist and we anticipate that they're going to nudge out and around the car to the right. Here there's a cyclist coming down the road and we know they're going to continue to drive down the shape of the road. Here somebody makes a right turn  and in a moment here  somebody's going to make a U turn in front of us  and we can anticipate that behavior and respond safely. Now  that's all well and good for things that we've seen  but of course  you encounter lots of things that you haven't seen in the world before. And so just a couple of months ago  our vehicles were driving through Mountain View  and this is what we encountered. This is a woman in an electric wheelchair chasing a duck in circles on the road.  Laughter  Now it turns out  there is nowhere in the DMV handbook that tells you how to deal with that  but our vehicles were able to encounter that  slow down  and drive safely. Now  we don't have to deal with just ducks. Watch this bird fly across in front of us. The car reacts to that. Here we're dealing with a cyclist that you would never expect to see anywhere other than Mountain View. And of course  we have to deal with drivers  even the very small ones. Watch to the right as someone jumps out of this truck at us. And now  watch the left as the car with the green box decides he needs to make a right turn at the last possible moment. Here  as we make a lane change  the car to our left decides it wants to as well. And here  we watch a car blow through a red light and yield to it. And similarly  here  a cyclist blowing through that light as well. And of course  the vehicle responds safely. And of course  we have people who do I don't know what sometimes on the road  like this guy pulling out between two self driving cars. You have to ask   What are you thinking   Now  I just fire hosed you with a lot of stuff there  so I'm going to break one of these down pretty quickly. So what we're looking at is the scene with the cyclist again  and you might notice in the bottom  we can't actually see the cyclist yet  but the car can  it's that little blue box up there  and that comes from the laser data. And that's not actually really easy to understand  so what I'm going to do is I'm going to turn that laser data and look at it  and if you're really good at looking at laser data  you can see a few dots on the curve there  right there  and that blue box is that cyclist. Now as our light is red  the cyclist's light has turned yellow already  and if you squint  you can see that in the imagery. But the cyclist  we see  is going to proceed through the intersection. Our light has now turned green  his is solidly red  and we now anticipate that this bike is going to come all the way across. Unfortunately the other drivers next to us were not paying as much attention. They started to pull forward  and fortunately for everyone  this cyclists reacts  avoids  and makes it through the intersection. And off we go. Now  as you can see  we've made some pretty exciting progress  and at this point we're pretty convinced this technology is going to come to market. We do three million miles of testing in our simulators every single day  so you can imagine the experience that our vehicles have. We are looking forward to having this technology on the road  and we think the right path is to go through the self driving rather than driver assistance approach because the urgency is so large. In the time I have given this talk today     people have died on America's roads. How soon can we bring it out  Well  it's hard to say because it's a really complicated problem  but these are my two boys. My oldest son is     and that means in four and a half years  he's going to be able to get his driver's license. My team and I are committed to making sure that doesn't happen. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Chris  I've got a question for you. Chris Urmson  Sure. CA  So certainly  the mind of your cars is pretty mind boggling. On this debate between driver assisted and fully driverless    I mean  there's a real debate going on out there right now. So some of the companies  for example  Tesla  are going the driver assisted route. What you're saying is that that's kind of going to be a dead end because you can't just keep improving that route and get to fully driverless at some point  and then a driver is going to say   This feels safe   and climb into the back  and something ugly will happen. CU  Right. No  that's exactly right  and it's not to say that the driver assistance systems aren't going to be incredibly valuable. They can save a lot of lives in the interim  but to see the transformative opportunity to help someone like Steve get around  to really get to the end case in safety  to have the opportunity to change our cities and move parking out and get rid of these urban craters we call parking lots  it's the only way to go. CA  We will be tracking your progress with huge interest. Thanks so much  Chris. CU  Thank you.  Applause  When you're a child  anything and everything is possible. The challenge  so often  is hanging on to that as we grow up. And as a four year old  I had the opportunity to sail for the first time. I will never forget the excitement as we closed the coast. I will never forget the feeling of adventure as I climbed on board the boat and stared into her tiny cabin for the first time. But the most amazing feeling was the feeling of freedom  the feeling that I felt when we hoisted her sails. As a four year old child  it was the greatest sense of freedom that I could ever imagine. I made my mind up there and then that one day  somehow  I was going to sail around the world. So I did what I could in my life to get closer to that dream. Age     it was saving my school dinner money change. Every single day for eight years  I had mashed potato and baked beans  which cost  p each  and gravy was free. Every day I would pile up the change on the top of my money box  and when that pile reached a pound  I would drop it in and cross off one of the     squares I'd drawn on a piece of paper. Finally  I bought a tiny dinghy. I spent hours sitting on it in the garden dreaming of my goal. I read every book I could on sailing  and then eventually  having been told by my school I wasn't clever enough to be a vet  left school age    to begin my apprenticeship in sailing. So imagine how it felt just four years later to be sitting in a boardroom in front of someone who I knew could make that dream come true. I felt like my life depended on that moment  and incredibly  he said yes. And I could barely contain my excitement as I sat in that first design meeting designing a boat on which I was going to sail solo nonstop around the world. From that first meeting to the finish line of the race  it was everything I'd ever imagined. Just like in my dreams  there were amazing parts and tough parts. We missed an iceberg by    feet. Nine times  I climbed to the top of her    foot mast. We were blown on our side in the Southern Ocean. But the sunsets  the wildlife  and the remoteness were absolutely breathtaking. After three months at sea  age just     I finished in second position. I'd loved it  so much so that within six months I decided to go around the world again  but this time not in a race  to try to be the fastest person ever to sail solo nonstop around the world. Now for this  I needed a different craft  bigger  wider  faster  more powerful. Just to give that boat some scale  I could climb inside her mast all the way to the top. Seventy five foot long     foot wide. I affectionately called her Moby. She was a multihull. When we built her  no one had ever made it solo nonstop around the world in one  though many had tried  but whilst we built her  a Frenchman took a boat    percent bigger than her and not only did he make it  but he took the record from    days right down to   . The bar was now much  much higher. And these boats were exciting to sail. This was a training sail off the French coast. This I know well because I was one of the five crew members on board. Five seconds is all it took from everything being fine to our world going black as the windows were thrust underwater  and that five seconds goes quickly. Just see how far below those guys the sea is. Imagine that alone in the Southern Ocean plunged into icy water  thousands of miles away from land. It was Christmas Day. I was forging into the Southern Ocean underneath Australia. The conditions were horrendous. I was approaching a part in the ocean which was       miles away from the nearest town. The nearest land was Antarctica  and the nearest people would be those manning the European Space Station above me. You really are in the middle of nowhere. If you need help  and you're still alive  it takes four days for a ship to get to you and then four days for that ship to get you back to port. No helicopter can reach you out there  and no plane can land. We are forging ahead of a huge storm. Within it  there was    knots of wind  which was far too much wind for the boat and I to cope with. The waves were already    to    feet high  and the spray from the breaking crests was blown horizontally like snow in a blizzard. If we didn't sail fast enough  we'd be engulfed by that storm  and either capsized or smashed to pieces. We were quite literally hanging on for our lives and doing so on a knife edge. The speed I so desperately needed brought with it danger. We all know what it's like driving a car    miles an hour        . It's not too stressful. We can concentrate. We can turn on the radio. Take that             accelerate through to             miles an hour. Now you have white knuckles and you're gripping the steering wheel. Now take that car off road at night and remove the windscreen wipers  the windscreen  the headlights and the brakes. That's what it's like in the Southern Ocean. You could imagine it would be quite difficult to sleep in that situation  even as a passenger. But you're not a passenger. You're alone on a boat you can barely stand up in  and you have to make every single decision on board. I was absolutely exhausted  physically and mentally. Eight sail changes in    hours. The mainsail weighed three times my body weight  and after each change  I would collapse on the floor soaked with sweat with this freezing Southern Ocean air burning the back of my throat. But out there  those lowest of the lows are so often contrasted with the highest of the highs. A few days later  we came out of the back of the low. Against all odds  we'd been able to drive ahead of the record within that depression. The sky cleared  the rain stopped  and our heartbeat  the monstrous seas around us were transformed into the most beautiful moonlit mountains. It's hard to explain  but you enter a different mode when you head out there. Your boat is your entire world  and what you take with you when you leave is all you have. If I said to you all now   Go off into Vancouver and find everything you will need for your survival for the next three months   that's quite a task. That's food  fuel  clothes  even toilet roll and toothpaste. That's what we do  and when we leave we manage it down to the last drop of diesel and the last packet of food. No experience in my life could have given me a better understanding of the definition of the word  finite.  What we have out there is all we have. There is no more. And never in my life had I ever translated that definition of finite that I'd felt on board to anything outside of sailing until I stepped off the boat at the finish line having broken that record. Suddenly I connected the dots. Our global economy is no different. It's entirely dependent on finite materials we only have once in the history of humanity. And it was a bit like seeing something you weren't expecting under a stone and having two choices  I either put that stone to one side and learn more about it  or I put that stone back and I carry on with my dream job of sailing around the world. I chose the first. I put it to one side and I began a new journey of learning  speaking to chief executives  experts  scientists  economists to try to understand just how our global economy works. And my curiosity took me to some extraordinary places. This photo was taken in the burner of a coal fired power station. I was fascinated by coal  fundamental to our global energy needs  but also very close to my family. My great grandfather was a coal miner  and he spent    years of his life underground. This is a photo of him  and when you see that photo  you see someone from another era. No one wears trousers with a waistband quite that high in this day and age.  Laughter  But yet  that's me with my great grandfather  and by the way  they are not his real ears.  Laughter  We were close. I remember sitting on his knee listening to his mining stories. He talked of the camaraderie underground  and the fact that the miners used to save the crusts of their sandwiches to give to the ponies they worked with underground. It was like it was yesterday. And on my journey of learning  I went to the World Coal Association website  and there in the middle of the homepage  it said   We have about     years of coal left.  And I thought to myself  well  that's well outside my lifetime  and a much greater figure than the predictions for oil. But I did the math  and I realized that my great grandfather had been born exactly     years before that year  and I sat on his knee until I was    years old  and I realized it's nothing in time  nor in history. And it made me make a decision I never thought I would make  to leave the sport of solo sailing behind me and focus on the greatest challenge I'd ever come across  the future of our global economy. And I quickly realized it wasn't just about energy. It was also materials. In       I picked up a scientific study looking at how many years we have of valuable materials to extract from the ground  copper      tin  zinc      silver    . These figures couldn't be exact  but we knew those materials were finite. We only have them once. And yet  our speed that we've used these materials has increased rapidly  exponentially. With more people in the world with more stuff  we've effectively seen     years of price declines in those basic commodities erased in just    years. And this affects all of us. It's brought huge volatility in prices  so much so that in       your average European car manufacturer saw a raw material price increase of     million Euros  wiping away half their operating profits through something they have absolutely no control over. And the more I learned  the more I started to change my own life. I started traveling less  doing less  using less. It felt like actually doing less was what we had to do. But it sat uneasy with me. It didn't feel right. It felt like we were buying ourselves time. We were eking things out a bit longer. Even if everybody changed  it wouldn't solve the problem. It wouldn't fix the system. It was vital in the transition  but what fascinated me was  in the transition to what  What could actually work  It struck me that the system itself  the framework within which we live  is fundamentally flawed  and I realized ultimately that our operating system  the way our economy functions  the way our economy's been built  is a system in itself. At sea  I had to understand complex systems. I had to take multiple inputs  I had to process them  and I had to understand the system to win. I had to make sense of it. And as I looked at our global economy  I realized it too is that system  but it's a system that effectively can't run in the long term. And I realized we've been perfecting what's effectively a linear economy for     years  where we take a material out of the ground  we make something out of it  and then ultimately that product gets thrown away  and yes  we do recycle some of it  but more an attempt to get out what we can at the end  not by design. It's an economy that fundamentally can't run in the long term  and if we know that we have finite materials  why would we build an economy that would effectively use things up  that would create waste  Life itself has existed for billions of years and has continually adapted to use materials effectively. It's a complex system  but within it  there is no waste. Everything is metabolized. It's not a linear economy at all  but circular. And I felt like the child in the garden. For the first time on this new journey  I could see exactly where we were headed. If we could build an economy that would use things rather than use them up  we could build a future that really could work in the long term. I was excited. This was something to work towards. We knew exactly where we were headed. We just had to work out how to get there  and it was exactly with this in mind that we created the Ellen MacArthur Foundation in September     . Many schools of thought fed our thinking and pointed to this model  industrial symbiosis  performance economy  sharing economy  biomimicry  and of course  cradle to cradle design. Materials would be defined as either technical or biological  waste would be designed out entirely  and we would have a system that could function absolutely in the long term. So what could this economy look like  Maybe we wouldn't buy light fittings  but we'd pay for the service of light  and the manufacturers would recover the materials and change the light fittings when we had more efficient products. What if packaging was so nontoxic it could dissolve in water and we could ultimately drink it  It would never become waste. What if engines were re manufacturable  and we could recover the component materials and significantly reduce energy demand. What if we could recover components from circuit boards  reutilize them  and then fundamentally recover the materials within them through a second stage  What if we could collect food waste  human waste  What if we could turn that into fertilizer  heat  energy  ultimately reconnecting nutrients systems and rebuilding natural capital  And cars    what we want is to move around. We don't need to own the materials within them. Could cars become a service and provide us with mobility in the future  All of this sounds amazing  but these aren't just ideas  they're real today  and these lie at the forefront of the circular economy. What lies before us is to expand them and scale them up. So how would you shift from linear to circular  Well  the team and I at the foundation thought you might want to work with the top universities in the world  with leading businesses within the world  with the biggest convening platforms in the world  and with governments. We thought you might want to work with the best analysts and ask them the question   Can the circular economy decouple growth from resource constraints  Is the circular economy able to rebuild natural capital  Could the circular economy replace current chemical fertilizer use   Yes was the answer to the decoupling  but also yes  we could replace current fertilizer use by a staggering  .  times. But what inspired me most about the circular economy was its ability to inspire young people. When young people see the economy through a circular lens  they see brand new opportunities on exactly the same horizon. They can use their creativity and knowledge to rebuild the entire system  and it's there for the taking right now  and the faster we do this  the better. So could we achieve this in their lifetimes  Is it actually possible  I believe yes. When you look at the lifetime of my great grandfather  anything's possible. When he was born  there were only    cars in the world  they had only just been invented. When he was     we flew for the first time in history. Now there are         charter flights every single day. When he was     we built the first computer. Many said it wouldn't catch on  but it did  and just    years later we turned it into a microchip of which there will be thousands in this room here today. Ten years before he died  we built the first mobile phone. It wasn't that mobile  to be fair  but now it really is  and as my great grandfather left this Earth  the Internet arrived. Now we can do anything  but more importantly  now we have a plan. Thank you. As a matter of fact  I was trying to think about my career since I left the White House  and the best example I have is a cartoon in The New Yorker a couple of years ago. This little boy is looking up at his father  and he says   Daddy  when I grow up  I want to be a former president.  Well  I have had a great blessing as a former president  because I have had an access that very few other people in the world have ever had to get to know so many people around this whole universe. Not only am I familiar with the    states in the United States  but also my wife and I have visited more than     countries in the world  and the Carter Center has had full time programs in    nations on Earth. And a lot of times  when we go into a country  we not only the meet the king or the president  but we also meet the villagers who live in the most remote areas of Africa. So our overall commitment at the Carter Center is to promote human rights  and knowing the world as I do  I can tell you without any equivocation that the number one abuse of human rights on Earth is  strangely  not addressed quite often  is the abuse of women and girls. There are a couple of reasons for this that I'll mention to begin with. First of all is the misinterpretation of religious scriptures  holy scriptures  in the Bible  Old Testament  New Testament  Quran and so forth  and these have been misinterpreted by men who are now in the ascendant positions in the synagogues and the churches and in the mosques. And they interpret these rules to make sure that women are ordinarily relegated to a secondary position compared to men in the eyes of God. This is a very serious problem. It's ordinarily not addressed. A number of years ago  in the year       I had been a Baptist  a Southern Baptist for    years    I tell you  I still teach Sunday school every Sunday  I'll be teaching this Sunday as well    but the Southern Baptist Convention in the year      decided that women should play a secondary position  a subservient position to men. So they issued an edict  in effect  that prevents women from being priests  pastors  deacons in the church  or chaplains in the military  and if a woman teaches a classroom in a Southern Baptist seminary  they cannot teach if a boy is in the room  because you can find verses in the Bible  there's over        verses in the Bible  that say that a woman shouldn't teach a man  and so forth. But the basic thing is the scriptures are misinterpreted to keep men in an ascendant position. That is an all pervasive problem  because men can exert that power and if an abusive husband or an employer  for instance  wants to cheat women  they can say that if women are not equal in the eyes of God  why should I treat them as equals myself  Why should I pay them equal pay for doing the same kind of work  The other very serious blight that causes this problem is the excessive resort to violence  and that is increasing tremendously around the world. In the United States of America  for instance  we have had an enormous increase in abuse of poor people  mostly black people and minorities  by putting them in prison. When I was in office as governor of Georgia  one out of every       Americans were in prison. Nowadays   .  people per       are in prison. That's a sevenfold increase. And since I left the White House  there's been an     percent increase in the number of women who are black who are in prison. We also have  one of the only countries  on Earth that still has the death penalty that is a developed country. And we rank right alongside the countries that are most abusive in all elements of human rights in encouraging the death penalty. We're in California now  and I figured out the other day that California has spent four billion dollars in convicting    people for the death penalty. If you add that up  that's     million dollars it costs California to send a person to be executed. Nebraska this week just passed a law abolishing the death penalty  because it costs so much.  Applause  So the resort to violence and abuse of poor people and helpless people is another cause of the increase in abuse of women. Let me just go down a very few abuses of women that concern me most  and I'll be fairly brief  because I have a limited amount of time  as you know. One is genital mutilation. Genital mutilation is horrible and not known by American women  but in some countries  many countries  when a child is born that's a girl  very soon in her life  her genitals are completely cut away by a so called cutter who has a razor blade and  in a non sterilized way  they remove the exterior parts of a woman's genitalia. And sometimes  in more extreme cases but not very rare cases  they sew the orifice up so the girl can just urinate or menstruate. And then later  when she gets married  the same cutter goes in and opens the orifice up so she can have sex. This is not a rare thing  although it's against the law in most countries. In Egypt  for instance     percent of all the females that live in Egypt today have been sexually mutilated in that way. In some countries  it's more than    percent of the women are cut that way before they reach maturity. This is a horrible affliction on all women that live in those countries. Another very serious thing is honor killings  where a family with misinterpretation  again  of a holy scripture    there's nothing in the Quran that mandates this    will execute a girl in their family if she is raped or if she marries a man that her father does not approve  or sometimes even if she wears inappropriate clothing. And this is done by members of her own family  so the family becomes murderers when the girl brings so called disgrace to the family. An analysis was done in Egypt not so long ago by the United Nations and it showed that    percent of these murders of a girl are perpetrated by the father  the uncle or the brother  but    percent of the murders are conducted by women. Another problem that we have in the world that relates to women particularly is slavery  or human trafficking it's called nowadays. There were about   .  million people sold from Africa into slavery in the New World back in the   th century and the   th century. There are    million people now living in slavery. The United States Department of State now has a mandate from Congress to give a report every year  and the State Department reports that         people are sold across international borders every year into slavery  and that    percent of those sold are women  into sexual slavery. In the United States right this moment         people are living in human bondage  or slavery. Atlanta  Georgia  where the Carter Center is located and where I teach at Emory University  they have between     and     women  people sold into slavery every month. It's the number one place in the nation because of that. Atlanta has the busiest airport in the world  and they also have a lot of passengers that come from the Southern Hemisphere. If a brothel owner wants to buy a girl that has brown or black skin  they can do it for       dollars. A white skinned girl brings several times more than that  and the average brothel owner in Atlanta and in the United States now can earn about         per slave. The sex trade in Atlanta  Georgia  exceeds the total drug trade in Atlanta  Georgia. So this is another very serious problem  and the basic problem is prostitution  because there's not a whorehouse in America that's not known by the local officials  the local policemen  or the chief of police or the mayor and so forth. And this leads to one of the worst problems  and that is that women are bought increasingly and put into sexual slavery in all countries in the world. Sweden has got a good approach to it. About    to    years ago  Sweden decided to change the law  and women are no longer prosecuted if they are in sexual slavery  but the brothel owners and the pimps and the male customers are prosecuted  and     Applause     prostitution has gone down. In the United States  we take just the opposite position. For every male arrested for illegal sex trade     women are arrested in the United States of America. Canada  Ireland  I've already said Sweden  France  and other countries are moving now towards this so called Swedish model. That's another thing that can be done. We have two great institutions in this country that all of us admire  our military and our great university system. In the military  they are now analyzing how many sexual assaults take place. The last report I got  there were        sexual assaults that took place in the military          . Only        not much more than   percent  are actually prosecuted  and the reason is that the commanding officer of any organization    a ship like my submarine  or a battalion in the Army or a company in the Marines    the commanding officer has the right under law to decide whether to prosecute a rapist or not  and of course  the last thing they want is for anybody to know that under their command  sexual assaults are taking place  so they do not do it. That law needs to be changed. About one out of four girls who enter American universities will be sexually assaulted before she graduates  and this is now getting a lot of publicity  partially because of my book  but other things  and so    universities in America are now condemned by the Department of Education under Title IX because the officials of the universities are not taking care of the women to protect them from sexual assault. The Department of Justice says that more than half of the rapes on a college campus take place by serial rapists  because outside of the university system  if they rape somebody  they'll be prosecuted  but when they get on a university campus  they can rape with impunity. They're not prosecuted. Those are the kinds of things that go on in our society. Another thing that's very serious about the abuse of women and girls is the lack of equal pay for equal work  as you know.  Applause  And this is sometimes misinterpreted  but for full time employment  a woman in the United States now gets    percent less than a man. When I became president  the difference was    percent. So we've made some progress  partially because I was president and so forth     Applause   Laughter     but in the last    years  there's been no progress made  so it's been just about    or    percent difference for the last    years. These are the kind of things that go on. If you take the Fortune     companies     of them have women CEOs  out of      and those CEOs  I need not tell you  make less on an average than the other CEOs. Well  that's what goes on in our country. Another problem with the United States is we are the most warlike nation on Earth. We have been to war with about    different countries since the Second World War. Sometimes  we've had soldiers on the ground fighting. The other times  we've been flying overhead dropping bombs on people. Other times  of course  now  we have drones that attack people and so forth. We've been at war with    different countries or more since the Second World War. There was four years  I won't say which ones  where we didn't    we didn't fire a bullet. But anyway  those kinds of things  the resort to violence and the misinterpretation of the holy scriptures are what causes  are the basic causes  of abuse of women and girls. There's one more basic cause that I need not mention  and that is that in general  men don't give a damn. The average man that might say  I'm against the abuse of women and girls quietly accepts the privileged position that we occupy  and this is very similar to what I knew when I was a child  when separate but equal had existed. Racial discrimination  legally  had existed for     years  from      at the end of the War Between the States  the Civil War  all the way up to the     s  when Lyndon Johnson got the bills passed for equal rights. But during that time  there were many white people that didn't think that racial discrimination was okay  but they stayed quiet  because they enjoyed the privileges of better jobs  unique access to jury duty  better schools  and everything else  and that's the same thing that exists today  because the average man really doesn't care. Even though they say   I'm against discrimination against girls and women   they enjoy a privileged position. And it's very difficult to get the majority of men who control the university system  the majority of men that control the military system  the majority of men that control the governments of the world  and the majority of men that control the great religions. So what is the basic thing that we need to do today  I would say the best thing that we could do today is for the women in the powerful nations like this one  and where you come from  Europe and so forth  who have influence and who have freedom to speak and to act  need to take the responsibility on yourselves to be more forceful in demanding an end to racial discrimination against girls and women all over the world. The average woman in Egypt doesn't have much to say about her daughters getting genitally mutilated and so forth. I didn't even go down to detail about that. But I hope that out of this conference  that every woman here  will get your husbands to realize that these abuses on the college campuses and the military and so forth and in the future job market  need to protect your daughters and your granddaughters. I have    grandchildren  four children  and    great grandchildren  and I think often about them and about the plight that they will face in America  not only if they lived in Egypt or a foreign country  in having equal rights  and I hope that all of you will join me in being a champion for women and girls around the world and protect their human rights. Thank you very much. A few years ago  my mom developed rheumatoid arthritis. Her wrists  knees and toes swelled up  causing crippling  chronic pain. She had to file for disability. She stopped attending our local mosque. Some mornings it was too painful for her to brush her teeth. I wanted to help. But I didn't know how. I'm not a doctor. So  what I am is a historian of medicine. So I started to research the history of chronic pain. Turns out  UCLA has an entire history of pain collection in their archives. And I found a story    a fantastic story    of a man who saved    rescued    millions of people from pain  people like my mom. Yet  I had never heard of him. There were no biographies of him  no Hollywood movies. His name was John J. Bonica. But when our story begins  he was better known as Johnny  Bull  Walker. It was a summer day in     . The circus had just arrived in the tiny town of Brookfield  New York. Spectators flocked to see the wire walkers  the tramp clowns    if they were lucky  the human cannonball. They also came to see the strongman  Johnny  Bull  Walker  a brawny bully who'd pin you for a dollar. You know  on that particular day  a voice rang out over the circus P.A. system. They needed a doctor urgently  in the live animal tent. Something had gone wrong with the lion tamer. The climax of his act had gone wrong  and his head was stuck inside the lion's mouth. He was running out of air  the crowd watched in horror as he struggled and then passed out. When the lion finally did relax its jaws  the lion tamer just slumped to the ground  motionless. When he came to a few minutes later  he saw a familiar figure hunched over him. It was Bull Walker. The strongman had given the lion tamer mouth to mouth  and saved his life. Now  the strongman hadn't told anyone  but he was actually a third year medical student. He toured with the circus during summers to pay tuition  but kept it a secret to protect his persona. He was supposed to be a brute  a villain    not a nerdy do gooder. His medical colleagues didn't know his secret  either. As he put it   If you were an athlete  you were a dumb dodo.  So he didn't tell them about the circus  or about how he wrestled professionally on evenings and weekends. He used a pseudonym like Bull Walker  or later  the Masked Marvel. He even kept it a secret that same year  when he was crowned the Light Heavyweight Champion of the world. Over the years  John J. Bonica lived these parallel lives. He was a wrestler  he was a doctor. He was a heel  he was a hero. He inflicted pain  and he treated it. And he didn t know it at the time  but over the next five decades  he'd draw on these dueling identities to forge a whole new way to think about pain. It'd change modern medicine so much so  that decades later  Time magazine would call him pain relief's founding father. But that all happened later. In       Bonica graduated medical school and married Emma  his sweetheart  whom he had met at one of his matches years before. He still wrestled in secret    he had to. His internship at New York's St. Vincent's Hospital paid nothing. With his championship belt  he wrestled in big ticket venues  like Madison Square Garden  against big time opponents  like Everett  The Blonde Bear  Marshall  or three time world champion  Angelo Savoldi. The matches took a toll on his body  he tore hip joints  fractured ribs. One night  The Terrible Turk's big toe scratched a scar like Capone's down the side of his face. The next morning at work  he had to wear a surgical mask to hide it. Twice Bonica showed up to the O.R. with one eye so bruised  he couldn't see out of it. But worst of all were his mangled cauliflower ears. He said they felt like two baseballs on the sides of his head. Pain just kept accumulating in his life. Next  he watched his wife go into labor at his hospital. She heaved and pushed  clearly in anguish. Her obstetrician called out to the intern on duty to give her a few drops of ether to ease her pain. But the intern was a young guy  just three weeks on the job    he was jittery  and in applying the ether  irritated Emma's throat. She vomited and choked  and started to turn blue. Bonica  who was watching all this  pushed the intern out of the way  cleared her airway  and saved his wife and his unborn daughter. At that moment  he decided to devote his life to anesthesiology. Later  he'd even go on to help develop the epidural  for delivering mothers. But before he could focus on obstetrics  Bonica had to report for basic training. Right around D Day  Bonica showed up to Madigan Army Medical Center  near Tacoma. At       beds  it was one of the largest army hospitals in America. Bonica was in charge of all pain control there. He was only   . Treating so many patients  Bonica started noticing cases that contradicted everything he had learned. Pain was supposed to be a kind of alarm bell    in a good way    a body's way of signaling an injury  like a broken arm. But in some cases  like after a patient had a leg amputated  that patient might still complain of pain in that nonexistent leg. But if the injury had been treated  why would the alarm bell keep ringing  There were other cases in which there was no evidence of an injury whatsoever  and yet  still the patient hurt. Bonica tracked down all the specialists at his hospital    surgeons  neurologists  psychiatrists  others. And he tried to get their opinions on his patients. It took too long  so he started organizing group meetings over lunch. It would be like a tag team of specialists going up against the patient's pain. No one had ever focused on pain this way before. After that  he hit the books. He read every medical textbook he could get his hands on  carefully noting every mention of the word  pain.  Out of the        pages he read  the word  pain  was on    and a half of them. Seventeen and a half. For the most basic  most common  most frustrating part of being a patient. Bonica was shocked    I'm quoting him  he said   What the hell kind of conclusion can you come to there  The most important thing from the patient's perspective  they don't talk about.  So over the next eight years  Bonica would talk about it. He'd write about it  he'd write those missing pages. He wrote what would later be known as the Bible of Pain. In it he proposed new strategies  new treatments using nerve block injections. He proposed a new institution  the Pain Clinic  based on those lunchtime meetings. But the most important thing about his book was that it was kind of an emotional alarm bell for medicine. A desperate plea to doctors to take pain seriously in patients' lives. He recast the very purpose of medicine. The goal wasn't to make patients better  it was to make patients feel better. He pushed his pain agenda for decades  before it finally took hold in the mid '  s. Hundreds of pain clinics sprung up all over the world. But as they did    a tragic twist. Bonica's years of wrestling caught up to him. He had been out of the ring for over    years  but those       professional bouts had left a mark on his body. Still in his mid   s  he suffered severe osteoarthritis. Over the next    years he'd have    surgeries  including four spine operations  and hip replacement after hip replacement. He could barely raise his arm  turn his neck. He needed aluminum crutches to walk. His friends and former students became his doctors. One recalled that he probably had more nerve block injections than anyone else on the planet. Already a workaholic  he worked even more        to    hour days. Healing others became more than just his job  it was his own most effective form of relief.  If I wasn't as busy as I am   he told a reporter at the time   I would be a completely disabled guy.  On a business trip to Florida in the early     s  Bonica got a former student to drive him to the Hyde Park area in Tampa. They drove past palm trees and pulled up to an old mansion  with giant silver howitzer cannons hidden in the garage. The house belonged to the Zacchini family  who were something like American circus royalty. Decades earlier  Bonica had watched them  clad in silver jumpsuits and goggles  doing the act they pioneered    the Human Cannonball. But now they were like him  retired. That generation is all dead now  including Bonica  so there's no way to know exactly what they said that day. But still  I love imagining it. The strongman and the human cannonballs reunited  showing off old scars  and new ones. Maybe Bonica gave them medical advice. Maybe he told them what he later said in an oral history  which is that his time in the circus and wrestling deeply molded his life. Bonica saw pain close up. He felt it. He lived it. And it made it impossible for him to ignore in others. Out of that empathy  he spun a whole new field  played a major role in getting medicine to acknowledge pain in and of itself. In that same oral history  Bonica claimed that pain is the most complex human experience. That it involves your past life  your current life  your interactions  your family. That was definitely true for Bonica. But it was also true for my mom. It's easy for doctors to see my mom as a kind of professional patient  a woman who just spends her days in waiting rooms. Sometimes I get stuck seeing her that same way. But as I saw Bonica's pain    a testament to his fully lived life    I started to remember all the things that my mom's pain holds. Before they got swollen and arthritic  my mom's fingers clacked away in the hospital H.R. department where she worked. They folded samosas for our entire mosque. When I was a kid  they cut my hair  wiped my nose  tied my shoes. Thank you. Every group of female friends has the funny one  the one you go to when you need a good cry  the one who tells you to suck it up when you've had a hard day. And this group was no different. Except that this was a community of groundbreaking women who came together    first to become teammates  then friends  and then family    in the least likely of places  on the Special Operations battlefield. This was a group of women whose friendship and valor was cemented not only by what they had seen and done at the tip of the spear  but by the fact that they were there at a time when women    officially  at least    remained banned from ground combat  and America had no idea they existed. This story begins with Special Operations leaders  some of the most tested men in the United States military  saying   We need women to help us wage this war.   America would never kill its way to the end of its wars   it argued.  Needed more knowledge and more understanding.  And as everyone knows  if you want to understand what's happening in a community and in a home  you talk to women  whether you're talking about Southern Afghanistan  or Southern California. But in this case  men could not talk to women  because in a conservative and traditional society like Afghanistan  that would cause grave offense. So you needed women soldiers out there. That meant  at this time in the war  that the women who would be recruited to serve alongside Army Rangers and Navy SEALs  would be seeing the kind of combat experienced by less than five percent of the entire United States military. Less than five percent. So the call went out.  Female soldiers  Become a part of history. Join Special Operations on the battlefield in Afghanistan.  This is in     . And from Alabama to Alaska  a group of women who had always wanted to do something that mattered alongside the best of the best  and to make a difference for their country  answered that call to serve. And for them it was not about politics  it was about serving with purpose. And so  the women who came to North Carolina to compete for a spot on these teams which would put women on the Special Operations front lines  landed and found very quickly a community  the likes of which they had never seen. Full of women who were as fierce and as fit as they were  and as driven to make a difference. They didn't have to apologize for who they were  and in fact  they could celebrate it. And what they found when they were there was that all of a sudden  there were lots of people like them. As one of them said   It was like you looked around and realized there was more than one giraffe at the zoo.  Among this team of standouts was Cassie  a young woman who managed to be an ROTC cadet  a sorority sister and a Women's Studies minor  all in one person. Tristan  a West Point track star  who always ran and road marched with no socks  and had shoes whose smell proved it. Amber  a Heidi look alike  who had always wanted to be in the infantry  and when she found out that women couldn't be  she decided to become an intel officer. She served in Bosnia  and later helped the FBI to bust drug gangs in Pennsylvania. And then there was Kate  who played high school football all four years  and actually wanted to drop out after the first  to go into the glee club  but when boys told her that girls couldn't play football  she decided to stay for all the little girls who would come after her. For them  biology had shaped part of their destiny  and put  as Cassie once said   everything noble out of reach for girls.  And yet  here was a chance to serve with the best of the best on a mission that mattered to their country  not despite the fact that they were female  but because of it. This team of women  in many ways  was like women everywhere. They wore makeup  and in fact  they would bond in the ladies' room over eyeliner and eye pencil. They also wore body armor. They would put    pounds of weight on their backs  and board the helicopter for an operation  and they would come back and watch a movie called  Bridesmaids.  They even wore a thing called Spanx  because  as they found very quickly  the uniforms made for men were big where they should be small  and small where they should be big. So Lane  an Iraq War veteran    you see her here on my left    decided she was going to go on Amazon and order a pair of Spanx to her base  so that her pants would fit better when she went out on mission each night. These women would get together over video conference from all around Afghanistan from their various bases  and they would talk about what it was like to be one of the only women doing what they were doing. They would swap jokes  they would talk about what was working  what wasn't  what they had learned to do well  what they needed to do better. And they would talk about some of the lighter moments of being women out on the Special Operations front lines  including the Shewee  which was a tool that let you pee like a guy  although it's said to have had only a    percent accuracy rate out there. These women lived in the  and.  They proved you could be fierce and you could be feminine. You could wear mascara and body armor. You could love CrossFit  and really like cross stitch. You could love to climb out of helicopters and you could also love to bake cookies. Women live in the and every single day  and these women brought that to this mission as well. On this life and death battlefield they never forgot that being female may have brought them to the front lines  but being a soldier is what would prove themselves there. There was the night Amber went out on mission  and in talking to the women of the house  realized that there was a barricaded shooter lying in wait for the Afghan and American forces who were waiting to enter the home. Another night it was Tristan who found out that there were pieces that make up explosives all around the house in which they were standing  and that in fact  explosives lay all the way between there and where they were about to head that night. There was the night another one of their teammates proved herself to a decidedly skeptical team of SEALs  when she found the intel item they were looking for wrapped up in a baby's wet diaper. And there was the night that Isabel  another one of their teammates  found the things that they were looking for  and received an Impact Award from the Rangers who said that without her  the things and the people they were looking for that night would never have been found. That night and so many others  they went out to prove themselves  not only for one another  but for everybody who would come after them. And also for the men alongside whom they served. We talk a lot about how behind every great man is a good woman. And in this case  next to these women stood men who wanted to see them succeed. The Army Ranger who trained them had served    deployments. And when they told him that he had to go train girls  he had no idea what to expect. But at the end of eight days with these women in the summer of       he told his fellow Ranger   We have just witnessed history. These may well be our own Tuskegee Airmen.  At the heart of this team was the one person who everyone called  the best of us.  She was a petite blonde dynamo  who barely reached five foot three. And she was this wild mix of Martha Stewart  and what we know as G.I. Jane. She was someone who loved to make dinner for her husband  her Kent State ROTC sweetheart who pushed her to be her best  and to trust herself  and to test every limit she could. She also loved to put    pounds of weight on her back and run for miles  and she loved to be a soldier. She was somebody who had a bread maker in her office in Kandahar  and would bake a batch of raisin bread  and then go to the gym and bust out    or    pull ups from a dead hang. She was the person who  if you needed an extra pair of boots or a home cooked dinner  would be on your speed dial. Because she never  ever would talk to you about how good she was  but let her character speak through action. She was famous for taking the hard right over the easy wrong. And she was also famous for walking up to a    foot rope  climbing it using only her arms  and then shuffling away and apologizing  because she knew she was supposed to use both her arms and her legs  as the Rangers had trained them. Some of our heroes return home to tell their stories. And some of them don't. And on October           First Lieutenant Ashley White was killed alongside two Rangers  Christopher Horns and Kristoffer Domeij. Her death threw this program built for the shadows into a very public spotlight. Because after all  the ban on women in combat was still very much in place. And at her funeral  the head of Army Special Operations came  and gave a public testimony not just to the courage of Ashley White  but to all her team of sisters.  Make no mistake about it   he said   these women are warriors  and they have written a new chapter in what it means to be a female in the United States Army.  Ashley's mom is a teacher's aide and a school bus driver  who bakes cookies on the side. She doesn't remember much about that overwhelming set of days  in which grief    enormous grief    mixed with pride. But she does remember one moment. A stranger with a child in her hand came up to her and she said   Mrs. White  I brought my daughter here today  because I wanted her to know what a hero was. And I wanted her to know that heroes could be women  too.  It is time to celebrate all the unsung heroines who reach into their guts and find the heart and the grit to keep going and to test every limit. This very unlikely band of sisters bound forever in life and afterward did indeed become part of history  and they paved the way for so many who would come after them  as much as they stood on the shoulders of those who had come before. These women showed that warriors come in all shapes and sizes. And women can be heroes  too. Thank you so much. My colleagues and I are fascinated by the science of moving dots. So what are these dots  Well  it's all of us. And we're moving in our homes  in our offices  as we shop and travel throughout our cities and around the world. And wouldn't it be great if we could understand all this movement  If we could find patterns and meaning and insight in it. And luckily for us  we live in a time where we're incredibly good at capturing information about ourselves. So whether it's through sensors or videos  or apps  we can track our movement with incredibly fine detail. So it turns out one of the places where we have the best data about movement is sports. So whether it's basketball or baseball  or football or the other football  we're instrumenting our stadiums and our players to track their movements every fraction of a second. So what we're doing is turning our athletes into    you probably guessed it    moving dots. So we've got mountains of moving dots and like most raw data  it's hard to deal with and not that interesting. But there are things that  for example  basketball coaches want to know. And the problem is they can't know them because they'd have to watch every second of every game  remember it and process it. And a person can't do that  but a machine can. The problem is a machine can't see the game with the eye of a coach. At least they couldn't until now. So what have we taught the machine to see  So  we started simply. We taught it things like passes  shots and rebounds. Things that most casual fans would know. And then we moved on to things slightly more complicated. Events like post ups  and pick and rolls  and isolations. And if you don't know them  that's okay. Most casual players probably do. Now  we've gotten to a point where today  the machine understands complex events like down screens and wide pins. Basically things only professionals know. So we have taught a machine to see with the eyes of a coach. So how have we been able to do this  If I asked a coach to describe something like a pick and roll  they would give me a description  and if I encoded that as an algorithm  it would be terrible. The pick and roll happens to be this dance in basketball between four players  two on offense and two on defense. And here's kind of how it goes. So there's the guy on offense without the ball the ball and he goes next to the guy guarding the guy with the ball  and he kind of stays there and they both move and stuff happens  and ta da  it's a pick and roll. So that is also an example of a terrible algorithm. So  if the player who's the interferer    he's called the screener    goes close by  but he doesn't stop  it's probably not a pick and roll. Or if he does stop  but he doesn't stop close enough  it's probably not a pick and roll. Or  if he does go close by and he does stop but they do it under the basket  it's probably not a pick and roll. Or I could be wrong  they could all be pick and rolls. It really depends on the exact timing  the distances  the locations  and that's what makes it hard. So  luckily  with machine learning  we can go beyond our own ability to describe the things we know. So how does this work  Well  it's by example. So we go to the machine and say   Good morning  machine. Here are some pick and rolls  and here are some things that are not. Please find a way to tell the difference.  And the key to all of this is to find features that enable it to separate. So if I was going to teach it the difference between an apple and orange  I might say   Why don't you use color or shape   And the problem that we're solving is  what are those things  What are the key features that let a computer navigate the world of moving dots  So figuring out all these relationships with relative and absolute location  distance  timing  velocities    that's really the key to the science of moving dots  or as we like to call it  spatiotemporal pattern recognition  in academic vernacular. Because the first thing is  you have to make it sound hard    because it is. The key thing is  for NBA coaches  it's not that they want to know whether a pick and roll happened or not. It's that they want to know how it happened. And why is it so important to them  So here's a little insight. It turns out in modern basketball  this pick and roll is perhaps the most important play. And knowing how to run it  and knowing how to defend it  is basically a key to winning and losing most games. So it turns out that this dance has a great many variations and identifying the variations is really the thing that matters  and that's why we need this to be really  really good. So  here's an example. There are two offensive and two defensive players  getting ready to do the pick and roll dance. So the guy with ball can either take  or he can reject. His teammate can either roll or pop. The guy guarding the ball can either go over or under. His teammate can either show or play up to touch  or play soft and together they can either switch or blitz and I didn't know most of these things when I started and it would be lovely if everybody moved according to those arrows. It would make our lives a lot easier  but it turns out movement is very messy. People wiggle a lot and getting these variations identified with very high accuracy  both in precision and recall  is tough because that's what it takes to get a professional coach to believe in you. And despite all the difficulties with the right spatiotemporal features we have been able to do that. Coaches trust our ability of our machine to identify these variations. We're at the point where almost every single contender for an NBA championship this year is using our software  which is built on a machine that understands the moving dots of basketball. So not only that  we have given advice that has changed strategies that have helped teams win very important games  and it's very exciting because you have coaches who've been in the league for    years that are willing to take advice from a machine. And it's very exciting  it's much more than the pick and roll. Our computer started out with simple things and learned more and more complex things and now it knows so many things. Frankly  I don't understand much of what it does  and while it's not that special to be smarter than me  we were wondering  can a machine know more than a coach  Can it know more than person could know  And it turns out the answer is yes. The coaches want players to take good shots. So if I'm standing near the basket and there's nobody near me  it's a good shot. If I'm standing far away surrounded by defenders  that's generally a bad shot. But we never knew how good  good  was  or how bad  bad  was quantitatively. Until now. So what we can do  again  using spatiotemporal features  we looked at every shot. We can see  Where is the shot  What's the angle to the basket  Where are the defenders standing  What are their distances  What are their angles  For multiple defenders  we can look at how the player's moving and predict the shot type. We can look at all their velocities and we can build a model that predicts what is the likelihood that this shot would go in under these circumstances  So why is this important  We can take something that was shooting  which was one thing before  and turn it into two things  the quality of the shot and the quality of the shooter. So here's a bubble chart  because what's TED without a bubble chart  Those are NBA players. The size is the size of the player and the color is the position. On the x axis  we have the shot probability. People on the left take difficult shots  on the right  they take easy shots. On the  y axis  is their shooting ability. People who are good are at the top  bad at the bottom. So for example  if there was a player who generally made    percent of their shots  that's all you knew before. But today  I can tell you that player takes shots that an average NBA player would make    percent of the time  and they are two percent worse. And the reason that's important is that there are lots of   s out there. And so it's really important to know if the    that you're considering giving     million dollars to is a good shooter who takes bad shots or a bad shooter who takes good shots. Machine understanding doesn't just change how we look at players  it changes how we look at the game. So there was this very exciting game a couple of years ago  in the NBA finals. Miami was down by three  there was    seconds left. They were about to lose the championship. A gentleman named LeBron James came up and he took a three to tie. He missed. His teammate Chris Bosh got a rebound  passed it to another teammate named Ray Allen. He sank a three. It went into overtime. They won the game. They won the championship. It was one of the most exciting games in basketball. And our ability to know the shot probability for every player at every second  and the likelihood of them getting a rebound at every second can illuminate this moment in a way that we never could before. Now unfortunately  I can't show you that video. But for you  we recreated that moment at our weekly basketball game about   weeks ago. And we recreated the tracking that led to the insights. So  here is us. This is Chinatown in Los Angeles  a park we play at every week  and that's us recreating the Ray Allen moment and all the tracking that's associated with it. So  here's the shot. I'm going to show you that moment and all the insights of that moment. The only difference is  instead of the professional players  it's us  and instead of a professional announcer  it's me. So  bear with me. Miami. Down three. Twenty seconds left. Jeff brings up the ball. Josh catches  puts up a three   Calculating shot probability   Shot quality   Rebound probability  Won't go   Rebound probability  Rebound  Noel. Back to Daria.  Shot quality  Her three pointer    bang  Tie game with five seconds left. The crowd goes wild. That's roughly how it happened. Roughly. That moment had about a nine percent chance of happening in the NBA and we know that and a great many other things. I'm not going to tell you how many times it took us to make that happen. Okay  I will  It was four. Way to go  Daria. But the important thing about that video and the insights we have for every second of every NBA game    it's not that. It's the fact you don't have to be a professional team to track movement. You do not have to be a professional player to get insights about movement. In fact  it doesn't even have to be about sports because we're moving everywhere. We're moving in our homes  in our offices  as we shop and we travel throughout our cities and around our world. What will we know  What will we learn  Perhaps  instead of identifying pick and rolls  a machine can identify the moment and let me know when my daughter takes her first steps. Which could literally be happening any second now. Perhaps we can learn to better use our buildings  better plan our cities. I believe that with the development of the science of moving dots  we will move better  we will move smarter  we will move forward. Thank you very much. I'll begin today by sharing a poem written by my friend from Malawi  Eileen Piri. Eileen is only    years old  but when we were going through the collection of poetry that we wrote  I found her poem so interesting  so motivating. So I'll read it to you. She entitled her poem  I'll Marry When I Want.   I'll marry when I want. My mother can't force me to marry. My father cannot force me to marry. My uncle  my aunt  my brother or sister  cannot force me to marry. No one in the world can force me to marry. I'll marry when I want. Even if you beat me  even if you chase me away  even if you do anything bad to me  I'll marry when I want. I'll marry when I want  but not before I am well educated  and not before I am all grown up. I'll marry when I want.  This poem might seem odd  written by a    year old girl  but where I and Eileen come from  this poem  which I have just read to you  is a warrior's cry. I am from Malawi. Malawi is one of the poorest countries  very poor  where gender equality is questionable. Growing up in that country  I couldn't make my own choices in life. I couldn't even explore personal opportunities in life. I will tell you a story of two different girls  two beautiful girls. These girls grew up under the same roof. They were eating the same food. Sometimes  they would share clothes  and even shoes. But their lives ended up differently  in two different paths. The other girl is my little sister. My little sister was only    years old when she got pregnant. It's a hurtful thing. Not only did it hurt her  even me. I was going through a hard time as well. As it is in my culture  once you reach puberty stage  you are supposed to go to initiation camps. In these initiation camps  you are taught how to sexually please a man. There is this special day  which they call  Very Special Day  where a man who is hired by the community comes to the camp and sleeps with the little girls. Imagine the trauma that these young girls go through every day. Most girls end up pregnant. They even contract HIV and AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. For my little sister  she ended up being pregnant. Today  she's only    years old and she has three children. Her first marriage did not survive  nor did her second marriage. On the other side  there is this girl. She's amazing. I call her amazing because she is. She's very fabulous. That girl is me.  Laughter  When I was    years old  I was told  you are grown up  you have now reached of age  you're supposed to go to the initiation camp. I was like   What  I'm not going to go to the initiation camps.  You know what the women said to me   You are a stupid girl. Stubborn. You do not respect the traditions of our society  of our community.  I said no because I knew where I was going. I knew what I wanted in life. I had a lot of dreams as a young girl. I wanted to get well educated  to find a decent job in the future. I was imagining myself as a lawyer  seated on that big chair. Those were the imaginations that were going through my mind every day. And I knew that one day  I would contribute something  a little something to my community. But every day after refusing  women would tell me   Look at you  you're all grown up. Your little sister has a baby. What about you   That was the music that I was hearing every day  and that is the music that girls hear every day when they don't do something that the community needs them to do. When I compared the two stories between me and my sister  I said   Why can't I do something  Why can't I change something that has happened for a long time in our community   That was when I called other girls just like my sister  who have children  who have been in class but they have forgotten how to read and write. I said   Come on  we can  remind each other how to read and write again  how to hold the pen  how to read  to hold the book.  It was a great time I had with them. Nor did I just learn a little about them  but they were able to tell me their personal stories  what they were facing every day as young mothers. That was when I was like  'Why can't we take all these things that are happening to us and present them and tell our mothers  our traditional leaders  that these are the wrong things   It was a scary thing to do  because these traditional leaders  they are already accustomed to the things that have been there for ages. A hard thing to change  but a good thing to try. So we tried. It was very hard  but we pushed. And I'm here to say that in my community  it was the first community after girls pushed so hard to our traditional leader  and our leader stood up for us and said no girl has to be married before the age of   . In my community  that was the first time a community  they had to call the bylaws  the first bylaw that protected girls in our community. We did not stop there. We forged ahead. We were determined to fight for girls not just in my community  but even in other communities. When the child marriage bill was being presented in February  we were there at the Parliament house. Every day  when the members of Parliament were entering  we were telling them   Would you please support the bill   And we don't have much technology like here  but we have our small phones. So we said   Why can't we get  their numbers and text them   So we did that. It was a good thing. So when the bill passed  we texted them back   Thank you for supporting the bill.  And when the bill was signed by the president  making it into law  it was a plus. Now  in Malawi     is the legal marriage age  from    to   . It's a good thing to know that the bill passed  but let me tell you this  There are countries where    is the legal marriage age  but don't we hear cries of women and girls every day  Every day  girls' lives are being wasted away. This is high time for leaders to honor their commitment. In honoring this commitment  it means keeping girls' issues at heart every time. We don't have to be subjected as second  but they have to know that women  as we are in this room  we are not just women  we are not just girls  we are extraordinary. We can do more. And another thing for Malawi  and not just Malawi but other countries  The laws which are there  you know how a law is not a law until it is enforced  The law which has just recently passed and the laws that in other countries have been there  they need to be publicized at the local level  at the community level  where girls' issues are very striking. Girls face issues  difficult issues  at the community level every day. So if these young girls know that there are laws that protect them  they will be able to stand up and defend themselves because they will know that there is a law that protects them. And another thing I would say is that girls' voices and women's voices are beautiful  they are there  but we cannot do this alone. Male advocates  they have to jump in  to step in and work together. It's a collective work. What we need is what girls elsewhere need  good education  and above all  not to marry whilst   . And furthermore  I know that together  we can transform the legal  the cultural and political framework that denies girls of their rights. I am standing here today and declaring that we can end child marriage in a generation. This is the moment where a girl and a girl  and millions of girls worldwide  will be able to say   I will marry when I want.  Thank you.  Applause  This summer I was back in Ohio for a family wedding  and when I was there  there was a meet and greet with Anna and Elsa from  Frozen.  Not the Anna and Elsa from  Frozen   as this was not a Disney sanctioned event. These two entrepreneurs had a business of running princess parties. Your kid is turning five  They'll come sing some songs  sprinkle some fairy dust  it's great. And they were not about to miss out on the opportunity that was the phenomenon and that was  Frozen.  So they get hired by a local toy store  kids come in on a Saturday morning  buy some Disney swag  get their picture taken with the princesses  call it a day. It's like Santa Claus without the seasonal restrictions. And my three and a half year old niece Samantha was in the thick of it. She could care less that these two women were signing posters and coloring books as Snow Queen and Princess Ana with one N to avoid copyright lawsuits. According to my niece and the     plus kids in the parking lot that day  this was the Anna and Elsa from  Frozen.  It is a blazing hot Saturday morning in August in Ohio. We get there at    o'clock  the scheduled start time  and we are handed number   . By    o'clock they had called numbers    through     this was going to be a while  and there is no amount of free face painting or temporary tattoos that could prevent the meltdowns that were occurring outside of the store. So  by       we get called      to     please.  And as we walk in  it is a scene I can only describe you as saying it looked like Norway threw up. There were cardboard cut out snowflakes covering the floor  glitter on every flat surface  and icicles all over the walls. And as we stood in line in an attempt to give my niece a better vantage point than the backside of the mother of number     I put her up on my shoulders  and she was instantly riveted by the sight of the princesses. And as we moved forward  her excitement only grew  and as we finally got to the front of the line  and number    unfurled her poster to be signed by the princesses  I could literally feel the excitement running through her body. And let's be honest  at that point  I was pretty excited too. I mean  the Scandinavian decadence was mesmerizing. So we get to the front of the line  and the haggard clerk turns to my niece and says   Hi  honey. You're next  Do you want to get down  or you're going to stay on your dad's shoulders for the picture ' And I was  for a lack of a better word  frozen. It's amazing that in an unexpected instant we are faced with the question  who am I  Am I an aunt  Or am I an advocate  Millions of people have seen my video about how to have a hard conversation  and there one was  right in front of me. At the same time  there's nothing more important to me than the kids in my life  so I found myself in a situation that we so often find ourselves in  torn between two things  two impossible choices. Would I be an advocate  Would I take my niece off my shoulders and turn to the clerk and explain to her that I was in fact her aunt  not her father  and that she should be more careful and not to jump to gender conclusions based on haircuts and shoulder rides    and while doing that  miss out on what was  to this point  the greatest moment of my niece's life. Or would I be an aunt  Would I brush off that comment  take a million pictures  and not be distracted for an instant from the pure joy of that moment  and by doing that  walk out with the shame that comes up for not standing up for myself  especially in front of my niece. Who was I  Which one was more important  Which role was more worth it  Was I an aunt  Or was I an advocate  And I had a split second to decide. We are taught right now that we are living in a world of constant and increasing polarity. It's so black and white  so us and them  so right and wrong. There is no middle  there is no gray  just polarity. Polarity is a state in which two ideas or opinions are completely opposite from each other  a diametrical opposition. Which side are you on  Are you unequivocally and without question antiwar  pro choice  anti death penalty  pro gun regulation  proponent of open borders and pro union  Or  are you absolutely  and uncompromisingly pro war  pro life  pro death penalty  a believer that the Second Amendment is absolute  anti immigrant and pro business  It's all or none  you're with us or against us. That is polarity. The problem with polarity  and absolutes is that it eliminates the individuality of our human experience and that makes it contradictory to our human nature. But if we are pulled in these two directions  but it's not really where we exist    polarity is not our actual reality    where do we go from there  What's at the other end of that spectrum  I don't think it's an unattainable  harmonious utopia  I think the opposite of polarity is duality. Duality is a state of having two parts  but not in diametrical opposition  in simultaneous existence. Don't think it's possible  Here are the people I know  I know Catholics who are pro choice  and feminists who wear hijabs  and veterans who are antiwar  and NRA members who think I should be able to get married. Those are the people I know  those are my friends and family  that is the majority of our society  that is you  that is me. Duality is the ability to hold both things. But the question is  Can we own our duality  Can we have the courage to hold both things  I work at a restaurant in town  I became really good friends with the busser. I was a server and we had  a great relationship  we had a really great time together. Her Spanish was great because she was from Mexico. That line actually went the other way. Her English was limited  but significantly better than my Spanish. But we were united by our similarities  not separated by our differences. And we were close  even though we came from very different worlds. She was from Mexico  she left her family behind so she could come here and afford them a better life back home. She was a devout conservative Catholic  a believer in traditional family values  stereotypical roles of men and women  and I was  well  me. But the things that bonded us were when she asked about my girlfriend  or she shared pictures that she had from her family back home. Those were the things that brought us together. So one day  we were in the back  scarfing down food as quickly as we could  gathered around a small table  during a very rare lull  and a new guy from the kitchen came over    who happened to be her cousin    and sat down with all the bravado and machismo that his    year old body could hold. And he said to her   in Spanish   Does Ash have a boyfriend   And she said   in Spanish   No  she has a girlfriend.  And he said   in Spanish   A girlfriend     And she set down her fork  and locked eyes with him  and said   in Spanish   Yes  a girlfriend. That is all.  And his smug smile quickly dropped to one of maternal respect  grabbed his plate  walked off  went back to work. She never made eye contact with me. She left  did the same thing    it was a    second conversation  such a short interaction. And on paper  she had so much more in common with him  language  culture  history  family  her community was her lifeline here  but her moral compass trumped all of that. And a little bit later  they were joking around in the kitchen in Spanish  that had nothing to do with me  and that is duality. She didn't have to choose some P.C. stance on gayness over her heritage. She didn't have to choose her family over our friendship. It wasn't Jesus or Ash. Her individual morality was so strongly rooted that she had the courage to hold both things. Our moral integrity is our responsibility and we must be prepared to defend it even when it's not convenient. That's what it means to be an ally  and if you're going to be an ally  you have to be an active ally  Ask questions  act when you hear something inappropriate  actually engage. I had a family friend who for years used to call my girlfriend my lover. Really  Lover  So overly sexual  so '  s gay porn. But she was trying  and she asked. She could have called her my friend  or my  friend   or my  special friend     or even worse  just not asked at all. Believe me  we would rather have you ask. I would rather have her say lover  than say nothing at all. People often say to me   Well  Ash  I don't care. I don't see race or religion or sexuality. It doesn't matter to me. I don't see it.  But I think the opposite of homophobia and racism and xenophobia is not love  it's apathy. If you don't see my gayness  then you don't see me. If it doesn't matter to you who I sleep with  then you cannot imagine what it feels like when I walk down the street late at night holding her hand  and approach a group of people and have to make the decision if I should hang on to it or if I should I drop it when all I want to do is squeeze it tighter. And the small victory I feel when I make it by and don't have to let go. And the incredible cowardice and disappointment I feel when I drop it. If you do not see that struggle that is unique to my human experience because I am gay  then you don't see me. If you are going to be an ally  I need you to see me. As individuals  as allies  as humans  we need to be able to hold both things  both the good and the bad  the easy and the hard. You don't learn how to hold two things just from the fluff  you learn it from the grit. And what if duality is just the first step  What if through compassion and empathy and human interaction we are able to learn to hold two things  And if we can hold two things  we can hold four  and if we can hold four  we can hold eight  and if we can hold eight  we can hold hundreds. We are complex individuals  swirls of contradiction. You are all holding so many things right now. What can you do to hold just a few more  So  back to Toledo  Ohio. I'm at the front of the line  niece on my shoulders  the frazzled clerk calls me Dad. Have you ever been mistaken for the wrong gender  Not even that. Have you ever been called something you are not  Here's what it feels like for me  I am instantly an internal storm of contrasting emotions. I break out into a sweat that is a combination of rage and humiliation  I feel like the entire store is staring at me  and I simultaneously feel invisible. I want to explode in a tirade of fury  and I want to crawl under a rock. And top all of that off with the frustration that I'm wearing an out of character tight fitting purple t shirt  so this whole store can see my boobs  to make sure this exact same thing doesn't happen. But  despite my best efforts to be seen as the gender I am  it still happens. And I hope with every ounce of my body that no one heard    not my sister  not my girlfriend  and certainly not my niece. I am accustomed to this familiar hurt  but I will do whatever I need to do to protect the people I love from it. But then I take my niece off my shoulders  and she runs to Elsa and Anna    the thing she's been waiting so long for    and all that stuff goes away. All that matters is the smile on her face. And as the    seconds we waited two and a half hours for comes to a close we gather up our things  and I lock eyes with the clerk again  and she gives me an apologetic smile and mouths   I am so sorry   And her humanity  her willingness to admit her mistake disarms me immediately  then I give her a   It's okay  it happens. But thanks.  And I realize in that moment that I don't have to be either an aunt or an advocate  I can be both. I can live in duality  and I can hold two things. And if I can hold two things in that environment  I can hold so many more things. As my girlfriend and my niece hold hands and skip out the front of the door  I turn to my sister and say   Was it worth it   And she said   Are you kidding me  Did you see the look on her face  This was the greatest day of her life    It was worth the two and a half hours in the heat  it was worth the overpriced coloring book that we already had a copy of.   It was even worth you  getting called Dad.  And for the first time ever in my life  it actually was. Thank you  Boulder. Have a good night. About    years ago  I went through a little bit of a hard time. So I decided to go see a therapist. I had been seeing her for a few months  when she looked at me one day and said   Who actually raised you until you were three   Seemed like a weird question. I said   My parents.  And she said   I don't think that's actually the case  because if it were  we'd be dealing with things that are far more complicated than just this.  It sounded like the setup to a joke  but I knew she was serious. Because when I first started seeing her  I was trying to be the funniest person in the room. And I would try and crack these jokes  but she caught on to me really quickly  and whenever I tried to make a joke  she would look at me and say   That is actually really sad.  It's terrible. So I knew I had to be serious  and I asked my parents who had actually raised me until I was three  And to my surprise  they said my primary caregiver had been a distant relative of the family. I had called her my auntie. I remember my auntie so clearly  it felt like she had been part of my life when I was much older. I remember the thick  straight hair  and how it would come around me like a curtain when she bent to pick me up  her soft  southern Thai accent  the way I would cling to her  even if she just wanted to go to the bathroom or get something to eat. I loved her  but  with  the ferocity that a child has sometimes before she understands that love also requires letting go. But my clearest and sharpest memory of my auntie  is also one of my first memories of life at all. I remember her being beaten and slapped by another member of my family. I remember screaming hysterically and wanting it to stop  as I did every single time it happened  for things as minor as wanting to go out with her friends  or being a little late. I became so hysterical over her treatment  that eventually  she was just beaten behind closed doors. Things got so bad for her that eventually she ran away. As an adult  I learned later that she had been just    when she was brought over from Thailand to the States to care for me  on a tourist visa. She wound up working in Illinois for a time  before eventually returning to Thailand  which is where I ran into her again  at a political rally in Bangkok. I clung to her again  as I had when I was a child  and I let go  and then I promised that I would call. I never did  though. Because I was afraid if I said everything that she meant to me    that I owed perhaps the best parts of who I became to her care  and that the words  I'm sorry  were like a thimble to bail out all the guilt and shame and rage I felt over everything she had endured to care for me for as long as she had    I thought if I said those words to her  I would never stop crying again. Because she had saved me. And I had not saved her. I'm a journalist  and I've been writing and researching human trafficking for the past eight years or so  and even so  I never put together this personal story with my professional life until pretty recently. I think this profound disconnect actually symbolizes most of our understanding about human trafficking. Because human trafficking is far more prevalent  complex and close to home than most of us realize. I spent time in jails and brothels  interviewed hundreds of survivors and law enforcement  NGO workers. And when I think about what we've done about human trafficking  I am hugely disappointed. Partly because we don't even talk about the problem right at all. When I say  human trafficking   most of you probably don't think about someone like my auntie. You probably think about a young girl or woman  who's been brutally forced into prostitution by a violent pimp. That is real suffering  and that is a real story. That story makes me angry for far more than just the reality of that situation  though. As a journalist  I really care about how we relate to each other through language  and the way we tell that story  with all the gory  violent detail  the salacious aspects    I call that  look at her scars  journalism. We use that story to convince ourselves that human trafficking is a bad man doing a bad thing to an innocent girl. That story lets us off the hook. It takes away all the societal context that we might be indicted for  for the structural inequality  or the poverty  or the barriers to migration. We let ourselves think that human trafficking is only about forced prostitution  when in reality  human trafficking is embedded in our everyday lives. Let me show you what I mean. Forced prostitution accounts for    percent of human trafficking. Ten percent is in state  imposed forced labor. but a whopping    percent is for the purpose of creating the goods and delivering the services that most of us rely on every day  in sectors like agricultural work  domestic work and construction. That is food and care and shelter. And somehow  these most essential workers are also among the world's most underpaid and exploited today. Human trafficking is the use of force  fraud or coercion to compel another person's labor. And it's found in cotton fields  and coltan mines  and even car washes in Norway and England. It's found in U.S. military bases in Iraq and Afghanistan. It's found in Thailand's fishing industry. That country has become the largest exporter of shrimp in the world. But what are the circumstances behind all that cheap and plentiful shrimp  Thai military were caught selling Burmese and Cambodian migrants onto fishing boats. Those fishing boats were taken out  the men put to work  and they were thrown overboard if they made the mistake of falling sick  or trying to resist their treatment. Those fish were then used to feed shrimp  The shrimp were then sold to four major global retailers  Costco  Tesco  Walmart and Carrefour. Human trafficking is found on a smaller scale than just that  and in places you would never even imagine. Traffickers have forced young people to drive ice cream trucks  or to sing in touring boys' choirs. Trafficking has even been found in a hair braiding salon in New Jersey. The scheme in that case was incredible. The traffickers found young families who were from Ghana and Togo  and they told these families that  your daughters are going to get a fine education in the United States.  They then located winners of the green card lottery  and they told them   We'll help you out. We'll get you a plane ticket. We'll pay your fees. All you have to do is take this young girl with you  say that she's your sister or your spouse. Once everyone arrived in New Jersey  the young girls were taken away  and put to work for    hour days  seven days a week  for five years. They made their traffickers nearly four million dollars. This is a huge problem. So what have we done about it  We've mostly turned to the criminal justice system. But keep in mind  most victims of human trafficking are poor and marginalized. They're migrants  people of color. Sometimes they're in the sex trade. And for populations like these  the criminal justice system is too often part of the problem  rather than the solution. In study after study  in countries ranging from Bangladesh to the United States  between    and    percent of the people in the sex trade who were surveyed said that they had been raped or assaulted by the police in the past year alone. People in prostitution  including people who have been trafficked into it  regularly receive multiple convictions for prostitution. Having that criminal record makes it so much more difficult to leave poverty  leave abuse  or leave prostitution  if that person so desires. Workers outside of the sex sector    if they try and resist their treatment  they risk deportation. In case after case I've studied  employers have no problem calling on law enforcement to try and threaten or deport their striking trafficked workers. If those workers run away  they risk becoming part of the great mass of undocumented workers who are also subject to the whims of law enforcement if they're caught. Law enforcement is supposed to identify victims and prosecute traffickers. But out of an estimated    million victims of human trafficking in the world  they have helped and identified fewer than        people. That's like comparing the population of the world to the population of Los Angeles  proportionally speaking. As for convictions  out of an estimated       convictions in       fewer than     were for labor trafficking. Keep in mind that labor trafficking accounts for    percent of all trafficking  but fewer than    percent of the convictions. I've heard one expert say that trafficking happens where need meets greed. I'd like to add one more element to that. Trafficking happens in sectors where workers are excluded from protections  and denied the right to organize. Trafficking doesn't happen in a vacuum. It happens in systematically degraded work environments. You might be thinking  oh  she's talking about failed states  or war torn states  or    I'm actually talking about the United States. Let me tell you what that looks like. I spent many months researching a trafficking case called Global Horizons  involving hundreds of Thai farm workers. They were sent all over the States  to work in Hawaii pineapple plantations  and Washington apple orchards  and anywhere the work was needed. They were promised three years of solid agricultural work. So they made a calculated risk. They sold their land  they sold their wives' jewelry  to make thousands in recruitment fees for this company  Global Horizons. But once they were brought over  their passports were confiscated. Some of the men were beaten and held at gunpoint. They worked so hard they fainted in the fields. This case hit me so hard. After I came back home  I was wandering through the grocery store  and I froze in the produce department. I was remembering the over the top meals the Global Horizons survivors would make for me every time I showed up to interview them. They finished one meal with this plate of perfect  long stemmed strawberries  and as they handed them to me  they said   Aren't these the kind of strawberries you eat with somebody special in the States  And don't they taste so much better when you know the people whose hands picked them for you   As I stood in that grocery store weeks later  I realized I had no idea of who to thank for this plenty  and no idea of how they were being treated. So  like the journalist I am  I started digging into the agricultural sector. And I found there are too many fields  and too few labor inspectors. I found multiple layers of plausible deniability between grower and distributor and processor  and God knows who else. The Global Horizons survivors had been brought to the States on a temporary guest worker program. That guest worker program ties a person's legal status to his or her employer  and denies that worker the right to organize. Mind you  none of what I am describing about this agricultural sector or the guest worker program is actually human trafficking. It is merely what we find legally tolerable. And I would argue this is fertile ground for exploitation. And all of this had been hidden to me  before I had tried to understand it. I wasn't the only person grappling with these issues. Pierre Omidyar  founder of eBay  is one of the biggest anti trafficking philanthropists in the world. And even he wound up accidentally investing nearly    million dollars in the pineapple plantation cited as having the worst working conditions in that Global Horizons case. When he found out  he and his wife were shocked and horrified  and they wound up writing an op ed for a newspaper  saying that it was up to all of us to learn everything we can about the labor and supply chains of the products that we support. I totally agree. What would happen if each one of us decided that we are no longer going to support companies if they don't eliminate exploitation from their labor and supply chains  If we demanded laws calling for the same  If all the CEOs out there decided that they were going to go through their businesses and say   no more   If we ended recruitment fees for migrant workers  If we decided that guest workers should have the right to organize without fear of retaliation  These would be decisions heard around the world. This isn't a matter of buying a fair trade peach and calling it a day  buying a guilt free zone with your money. That's not how it works. This is the decision to change a system that is broken  and that we have unwittingly but willingly allowed ourselves to profit from and benefit from for too long. We often dwell on human trafficking survivors' victimization. But that is not my experience of them. Over all the years that I've been talking to them  they have taught me that we are more than our worst days. Each one of us is more than what we have lived through. Especially trafficking survivors. These people were the most resourceful and resilient and responsible in their communities. They were the people that you would take a gamble on. You'd say  I'm gong to sell my rings  because I have the chance to send you off to a better future. They were the emissaries of hope. These survivors don't need saving. They need solidarity  because they're behind some of the most exciting social justice movements out there today. The nannies and housekeepers who marched with their families and their employers' families    their activism got us an international treaty on domestic workers' rights. The Nepali women who were trafficked into the sex trade    they came together  and they decided that they were going to make the world's first anti trafficking organization actually headed and run by trafficking survivors themselves. These Indian shipyard workers were trafficked to do post Hurricane Katrina reconstruction. They were threatened with deportation  but they broke out of their work compound and they marched from New Orleans to Washington  D.C.  to protest labor exploitation. They cofounded an organization called the National Guest Worker Alliance  and through this organization  they have wound up helping other workers bring to light exploitation and abuses in supply chains in Walmart and Hershey's factories. And although the Department of Justice declined to take their case  a team of civil rights lawyers won the first of a dozen civil suits this February  and got their clients    million dollars. These survivors are fighting for people they don't even know yet  other workers  and for the possibility of a just world for all of us. This is our chance to do the same. This is our chance to make the decision that tells us who we are  as a people and as a society  that our prosperity is no longer prosperity  as long as it is pinned to other people's pain  that our lives are inextricably woven together  and that we have the power to make a different choice. I was so reluctant to share my story of my auntie with you. Before I started this TED process and climbed up on this stage  I had told literally a handful of people about it  because  like many a journalist  I am far more interested in learning about your stories than sharing much  if anything  about my own. I also haven't done my journalistic due diligence on this. I haven't issued my mountains of document requests  and interviewed everyone and their mother  and I haven't found my auntie yet. I don't know her story of what happened  and of her life now. The story as I've told it to you is messy and unfinished. But I think it mirrors the messy and unfinished situation we're all in  when it comes to human trafficking. We are all implicated in this problem. But that means we are all also part of its solution. Figuring out how to build a more just world is our work to do  and our story to tell. So let us tell it the way we should have done  from the very beginning. Let us tell this story together. Thank you so much. It was the middle of summer and well past closing time in the downtown Berkeley bar where my friend Polly and I worked together as bartenders. Usually at the end of our shift we had a drink    but not that night.  I'm pregnant. Not sure what I'm going to do yet   I told Polly. Without hesitation  she replied   I've had an abortion.  Before Polly  no one had ever told me that she'd had an abortion. I'd graduated from college just a few months earlier and I was in a new relationship when I found out that I was pregnant. When I thought about my choices  I honestly did not know how to decide  what criteria I should use. How would I know what the right decision was  I worried that I would regret  an abortion later. Coming of age on the beaches of Southern California  I grew up in the middle of  our nation's abortion wars. I was born in a trailer on the third anniversary of Roe vs. Wade. Our community was surfing Christians. We cared about God  the less fortunate  and the ocean. Everyone was pro life. As a kid  the idea of abortion made me so sad that I knew if I ever got pregnant I could never have one. And then I did. It was a step towards the unknown. But Polly had given me a very special gift  the knowledge that I wasn't alone and the realization that abortion was something that we can talk about. Abortion is common. According to the Guttmacher Institute  one in three women in America will have an abortion in their lifetime. But for the last few decades  the dialogue around abortion in the United States has left little room for anything beyond  pro life and pro choice. It's political and polarizing. But as much as abortion is hotly debated  it's still rare for us  whether as fellow women or even just as fellow people  to talk with one another about the abortions that we have. There is a gap. Between what happens in politics and what happens in real life  and in that gap  a battlefield mentality. An  are you with us  or against us   stance takes root. This isn't just about abortion. There are so many important issues  that we can't talk about. And so finding ways to shift the conflict to a place of conversation is the work of my life. There are two main ways to get started. One way is to listen closely. And the other way is to share stories. So     years ago  I cofounded an organization called Exhale to start listening to people  who have had abortions. The first thing we did was create  a talk line  where women and men could call to get emotional support. Free of judgment and politics  believe it or not  nothing like our sevice had ever existed. We needed a new framework that could  hold all the experiences that we were hearing on our talk line. The feminist who regrets her abortion. The Catholic who is grateful for hers. The personal experiences that weren't  fitting neatly into one box or the other. We didn't think it was right  to ask women to pick a side. We wanted to show them that the whole world was on their side  as they were going through this deeply personal experience. So we invented  pro voice.  Beyond abortion  pro voice works on hard issues that we've struggled with globally for years  issues like immigration  religious tolerance  violence against women. It also works on deeply personal topics  that might only matter to you and your immediate family and friends. They have a terminal illness   their mother just died  they have a child with special needs and they can't talk about it. Listening and storytelling are the hallmarks of pro voice practice. Listening and storytelling. That sounds pretty nice. Sounds maybe  easy  We could all do that. It's not easy. It's very hard. Pro voice is hard because we are talking about things everyone's fighting about or the things that no one  wants to talk about. I wish I could tell you that when you  decide to be pro voice  that you'll find beautiful moments of breakthrough  and gardens full of flowers  where listening and storytelling creates wonderful  a ha  moments. I wish I could tell you that there would be a feminist welcoming party for you  or that there's a long lost sisterhood of people who are just ready to have your back when you get slammed. But it can be vulnerable and exhausting  to tell our own stories when it feels like nobody cares. And if we truly listen to one another  we will hear things that demand that we shift our own perceptions. There is no perfect time and there is no perfect place to start a difficult conversation. There's never a time when everyone will be on the same page  share the same lens  or know the same history. So  let's talk about listening and how to be a good listener. There's lots of ways to be a good listener and I'm going to give you just a couple. One is to ask open ended questions. You can ask yourself or someone  that you know   How are you feeling    What was that like    What do you hope for  now   Another way to be a good listener  is to use reflective language. If someone is talking about their own personal experience  use the words that they use. If someone is talking about an abortion and they say the word  baby   you can say  baby.  If they say  fetus   you can say  fetus.  If someone describes themselves as gender queer to you  you can say  gender queer.  If someone kind of looks like a he  but they say they're a she    it's cool. Call that person a she. When we reflect the language of the person who is sharing their own story  we are conveying that we are interested in understanding who they are and what they're going through. The same way that we hope people are  interested in knowing us. So  I'll never forget being in one  of the Exhale counselor meetings  listening to a volunteer talk about how she was getting a lot of calls from Christian women who  were talking about God. Now  some of our volunteers are religious  but this particular one was not. At first  it felt a little weird for her  to talk to callers about God. So  she decided to get comfortable. And she stood in front of her mirror  at home  and she said the word  God.   God.   God.   God.   God.   God.   God.  Over and over and over again until the word no longer felt strange coming out her mouth. Saying the word God did not turn this  volunteer into a Christian  but it did make her a much  better listener of Christian women. So  another way to be pro voice is to share stories  and one risk that you take on  when you share your story with someone else  is that given the same set of circumstances as you they might actually make a different decision. For example  if you're telling a story  about your abortion  realize that she might have had the baby. She might have placed for adoption. She might have told her parents  and her partner    or not. She might have felt relief and confidence  even though you felt sad and lost. This is okay. Empathy gets created the moment we imagine ourselves in someone else's shoes. It doesn't mean we all have  to end up in the same place. It's not agreement  it's not sameness that pro voice is after. It creates a culture and a society that  values what make us special and unique. It values what makes us human  our flaws and our imperfections. And this way of thinking allows us to see our differences with respect  instead of fear. And it generates the empathy that we need to overcome all the ways that we try to hurt one another. Stigma  shame  prejudice   discrimination  oppression. Pro voice is contagious  and the more it's practiced the more it spreads. So  last year I was pregnant again. This time I was looking forward  to the birth of my son. And while pregnant  I had never been asked how I was feeling so much in all my life. And however I replied  whether I was feeling wonderful and excited or scared and totally freaked out  there was always someone there giving me a  been there  response. It was awesome. It was a welcome  yet dramatic departure from what I experience when I talk about my mixed feelings of my abortion. Pro voice is about the real stories of real people making an impact on the way abortion and so many other politicized and stigmatized issues are understood and discussed. From sexuality and mental health to poverty and incarceration. Far beyond definition as single right or wrong decisions  our experiences can exist on a spectrum. Pro voice focuses that conversation on human experience and it makes support and respect possible for all. Thank you. Alec Soth  So about    years ago  I got a call from a woman in Texas  Stacey Baker  and she'd seen some of my photographs in an art exhibition and was wondering if she could commission me to take a portrait of her parents. Now  at the time I hadn't met Stacey  and I thought this was some sort of wealthy oil tycoon and I'd struck it rich  but it was only later that I found out she'd actually taken out a loan to make this happen. I took the picture of her parents  but I was actually more excited about photographing Stacey. The picture I made that day ended up becoming one of my best known portraits. At the time I made this picture  Stacey was working as an attorney for the State of Texas. Not long after  she left her job to study photography in Maine  and while she was there  she ended up meeting the director of photography at the New York Times Magazine and was actually offered a job. Stacey Baker  In the years since  Alec and I have done a number of magazine projects together  and we've become friends. A few months ago  I started talking to Alec about a fascination of mine. I've always been obsessed with how couples meet. I asked Alec how he and his wife Rachel met  and he told me the story of a high school football game where she was    and he was     and he asked her out. He liked her purple hair. She said yes  and that was it. I then asked Alec if he'd be interested in doing a photography project exploring this question. AS  And I was interested in the question  but I was actually much more interested in Stacey's motivation for asking it  particularly since I'd never known Stacey to have a boyfriend. So as part of this project  I thought it'd be interesting if she tried to meet someone. So my idea was to have Stacey here go speed dating in Las Vegas on Valentine's Day. SB  We ended up at what was advertised as the world's largest speed dating event. I had    dates and each date lasted three minutes. Participants were given a list of ice  breaker questions to get the ball rolling  things like   If you could be any kind of animal  what would you be   That sort of thing. My first date was Colin. He's from England  and he once married a woman he met after placing an ad for a Capricorn. Alec and I saw him at the end of the evening  and he said he'd kissed a woman in line at one of the concession stands. Zack and Chris came to the date a thon together. This is Carl. I asked Carl   What's the first thing you notice about a woman   He said   Tits.  Matthew is attracted to women with muscular calves. We talked about running. He does triathlons  I run half marathons. Alec actually liked his eyes and asked if I was attracted to him  but I wasn't  and I don't think he was attracted to me either. Austin and Mike came together. Mike asked me a hypothetical question. He said   You're in an elevator running late for a meeting. Someone makes a dash for the elevator. Do you hold it open for them   And I said I would not. Cliff said the first thing he notices about a woman is her teeth  and we complimented each other's teeth. Because he's an open mouth sleeper  he says he has to floss more to help prevent gum disease  and so I asked him how often he flosses  and he said   Every other day.  Now  as someone who flosses twice a day  I wasn't really sure that that was flossing more but I don't think I said that out loud. Bill is an auditor  and we talked the entire three minutes about auditing.  Laughter  The first thing Spencer notices about a woman is her complexion. He feels a lot of women wear too much makeup  and that they should only wear enough to accentuate the features that they have. I told him I didn't wear any makeup at all and he seemed to think that that was a good thing. Craig told me he didn't think I was willing to be vulnerable. He was also frustrated when I couldn't remember my most embarrassing moment. He thought I was lying  but I wasn't. I didn't think he liked me at all  but at the end of the night  he came back to me and he gave me a box of chocolates. William was really difficult to talk to. I think he was drunk. Actor Chris McKenna was the MC of the event. He used to be on  The Young and the Restless.  I didn't actually go on a date with him. Alec said he saw several women give their phone numbers to him. Needless to say  I didn't fall in love. I didn't feel a particular connection with any of the men that I went on dates with  and I didn't feel like they felt a particular connection with me either. AS  Now  the most beautiful thing to me    The physical exterior reveals a crack in which you can get a glimpse at a more fragile interior. At this date a thon event  I saw so many examples of that  but as I watched Stacey's dates and talked to her about them  I realized how different photographic love is from real love. What is real love  How does it work  In order to work on this question and to figure out how someone goes from meeting on a date to having a life together  Stacey and I went to Sun City Summerlin  which is the largest retirement community in Las Vegas. Our contact there was George  who runs the community's photography club. He arranged for us to meet other couples in their makeshift photo studio. SB  After    years of marriage  Anastasia's husband died two years ago  so we asked if she had an old wedding picture. She met her husband when she was a    year old waitress at a small barbecue place in Michigan. He was   . She'd lied about her age. He was the first person she'd dated. Dean had been named photographer of the year in Las Vegas two years in a row  and this caught Alec's attention  as did the fact  that he met his wife  Judy  at the same age when Alec met Rachel. Dean admitted that he likes to look at beautiful women  but he's never questioned his decision to marry Judy. AS  George met Josephine at a parish dance. He was     she was   . Like a lot of the couples we met  they weren't especially philosophical about their early choices. George said something that really stuck with me. He said   When you get that feeling  you just go with it.  Bob and Trudy met on a blind date when she was still in high school. They said they weren't particularly attracted to each other when the first met. Nevertheless  they were married soon after. SB  The story that stayed with me the most was that of George  the photography club president  and his wife  Mary. This was George and Mary's second marriage. They met at a country western club in Louisville  Kentucky called the Sahara. He was there alone drinking and she was with friends. When they started dating  he owed the IRS       dollars in taxes  and she offered to help him get out of debt  so for the next year  he turned his paychecks over to Mary  and she got him out of debt. George was actually an alcoholic when they married  and Mary knew it. At some point in their marriage  he says he consumed    beers in one day. Another time  when he was drunk  he threatened to kill Mary and her two kids  but they escaped and a SWAT team was called to the house. Amazingly  Mary took him back  and eventually things got better. George has been involved in Alcoholics Anonymous and hasn't had a drink in    years. At the end of the day  after we left Sun City  I told Alec that I didn't actually think that the stories of how these couples met were all that interesting. What was more interesting was how they managed to stay together. AS  They all had this beautiful quality of endurance  but that was true of the singles  too. The world is hard  and the singles were out there trying to connect with other people  and the couples were holding onto each other after all these decades. My favorite pictures on this trip were of Joe and Roseanne. Now  by the time we met Joe and Roseanne  we'd gotten in the habit of asking couples if they had an old wedding photograph. In their case  they simultaneously pulled out of their wallets the exact same photograph. What's more beautiful  I thought to myself  this image of a young couple who has just fallen in love or the idea of these two people holding onto this image for decades  Thank you. This back here was my brain cancer. Isn't it nice  The key phrase is  was   phew. Having brain cancer was really  as you can imagine  shocking news for me. I knew nothing about cancer. In Western cultures  when you have cancer  it's as if you disappear in a way. Your life as a complex human being is replaced by medical data  Your images  your exams  your lab values  a list of medicines. And everyone changes as well. You suddenly become a disease on legs. Doctors start speaking a language which you don't understand. They start pointing their fingers at your body and your images. People start changing as well because they start dealing with the disease  instead of with the human being. They say   What did the doctor say   before even saying   Hello.  And in the meanwhile  you're left with questions to which nobody gives an answer. These are the  Can I   questions  Can I work while I have cancer  Can I study  Can I make love  Can I be creative  And you wonder   What have I done to deserve this   You wonder   Can I change something about my lifestyle   You wonder   Can I do something  Are there any other options   And  obviously  doctors are the good guys in all these scenarios  because they are very professional and dedicated to curing you. But they also are very used to having to deal with patients  so I'd say that they sometimes lose the idea that this is torture for you and that you become  literally  a patient     patient  means  the one who waits.  Things are changing  but classically  they tend to not engage you in any way to learn about your condition  to get your friends and family engaged  or showing you ways in which you can change your lifestyle to minimize the risks of what you're going through. But instead  you're forced there to wait in the hands of a series of very professional strangers. While I was in the hospital  I asked for a printed out picture of my cancer and I spoke with it. It was really hard to obtain  because it's not common practice to ask for a picture of your own cancer. I talked to it and I said   Okay  cancer  you're not all there is to me. There's more to me. A cure  whichever it is  will have to deal with the whole of me.  And so  the next day  I left the hospital against medical advice. I was determined to change my relationship with the cancer and I was determined to learn more about my cancer before doing anything as drastic as a surgery. I'm an artist  I use several forms of open source technologies and open information in my practice. So my best bet was to get it all out there  get the information out there  and use it so that it could be accessed by anyone. So I created a website  which is called La Cura  on which I put my medical data  online. I actually had to hack it and that's a thing which we can talk about in another speech. I chose this word  La Cura    La Cura in Italian means  the cure     because in many different cultures  the word  cure  can mean many different things. In our Western cultures  it means eradicating or reversing a disease  but in different cultures  for example  a culture from Asia  from the Mediterranean  from Latin countries  from Africa  it can mean many more things. Of course  I was interested in the opinions of doctors and healthcare providers  but I was also interested in the cure of the artist  of the poet  of the designer  of  who knows  the musicians. I was interested in the social cure  I was interested in the psychological cure  I was interested in the spiritual cure  I was interested in the emotional cure  I was interested in any form of cure. And  it worked. The La Cura website went viral. I received lots of media attention from Italy and from abroad and I quickly received more than         contacts    emails  social networking    most of them were a suggestion on how to cure my cancer  but more of them were about how to cure myself as a full individual. For example  many thousands of videos  images  pictures  art performances were produced for La Cura. For example  here we see Francesca Fini in her performance. Or  as artist Patrick Lichty has done  He produced a  D sculpture of my tumor and put it on sale on Thingiverse. Now you can have my cancer  too  Which is a nice thing  if you think about it  we can share our cancer. And this was going on    scientists  the traditional medicine experts  several researchers  doctors    all connected with me to give advice. With all this information and support  I was able to form a team of several neurosurgeons  traditional doctors  oncologists  and several hundred volunteers with whom I was able to discuss the information I was receiving  which is very important. And together  we were able to form a strategy for my own cure in many languages  according to many cultures. And the current strategy spans the whole world and thousands of years of human history  which is quite remarkable for me.  Surgery  The follow up MRIs showed  luckily  little to no growth of the cancer. So I was able to take my time and choose. I chose the doctor I wanted to work with  I chose the hospital I wanted to stay in  and in the meanwhile  I was supported by thousands of people  none of whom felt pity for me. Everyone felt like they could take an active role in helping me to get well  and this was the most important part of La Cura. What are the outcomes  I'm fine  as you can see  pretty fine. I had excellent news after the surgery    I have    I had a very low grade glioma  which is a  good  kind of cancer which doesn't grow a lot. I have completely changed my life and my lifestyle. Everything I did was thoughtfully designed to get me engaged. Up until the very last few minutes of the surgery  which was very intense  a matrix of electrodes was implanted in my brain from this side  to be able to build a functional map of what the brain controls. And right before the operation  we were able to discuss the functional map of my brain with the doctor  to understand which risks I was running into and if there were any I wanted to avoid. Obviously  there were.  Open  And this openness was really the fundamental part of La Cura. Thousands of people shared their stories  their experiences. Doctors got to talk with people they don't usually consult when they think about cancer. I'm a self founding  continuous state of translation among many different languages  in which science meets emotion and conventional research meets traditional research.  Society  The most important thing of La Cura was to feel like a part of a really engaged and connected society whose wellness really depends on the wellness of all of its components. This global performance is my open source cure for cancer. And from what I feel  it's a cure for me  but for us all. Thank you. So  people are more afraid of insects than they are of dying. At least  according to a       Book of Lists  survey which preceded all those online best  worst  funniest lists that you see today. Only heights and public speaking exceeded the six legged as sources of fear. And I suspect if you had put spiders in there  the combinations of insects and spiders would have just topped the chart. Now  I am not one of those people. I really love insects. I think they're interesting and beautiful  and sometimes even cute. And I'm not alone. For centuries  some of the greatest minds in science  from Charles Darwin to E.O. Wilson  have drawn inspiration from studying some of the smallest minds on Earth. Well  why is that  What is that keeps us coming back to insects  Some of it  of course  is just the sheer magnitude of almost everything about them. They're more numerous than any other kind of animal. We don't even know how many species of insects there are  because new ones are being discovered all the time. There are at least a million  maybe as many as    million. This means that you could have an insect of the month calendar and not have to reuse a species for over        years. Take that  pandas and kittens  More seriously  insects are essential. We need them. It's been estimated that   out of every   bites of food is made possible by a pollinator. Scientist use insects to make fundamental discoveries about everything from the structure of our nervous systems to how our genes and DNA work. But what I love most about insects is what they can tell us about our own behavior. Insects seem like they do everything that people do. They meet  they mate  they fight  they break up. And they do so with what looks like love or animosity. But what drives their behaviors is really different than what drives our own  and that difference can be really illuminating. There's nowhere where that's more true than when it comes to one of our most consuming interests    sex. Now  I will maintain. and I think I can defend  what may seem like a surprising statement. I think sex in insects is more interesting than sex in people. And the wild variety that we see makes us challenge some of our own assumptions about what it means to be male and female. Of course  to start with  a lot of insects don't need to have sex at all to reproduce. Female aphids can make little  tiny clones of themselves without ever mating. Virgin birth  right there. On your rose bushes. When they do have sex  even their sperm is more interesting than human sperm. There are some kinds of fruit flies whose sperm is longer than the male's own body. And that's important because the males use their sperm to compete. Now  male insects do compete with weapons  like the horns on these beetles. But they also compete after mating with their sperm. Dragonflies and damselflies have penises that look kind of like Swiss Army knives with all of the attachments pulled out. They use these formidable devices like scoops  to remove the sperm from previous males that the female has mated with. So  what can we learn from this  All right  it is not a lesson in the sense of us imitating them or of them setting an example for us to follow. Which  given this  is probably just as well. And also  did I mention sexual cannibalism is rampant among insects  So  no  that's not the point. But what I think insects do  is break a lot of the rules that we humans have about the sex roles. So  people have this idea that nature dictates kind of a     s sitcom version of what males and females are like. So that males are always supposed to be dominant and aggressive  and females are passive and coy. But that's just not the case. So for example  take katydids  which are relatives of crickets and grasshoppers. The males are very picky about who they mate with  because they not only transfer sperm during mating  they also give the female something called a nuptial gift. You can see two katydids mating in these photos. In both panels  the male's the one on the right  and that sword like appendage is the female's egg laying organ. The white blob is the sperm  the green blob is the nuptial gift  and the male manufactures this from his own body and it's extremely costly to produce. It can weigh up to a third of his body mass. I will now pause for a moment and let you think about what it would be like if human men  every time they had sex  had to produce something that weighed            pounds. Okay  they would not be able to do that very often. And indeed  neither can the katydids. And so what that means is the katydid males are very choosy about who they offer these nuptial gifts to. Now  the gift is very nutritious  and the female eats it during and after mating. So  the bigger it is  the better off the male is  because that means more time for his sperm to drain into her body and fertilize her eggs. But it also means that the males are very passive about mating  whereas the females are extremely aggressive and competitive  in an attempt to get as many of these nutritious nuptial gifts as they can. So  it's not exactly a stereotypical set of rules. Even more generally though  males are actually not all that important in the lives of a lot of insects. In the social insects    the bees and wasps and ants    the individuals that you see every day    the ants going back and forth to your sugar bowl  the honey bees that are flitting from flower to flower    all of those are always female. People have had a hard time getting their head around that idea for millennia. The ancient Greeks knew that there was a class of bees  the drones  that are larger than the workers  although they disapproved of the drones' laziness because they could see that the drones just hang around the hive until the mating flight    they're the males. They hang around until the mating flight  but they don't participate in gathering nectar or pollen. The Greeks couldn't figure out the drones' sex  and part of the confusion was that they were aware of the stinging ability of bees but they found it difficult to believe that any animals that bore such a weapon could possibly be a female. Aristotle tried to get involved as well. He suggested   OK  if the stinging individuals are going to be the males ...  Then he got confused  because that would have meant the males were also taking care of the young in a colony  and he seemed to think that would be completely impossible. He then concluded that maybe bees had the organs of both sexes in the same individual  which is not that far fetched  some animals do that  but he never really did get it figured out. And you know  even today  my students  for instance  call every animal they see  including insects  a male. And when I tell them that the ferocious army ant soldiers with their giant jaws  used to defend the colony  are all always female  they seem to not quite believe me. And certainly all of the movies    Antz  Bee Movie    portray the main character in the social insects as being male. Well  what difference does this make  These are movies. They're fiction. They have talking animals in them. What difference does it make if they talk like Jerry Seinfeld  I think it does matter  and it's a problem that actually is part of a much deeper one that has implications for medicine and health and a lot of other aspects of our lives. You all know that scientists use what we call model systems  which are creatures    white rats or fruit flies    that are kind of stand ins for all other animals  including people. And the idea is that what's true for a person will also be true for the white rat. And by and large  that turns out to be the case. But you can take the idea of a model system too far. And what I think we've done  is use males  in any species  as though they are the model system. The norm. The way things are supposed to be. And females as a kind of variant    something special that you only study after you get the basics down. And so  back to the insects. I think what that means is that people just couldn't see what was in front of them. Because they assumed that the world's stage was largely occupied by male players and females would only have minor  walk on roles. But when we do that  we really miss out on a lot of what nature is like. And we can also miss out on the way natural  living things  including people  can vary. And I think that's why we've used males as models in a lot of medical research  something that we know now to be a problem if we want the results to apply to both men and women. Well  the last thing I really love about insects is something that a lot of people find unnerving about them. They have little  tiny brains with very little cognitive ability  the way we normally think of it. They have complicated behavior  but they lack complicated brains. And so  we can't just think of them as though they're little people because they don't do things the way that we do. I really love that it's difficult to anthropomorphize insects  to look at them and just think of them like they're little people in exoskeletons  with six legs. Instead  you really have to accept them on their own terms  because insects make us question what's normal and what's natural. Now  you know  people write fiction and talk about parallel universes. They speculate about the supernatural  maybe the spirits of the departed walking among us. The allure of another world is something that people say is part of why they want to dabble in the paranormal. But as far as I'm concerned  who needs to be able to see dead people  when you can see live insects  Thank you. In the early days of Twitter  it was like a place of radical de shaming. People would admit shameful secrets about themselves  and other people would say   Oh my God  I'm exactly the same.  Voiceless people realized that they had a voice  and it was powerful and eloquent. If a newspaper ran some racist or homophobic column  we realized we could do something about it. We could get them. We could hit them with a weapon that we understood but they didn't    a social media shaming. Advertisers would withdraw their advertising. When powerful people misused their privilege  we were going to get them. This was like the democratization of justice. Hierarchies were being leveled out. We were going to do things better. Soon after that  a disgraced pop science writer called Jonah Lehrer    he'd been caught plagiarizing and faking quotes  and he was drenched in shame and regret  he told me. And he had the opportunity to publicly apologize at a foundation lunch. This was going to be the most important speech of his life. Maybe it would win him some salvation. He knew before he arrived that the foundation was going to be live streaming his event  but what he didn't know until he turned up  was that they'd erected a giant screen Twitter feed right next to his head. Another one in a monitor screen in his eye line. I don't think the foundation did this because they were monstrous. I think they were clueless  I think this was a unique moment when the beautiful naivety of Twitter was hitting the increasingly horrific reality. And here were some of the Tweets that were cascading into his eye line  as he was trying to apologize   Jonah Lehrer  boring us into forgiving him.  And   Jonah Lehrer has not proven that he is capable of feeling shame.  That one must have been written by the best psychiatrist ever  to know that about such a tiny figure behind a lectern. And   Jonah Lehrer is just a frigging sociopath.  That last word is a very human thing to do  to dehumanize the people we hurt. It's because we want to destroy people but not feel bad about it. Imagine if this was an actual court  and the accused was in the dark  begging for another chance  and the jury was yelling out   Bored  Sociopath   You know  when we watch courtroom dramas  we tend to identify with the kindhearted defense attorney  but give us the power  and we become like hanging judges. Power shifts fast. We were getting Jonah because he was perceived to have misused his privilege  but Jonah was on the floor then  and we were still kicking  and congratulating ourselves for punching up. And it began to feel weird and empty when there wasn't a powerful person who had misused their privilege that we could get. A day without a shaming began to feel like a day picking fingernails and treading water. Let me tell you a story. It's about a woman called Justine Sacco. She was a PR woman from New York with     Twitter followers  and she'd Tweet little acerbic jokes to them  like this one on a plane from New York to London   Weird German Dude  You're in first class. It's     . Get some deodorant.   Inner monologue as inhale BO. Thank god for pharmaceuticals.  So Justine chuckled to herself  and pressed send  and got no replies  and felt that sad feeling that we all feel when the Internet doesn't congratulate us for being funny. Black silence when the Internet doesn't talk back. And then she got to Heathrow  and she had a little time to spare before her final leg  so she thought up another funny little acerbic joke   Going to Africa. Hope I don't get AIDS. Just kidding. I'm white   And she chuckled to herself  pressed send  got on the plane  got no replies  turned off her phone  fell asleep  woke up    hours later  turned on her phone while the plane was taxiing on the runway  and straightaway there was a message from somebody that she hadn't spoken to since high school  that said   I am so sorry to see what's happening to you.  And then another message from a best friend   You need to call me right now. You are the worldwide number one trending topic on Twitter.  What had happened is that one of her     followers had sent the Tweet to a Gawker journalist  and he retweeted it to his        followers   And now  a funny holiday joke from IAC's PR boss  And then it was like a bolt of lightning. A few weeks later  I talked to the Gawker journalist. I emailed him and asked him how it felt  and he said   It felt delicious.  And then he said   But I'm sure she's fine.  But she wasn't fine  because while she slept  Twitter took control of her life and dismantled it piece by piece. First there were the philanthropists   If  JustineSacco's unfortunate words ... bother you  join me in supporting  CARE's work in Africa.   In light of ... disgusting  racist tweet  I'm donating to  care today  Then came the beyond horrified   ... no words for that horribly disgusting racist as fuck tweet from Justine Sacco. I am beyond horrified.  Was anybody on Twitter that night  A few of you. Did Justine's joke overwhelm your Twitter feed the way it did mine  It did mine  and I thought what everybody thought that night  which was   Wow  somebody's screwed  Somebody's life is about to get terrible   And I sat up in my bed  and I put the pillow behind my head  and then I thought  I'm not entirely sure that joke was intended to be racist. Maybe instead of gleefully flaunting her privilege  she was mocking the gleeful flaunting of privilege. There's a comedy tradition of this  like South Park or Colbert or Randy Newman. Maybe Justine Sacco's crime was not being as good at it as Randy Newman. In fact  when I met Justine a couple of weeks later in a bar  she was just crushed  and I asked her to explain the joke  and she said   Living in America puts us in a bit of a bubble when it comes to what is going on in the Third World. I was making of fun of that bubble.  You know  another woman on Twitter that night  a New Statesman writer Helen Lewis  she reviewed my book on public shaming and wrote that she Tweeted that night   I'm not sure that her joke was intended to be racist   and she said straightaway she got a fury of Tweets saying   Well  you're just a privileged bitch  too.  And so to her shame  she wrote  she shut up and watched as Justine's life got torn apart. It started to get darker   Everyone go report this cunt  JustineSacco  Then came the calls for her to be fired.  Good luck with the job hunt in the new year.  GettingFired  Thousands of people around the world decided it was their duty to get her fired.   JustineSacco last tweet of your career.  SorryNotSorry Corporations got involved  hoping to sell their products on the back of Justine's annihilation   Next time you plan to tweet something stupid before you take off  make sure you are getting on a  Gogo flight   A lot of companies were making good money that night. You know  Justine's name was normally Googled    times a month. That month  between December the   th and the end of December  her name was Googled           times. And one Internet economist told me that that meant that Google made somewhere between         dollars and         dollars from Justine's annihilation  whereas those of us doing the actual shaming    we got nothing. We were like unpaid shaming interns for Google. And then came the trolls   I'm actually kind of hoping Justine Sacco gets aids  lol  Somebody else on that wrote   Somebody HIV positive should rape this bitch and then we'll find out if her skin color protects her from AIDS.  And that person got a free pass. Nobody went after that person. We were all so excited about destroying Justine  and our shaming brains are so simple minded  that we couldn't also handle destroying somebody who was inappropriately destroying Justine. Justine was really uniting a lot of disparate groups that night  from philanthropists to  rape the bitch.    JustineSacco I hope you get fired  You demented bitch... Just let the world know you're planning to ride bare back while in Africa.  Women always have it worse than men. When a man gets shamed  it's   I'm going to get you fired.  When a woman gets shamed  it's   I'm going to get you fired and raped and cut out your uterus.  And then Justine's employers got involved   IAC on  JustineSacco tweet  This is an outrageous  offensive comment. Employee in question currently unreachable on an intl flight.  And that's when the anger turned to excitement   All I want for Christmas is to see  JustineSacco's face when her plane lands and she checks her inbox voicemail.  fired   Oh man   justinesacco is going to have the most painful phone turning on moment ever when her plane lands.   We are about to watch this  JustineSacco bitch get fired. In REAL time. Before she even KNOWS she's getting fired.  What we had was a delightful narrative arc. We knew something that Justine didn't. Can you think of anything less judicial than this  Justine was asleep on a plane and unable to explain herself  and her inability was a huge part of the hilarity. On Twitter that night  we were like toddlers crawling towards a gun. Somebody worked out exactly which plane she was on  so they linked to a flight tracker website.  British Airways Flight    On time   arrives in   hour    minutes  A hashtag began trending worldwide    hasJustineLandedYet   It is kinda wild to see someone self destruct without them even being aware of it.  hasJustineLandedYet   Seriously. I just want to go home to go to bed  but everyone at the bar is SO into  HasJustineLandedYet. Can't look away. Can't leave.    HasJustineLandedYet may be the best thing to happen to my Friday night.   Is no one in Cape Town going to the airport to tweet her arrival  Come on  twitter  I'd like pictures  And guess what  Yes there was.   JustineSacco HAS in fact landed at Cape Town international. And if you want to know what it looks like to discover that you've just been torn to shreds because of a misconstrued liberal joke  not by trolls  but by nice people like us  this is what it looks like   ... She's decided to wear sunnies as a disguise.  So why did we do it  I think some people were genuinely upset  but I think for other people  it's because Twitter is basically a mutual approval machine. We surround ourselves with people who feel the same way we do  and we approve each other  and that's a really good feeling. And if somebody gets in the way  we screen them out. And do you know what that's the opposite of  It's the opposite of democracy. We wanted to show that we cared about people dying of AIDS in Africa. Our desire to be seen to be compassionate is what led us to commit this profoundly un compassionate act. As Meghan O'Gieblyn wrote in the Boston Review   This isn't social justice. It's a cathartic alternative.  For the past three years  I've been going around the world meeting people like Justine Sacco    and believe me  there's a lot of people like Justine Sacco. There's more every day. And we want to think they're fine  but they're not fine. The people I met were mangled. They talked to me about depression  and anxiety and insomnia and suicidal thoughts. One woman I talked to  who also told a joke that landed badly  she stayed home for a year and a half. Before that  she worked with adults with learning difficulties  and was apparently really good at her job. Justine was fired  of course  because social media demanded it. But it was worse than that. She was losing herself. She was waking up in the middle of the night  forgetting who she was. She was got because she was perceived to have misused her privilege. And of course  that's a much better thing to get people for than the things we used to get people for  like having children out of wedlock. But the phrase  misuse of privilege  is becoming a free pass to tear apart pretty much anybody we choose to. It's becoming a devalued term  and it's making us lose our capacity for empathy and for distinguishing between serious and unserious transgressions. Justine had     Twitter followers  and so to make it work  she had to be fictionalized. Word got around that she was the daughter the mining billionaire Desmond Sacco.  Let us not be fooled by  JustineSacco her father is a SA mining billionaire. She's not sorry. And neither is her father.  I thought that was true about Justine  until I met her at a bar  and I asked her about her billionaire father  and she said   My father sells carpets.  And I think back on the early days of Twitter  when people would admit shameful secrets about themselves  and other people would say   Oh my God  I'm exactly the same.  These days  the hunt is on for people's shameful secrets. You can lead a good  ethical life  but some bad phraseology in a Tweet can overwhelm it all  become a clue to your secret inner evil. Maybe there's two types of people in the world  those people who favor humans over ideology  and those people who favor ideology over humans. I favor humans over ideology  but right now  the ideologues are winning  and they're creating a stage for constant artificial high dramas where everybody's either a magnificent hero or a sickening villain  even though we know that's not true about our fellow humans. What's true is that we are clever and stupid  what's true is that we're grey areas. The great thing about social media was how it gave a voice to voiceless people  but we're now creating a surveillance society  where the smartest way to survive is to go back to being voiceless. Let's not do that. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Thank you  Jon. Jon Ronson  Thanks  Bruno. BG  Don't go away. What strikes me about Justine's story is also the fact that if you Google her name today  this story covers the first     pages of Google results    there is nothing else about her. In your book  you mention another story of another victim who actually got taken on by a reputation management firm  and by creating blogs and posting nice  innocuous stories about her love for cats and holidays and stuff  managed to get the story off the first couple pages of Google results  but it didn't last long. A couple of weeks later  they started creeping back up to the top result. Is this a totally lost battle  Jon Ronson  You know  I think the very best thing we can do  if you see a kind of unfair or an ambiguous shaming  is to speak up  because I think the worst thing that happened to Justine was that nobody supported her    like  everyone was against her  and that is profoundly traumatizing  to be told by tens of thousands of people that you need to get out. But if a shaming happens and there's a babble of voices  like in a democracy  where people are discussing it  I think that's much less damaging. So I think that's the way forward  but it's hard  because if you do stand up for somebody  it's incredibly unpleasant. BG  So let's talk about your experience  because you stood up by writing this book. By the way  it's mandatory reading for everybody  okay  You stood up because the book actually puts the spotlight on shamers. And I assume you didn't only have friendly reactions on Twitter. JR  It didn't go down that well with some people. I mean  you don't want to just concentrate    because lots of people understood  and were really nice about the book. But yeah  for    years I've been writing stories about abuses of power  and when I say the powerful people over there in the military  or in the pharmaceutical industry  everybody applauds me. As soon as I say   We are the powerful people abusing our power now   I get people saying   Well you must be a racist too.  BG  So the other night    yesterday    we were at dinner  and there were two discussions going on. On one side you were talking with people around the table    and that was a nice  constructive discussion. On the other  every time you turned to your phone  there is this deluge of insults. JR  Yeah. This happened last night. We had like a TED dinner last night. We were chatting and it was lovely and nice  and I decided to check Twitter. Somebody said   You are a white supremacist.  And then I went back and had a nice conversation with somebody  and then I went back to Twitter  somebody said my very existence made the world a worse place. My friend Adam Curtis says that maybe the Internet is like a John Carpenter movie from the     s  when eventually everyone will start screaming at each other and shooting each other  and then eventually everybody would flee to somewhere safer  and I'm starting to think of that as a really nice option. BG  Jon  thank you. JR  Thank you  Bruno. So on my way here  the passenger next to me and I had a very interesting conversation during my flight. He told me   It seems like the United States has run out of jobs  because they're just making some up  cat psychologist  dog whisperer  tornado chaser.  A couple of seconds later  he asked me   So what do you do   And I was like   Peacebuilder   Every day  I work to amplify the voices of women and to highlight their experiences and their participation in peace processes and conflict resolution  and because of my work  I recognize that the only way to ensure the full participation of women globally is by reclaiming religion. Now  this matter is vitally important to me. As a young Muslim woman  I am very proud of my faith. It gives me the strength and conviction to do my work every day. It's the reason I can be here in front of you. But I can't overlook the damage that has been done in the name of religion  not just my own  but all of the world's major faiths. The misrepresentation and misuse and manipulation of religious scripture has influenced our social and cultural norms  our laws  our daily lives  to a point where we sometimes don't recognize it. My parents moved from Libya  North Africa  to Canada in the early     s  and I am the middle child of    children. Yes    . But growing up  I saw my parents  both religiously devout and spiritual people  pray and praise God for their blessings  namely me of course  but among others.  Laughter  They were kind and funny and patient  limitlessly patient  the kind of patience that having    kids forces you to have. And they were fair. I was never subjected to religion through a cultural lens. I was treated the same  the same was expected of me. I was never taught that God judged differently based on gender. And my parents' understanding of God as a merciful and beneficial friend and provider shaped the way I looked at the world. Now  of course  my upbringing had additional benefits. Being one of    children is Diplomacy    .  Laughter  To this day  I am asked where I went to school  like   Did you go to Kennedy School of Government   and I look at them and I'm like   No  I went to the Murabit School of International Affairs.  It's extremely exclusive. You would have to talk to my mom to get in. Lucky for you  she's here. But being one of    children and having    siblings teaches you a lot about power structures and alliances. It teaches you focus  you have to talk fast or say less  because you will always get cut off. It teaches you the importance of messaging. You have to ask questions in the right way to get the answers you know you want  and you have to say no in the right way to keep the peace. But the most important lesson I learned growing up was the importance of being at the table. When my mom's favorite lamp broke  I had to be there when she was trying to find out how and by who  because I had to defend myself  because if you're not  then the finger is pointed at you  and before you know it  you will be grounded. I am not speaking from experience  of course. When I was    in       I completed high school and I moved from Canada    Saskatoon    to Zawiya  my parents' hometown in Libya  a very traditional city. Mind you  I had only ever been to Libya before on vacation  and as a seven year old girl  it was magic. It was ice cream and trips to the beach and really excited relatives. Turns out it's not the same as a    year old young lady. I very quickly became introduced to the cultural aspect of religion. The words  haram     meaning religiously prohibited    and  aib     meaning culturally inappropriate    were exchanged carelessly  as if they meant the same thing and had the same consequences. And I found myself in conversation after conversation with classmates and colleagues  professors  friends  even relatives  beginning to question my own role and my own aspirations. And even with the foundation my parents had provided for me  I found myself questioning the role of women in my faith. So at the Murabit School of International Affairs  we go very heavy on the debate  and rule number one is do your research  so that's what I did  and it surprised me how easy it was to find women in my faith who were leaders  who were innovative  who were strong    politically  economically  even militarily. Khadija financed the Islamic movement in its infancy. We wouldn't be here if it weren't for her. So why weren't we learning about her  Why weren't we learning about these women  Why were women being relegated to positions which predated the teachings of our faith  And why  if we are equal in the eyes of God  are we not equal in the eyes of men  To me  it all came back to the lessons I had learned as a child. The decision maker  the person who gets to control the message  is sitting at the table  and unfortunately  in every single world faith  they are not women. Religious institutions are dominated by men and driven by male leadership  and they create policies in their likeness  and until we can change the system entirely  then we can't realistically expect to have full economic and political participation of women. Our foundation is broken. My mom actually says  you can't build a straight house on a crooked foundation. In       the Libyan revolution broke out  and my family was on the front lines. And there's this amazing thing that happens in war  a cultural shift almost  very temporary. And it was the first time that I felt it was not only acceptable for me to be involved  but it was encouraged. It was demanded. Myself and other women had a seat at the table. We weren't holding hands or a medium. We were part of decision making. We were information sharing. We were crucial. And I wanted and needed for that change to be permanent. Turns out  that's not that easy. It only took a few weeks before the women that I had previously worked with were returning back to their previous roles  and most of them were driven by words of encouragement from religious and political leaders  most of whom cited religious scripture as their defense. It's how they gained popular support for their opinions. So initially  I focused on the economic and political empowerment of women. I thought that would lead to cultural and social change. It turns out  it does a little  but not a lot. I decided to use their defense as my offense  and I began to cite and highlight Islamic scripture as well. In      and       my organization led the single largest and most widespread campaign in Libya. We entered homes and schools and universities  even mosques. We spoke to        people directly  and hundreds of thousands more through billboards and television commercials  radio commercials and posters. And you're probably wondering how a women's rights organization was able to do this in communities which had previously opposed our sheer existence. I used scripture. I used verses from the Quran and sayings of the Prophet  Hadiths  his sayings which are  for example   The best of you is the best to their family.   Do not let your brother oppress another.  For the first time  Friday sermons led by local community imams promoted the rights of women. They discussed taboo issues  like domestic violence. Policies were changed. In certain communities  we actually had to go as far as saying the International Human Rights Declaration  which you opposed because it wasn't written by religious scholars  well  those same principles are in our book. So really  the United Nations just copied us. By changing the message  we were able to provide an alternative narrative which promoted the rights of women in Libya. It's something that has now been replicated internationally  and while I am not saying it's easy    believe me  it's not. Liberals will say you're using religion and call you a bad conservative. Conservatives will call you a lot of colorful things. I've heard everything from   Your parents must be extremely ashamed of you     false  they're my biggest fans    to  You will not make it to your next birthday     again wrong  because I did. And I remain a very strong believer that women's rights and religion are not mutually exclusive. But we have to be at the table. We have to stop giving up our position  because by remaining silent  we allow for the continued persecution and abuse of women worldwide. By saying that we're going to fight for women's rights and fight extremism with bombs and warfare  we completely cripple local societies which need to address these issues so that they're sustainable. It is not easy  challenging distorted religious messaging. You will have your fair share of insults and ridicule and threats. But we have to do it. We have no other option than to reclaim the message of human rights  the principles of our faith  not for us  not for the women in your families  not for the women in this room  not even for the women out there  but for societies that would be transformed with the participation of women. And the only way we can do that  our only option  is to be  and remain  at the table. Thank you. This is a map of New York State that was made in      by the General Drafting Company. It's an extremely famous map among cartography nerds  because down here at the bottom of the Catskill Mountains  there is a little town called Roscoe    actually  this will go easier if I just put it up here    There's Roscoe  and then right above Roscoe is Rockland  New York  and then right above that is the tiny town of Agloe  New York. Agloe  New York  is very famous to cartographers  because it's a paper town. It's also known as a copyright trap. Mapmakers    because my map of New York and your map of New York are going to look very similar  on account of the shape of New York    often  mapmakers will insert fake places onto their maps  in order to protect their copyright. Because then  if my fake place shows up on your map  I can be well and truly sure that you have robbed me. Agloe is a scrabblization of the initials of the two guys who made this map  Ernest Alpers and Otto  G.  Lindberg  and they released this map in     . Decades later  Rand McNally releases a map with Agloe  New York  on it  at the same exact intersection of two dirt roads in the middle of nowhere. Well  you can imagine the delight over at General Drafting. They immediately call Rand McNally  and they say   We've caught you  We made Agloe  New York  up. It is a fake place. It's a paper town. We're going to sue your pants off   And Rand McNally says   No  no  no  no  Agloe is real.  Because people kept going to that intersection of two dirt roads    in the middle of nowhere  expecting there to be a place called Agloe    someone built a place called Agloe  New York. It had a gas station  a general store  two houses at its peak. And this is of course a completely irresistible metaphor to a novelist  because we would all like to believe that the stuff that we write down on paper can change the actual world in which we're actually living  which is why my third book is called  Paper Towns . But what interests me ultimately more than the medium in which this happened  is the phenomenon itself. It's easy enough to say that the world shapes our maps of the world  right  Like the overall shape of the world is obviously going to affect our maps. But what I find a lot more interesting is the way that the manner in which we map the world changes the world. Because the world would truly be a different place if North were down. And the world would be a truly different place if Alaska and Russia weren't on opposite sides of the map. And the world would be a different place if we projected Europe to show it in its actual size. The world is changed by our maps of the world. The way that we choose    sort of  our personal cartographic enterprise  also shapes the map of our lives  and that in turn shapes our lives. I believe that what we map changes the life we lead. And I don't mean that in some  like  secret y Oprah's Angels network  like  you can think your way  out of cancer sense. But I do believe that while maps don't show you where you will go in your life  they show you where you might go. You very rarely go to a place that isn't on your personal map. So I was a really terrible student when I was a kid. My GPA was consistently in the low  s. And I think the reason that I was such a terrible student is that I felt like education was just a series of hurdles that had been erected before me  and I had to jump over in order to achieve adulthood. And I didn't really want to jump over these hurdles  because they seemed completely arbitrary  so I often wouldn't  and then people would threaten me  you know  they'd threaten me with this  going on  my  permanent record   or  You'll never get a good job.  I didn't want a good job  As far as I could tell at eleven or twelve years old  like  people with good jobs woke up very early in the morning  and the men who had good jobs  one of the first things they did was tie a strangulation item of clothing around their necks. They literally put nooses on themselves  and then they went off to their jobs  whatever they were. That's not a recipe for a happy life. These people    in my  symbol obsessed  twelve year old imagination    these people who are strangling themselves as one of the first things they do each morning  they can't possibly be happy. Why would I want to jump over all of these hurdles and have that be the end  That's a terrible end  And then  when I was in tenth grade  I went to this school  Indian Springs School  a small boarding school  outside of Birmingham  Alabama. And all at once I became a learner. And I became a learner  because I found myself in a community of learners. I found myself surrounded by people who celebrated intellectualism and engagement  and who thought that my ironic oh so cool disengagement wasn't clever  or funny  but  like  it was a simple and unspectacular response to very complicated and compelling problems. And so I started to learn  because learning was cool. I learned that some infinite sets are bigger than other infinite sets  and I learned that iambic pentameter is and why it sounds so good to human ears. I learned that the Civil War was a nationalizing conflict  I learned some physics  I learned that correlation shouldn't be confused with causation    all of these things  by the way  enriched my life on a literally daily basis. And it's true that I don't use most of them for my  job   but that's not what it's about for me. It's about cartography. What is the process of cartography  It's  you know  sailing upon some land  and thinking   I think I'll draw that bit of land   and then wondering   Maybe there's some more land to draw.  And that's when learning really began for me. It's true that I had teachers that didn't give up on me  and I was very fortunate to have those teachers  because I often gave them cause to think there was no reason to invest in me. But a lot of the learning that I did in high school wasn't about what happened inside the classroom  it was about what happened outside of the classroom. For instance  I can tell you that  There's a certain Slant of light  Winter Afternoons    That oppresses  like the Heft Of Cathedral Tunes     not because I memorized Emily Dickinson in school when I was in high school  but because there was a girl when I was in high school  and her name was Amanda  and I had a crush on her  and she liked Emily Dickinson poetry. The reason I can tell you what opportunity cost is  is because one day when I was playing Super Mario Kart on my couch  my friend Emmet walked in  and he said   How long have you been playing Super Mario Kart   And I said   I don't know  like  six hours   and he said   Do you realize that if you'd worked at Baskin Robbins those six hours  you could have made    dollars  so in some ways  you just paid thirty dollars to play Super Mario Kart.  And I was  like   I'll take that deal.  But I learned what opportunity cost is. And along the way  the map of my life got better. It got bigger  it contained more places. There were more things that might happen  more futures I might have. It wasn't a formal  organized learning process  and I'm happy to admit that. It was spotty  it was inconsistent  there was a lot I didn't know. I might know  you know  Cantor's idea that some infinite sets are larger than other infinite sets  but I didn't really understand the calculus behind that idea. I might know the idea of opportunity cost  but I didn't know the law of diminishing returns. But the great thing about imagining learning as cartography  instead of imagining it as arbitrary hurdles that you have to jump over  is that you see a bit of coastline  and that makes you want to see more. And so now I do know at least some of the calculus that underlies all of that stuff. So  I had one learning community in high school  then I went to another for college  and then I went to another  when I started working at a magazine called  Booklist   where I was an assistant  surrounded by astonishingly well read people. And then I wrote a book. And like all authors dream of doing  I promptly quit my job. And for the first time since high school  I found myself without a learning community  and it was miserable. I hated it. I read many  many books during this two year period. I read books about Stalin  and books about how the Uzbek people came to identify as Muslims  and I read books about how to make atomic bombs  but it just felt like I was creating my own hurdles  and then jumping over them myself  instead of feeling the excitement of being part of a community of learners  a community of people who are engaged together in the cartographic enterprise of trying to better understand and map the world around us. And then  in       I met that guy. His name is Ze Frank. I didn't actually meet him  just on the Internet. Ze Frank was running  at the time  a show called  The Show with Ze Frank   and I discovered the show  and that was my way back into being a community learner again. Here's Ze talking about Las Vegas  Almost everything here was brought from somewhere else    the sort of rocks  the trees  the waterfalls. These fish are almost as out of place as my pig that flew. Contrasted to the scorching desert that surrounds this place  so are these people. Things from all over the world have been rebuilt here  away from their histories  and away from the people that experience them differently. Sometimes improvements were made    even the Sphinx got a nose job. Here  there's no reason to feel like you're missing anything. This New York means the same to me as it does to everyone else. Everything is out of context  and that means context allows for everything  Self Parking  Events Center  Shark Reef. This fabrication of place could be one of the world's greatest achievements  because no one belongs here  everyone does. As I walked around this morning  I noticed most of the buildings were huge mirrors reflecting the sun back into the desert. But unlike most mirrors  which present you with an outside view of yourself embedded in a place  these mirrors come back empty. John Green  Makes me nostalgic for the days when you could see the pixels in online video. Ze isn't just a great public intellectual  he's also a brilliant community builder  and the community of people that built up around these videos was in many ways a community of learners. So we played Ze Frank at chess collaboratively  and we beat him. We organized ourselves to take a young man on a road trip across the United States. We turned the Earth into a sandwich  by having one person hold a piece of bread at one point on the Earth  and on the exact opposite point of the Earth  have another person holding a piece of bread. I realize that these are silly ideas  but they are also  learny  ideas  and that was what was so exciting to me  and if you go online  you can find communities like this all over the place. Follow the calculus tag on Tumblr  and yes  you will see people complaining about calculus  but you'll also see people re blogging those complaints  making the argument that calculus is interesting and beautiful  and here's a way in to thinking about the problem that you find unsolvable. You can go to places like Reddit  and find sub Reddits  like  Ask a Historian  or  Ask Science   where you can ask people who are in these fields a wide range of questions  from very serious ones to very silly ones. But to me  the most interesting communities of learners that are growing up on the Internet right now are on YouTube  and admittedly  I am biased. But I think in a lot of ways  the YouTube page resembles a classroom. Look for instance at  Minute Physics   a guy who's teaching the world about physics  As of July          the Higgs boson is the last fundamental piece of the standard model of particle physics to be discovered experimentally. But  you might ask  why was the Higgs boson included in the standard model  alongside well known particles like electrons and photons and quarks  if it hadn't been discovered back then in the     s  Good question. There are two main reasons. First  just like the electron is an excitation in the electron field  the Higgs boson is simply a particle which is an excitation of the everywhere permeating Higgs field. The Higgs field in turn plays an integral role in our model for the weak nuclear force. In particular  the Higgs field helps explain why it's so weak. We'll talk more about this in a later video  but even though weak nuclear theory was confirmed in the     s  in the equations  the Higgs field is so inextricably jumbled with the weak force  that until now we've been unable to confirm its actual and independent existence. JG  Or here's a video that I made as part of my show  Crash Course   talking about World War I  of the Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand  on June           by a Bosnian Serb nationalist named Gavrilo Princip. Quick aside  It's worth noting that the first big war of the twentieth century began with an act of terrorism. So Franz Ferdinand wasn't particularly well liked by his uncle  the emperor Franz Joseph    now that is a mustache  But even so  the assassination led Austria to issue an ultimatum to Serbia  whereupon Serbia accepted some  but not all  of Austria's demands  leading Austria to declare war against Serbia. And then Russia  due to its alliance with the Serbs  mobilized its army. Germany  because it had an alliance with Austria  told Russia to stop mobilizing  which Russia failed to do  so then Germany mobilized its own army  declared war on Russia  cemented an alliance with the Ottomans  and then declared war on France  because  you know  France. And it's not just physics and world history that people are choosing to learn through YouTube. Here's a video about abstract mathematics. because they make you go every single day. And you're learning about  I don't know  the sums of infinite series. That's a high school topic  right  Which is odd  because it's a cool topic  but they somehow manage to ruin it anyway. So I guess that's why they allow infinite series in the curriculum. So  in a quite understandable need for distraction  you're doodling and thinking more about what the plural of  series  should be than about the topic at hand   serieses    seriese    seriesen   and  serii   Or is it that the singular should be changed  one  serie   or  serum   just like the singular of  sheep  should be  shoop.  But the whole concept of things like                        and so on approaches one  is useful if  say  you want to draw a line of elephants  each holding the tail of the next one  normal elephant  young elephant  baby elephant  dog sized elephant  puppy sized elephant  all the way down to Mr. Tusks and beyond. Which is at least a tiny bit awesome  because you can get an infinite number of elephants in a line  and still have it fit across a single notebook page. JG  And lastly  here's Destin  from  Smarter Every Day   talking about the conservation of angular momentum  and  since it's YouTube  cats  So you've probably observed that cats almost always land on their feet. Today's question is  why  Like most simple questions  there's a very complex answer. For instance  let me reword this question  How does a cat go from feet up to feet down in a falling reference frame  without violating the conservation of angular momentum  JG  So  here's something all four of these videos have in common  They all have more than half a million views on YouTube. And those are people watching not in classrooms  but because they are part of the communities of learning that are being set up by these channels. And I said earlier that YouTube is like a classroom to me  and in many ways it is  because here is the instructor    it's like the old fashioned classroom  here's the instructor  and then beneath the instructor are the students  and they're all having a conversation. And I know that YouTube comments have a very bad reputation in the world of the Internet  but in fact  if you go on comments for these channels  what you'll find is people engaging the subject matter  asking difficult  complicated questions that are about the subject matter  and then other people answering those questions. And because the YouTube page is set up so that the page in which I'm talking to you is on the exact    the place where I'm talking to you is on the exact same page as your comments  you are participating in a live and real and active way in the conversation. And because I'm in comments usually  I get to participate with you. And you find this whether it's world history  or mathematics  or science  or whatever it is. You also see young people using the tools and the sort of genres of the Internet in order to create places for intellectual engagement  instead of the ironic detachment that maybe most of us associate with memes and other Internet conventions    you know   Got bored. Invented calculus.  Or  here's Honey Boo Boo criticizing industrial capitalism    Liberal capitalism is not at all the Good of humanity. Quite the contrary  it is the vehicle of savage  destructive nihilism.   In case you can't see what she says ... yeah. I really believe that these spaces  these communities  have become for a new generation of learners  the kind of communities  the kind of cartographic communities that I had when I was in high school  and then again when I was in college. And as an adult  re finding these communities has re introduced me to a community of learners  and has encouraged me to continue to be a learner even in my adulthood  so that I no longer feel like learning is something reserved for the young. Vi Hart and  Minute Physics  introduced me to all kinds of things that I didn't know before. And I know that we all hearken back to the days of the Parisian salon in the Enlightenment  or to the Algonquin Round Table  and wish   Oh  I wish I could have been a part of that  I wish I could have laughed at Dorothy Parker's jokes.  But I'm here to tell you that these places exist  they still exist. They exist in corners of the Internet  where old men fear to tread. And I truly  truly believe that when we invented Agloe  New York  in the     s  when we made Agloe real  we were just getting started. Thank you. In       when I painted the minaret of Jara Mosque in my hometown of Gab s  in the south of Tunisia  I never thought that graffiti would bring so much attention to a city. At the beginning  I was just looking for a wall in my hometown  and it happened that the minaret was built in '  . And for    years  those    meters of concrete stayed grey. When I met the imam for the first time  and I told him what I wanted to do  he was like   Thank God you finally came   and he told me that for years he was waiting for somebody to do something on it. The most amazing thing about this imam is that he didn't ask me anything    neither a sketch  or what I was going to write. In every work that I create  I write messages with my style of calligraffiti    a mix of calligraphy and graffiti. I use quotes or poetry. For the minaret  I thought that the most relevant message to be put on a mosque should come from the Quran  so I picked this verse   Oh humankind  we have created you from a male and a female  and made you people and tribe  so you may know each other.  It was a universal call for peace  tolerance  and acceptance coming from the side that we don't usually portray in a good way in the media. I was amazed to see how the local community reacted to the painting  and how it made them proud to see the minaret getting so much attention from international press all around the world. For the imam  it was not just the painting  it was really deeper than that. He hoped that this minaret would become a monument for the city  and attract people to this forgotten place of Tunisia. The universality of the message  the political context of Tunisia at this time  and the fact that I was writing Quran in a graffiti way were not insignificant. It reunited the community. Bringing people  future generations  together through Arabic calligraphy is what I do. Writing messages is the essence of my artwork. What is funny  actually  is that even Arabic speaking people really need to focus a lot to decipher what I'm writing. You don't need to know the meaning to feel the piece. I think that Arabic script touches your soul before it reaches your eyes. There is a beauty in it that you don't need to translate. Arabic script speaks to anyone  I believe  to you  to you  to you  to anybody  and then when you get the meaning  you feel connected to it. I always make sure to write messages that are relevant to the place where I'm painting  but messages that have a universal dimension  so anybody around the world can connect to it. I was born and raised in France  in Paris  and I started learning how to write and read Arabic when I was   . Today I only write messages in Arabic. One of the reasons this is so important to me  is because of all the reaction that I've experienced all around the world. In Rio de Janeiro  I translated this Portuguese poem from Gabriela T rres Barbosa  who was giving an homage to the poor people of the favela  and then I painted it on the rooftop. The local community were really intrigued by what I was doing  but as soon as I gave them the meaning of the calligraphy  they thanked me  as they felt connected to the piece. In South Africa  in Cape Town  the local community of Philippi offered me the only concrete wall of the slum. It was a school  and I wrote on it a quote from Nelson Mandela  saying    in Arabic    which means   It seems impossible until it's done.  Then this guy came to me and said   Man  why you don't write in English   and I replied to him   I would consider your concern legit if you asked me why I didn't write in Zulu.  In Paris  once  there was this event  and someone gave his wall to be painted. And when he saw I was painting in Arabic  he got so mad    actually  hysterical    and he asked for the wall to be erased. I was mad and disappointed. But a week later  the organizer of the event asked me to come back  and he told me that there was a wall right in front of this guy's house. So  this guy    like  was forced to see it every day. At the beginning  I was going to write    In Arabic    which means   In your face   but    I decided to be smarter and I wrote    In Arabic    which means   Open your heart.  I'm really proud of my culture  and I'm trying to be an ambassador of it through my artwork. And I hope that I can break the stereotypes we all know  with the beauty of Arabic script. Today  I don't write the translation of the message anymore on the wall. I don't want the poetry of the calligraphy to be broken  as it's art and you can appreciate it without knowing the meaning  as you can enjoy any music from other countries. Some people see that as a rejection or a closed door  but for me  it's more an invitation    to my language  to my culture  and to my art. Thank you. Seventy thousand years ago  our ancestors were insignificant animals. The most important thing to know about prehistoric humans is that they were unimportant. Their impact on the world was not much greater than that of jellyfish or fireflies or woodpeckers. Today  in contrast  we control this planet. And the question is  How did we come from there to here  How did we turn ourselves from insignificant apes  minding their own business in a corner of Africa  into the rulers of planet Earth  Usually  we look for the difference between us and all the other animals on the individual level. We want to believe    I want to believe    that there is something special about me  about my body  about my brain  that makes me so superior to a dog or a pig  or a chimpanzee. But the truth is that  on the individual level  I'm embarrassingly similar to a chimpanzee. And if you take me and a chimpanzee and put us together on some lonely island  and we had to struggle for survival to see who survives better  I would definitely place my bet on the chimpanzee  not on myself. And this is not something wrong with me personally. I guess if they took almost any one of you  and placed you alone with a chimpanzee on some island  the chimpanzee would do much better. The real difference between humans and all other animals is not on the individual level  it's on the collective level. Humans control the planet because they are the only animals that can cooperate both flexibly and in very large numbers. Now  there are other animals    like the social insects  the bees  the ants    that can cooperate in large numbers  but they don't do so flexibly. Their cooperation is very rigid. There is basically just one way in which a beehive can function. And if there's a new opportunity or a new danger  the bees cannot reinvent the social system overnight. They cannot  for example  execute the queen and establish a republic of bees  or a communist dictatorship of worker bees. Other animals  like the social mammals    the wolves  the elephants  the dolphins  the chimpanzees    they can cooperate much more flexibly  but they do so only in small numbers  because cooperation among chimpanzees is based on intimate knowledge  one of the other. I'm a chimpanzee and you're a chimpanzee  and I want to cooperate with you. I need to know you personally. What kind of chimpanzee are you  Are you a nice chimpanzee  Are you an evil chimpanzee  Are you trustworthy  If I don't know you  how can I cooperate with you  The only animal that can combine the two abilities together and cooperate both flexibly and still do so in very large numbers is us  Homo sapiens. One versus one  or even    versus     chimpanzees might be better than us. But  if you pit       humans against       chimpanzees  the humans will win easily  for the simple reason that a thousand chimpanzees cannot cooperate at all. And if you now try to cram         chimpanzees into Oxford Street  or into Wembley Stadium  or Tienanmen Square or the Vatican  you will get chaos  complete chaos. Just imagine Wembley Stadium with         chimpanzees. Complete madness. In contrast  humans normally gather there in tens of thousands  and what we get is not chaos  usually. What we get is extremely sophisticated and effective networks of cooperation. All the huge achievements of humankind throughout history  whether it's building the pyramids or flying to the moon  have been based not on individual abilities  but on this ability to cooperate flexibly in large numbers. Think even about this very talk that I'm giving now  I'm standing here in front of an audience of about     or     people  most of you are complete strangers to me. Similarly  I don't really know all the people who have organized and worked on this event. I don't know the pilot and the crew members of the plane that brought me over here  yesterday  to London. I don't know the people who invented and manufactured this microphone and these cameras  which are recording what I'm saying. I don't know the people who wrote all the books and articles that I read in preparation for this talk. And I certainly don't know all the people who might be watching this talk over the Internet  somewhere in Buenos Aires or in New Delhi. Nevertheless  even though we don't know each other  we can work together to create this global exchange of ideas. This is something chimpanzees cannot do. They communicate  of course  but you will never catch a chimpanzee traveling to some distant chimpanzee band to give them a talk about bananas or about elephants  or anything else that might interest chimpanzees. Now cooperation is  of course  not always nice  all the horrible things humans have been doing throughout history    and we have been doing some very horrible things    all those things are also based on large scale cooperation. Prisons are a system of cooperation  slaughterhouses are a system of cooperation  concentration camps are a system of cooperation. Chimpanzees don't have slaughterhouses and prisons and concentration camps. Now suppose I've managed to convince you perhaps that yes  we control the world because we can cooperate flexibly in large numbers. The next question that immediately arises in the mind of an inquisitive listener is  How  exactly  do we do it  What enables us alone  of all the animals  to cooperate in such a way  The answer is our imagination. We can cooperate flexibly with countless numbers of strangers  because we alone  of all the animals on the planet  can create and believe fictions  fictional stories. And as long as everybody believes in the same fiction  everybody obeys and follows the same rules  the same norms  the same values. All other animals use their communication system only to describe reality. A chimpanzee may say   Look  There's a lion  let's run away   Or   Look  There's a banana tree over there  Let's go and get bananas   Humans  in contrast  use their language not merely to describe reality  but also to create new realities  fictional realities. A human can say   Look  there is a god above the clouds  And if you don't do what I tell you to do  when you die  God will punish you and send you to hell.  And if you all believe this story that I've invented  then you will follow the same norms and laws and values  and you can cooperate. This is something only humans can do. You can never convince a chimpanzee to give you a banana by promising him   ... after you die  you'll go to chimpanzee heaven ...   ... and you'll receive lots and lots of bananas for your good deeds. So now give me this banana.  No chimpanzee will ever believe such a story. Only humans believe such stories  which is why we control the world  whereas the chimpanzees are locked up in zoos and research laboratories. Now you may find it acceptable that yes  in the religious field  humans cooperate by believing in the same fictions. Millions of people come together to build a cathedral or a mosque or fight in a crusade or a jihad  because they all believe in the same stories about God and heaven and hell. But what I want to emphasize is that exactly the same mechanism underlies all other forms of mass scale human cooperation  not only in the religious field. Take  for example  the legal field. Most legal systems today in the world are based on a belief in human rights. But what are human rights  Human rights  just like God and heaven  are just a story that we've invented. They are not an objective reality  they are not some biological effect about homo sapiens. Take a human being  cut him open  look inside  you will find the heart  the kidneys  neurons  hormones  DNA  but you won't find any rights. The only place you find rights are in the stories that we have invented and spread around over the last few centuries. They may be very positive stories  very good stories  but they're still just fictional stories that we've invented. The same is true of the political field. The most important factors in modern politics are states and nations. But what are states and nations  They are not an objective reality. A mountain is an objective reality. You can see it  you can touch it  you can ever smell it. But a nation or a state  like Israel or Iran or France or Germany  this is just a story that we've invented and became extremely attached to. The same is true of the economic field. The most important actors today in the global economy are companies and corporations. Many of you today  perhaps  work for a corporation  like Google or Toyota or McDonald's. What exactly are these things  They are what lawyers call legal fictions. They are stories invented and maintained by the powerful wizards we call lawyers. And what do corporations do all day  Mostly  they try to make money. Yet  what is money  Again  money is not an objective reality  it has no objective value. Take this green piece of paper  the dollar bill. Look at it    it has no value. You cannot eat it  you cannot drink it  you cannot wear it. But then came along these master storytellers    the big bankers  the finance ministers  the prime ministers    and they tell us a very convincing story   Look  you see this green piece of paper  It is actually worth    bananas.  And if I believe it  and you believe it  and everybody believes it  it actually works. I can take this worthless piece of paper  go to the supermarket  give it to a complete stranger whom I've never met before  and get  in exchange  real bananas which I can actually eat. This is something amazing. You could never do it with chimpanzees. Chimpanzees trade  of course   Yes  you give me a coconut  I'll give you a banana.  That can work. But  you give me a worthless piece of paper and you except me to give you a banana  No way  What do you think I am  a human  Money  in fact  is the most successful story ever invented and told by humans  because it is the only story everybody believes. Not everybody believes in God  not everybody believes in human rights  not everybody believes in nationalism  but everybody believes in money  and in the dollar bill. Take  even  Osama Bin Laden. He hated American politics and American religion and American culture  but he had no objection to American dollars. He was quite fond of them  actually. To conclude  then  We humans control the world because we live in a dual reality. All other animals live in an objective reality. Their reality consists of objective entities  like rivers and trees and lions and elephants. We humans  we also live in an objective reality. In our world  too  there are rivers and trees and lions and elephants. But over the centuries  we have constructed on top of this objective reality a second layer of fictional reality  a reality made of fictional entities  like nations  like gods  like money  like corporations. And what is amazing is that as history unfolded  this fictional reality became more and more powerful so that today  the most powerful forces in the world are these fictional entities. Today  the very survival of rivers and trees and lions and elephants depends on the decisions and wishes of fictional entities  like the United States  like Google  like the World Bank    entities that exist only in our own imagination. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Yuval  you have a new book out. After Sapiens  you wrote another one  and it's out in Hebrew  but not yet translated into ... Yuval Noah Harari  I'm working on the translation as we speak. BG  In the book  if I understand it correctly  you argue that the amazing breakthroughs that we are experiencing right now not only will potentially make our lives better  but they will create    and I quote you     ... new classes and new class struggles  just as the industrial revolution did.  Can you elaborate for us  YNH  Yes. In the industrial revolution  we saw the creation of a new class of the urban proletariat. And much of the political and social history of the last     years involved what to do with this class  and the new problems and opportunities. Now  we see the creation of a new massive class of useless people. As computers become better and better in more and more fields  there is a distinct possibility that computers will out perform us in most tasks and will make humans redundant. And then the big political and economic question of the   st century will be   What do we need humans for    or at least   What do we need so many humans for   BG  Do you have an answer in the book  YNH  At present  the best guess we have is to keep them happy with drugs and computer games ... but this doesn't sound like a very appealing future. BG  Ok  so you're basically saying in the book and now  that for all the discussion about the growing evidence of significant economic inequality  we are just kind of at the beginning of the process  YNH  Again  it's not a prophecy  it's seeing all kinds of possibilities before us. One possibility is this creation of a new massive class of useless people. Another possibility is the division of humankind into different biological castes  with the rich being upgraded into virtual gods  and the poor being degraded to this level of useless people. BG  I feel there is another TED talk coming up in a year or two. Thank you  Yuval  for making the trip. YNH  Thanks  For the past decade  I've been studying non state armed groups  armed organizations like terrorists  insurgents or militias. I document what these groups do when they're not shooting. My goal is to better understand these violent actors and to study ways to encourage transition from violent engagement to nonviolent confrontation. I work in the field  in the policy world and in the library. Understanding non state armed groups is key to solving most ongoing conflict  because war has changed. It used to be a contest between states. No longer. It is now a conflict between states and non state actors. For example  of the     peace agreements signed between      and           of them were between a state and a non state actor. So we need to understand these groups  we need to either engage them or defeat them in any conflict resolution process that has to be successful. So how do we do that  We need to know what makes these organizations tick. We know a lot about how they fight  why they fight  but no one looks at what they're doing when they're not fighting. Yet  armed struggle and unarmed politics are related. It is all part of the same organization. We cannot understand these groups  let alone defeat them  if we don't have the full picture. And armed groups today are complex organizations. Take the Lebanese Hezbollah  known for its violent confrontation against Israel. But since its creation in the early     s  Hezbollah has also set up a political party  a social service network  and a military apparatus. Similarly  the Palestinian Hamas  known for its suicide attacks against Israel  also runs the Gaza Strip since     . So these groups do way more than just shoot. They multi task. They set up complex communication machines    radio stations  TV channels  Internet websites and social media strategies. And up here  you have the ISIS magazine  printed in English and published to recruit. Armed groups also invest in complex fund raising    not looting  but setting up profitable businesses  for example  construction companies. Now  these activities are keys. They allow these groups to increase their strength  increase their funds  to better recruit and to build their brand. Armed groups also do something else  they build stronger bonds with the population by investing in social services. They build schools  they run hospitals  they set up vocational training programs or micro loan programs. Hezbollah offers all of these services and more. Armed groups also seek to win the population over by offering something that the state is not providing  safety and security. The initial rise of the Taliban in war torn Afghanistan  or even the beginning of the ascent of ISIS  can be understood also by looking at these groups' efforts to provide security. Now  unfortunately  in these cases  the provision of security came at an unbearably high price for the population. But in general  providing social services fills a gap  a governance gap left by the government  and allows these groups to increase their strength and their power. For example  the      electoral victory of the Palestinian Hamas cannot be understood without acknowledging the group's social work. Now  this is a really complex picture  yet in the West  when we look at armed groups  we only think of the violent side. But that's not enough to understand these groups' strength  strategy or long term vision. These groups are hybrid. They rise because they fill a gap left by the government  and they emerge to be both armed and political  engage in violent struggle and provide governance. And the more these organizations are complex and sophisticated  the less we can think of them as the opposite of a state. Now  what do you call a group like Hezbollah  They run part of a territory  they administer all their functions  they pick up the garbage  they run the sewage system. Is this a state  Is it a rebel group  Or maybe something else  something different and new  And what about ISIS  The lines are blurred. We live in a world of states  non states  and in between  and the more states are weak  like in the Middle East today  the more non state actors step in and fill that gap. This matters for governments  because to counter these groups  they will have to invest more in non military tools. Filling that governance gap has to be at the center of any sustainable approach. This also matters very much for peacemaking and peacebuilding. If we better understand armed groups  we will better know what incentives to offer to encourage the transition from violence to nonviolence. So in this new contest between states and non states  military power can win some battles  but it will not give us peace nor stability. To achieve these objectives  what we need is a long term investment in filling that security gap  in filling that governance gap that allowed these groups to thrive in the first place. Thank you. Imagine a place where your neighbors greet your children by name  a place with splendid vistas  a place where you can drive just    minutes and put your sailboat on the water. It's a seductive place  isn't it  I don't live there. But I did journey on a        mile trip for two years  to the fastest growing and whitest counties in America. What is a Whitopia  I define Whitopia in three ways  First  a Whitopia has posted at least six percent population growth since     . Secondly  the majority of that growth comes from white migrants. And third  the Whitopia has an ineffable charm  a pleasant look and feel  a je Ne sais quoi. To learn how and why Whitopias are ticking  I immersed myself for several months apiece in three of them  first  St. George  Utah  second  Coeur d'Alene  Idaho  and third  Forsyth County  Georgia. First stop  St. George    a beautiful town of red rock landscapes. In the     s  Brigham Young dispatched families to St. George to grow cotton because of the hot  arid climate. And so they called it Utah's Dixie  and the name sticks to this day. I approached my time in each Whitopia like an anthropologist. I made detailed spreadsheets of all the power brokers in the communities  who I needed to meet  where I needed to be  and I threw myself with gusto in these communities. I went to zoning board meetings  I went to Democratic clubs and Republican clubs. I went to poker nights. In St. George  I rented a home at the Entrada  one of the town's premier gated communities. There were no Motel  's or Howard Johnsons for me. I lived in Whitopia as a resident  and not like a visitor. I rented myself this home by phone. Golf is the perfect seductive symbol of Whitopia. When I went on my journey  I had barely ever held a golf club. By the time I left  I was golfing at least three times a week. Golf helps people bond. Some of the best interviews I ever scored during my trip were on the golf courses. One venture capitalist  for example  invited me to golf in his private club that had no minority members. I also went fishing. Because I had never fished  this fellow had to teach me how to cast my line and what bait to use. I also played poker every weekend. It was Texas Hold 'em with a     buy in. My poker mates may have been bluffing about the hands that they drew  but they weren't bluffing about their social beliefs. Some of the most raw  salty conversations I ever had during my journey were at the poker table. I'm a gung ho entertainer. I love to cook  I hosted many dinner parties  and in return  people invited me to their dinner parties  and to their barbecues  and to their pool parties  and to their birthday parties. But it wasn't all fun. Immigration turned out to be a big issue in this Whitopia. The St. George's Citizens Council on Illegal Immigration held regular and active protests against immigration  and so what I gleaned from this Whitopia is what a hot debate this would become. It was a real time preview  and so it has become. Next stop  Almost Heaven  a cabin I rented for myself in Coeur d'Alene  in the beautiful North Idaho panhandle. I rented this place for myself  also by phone. The book  A Thousand Places To See Before You Die  lists Coeur d'Alene    it's a gorgeous paradise for huntsmen  boatmen and fishermen. My growing golf skills came in handy in Coeur d'Alene. I golfed with retired LAPD cops. In       around        families and cops fled Los Angeles after the L.A. racial unrest  for North Idaho  and they've built an expatriated community. Given the conservatism of these cops  there's no surprise that North Idaho has a strong gun culture. In fact  it is said  North Idaho has more gun dealers than gas stations. So what's a resident to do to fit in  I hit the gun club. When I rented a gun  the gentleman behind the counter was perfectly pleasant and kind  until I showed him my New York City driver's license. That's when he got nervous. I'm not as bad a shot as I thought I might have been. What I learned from North Idaho is the peculiar brand of paranoia that can permeate a community when so many cops and guns are around. In North Idaho  in my red pickup truck  I kept a notepad. And in that notepad I counted more Confederate flags than black people. In North Idaho  I found Confederate flags on key chains  on cellphone paraphernalia  and on cars. About a seven minute drive from my hidden lake cabin was the compound of Aryan Nations  the white supremacist group. America's Promise Ministries  the religious arm of Aryan Nations  happened to have a three day retreat during my visit. So I decided to crash it. I'm the only non Aryan journalist I'm aware of ever to have done so. Among the many memorable episodes of that retreat... ...is when Abe  an Aryan  sidled up next to me. He slapped my knee  and he said   Hey Rich  I just want you to know one thing. We are not white supremacists. We are white separatists. We don't think we're better than you  we just want to be away from you.  Indeed  most white people in Whitopia are neither white supremacists or white separatists  in fact  they're not there for explicitly racial reasons at all. Rather  they emigrate there for friendliness  comfort  security  safety    reasons that they implicitly associate to whiteness in itself. Next stop was Georgia. In Georgia  I stayed in an exurb north of Atlanta. In Utah  I found poker  in Idaho  I found guns  in Georgia  I found God. The way that I immersed myself in this Whitopia was to become active at First Redeemer Church  a megachurch that's so huge that it has golf carts to escort the congregants around its many parking lots on campus. I was active in the youth ministry. And for me  personally  I was more comfortable in this Whitopia than say  in a Colorado  or an Idaho  or even a suburban Boston. That is because  there   in Georgia  white people and black people are more historically familiar to one another. I was less exotic in this Whitopia. But what does it all mean  Whitopian dreaming  Whitopia migration  is a push pull phenomenon  full of alarming pushes and alluring pulls  and Whitopia operates at the level of conscious and unconscious bias. It's possible for people to be in Whitopia not for racist reasons  though it has racist outcomes. Many Whitopians feel pushed by illegals  social welfare abuse  minorities  density  crowded schools. Many Whitopians feel pulled by merit  freedom  the allure of privatism    privatized places  privatized people  privatized things. And I learned in Whitopia how a country can have racism without racists. Many of my smug urban liberal friends couldn't believe I would go on such a venture. The reality is that many white Americans are affable and kind. Interpersonal race relations    how we treat each other as human beings    are vastly better than in my parents' generation. Can you imagine me going to Whitopia    years ago  What a journey that would have been. And yet  some things haven't changed. America is as residentially and educationally segregated today as it was in     . As Americans  we often find ways to cook for each other  to dance with each other  to host with each other  but why can't that translate into how we treat each other as communities  It's a devastating irony  how we have gone forward as individuals  and backwards as communities. One of the Whitopian outlooks that really hit me was a proverbial saying   One black man is a delightful dinner guest     black men is a ghetto.  One of the big contexts animating my Whitopian journey was the year     . By       white people will no longer be the American majority. As such  will there be more Whitopias  In looking at this  the danger of Whitopia is that the more segregation we have  the less we can look at and confront conscious and unconscious bias. I ventured on my two year         mile journey to learn where  why  and how white people are fleeing  but I didn't expect to have so much fun on my journey. I didn't expect to learn so much about myself. I don't expect I'll be living in a Whitopia    or a Blacktopia  for that matter. I do plan to continue golfing every chance I get. And I'll just have to leave the guns and megachurches back in Whitopia. Thank you. There's this quote by activist and punk rock musician Jello Biafra that I love. He says   Don't hate the media. Be the media.  I'm an artist. I like working with media and technology because A  I'm familiar with them and I like the power they hold. And B  I hate them and I'm terrified of the power they hold. I remember watching  in       an interview between Fox News host Tony Snow and then US Defense Secretary  Donald Rumsfeld. They were talking about the recent invasion of Iraq  and Rumsfeld is asked the question   Well  we're hear about our body counts  but we never hear about theirs  why   And Rumsfeld's answer is   Well  we don't do body counts on other people.  Right  It's estimated that between         to one million Iraqis  civilians  have died as a result of the US led invasion in     . That number is in stark contrast with the       US service members who died during that same window of time. I wanted to do more than just bring awareness to this terrifying number. I wanted to create a monument for the individual civilians who died as a result of the invasion. Monuments to war  such as Maya Lin's Vietnam Memorial  are often enormous in scale. Very powerful and very one sided. I wanted my monument to live in the world  and to circulate. I remember when I was a boy in school  my teacher assigned us this classic civics assignment where you take a sheet of paper and you write a member of your government. And we were told  if we wrote a really good letter  if we really thought about it  we would get back more than just a simple formed letter as a reply. This is my  Notepad.  What looks like an everyday  yellow legal tablet of paper is actually a monument to the individual Iraqi civilians that died as a result of the US invasion.  Notepad  is an act of protest and an act of commemoration disguised as an everyday tablet of paper. The lines of the paper  when magnified  are revealed to be micro printed text that contains the details  the names  the dates and locations of individual Iraqi civilians that died. So  for the last   years  I've been taking pads of this paper  tons of this stuff  and smuggling it into the stationery supplies of the United States and the Coalition governments. I don't have to tell you guys this is not the place to discuss how I did that. But also  I've been meeting one on one with members and former members of the so called Coalition of the Willing  who assisted in the invasion. And so  whenever I can  I meet with one of them  and I share the project with them. And last summer  I had the chance to meet with former United States Attorney General and Torture Memo author  Alberto Gonzales. This is a special legal tablet. It's actually part of an ongoing art project. Alberto Gonzalez  This is a special legal pad  MK  Yes. You won't believe me  but it's in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art  I'm an artist. MK  And all of the lines of the paper are actually    AG  Are they going to disappear  MK  No  they're micro printed text that contains the names of individual Iraqi civilians who have died since the invasion of Iraq. AG  Yeah. OK. AG  Thank you. MK  Thank you. The way he says  thank you  really creeps me out. OK  so I'd like each of you to look under your chairs. There's an envelope. And please open it. The paper you're holding in your hand contains the details of Iraqi civilians that died as result of the invasion. I'd like you to use this paper and write a member of government. You can help to smuggle this civilian body count into government archives. Because every letter that's sent in to the government  and this is all across the world  of course    every letter that is sent in is archived  filed and recorded. Together  we can put this in the mailboxes and under the noses of people in power. Everything that's sent in eventually becomes part of the permanent archive of our government  our shared historical record. Thank you. Tom Rielly  So  tell me Matt  how did this idea come into your head  of  Notepad   Matt Kenyon  I'd just finished a project that dealt with the US Coalition side of the war and it was a black armband that was called the  Improvised Empathetic Device  which accumulated  in real time  the names  ranks  cause of death and location of US service members who had died overseas  and each time the Department of Defense or CENTCOM released their data  it would stab me in the arm. And so  I became aware that there was a spectacle associated with our own people who were dying overseas  but a disproportionate amount of casualties were the civilian casualties. TR  Thank you so much. MK  Thank you. What do you do when you have a headache  You swallow an aspirin. But for this pill to get to your head  where the pain is  it goes through your stomach  intestines and various other organs first. Swallowing pills is the most effective and painless way of delivering any medication in the body. The downside  though  is that swallowing any medication leads to its dilution. And this is a big problem  particularly in HIV patients. When they take their anti HIV drugs  these drugs are good for lowering the virus in the blood  and increasing the CD  cell counts. But they are also notorious for their adverse side effects  but mostly bad  because they get diluted by the time they get to the blood  and worse  by the time they get to the sites where it matters most  within the HIV viral reservoirs. These areas in the body    such as the lymph nodes  the nervous system  as well as the lungs    where the virus is sleeping  and will not readily get delivered in the blood of patients that are under consistent anti HIV drugs therapy. However  upon discontinuation of therapy  the virus can awake and infect new cells in the blood. Now  all this is a big problem in treating HIV with the current drug treatment  which is a life long treatment that must be swallowed by patients. One day  I sat and thought   Can we deliver anti HIV directly within its reservoir sites  without the risk of drug dilution   As a laser scientist  the answer was just before my eyes  Lasers  of course. If they can be used for dentistry  for diabetic wound healing and surgery  they can be used for anything imaginable  including transporting drugs into cells. As a matter of fact  we are currently using laser pulses to poke or drill extremely tiny holes  which open and close almost immediately in HIV infected cells  in order to deliver drugs within them.  How is that possible   you may ask. Well  we shine a very powerful but super tiny laser beam onto the membrane of HIV infected cells while these cells are immersed in liquid containing the drug. The laser pierces the cell  while the cell swallows the drug in a matter of microseconds. Before you even know it  the induced hole becomes immediately repaired. Now  we are currently testing this technology in test tubes or in Petri dishes  but the goal is to get this technology in the human body  apply it in the human body.  How is that possible   you may ask. Well  the answer is  through a three headed device. Using the first head  which is our laser  we will make an incision in the site of infection. Using the second head  which is a camera  we meander to the site of infection. Finally  using a third head  which is a drug spreading sprinkler  we deliver the drugs directly at the site of infection  while the laser is again used to poke those cells open. Well  this might not seem like much right now. But one day  if successful  this technology can lead to complete eradication of HIV in the body. Yes. A cure for HIV. This is every HIV researcher's dream    in our case  a cure lead by lasers. Thank you. Today  I want to talk to you about dreams. I have been a lucid dreamer my whole life  and it's cooler than in the movies. Beyond flying  breathing fire  and making hot men spontaneously appear ... I can do things like read and write music. Fun fact is that I wrote my personal statement to college in a dream. And I did accepted. So  yeah. I am a very visual thinker. I think in pictures  not words. To me  words are more like instincts and language. There are many people like me  Nikola Tesla  for example  who could visualize  design  test  and troubleshoot everything    all of his inventions    in his mind  accurately. Language is kind of exclusive to our species  anyway. I am a bit more primitive  like a beta version of Google Translate. My brain has the ability to hyper focus on things that interest me. For example  once I had an affair with calculus that lasted longer than some celebrity marriages. There are some other unusual things about me. You may have noticed that I don't have much inflection in my voice. That's why people often confuse me with a GPS. This can make basic communication a challenge  unless you need directions. Thank you. A few years ago  when I started doing presentations  I went to get head shots done for the first time. The photographer told me to look flirty. And I had no idea what she was talking about. She said   Do that thing  you know  with your eyes  when you're flirting with guys.   What thing   I asked.  You know  squint.  And so I tried  really. It looked something like this. I looked like I was searching for Waldo. There's a reason for this  as there is a reason that Waldo is hiding. I have Asperger's  a high functioning form of autism that impairs the basic social skills one is expected to display. It's made life difficult in many ways  and growing up  I struggled to fit in socially. My friends would tell jokes  but I didn't understand them. My personal heroes were George Carlin and Stephen Colbert    and they taught me humor. My personality switched from being shy and awkward to being defiant and cursing out a storm. Needless to say  I did not have many friends. I was also hypersensitive to texture. The feel of water on my skin was like pins and needles  and so for years  I refused to shower. I can assure you that my hygiene routine is up to standards now  though. I had to do a lot to get here  and my parents    things kind of got out of control when I was sexually assaulted by a peer  and on top of everything  it made a difficult situation worse. And I had to travel       miles across the country to get treatment  but within days of them prescribing a new medication  my life turned into an episode of the Walking Dead. I became paranoid  and began to hallucinate that rotting corpses were coming towards me. My family finally rescued me  but by that time  I had lost    pounds in those three weeks  as well as developing severe anemia  and was on the verge of suicide. I transferred to a new treatment center that understood my aversions  my trauma  and my social anxiety  and they knew how to treat it  and I got the help I finally needed. And after    months of hard work  I went on to do incredible things. One of the things with Asperger's is that oftentimes  these people have a very complex inner life  and I know for myself  I have a very colorful personality  rich ideas  and just a lot going on in my mind. But there's a gap between where that stands  and how I communicate it with the rest of the world. And this can make basic communication a challenge. Not many places would hire me  due to my lack of social skills  which is why I applied to Waffle House. Waffle House is an exceptional    hour diner    thank you    where you can order your hash browns the many ways that someone would dispose of a human corpse ... Sliced  diced  peppered  chunked  topped  capped  and covered. As social norms would have it  you should only go to Waffle House at an ungodly hour in the night. So one time  at   am  I was chatting with a waitress  and I asked her   What's the most ridiculous thing that's happened to you on the job   And she told me that one time  a man walked in completely naked. I said   Great  Sign me up for the graveyard shift   Needless to say  Waffle House did not hire me. So in terms of having Asperger's  it can be viewed as a disadvantage  and sometimes it is a real pain in the butt  but it's also the opposite. It's a gift  and it allows me to think innovatively. At     I won a research competition for my research on coral reefs  and I ended up speaking at the UN Convention of Biological Diversity  presenting this research. Thank you. And at     I'm getting ready to graduate college  and I am a co founder of a biotech company called AutismSees. Thank you. But consider what I had to do to get here     therapists     misdiagnoses  and years of pain and trauma. I spent a lot of time thinking if there's a better way  and I think there is  autism assistive technology. This technology could play an integral role in helping people with autistic spectrum disorder  or ASD. The app Podium  released by my company  AutismSees  has the ability to independently assess and help develop communication skills. In addition to this  it tracks eye contact through camera and simulates a public speaking and job interview experience. And so maybe one day  Waffle House will hire me  after practicing on it some more. And one of the great things is that I've used Podium to help me prepare for today  and it's been a great help. But it's more than that. There's more that can be done. For people with ASD    it has been speculated that many innovative scientists  researchers  artists  and engineers have it  like  for example  Emily Dickinson  Jane Austen  Isaac Newton  and Bill Gates are some examples. But the problem that's encountered is that these brilliant ideas often can't be shared if there are communication roadblocks. And so  many people with autism are being overlooked every day  and they're being taken advantage of. So my dream for people with autism is to change that  to remove the roadblocks that prevent them from succeeding. One of the reasons I love lucid dreaming is because it allows me to be free  without judgment of social and physical consequences. When I'm flying over scenes that I create in my mind  I am at peace. I am free from judgment  and so I can do whatever I want  you know  I'm making out with Brad Pitt  and Angelina is totally cool with it. But the goal of autism assistive technology is bigger than that  and more important. My goal is to shift people's perspective of autism and people with higher functioning Asperger's because there is a lot they can do. I mean  look at Temple Grandin  for example. And by doing so  we allow people to share their talents with this world and move this world forward. In addition  we give them the courage to pursue their dreams in the real world  in real time. Thank you. Thank you. Over the past    years  I've been researching the way people organize and visualize information. And I've noticed an interesting shift. For a long period of time  we believed in a natural ranking order in the world around us  also known as the great chain of being  or  Scala naturae  in Latin  a top down structure that normally starts with God at the very top  followed by angels  noblemen  common people  animals  and so on. This idea was actually based on Aristotle's ontology  which classified all things known to man in a set of opposing categories  like the ones you see behind me. But over time  interestingly enough  this concept adopted the branching schema of a tree in what became known as the Porphyrian tree  also considered to be the oldest tree of knowledge. The branching scheme of the tree was  in fact  such a powerful metaphor for conveying information that it became  over time  an important communication tool to map a variety of systems of knowledge. We can see trees being used to map morality  with the popular tree of virtues and tree of vices  as you can see here  with these beautiful illustrations from medieval Europe. We can see trees being used to map consanguinity  the various blood ties between people. We can also see trees being used to map genealogy  perhaps the most famous archetype of the tree diagram. I think many of you in the audience have probably seen family trees. Many of you probably even have your own family trees drawn in such a way. We can see trees even mapping systems of law  the various decrees and rulings of kings and rulers. And finally  of course  also a very popular scientific metaphor  we can see trees being used to map all species known to man. And trees ultimately became such a powerful visual metaphor because in many ways  they really embody this human desire for order  for balance  for unity  for symmetry. However  nowadays we are really facing new complex  intricate challenges that cannot be understood by simply employing a simple tree diagram. And a new metaphor is currently emerging  and it's currently replacing the tree in visualizing various systems of knowledge. It's really providing us with a new lens to understand the world around us. And this new metaphor is the metaphor of the network. And we can see this shift from trees into networks in many domains of knowledge. We can see this shift in the way we try to understand the brain. While before  we used to think of the brain as a modular  centralized organ  where a given area was responsible for a set of actions and behaviors  the more we know about the brain  the more we think of it as a large music symphony  played by hundreds and thousands of instruments. This is a beautiful snapshot created by the Blue Brain Project  where you can see        neurons and    million connections. And this is only mapping    percent of a mammalian neocortex. We can also see this shift in the way we try to conceive of human knowledge. These are some remarkable trees of knowledge  or trees of science  by Spanish scholar Ramon Llull. And Llull was actually the precursor  the very first one who created the metaphor of science as a tree  a metaphor we use every single day  when we say   Biology is a branch of science   when we say   Genetics is a branch of science.  But perhaps the most beautiful of all trees of knowledge  at least for me  was created for the French encyclopedia by Diderot and d'Alembert in     . This was really the bastion of the French Enlightenment  and this gorgeous illustration was featured as a table of contents for the encyclopedia. And it actually maps out all domains of knowledge as separate branches of a tree. But knowledge is much more intricate than this. These are two maps of Wikipedia showing the inter linkage of articles    related to history on the left  and mathematics on the right. And I think by looking at these maps and other ones that have been created of Wikipedia    arguably one of the largest rhizomatic structures ever created by man    we can really understand how human knowledge is much more intricate and interdependent  just like a network. We can also see this interesting shift in the way we map social ties between people. This is the typical organization chart. I'm assuming many of you have seen a similar chart as well  in your own corporations  or others. It's a top down structure that normally starts with the CEO at the very top  and where you can drill down all the way to the individual workmen on the bottom. But humans sometimes are  well  actually  all humans are unique in their own way  and sometimes you really don't play well under this really rigid structure. I think the Internet is really changing this paradigm quite a lot. This is a fantastic map of online social collaboration between Perl developers. Perl is a famous programming language  and here  you can see how different programmers are actually exchanging files  and working together on a given project. And here  you can notice that this is a completely decentralized process    there's no leader in this organization  it's a network. We can also see this interesting shift when we look at terrorism. One of the main challenges of understanding terrorism nowadays is that we are dealing with decentralized  independent cells  where there's no leader leading the whole process. And here  you can actually see how visualization is being used. The diagram that you see behind me shows all the terrorists involved in the Madrid attack in     . And what they did here is  they actually segmented the network into three different years  represented by the vertical layers that you see behind me. And the blue lines tie together the people that were present in that network year after year. So even though there's no leader per se  these people are probably the most influential ones in that organization  the ones that know more about the past  and the future plans and goals of this particular cell. We can also see this shift from trees into networks in the way we classify and organize species. The image on the right is the only illustration that Darwin included in  The Origin of Species   which Darwin called the  Tree of Life.  There's actually a letter from Darwin to the publisher  expanding on the importance of this particular diagram. It was critical for Darwin's theory of evolution. But recently  scientists discovered that overlaying this tree of life is a dense network of bacteria  and these bacteria are actually tying together species that were completely separated before  to what scientists are now calling not the tree of life  but the web of life  the network of life. And finally  we can really see this shift  again  when we look at ecosystems around our planet. No more do we have these simplified predator versus prey diagrams we have all learned at school. This is a much more accurate depiction of an ecosystem. This is a diagram created by Professor David Lavigne  mapping close to     species that interact with the codfish off the coast of Newfoundland in Canada. And I think here  we can really understand the intricate and interdependent nature of most ecosystems that abound on our planet. But even though recent  this metaphor of the network  is really already adopting various shapes and forms  and it's almost becoming a growing visual taxonomy. It's almost becoming the syntax of a new language. And this is one aspect that truly fascinates me. And these are actually    different typologies I've been collecting over time  and it really shows the immense visual diversity of this new metaphor. And here is an example. On the very top band  you have radial convergence  a visualization model that has become really popular over the last five years. At the top left  the very first project is a gene network  followed by a network of IP addresses    machines  servers    followed by a network of Facebook friends. You probably couldn't find more disparate topics  yet they are using the same metaphor  the same visual model  to map the never ending complexities of its own subject. And here are a few more examples of the many I've been collecting  of this growing visual taxonomy of networks. But networks are not just a scientific metaphor. As designers  researchers  and scientists try to map a variety of complex systems  they are in many ways influencing traditional art fields  like painting and sculpture  and influencing many different artists. And perhaps because networks have this huge aesthetical force to them    they're immensely gorgeous    they are really becoming a cultural meme  and driving a new art movement  which I've called  networkism.  And we can see this influence in this movement in a variety of ways. This is just one of many examples  where you can see this influence from science into art. The example on your left side is IP mapping  a computer generated map of IP addresses  again    servers  machines. And on your right side  you have  Transient Structures and Unstable Networks  by Sharon Molloy  using oil and enamel on canvas. And here are a few more paintings by Sharon Molloy  some gorgeous  intricate paintings. And here's another example of that interesting cross pollination between science and art. On your left side  you have  Operation Smile.  It is a computer generated map of a social network. And on your right side  you have  Field     by Emma McNally  using only graphite on paper. Emma McNally is one of the main leaders of this movement  and she creates these striking  imaginary landscapes  where you can really notice the influence from traditional network visualization. But networkism doesn't happen only in two dimensions. This is perhaps one of my favorite projects of this new movement. And I think the title really says it all    it's called   Galaxies Forming Along Filaments  Like Droplets Along the Strands of a Spider's Web.  And I just find this particular project to be immensely powerful. It was created by Tom s Saraceno  and he occupies these large spaces  creates these massive installations using only elastic ropes. As you actually navigate that space and bounce along those elastic ropes  the entire network kind of shifts  almost like a real organic network would. And here's yet another example of networkism taken to a whole different level. This was created by Japanese artist Chiharu Shiota in a piece called  In Silence.  And Chiharu  like Tom s Saraceno  fills these rooms with this dense network  this dense web of elastic ropes and black wool and thread  sometimes including objects  as you can see here  sometimes even including people  in many of her installations. But networks are also not just a new trend  and it's too easy for us to dismiss it as such. Networks really embody notions of decentralization  of interconnectedness  of interdependence. And this new way of thinking is critical for us to solve many of the complex problems we are facing nowadays  from decoding the human brain  to understanding the vast universe out there. On your left side  you have a snapshot of a neural network of a mouse    very similar to our own at this particular scale. And on your right side  you have the Millennium Simulation. It was the largest and most realistic simulation of the growth of cosmic structure. It was able to recreate the history of    million galaxies in approximately    terabytes of output. And coincidentally or not  I just find this particular comparison between the smallest scale of knowledge    the brain    and the largest scale of knowledge    the universe itself    to be really quite striking and fascinating. Because as Bruce Mau once said   When everything is connected to everything else  for better or for worse  everything matters.  Thank you so much. This is a painting from the   th century from Lucas Cranach the Elder. It shows the famous Fountain of Youth. If you drink its water or you bathe in it  you will get health and youth. Every culture  every civilization has dreamed of finding eternal youth. There are people like Alexander the Great or Ponce De Le n  the explorer  who spent much of their life chasing the Fountain of Youth. They didn't find it. But what if there was something to it  What if there was something to this Fountain of Youth  I will share an absolutely amazing development in aging research that could revolutionize the way we think about aging and how we may treat age related diseases in the future. It started with experiments that showed  in a recent number of studies about growing  that animals    old mice    that share a blood supply with young mice can get rejuvenated. This is similar to what you might see in humans  in Siamese twins  and I know this sounds a bit creepy. But what Tom Rando  a stem cell researcher  reported in       was that old muscle from a mouse can be rejuvenated if it's exposed to young blood through common circulation. This was reproduced by Amy Wagers at Harvard a few years later  and others then showed that similar rejuvenating effects could be observed in the pancreas  the liver and the heart. But what I'm most excited about  and several other labs as well  is that this may even apply to the brain. So  what we found is that an old mouse exposed to a young environment in this model called parabiosis  shows a younger brain    and a brain that functions better. And I repeat  an old mouse that gets young blood through shared circulation looks younger and functions younger in its brain. So when we get older    we can look at different aspects of human cognition  and you can see on this slide here  we can look at reasoning  verbal ability and so forth. And up to around age    or     these functions are all intact  and as I look at the young audience here in the room  we're all still fine. But it's scary to see how all these curves go south. And as we get older  diseases such as Alzheimer's and others may develop. We know that with age  the connections between neurons    the way neurons talk to each other  the synapses    they start to deteriorate  neurons die  the brain starts to shrink  and there's an increased susceptibility for these neurodegenerative diseases. One big problem we have    to try to understand how this really works at a very molecular mechanistic level    is that we can't study the brains in detail  in living people. We can do cognitive tests  we can do imaging    all kinds of sophisticated testing. But we usually have to wait until the person dies to get the brain and look at how it really changed through age or in a disease. This is what neuropathologists do  for example. So  how about we think of the brain as being part of the larger organism. Could we potentially understand more about what happens in the brain at the molecular level if we see the brain as part of the entire body  So if the body ages or gets sick  does that affect the brain  And vice versa  as the brain gets older  does that influence the rest of the body  And what connects all the different tissues in the body is blood. Blood is the tissue that not only carries cells that transport oxygen  for example  the red blood cells  or fights infectious diseases  but it also carries messenger molecules  hormone like factors that transport information from one cell to another  from one tissue to another  including the brain. So if we look at how the blood changes in disease or age  can we learn something about the brain  We know that as we get older  the blood changes as well  so these hormone like factors change as we get older. And by and large  factors that we know are required for the development of tissues  for the maintenance of tissues    they start to decrease as we get older  while factors involved in repair  in injury and in inflammation    they increase as we get older. So there's this unbalance of good and bad factors  if you will. And to illustrate what we can do potentially with that  I want to talk you through an experiment that we did. We had almost     blood samples from healthy human beings    to    years of age  and we measured over     of these communication factors  these hormone like proteins that transport information between tissues. And what we noticed first is that between the youngest and the oldest group  about half the factors changed significantly. So our body lives in a very different environment as we get older  when it comes to these factors. And using statistical or bioinformatics programs  we could try to discover those factors that best predict age    in a way  back calculate the relative age of a person. And the way this looks is shown in this graph. So  on the one axis you see the actual age a person lived  the chronological age. So  how many years they lived. And then we take these top factors that I showed you  and we calculate their relative age  their biological age. And what you see is that there is a pretty good correlation  so we can pretty well predict the relative age of a person. But what's really exciting are the outliers  as they so often are in life. You can see here  the person I highlighted with the green dot is about    years of age but seems to have a biological age  if what we're doing here is really true  of only about   . So is this a person that actually looks much younger than their age  But more importantly  Is this a person who is maybe at a reduced risk to develop an age related disease and will have a long life    will live to     or more  On the other hand  the person here  highlighted with the red dot  is not even     but has a biological age of   . Is this a person at an increased risk of developing an age related disease  So in our lab  we're trying to understand these factors better  and many other groups are trying to understand  what are the true aging factors  and can we learn something about them to possibly predict age related diseases  So what I've shown you so far is simply correlational  right  You can just say   Well  these factors change with age   but you don't really know if they do something about aging. So what I'm going to show you now is very remarkable and it suggests that these factors can actually modulate the age of a tissue. And that's where we come back to this model called parabiosis. So  parabiosis is done in mice by surgically connecting the two mice together  and that leads then to a shared blood system  where we can now ask   How does the old brain get influenced by exposure to the young blood   And for this purpose  we use young mice that are an equivalency of    year old people  and old mice that are roughly    years old in human years. What we found is quite remarkable. We find there are more neural stem cells that make new neurons in these old brains. There's an increased activity of the synapses  the connections between neurons. There are more genes expressed that are known to be involved in the formation of new memories. And there's less of this bad inflammation. But we observed that there are no cells entering the brains of these animals. So when we connect them  there are actually no cells going into the old brain  in this model. Instead  we've reasoned  then  that it must be the soluble factors  so we could collect simply the soluble fraction of blood which is called plasma  and inject either young plasma or old plasma into these mice  and we could reproduce these rejuvenating effects  but what we could also do now is we could do memory tests with mice. As mice get older  like us humans  they have memory problems. It's just harder to detect them  but I'll show you in a minute how we do that. But we wanted to take this one step further  one step closer to potentially being relevant to humans. What I'm showing you now are unpublished studies  where we used human plasma  young human plasma  and as a control  saline  and injected it into old mice  and asked  can we again rejuvenate these old mice  Can we make them smarter  And to do this  we used a test. It's called a Barnes maze. This is a big table that has lots of holes in it  and there are guide marks around it  and there's a bright light  as on this stage here. The mice hate this and they try to escape  and find the single hole that you see pointed at with an arrow  where a tube is mounted underneath where they can escape and feel comfortable in a dark hole. So we teach them  over several days  to find this space on these cues in the space  and you can compare this for humans  to finding your car in a parking lot after a busy day of shopping. Many of us have probably had some problems with that. So  let's look at an old mouse here. This is an old mouse that has memory problems  as you'll notice in a moment. It just looks into every hole  but it didn't form this spacial map that would remind it where it was in the previous trial or the last day. In stark contrast  this mouse here is a sibling of the same age  but it was treated with young human plasma for three weeks  with small injections every three days. And as you noticed  it almost looks around   Where am I      and then walks straight to that hole and escapes. So  it could remember where that hole was. So by all means  this old mouse seems to be rejuvenated    it functions more like a younger mouse. And it also suggests that there is something not only in young mouse plasma  but in young human plasma that has the capacity to help this old brain. So to summarize  we find the old mouse  and its brain in particular  are malleable. They're not set in stone  we can actually change them. It can be rejuvenated. Young blood factors can reverse aging  and what I didn't show you    in this model  the young mouse actually suffers from exposure to the old. So there are old blood factors that can accelerate aging. And most importantly  humans may have similar factors  because we can take young human blood and have a similar effect. Old human blood  I didn't show you  does not have this effect  it does not make the mice younger. So  is this magic transferable to humans  We're running a small clinical study at Stanford  where we treat Alzheimer's patients with mild disease with a pint of plasma from young volunteers     year olds  and do this once a week for four weeks  and then we look at their brains with imaging. We test them cognitively  and we ask their caregivers for daily activities of living. What we hope is that there are some signs of improvement from this treatment. And if that's the case  that could give us hope that what I showed you works in mice might also work in humans. Now  I don't think we will live forever. But maybe we discovered that the Fountain of Youth is actually within us  and it has just dried out. And if we can turn it back on a little bit  maybe we can find the factors that are mediating these effects  we can produce these factors synthetically and we can treat diseases of aging  such as Alzheimer's disease or other dementias. Thank you very much. For more than     years  the telephone companies have provided wiretapping assistance to governments. For much of this time  this assistance was manual. Surveillance took place manually and wires were connected by hand. Calls were recorded to tape. But as in so many other industries  computing has changed everything. The telephone companies built surveillance features into the very core of their networks. I want that to sink in for a second  Our telephones and the networks that carry our calls were wired for surveillance first. First and foremost. So what that means is that when you're talking to your spouse  your children  a colleague or your doctor on the telephone  someone could be listening. Now  that someone might be your own government  it could also be another government  a foreign intelligence service  or a hacker  or a criminal  or a stalker or any other party that breaks into the surveillance system  that hacks into the surveillance system of the telephone companies. But while the telephone companies have built surveillance as a priority  Silicon Valley companies have not. And increasingly  over the last couple years  Silicon Valley companies have built strong encryption technology into their communications products that makes surveillance extremely difficult. For example  many of you might have an iPhone  and if you use an iPhone to send a text message to other people who have an iPhone  those text messages cannot easily be wiretapped. And in fact  according to Apple  they're not able to even see the text messages themselves. Likewise  if you use FaceTime to make an audio call or a video call with one of your friends or loved ones  that  too  cannot be easily wiretapped. And it's not just Apple. WhatsApp  which is now owned by Facebook and used by hundreds of millions of people around the world  also has built strong encryption technology into its product  which means that people in the Global South can easily communicate without their governments  often authoritarian  wiretapping their text messages. So  after     years of being able to listen to any telephone call    anytime  anywhere    you might imagine that government officials are not very happy. And in fact  that's what's happening. Government officials are extremely mad. And they're not mad because these encryption tools are now available. What upsets them the most is that the tech companies have built encryption features into their products and turned them on by default. It's the default piece that matters. In short  the tech companies have democratized encryption. And so  government officials like British Prime Minister David Cameron  they believe that all communications    emails  texts  voice calls    all of these should be available to governments  and encryption is making that difficult. Now  look    I'm extremely sympathetic to their point of view. We live in a dangerous time in a dangerous world  and there really are bad people out there. There are terrorists and other serious national security threats that I suspect we all want the FBI and the NSA to monitor. But those surveillance features come at a cost. The reason for that is that there is no such thing as a terrorist laptop  or a drug dealer's cell phone. We all use the same communications devices. What that means is that if the drug dealers' telephone calls or the terrorists' telephone calls can be intercepted  then so can the rest of ours  too. And I think we really need to ask  Should a billion people around the world be using devices that are wiretap friendly  So the scenario of hacking of surveillance systems that I've described    this is not imaginary. In       the surveillance systems that Google and Microsoft built into their networks    the systems that they use to respond to lawful surveillance requests from the police    those systems were compromised by the Chinese government  because the Chinese government wanted to figure out which of their own agents the US government was monitoring. By the same token  in       the surveillance system built into the network of Vodafone Greece    Greece's largest telephone company    was compromised by an unknown entity  and that feature  the surveillance feature  was used to wiretap the Greek Prime Minister and members of the Greek cabinet. The foreign government or hackers who did that were never caught. And really  this gets to the very problem with these surveillance features  or backdoors. When you build a backdoor into a communications network or piece of technology  you have no way of controlling who's going to go through it. You have no way of controlling whether it'll be used by your side or the other side  by good guys  or by bad guys. And so for that reason  I think that it's better to build networks to be as secure as possible. Yes  this means that in the future  encryption is going to make wiretapping more difficult. It means that the police are going to have a tougher time catching bad guys. But the alternative would mean to live in a world where anyone's calls or anyone's text messages could be surveilled by criminals  by stalkers and by foreign intelligence agencies. And I don't want to live in that kind of world. And so right now  you probably have the tools to thwart many kinds of government surveillance already on your phones and already in your pockets  you just might not realize how strong and how secure those tools are  or how weak the other ways you've used to communicate really are. And so  my message to you is this  We need to use these tools. We need to secure our telephone calls. We need to secure our text messages. I want you to use these tools. I want you to tell your loved ones  I want you to tell your colleagues  Use these encrypted communications tools. Don't just use them because they're cheap and easy  but use them because they're secure. Thank you. I was raised by lesbians in the mountains  and I sort of came like a forest gnome to New York City a while back. Really messed with my head  but I'll get into that later. I'll start with when I was eight years old. I took a wood box  and I buried a dollar bill  a pen and a fork inside this box in Colorado. And I thought some strange humanoids or aliens in     years would find this box and learn about the way our species exchanged ideas  maybe how we ate our spaghetti. I really didn't know. Anyway  this is kind of funny  because here I am     years later  and I'm still making boxes. Now  at some point I was in Hawaii    I like to hike and surf and do all that weird stuff  and I was making a collage for my ma. And I took a dictionary and I ripped it up  and I made it into a sort of Agnes Martin grid  and I poured resin all over it and a bee got stuck. Now  she's afraid of bees and she's allergic to them  so I poured more resin on the canvas  thinking I could hide it or something. Instead  the opposite happened  It sort of created a magnification  like a magnifying glass  on the dictionary text. So what did I do  I built more boxes. This time  I started putting electronics  frogs  strange bottles I'd find in the street    anything I could find    because I was always finding things my whole life  and trying to make relationships and tell stories between these objects. So I started drawing around the objects  and I realized  Holy moly  I can draw in space  I can make free floating lines  like the way you would draw around a dead body at a crime scene. So I took the objects out  and I created my own taxonomy of invented specimens. First  botanical    which you can kind of get a sense of. Then I made some weird insects and creatures. It was really fun  I was just drawing on the layers of resin. And it was cool  because I was actually starting to have shows and stuff  I was making some money  I could take my girlfriend for dinner  and like  go to Sizzler. It was some good shit  man. At some point  I got up to the human form  life size resin sculptures with drawings of humans inside the layers. This was great  except for one thing  I was going to die. I didn't know what to do  because the resin was going to kill me. And I went to bed every night thinking about it. So I tried using glass. I started drawing on the layers of glass  almost like if you drew on a window  then you put another window  and another window  and you had all these windows together that made a three dimensional composition. And this really worked  because I could stop using the resin. So I did this for years  which culminated in a very large work  which I call  The Triptych.   The Triptych  was largely inspired by Hieronymus Bosch's   The  Garden of Earthly Delights   which is a painting in the  Museo del  Prado in Spain. Do you guys know this painting  Good  it's a cool painting. It's kind of ahead of its time  they say. So   The Triptych.  I'll walk you through this piece. It weighs        pounds. It's    feet long. It's double sided  so it's    feet of composition. It's kind of weird. Well  that's the blood fountain. To the left  you have Jesus and the locusts. There's a cave where all these animal headed creatures travel between two worlds. They go from the representational world  to this analog mesh underworld  where they're hiding. This is where the animal headed creatures are by the lighthouse  and they're all about to commit mass suicide into the ocean. The ocean is made up of thousands of elements. This is a bird god tied up to a battleship. Billy Graham is in the ocean  the Horizon from the oil spill  Waldo  Osama Bin Laden's shelter    there's all kinds of weird stuff that you can find if you look really hard  in the ocean. Anyway  this is a lady creature. She's coming out of the ocean  and she's spitting oil into one hand and she has clouds coming out of her other hand. Her hands are like scales  and she has the mythological reference of the Earth and cosmos in balance. So that's one side of  The Triptych.  It's a little narrative thing. That's her hand that she's spitting into. And then  when you go to the other side  she has like a trunk  like a bird's beak  and she's spitting clouds out of her trunk. Then she has an    foot long serpent's tail that connects  The Triptych.  Anyway  her tail catches on fire from the back of the volcano. I don't know why that happened. That happens  you know. Her tail terminates in a cycloptic eyeball  made out of      terrorist cards. Have you guys seen those  They were made in the     's  they're like baseball cards of terrorists. Way ahead of their time. That will bring you to my latest project. I'm in the middle of two projects  One's called  Psychogeographies.  It's about a six year project to make     of these humans. Each one is an archive of our culture  through our ripped up media and matter  whether it's encyclopedias or dictionaries or magazines. But each one acts as a sort of an archive in the shape of a human  and they travel in groups of        or    at a time. They're like cells    they come together  they divide. And you kind of walk through them. It's taking me years. Each one is basically a       pound microscope slide with a human stuck inside. This one has a little cave in his chest. That's his head  there's the chest  you can kind of see the beginning. I'm going to go down the body for you  There's a waterfall coming out of his chest  covering his penis    or not penis  or whatever it is  a kind of androgynous thing. I'll take you quickly through these works  because I can't explain them for too long. There are the layers  you can kind of see it. That's a body getting split in half. This one has two heads  and it's communicating between the two heads. You can see the pills coming out  going into one head from this weird statue. There's a little forest scene inside the chest cavity. Can you see that  Anyway  this talk's all about these boxes  like the boxes we're in. This box we're in  the solar system is a box. This brings you to my latest box. It's a brick box. It's called Pioneer Works. Inside of this box is a physicist  a neuroscientist  a painter  a musician  a writer  a radio station  a museum  a school  a publishing arm to disseminate all the content we make there into the world  a garden. We shake this box up  and all these people kind of start hitting each other like particles. And I think that's the way you change the world. You redefine your insides and the box that you're living in. And you come together to realize that we're all in this together  that this delusion of difference    this idea of countries  of borders  of religion    doesn't work. We're all really made up of the same stuff  in the same box. And if we don't start exchanging that stuff sweetly and nicely  we're all going to die real soon. Thank you very much. I'd like to introduce you to an emerging area of science  one that is still speculative but hugely exciting  and certainly one that's growing very rapidly. Quantum biology asks a very simple question  Does quantum mechanics    that weird and wonderful and powerful theory of the subatomic world of atoms and molecules that underpins so much of modern physics and chemistry    also play a role inside the living cell  In other words  Are there processes  mechanisms  phenomena in living organisms that can only be explained with a helping hand from quantum mechanics  Now  quantum biology isn't new  it's been around since the early     s. But it's only in the last decade or so that careful experiments    in biochemistry labs  using spectroscopy    have shown very clear  firm evidence that there are certain specific mechanisms that require quantum mechanics to explain them. Quantum biology brings together quantum physicists  biochemists  molecular biologists    it's a very interdisciplinary field. I come from quantum physics  so I'm a nuclear physicist. I've spent more than three decades trying to get my head around quantum mechanics. One of the founders of quantum mechanics  Niels Bohr  said  If you're not astonished by it  then you haven't understood it. So I sort of feel happy that I'm still astonished by it. That's a good thing. But it means I study the very smallest structures in the universe    the building blocks of reality. If we think about the scale of size  start with an everyday object like the tennis ball  and just go down orders of magnitude in size    from the eye of a needle down to a cell  down to a bacterium  down to an enzyme    you eventually reach the nano world. Now  nanotechnology may be a term you've heard of. A nanometer is a billionth of a meter. My area is the atomic nucleus  which is the tiny dot inside an atom. It's even smaller in scale. This is the domain of quantum mechanics  and physicists and chemists have had a long time to try and get used to it. Biologists  on the other hand  have got off lightly  in my view. They are very happy with their balls and sticks models of molecules. The balls are the atoms  the sticks are the bonds between the atoms. And when they can't build them physically in the lab  nowadays  they have very powerful computers that will simulate a huge molecule. This is a protein made up of         atoms. It doesn't really require much in the way of quantum mechanics to explain it. Quantum mechanics was developed in the     s. It is a set of beautiful and powerful mathematical rules and ideas that explain the world of the very small. And it's a world that's very different from our everyday world  made up of trillions of atoms. It's a world built on probability and chance. It's a fuzzy world. It's a world of phantoms  where particles can also behave like spread out waves. If we imagine quantum mechanics or quantum physics  then  as the fundamental foundation of reality itself  then it's not surprising that we say quantum physics underpins organic chemistry. After all  it gives us the rules that tell us how the atoms fit together to make organic molecules. Organic chemistry  scaled up in complexity  gives us molecular biology  which of course leads to life itself. So in a way  it's sort of not surprising. It's almost trivial. You say   Well  of course life ultimately must depend of quantum mechanics.  But so does everything else. So does all inanimate matter  made up of trillions of atoms. Ultimately  there's a quantum level where we have to delve into this weirdness. But in everyday life  we can forget about it. Because once you put together trillions of atoms  that quantum weirdness just dissolves away. Quantum biology isn't about this. Quantum biology isn't this obvious. Of course quantum mechanics underpins life at some molecular level. Quantum biology is about looking for the non trivial    the counterintuitive ideas in quantum mechanics    and to see if they do  indeed  play an important role in describing the processes of life. Here is my perfect example of the counterintuitiveness of the quantum world. This is the quantum skier. He seems to be intact  he seems to be perfectly healthy  and yet  he seems to have gone around both sides of that tree at the same time. Well  if you saw tracks like that you'd guess it was some sort of stunt  of course. But in the quantum world  this happens all the time. Particles can multitask  they can be in two places at once. They can do more than one thing at the same time. Particles can behave like spread out waves. It's almost like magic. Physicists and chemists have had nearly a century of trying to get used to this weirdness. I don't blame the biologists for not having to or wanting to learn quantum mechanics. You see  this weirdness is very delicate  and we physicists work very hard to maintain it in our labs. We cool our system down to near absolute zero  we carry out our experiments in vacuums  we try and isolate it from any external disturbance. That's very different from the warm  messy  noisy environment of a living cell. Biology itself  if you think of molecular biology  seems to have done very well in describing all the processes of life in terms of chemistry    chemical reactions. And these are reductionist  deterministic chemical reactions  showing that  essentially  life is made of the same stuff as everything else  and if we can forget about quantum mechanics in the macro world  then we should be able to forget about it in biology  as well. Well  one man begged to differ with this idea. Erwin Schr dinger  of Schr dinger's Cat fame  was an Austrian physicist. He was one of the founders of quantum mechanics in the     s. In       he wrote a book called  What is Life   It was tremendously influential. It influenced Francis Crick and James Watson  the discoverers of the double helix structure of DNA. To paraphrase a description in the book  he says  At the molecular level  living organisms have a certain order  a structure to them that's very different from the random thermodynamic jostling of atoms and molecules in inanimate matter of the same complexity. In fact  living matter seems to behave in this order  in a structure  just like inanimate matter cooled down to near absolute zero  where quantum effects play a very important role. There's something special about the structure    the order    inside a living cell. So  Schr dinger speculated that maybe quantum mechanics plays a role in life. It's a very speculative  far reaching idea  and it didn't really go very far. But as I mentioned at the start  in the last    years  there have been experiments emerging  showing where some of these certain phenomena in biology do seem to require quantum mechanics. I want to share with you just a few of the exciting ones. This is one of the best known phenomena in the quantum world  quantum tunneling. The box on the left shows the wavelike  spread out distribution of a quantum entity    a particle  like an electron  which is not a little ball bouncing off a wall. It's a wave that has a certain probability of being able to permeate through a solid wall  like a phantom leaping through to the other side. You can see a faint smudge of light in the right hand box. Quantum tunneling suggests that a particle can hit an impenetrable barrier  and yet somehow  as though by magic  disappear from one side and reappear on the other. The nicest way of explaining it is if you want to throw a ball over a wall  you have to give it enough energy to get over the top of the wall. In the quantum world  you don't have to throw it over the wall  you can throw it at the wall  and there's a certain non zero probability that it'll disappear on your side  and reappear on the other. This isn't speculation  by the way. We're happy    well   happy  is not the right word    we are familiar with this. Quantum tunneling takes place all the time  in fact  it's the reason our Sun shines. The particles fuse together  and the Sun turns hydrogen into helium through quantum tunneling. Back in the   s and   s  it was discovered that quantum tunneling also takes place inside living cells. Enzymes  those workhorses of life  the catalysts of chemical reactions    enzymes are biomolecules that speed up chemical reactions in living cells  by many  many orders of magnitude. And it's always been a mystery how they do this. Well  it was discovered that one of the tricks that enzymes have evolved to make use of  is by transferring subatomic particles  like electrons and indeed protons  from one part of a molecule to another via quantum tunneling. It's efficient  it's fast  it can disappear    a proton can disappear from one place  and reappear on the other. Enzymes help this take place. This is research that's been carried out back in the   s  particularly by a group in Berkeley  Judith Klinman. Other groups in the UK have now also confirmed that enzymes really do this. Research carried out by my group    so as I mentioned  I'm a nuclear physicist  but I've realized I've got these tools of using quantum mechanics in atomic nuclei  and so can apply those tools in other areas as well. One question we asked is whether quantum tunneling plays a role in mutations in DNA. Again  this is not a new idea  it goes all the way back to the early   s. The two strands of DNA  the double helix structure  are held together by rungs  it's like a twisted ladder. And those rungs of the ladder are hydrogen bonds    protons  that act as the glue between the two strands. So if you zoom in  what they're doing is holding these large molecules    nucleotides    together. Zoom in a bit more. So  this a computer simulation. The two white balls in the middle are protons  and you can see that it's a double hydrogen bond. One prefers to sit on one side  the other  on the other side of the two strands of the vertical lines going down  which you can't see. It can happen that these two protons can hop over. Watch the two white balls. They can jump over to the other side. If the two strands of DNA then separate  leading to the process of replication  and the two protons are in the wrong positions  this can lead to a mutation. This has been known for half a century. The question is  How likely are they to do that  and if they do  how do they do it  Do they jump across  like the ball going over the wall  Or can they quantum tunnel across  even if they don't have enough energy  Early indications suggest that quantum tunneling can play a role here. We still don't know yet how important it is  this is still an open question. It's speculative  but it's one of those questions that is so important that if quantum mechanics plays a role in mutations  surely this must have big implications  to understand certain types of mutations  possibly even those that lead to turning a cell cancerous. Another example of quantum mechanics in biology is quantum coherence  in one of the most important processes in biology  photosynthesis  plants and bacteria taking sunlight  and using that energy to create biomass. Quantum coherence is the idea of quantum entities multitasking. It's the quantum skier. It's an object that behaves like a wave  so that it doesn't just move in one direction or the other  but can follow multiple pathways at the same time. Some years ago  the world of science was shocked when a paper was published showing experimental evidence that quantum coherence takes place inside bacteria  carrying out photosynthesis. The idea is that the photon  the particle of light  the sunlight  the quantum of light captured by a chlorophyll molecule  is then delivered to what's called the reaction center  where it can be turned into chemical energy. And in getting there  it doesn't just follow one route  it follows multiple pathways at once  to optimize the most efficient way of reaching the reaction center without dissipating as waste heat. Quantum coherence taking place inside a living cell. A remarkable idea  and yet evidence is growing almost weekly  with new papers coming out  confirming that this does indeed take place. My third and final example is the most beautiful  wonderful idea. It's also still very speculative  but I have to share it with you. The European robin migrates from Scandinavia down to the Mediterranean  every autumn  and like a lot of other marine animals and even insects  they navigate by sensing the Earth's magnetic field. Now  the Earth's magnetic field is very  very weak  it's     times weaker than a fridge magnet  and yet it affects the chemistry    somehow    within a living organism. That's not in doubt    a German couple of ornithologists  Wolfgang and Roswitha Wiltschko  in the     s  confirmed that indeed  the robin does find its way by somehow sensing the Earth's magnetic field  to give it directional information    a built in compass. The puzzle  the mystery was  How does it do it  Well  the only theory in town    we don't know if it's the correct theory  but the only theory in town    is that it does it via something called quantum entanglement. Inside the robin's retina    I kid you not    inside the robin's retina is a protein called cryptochrome  which is light sensitive. Within cryptochrome  a pair of electrons are quantum entangled. Now  quantum entanglement is when two particles are far apart  and yet somehow remain in contact with each other. Even Einstein hated this idea  he called it  spooky action at a distance.  So if Einstein doesn't like it  then we can all be uncomfortable with it. Two quantum entangled electrons within a single molecule dance a delicate dance that is very sensitive to the direction the bird flies in the Earth's magnetic field. We don't know if it's the correct explanation  but wow  wouldn't it be exciting if quantum mechanics helps birds navigate  Quantum biology is still in it infancy. It's still speculative. But I believe it's built on solid science. I also think that in the coming decade or so  we're going to start to see that actually  it pervades life    that life has evolved tricks that utilize the quantum world. Watch this space. Thank you. The child's symptoms begin with mild fever  headache  muscle pains  followed by vomiting and diarrhea  then bleeding from the mouth  nose and gums. Death follows in the form of organ failure from low blood pressure. Sounds familiar  If you're thinking this is Ebola  actually  in this case  it's not. It's an extreme form of dengue fever  a mosquito born disease which also does not have an effective therapy or a vaccine  and kills        people each year. That is actually twice the number of people that have been killed by Ebola in the nearly four decades that we've known about it. As for measles  so much in the news recently  the death toll is actually tenfold higher. Yet for the last year  it has been Ebola that has stolen all of the headlines and the fear. Clearly  there is something deeply rooted about it  something which scares us and fascinates us more than other diseases. But what is it  exactly  Well  it's hard to acquire Ebola  but if you do  the risk of a horrible death is high. Why  Because right now  we don't have any effective therapy or vaccine available. And so  that's the clue. We may have it someday. So we rightfully fear Ebola  because it doesn't kill as many people as other diseases. In fact  it's much less transmissible than viruses such as flu or measles. We fear Ebola because of the fact that it kills us and we can't treat it. We fear the certain inevitability that comes with Ebola. Ebola has this inevitability that seems to defy modern medical science. But wait a second  why is that  We've known about Ebola since     . We've known what it's capable of. We've had ample opportunity to study it in the    outbreaks that have occurred. And in fact  we've actually had vaccine candidates available now for more than a decade. Why is that those vaccines are just going into clinical trials now  This goes to the fundamental problem we have with vaccine development for infectious diseases. It goes something like this  The people most at risk for these diseases are also the ones least able to pay for vaccines. This leaves little in the way of market incentives for manufacturers to develop vaccines  unless there are large numbers of people who are at risk in wealthy countries. It's simply too commercially risky. As for Ebola  there is absolutely no market at all  so the only reason we have two vaccines in late stage clinical trials now  is actually because of a somewhat misguided fear. Ebola was relatively ignored until September    and the anthrax attacks  when all of a sudden  people perceived Ebola as  potentially  a bioterrorism weapon. Why is it that the Ebola vaccine wasn't fully developed at this point  Well  partially  because it was really difficult    or thought to be difficult    to weaponize the virus  but mainly because of the financial risk in developing it. And this is really the point. The sad reality is  we develop vaccines not based upon the risk the pathogen poses to people  but on how economically risky it is to develop these vaccines. Vaccine development is expensive and complicated. It can cost hundreds of millions of dollars to take even a well known antigen and turn it into a viable vaccine. Fortunately for diseases like Ebola  there are things we can do to remove some of these barriers. The first is to recognize when there's a complete market failure. In that case  if we want vaccines  we have to provide incentives or some type of subsidy. We also need to do a better job at being able to figure out which are the diseases that most threaten us. By creating capabilities within countries  we then create the ability for those countries to create epidemiological and laboratory networks which are capable of collecting and categorizing these pathogens. The data from that then can be used to understand the geographic and genetic diversity  which then can be used to help us understand how these are being changed immunologically  and what type of reactions they promote. So these are the things that can be done  but to do this  if we want to deal with a complete market failure  we have to change the way we view and prevent infectious diseases. We have to stop waiting until we see evidence of a disease becoming a global threat before we consider it as one. So  for Ebola  the paranoid fear of an infectious disease  followed by a few cases transported to wealthy countries  led the global community to come together  and with the work of dedicated vaccine companies  we now have these  Two Ebola vaccines in efficacy trials in the Ebola countries    and a pipeline of vaccines that are following behind. Every year  we spend billions of dollars  keeping a fleet of nuclear submarines permanently patrolling the oceans to protect us from a threat that almost certainly will never happen. And yet  we spend virtually nothing to prevent something as tangible and evolutionarily certain as epidemic infectious diseases. And make no mistake about it    it's not a question of  if   but  when.  These bugs are going to continue to evolve and they're going to threaten the world. And vaccines are our best defense. So if we want to be able to prevent epidemics like Ebola  we need to take on the risk of investing in vaccine development and in stockpile creation. And we need to view this  then  as the ultimate deterrent    something we make sure is available  but at the same time  praying we never have to use it. Thank you. Over a million people are killed each year in disasters. Two and a half million people will be permanently disabled or displaced  and the communities will take    to    years to recover and billions of economic losses. If you can reduce the initial response by one day  you can reduce the overall recovery by a thousand days  or three years. See how that works  If the initial responders can get in  save lives  mitigate whatever flooding danger there is  that means the other groups can get in to restore the water  the roads  the electricity  which means then the construction people  the insurance agents  all of them can get in to rebuild the houses  which then means you can restore the economy  and maybe even make it better and more resilient to the next disaster. A major insurance company told me that if they can get a homeowner's claim processed one day earlier  it'll make a difference of six months in that person getting their home repaired. And that's why I do disaster robotics    because robots can make a disaster go away faster. Now  you've already seen a couple of these. These are the UAVs. These are two types of UAVs  a rotorcraft  or hummingbird  a fixed wing  a hawk. And they're used extensively since         Hurricane Katrina. Let me show you how this hummingbird  this rotorcraft  works. Fantastic for structural engineers. Being able to see damage from angles you can't get from binoculars on the ground or from a satellite image  or anything flying at a higher angle. But it's not just structural engineers and insurance people who need this. You've got things like this fixed wing  this hawk. Now  this hawk can be used for geospatial surveys. That's where you're pulling imagery together and getting  D reconstruction. We used both of these at the Oso mudslides up in Washington State  because the big problem was geospatial and hydrological understanding of the disaster    not the search and rescue. The search and rescue teams had it under control and knew what they were doing. The bigger problem was that river and mudslide might wipe them out and flood the responders. And not only was it challenging to the responders and property damage  it's also putting at risk the future of salmon fishing along that part of Washington State. So they needed to understand what was going on. In seven hours  going from Arlington  driving from the Incident Command Post to the site  flying the UAVs  processing the data  driving back to Arlington command post    seven hours. We gave them in seven hours data that they could take only two to three days to get any other way    and at higher resolution. It's a game changer. And don't just think about the UAVs. I mean  they are sexy    but remember     percent of the world's population lives by water  and that means our critical infrastructure is underwater    the parts that we can't get to  like the bridges and things like that. And that's why we have unmanned marine vehicles  one type of which you've already met  which is SARbot  a square dolphin. It goes underwater and uses sonar. Well  why are marine vehicles so important and why are they very  very important  They get overlooked. Think about the Japanese tsunami        miles of coastland totally devastated  twice the amount of coastland devastated by Hurricane Katrina in the United States. You're talking about your bridges  your pipelines  your ports    wiped out. And if you don't have a port  you don't have a way to get in enough relief supplies to support a population. That was a huge problem at the Haiti earthquake. So we need marine vehicles. Now  let's look at a viewpoint from the SARbot of what they were seeing. We were working on a fishing port. We were able to reopen that fishing port  using her sonar  in four hours. That fishing port was told it was going to be six months before they could get a manual team of divers in  and it was going to take the divers two weeks. They were going to miss the fall fishing season  which was the major economy for that part  which is kind of like their Cape Cod. UMVs  very important. But you know  all the robots I've shown you have been small  and that's because robots don't do things that people do. They go places people can't go. And a great example of that is Bujold. Unmanned ground vehicles are particularly small  so Bujold    Say hello to Bujold. Bujold was used extensively at the World Trade Center to go through Towers      and  . You're climbing into the rubble  rappelling down  going deep in spaces. And just to see the World Trade Center from Bujold's viewpoint  look at this. You're talking about a disaster where you can't fit a person or a dog    and it's on fire. The only hope of getting to a survivor way in the basement  you have to go through things that are on fire. It was so hot  on one of the robots  the tracks began to melt and come off. Robots don't replace people or dogs  or hummingbirds or hawks or dolphins. They do things new. They assist the responders  the experts  in new and innovative ways. The biggest problem is not making the robots smaller  though. It's not making them more heat resistant. It's not making more sensors. The biggest problem is the data  the informatics  because these people need to get the right data at the right time. So wouldn't it be great if we could have experts immediately access the robots without having to waste any time of driving to the site  so whoever's there  use their robots over the Internet. Well  let's think about that. Let's think about a chemical train derailment in a rural county. What are the odds that the experts  your chemical engineer  your railroad transportation engineers  have been trained on whatever UAV that particular county happens to have  Probably  like  none. So we're using these kinds of interfaces to allow people to use the robots without knowing what robot they're using  or even if they're using a robot or not. What the robots give you  what they give the experts  is data. The problem becomes  who gets what data when  One thing to do is to ship all the information to everybody and let them sort it out. Well  the problem with that is it overwhelms the networks  and worse yet  it overwhelms the cognitive abilities of each of the people trying to get that one nugget of information they need to make the decision that's going to make the difference. So we need to think about those kinds of challenges. So it's the data. Going back to the World Trade Center  we tried to solve that problem by just recording the data from Bujold only when she was deep in the rubble  because that's what the USAR team said they wanted. What we didn't know at the time was that the civil engineers would have loved  needed the data as we recorded the box beams  the serial numbers  the locations  as we went into the rubble. We lost valuable data. So the challenge is getting all the data and getting it to the right people. Now  here's another reason. We've learned that some buildings    things like schools  hospitals  city halls    get inspected four times by different agencies throughout the response phases. Now  we're looking  if we can get the data from the robots to share  not only can we do things like compress that sequence of phases to shorten the response time  but now we can begin to do the response in parallel. Everybody can see the data. We can shorten it that way. So really   disaster robotics  is a misnomer. It's not about the robots. It's about the data. So my challenge to you  the next time you hear about a disaster  look for the robots. They may be underground  they may be underwater  they may be in the sky  but they should be there. Look for the robots  because robots are coming to the rescue. Paul Krugman  the Nobel Prize  winner  in economics  once wrote   Productivity is not everything  but in the long run  it is almost everything.  So this is serious. There are not that many things on earth that are  almost everything.  Productivity is the principal driver of the prosperity of a society. So we have a problem. In the largest European economies  productivity used to grow five percent per annum in the '  s  '  s  early '  s. From '   to '    three percent per annum. From '   to '    two percent per annum. Since       less than one percent per annum. The same profile in Japan. The same profile in the US  despite a momentary rebound    years ago  and despite all the technological innovations around us  the Internet  the information  the new information and communication technologies. When productivity grows three percent per annum  you double the standard of living every generation. Every generation is twice as well off as its parents'. When it grows one percent per annum  it takes three generations to double the standard of living. And in this process  many people will be less well off than their parents. They will have less of everything  smaller roofs  or perhaps no roof at all  less access to education  to vitamins  to antibiotics  to vaccination    to everything. Think of all the problems that we're facing at the moment. All. Chances are that they are rooted in the productivity crisis. Why this crisis  Because the basic tenets about efficiency    effectiveness in organizations  in management    have become counterproductive for human efforts. Everywhere in public services    in companies  in the way we work  the way we innovate  invest    try to learn to work better. Take the holy trinity of efficiency  clarity  measurement  accountability. They make human efforts derail. There are two ways to look at it  to prove it. One  the one I prefer  is rigorous  elegant  nice    math. But the full math version takes a little while  so there is another one. It is to look at a relay race. This is what we will do today. It's a bit more animated  more visual and also faster    it's a race. Hopefully  it's faster. World championship final    women. Eight teams in the final. The fastest team is the US team. They have the fastest women on earth. They are the favorite team to win. Notably  if you compare them to an average team  say  the French team  based on their best performances in the     meter race  if you add the individual times of the US runners  they arrive at the finish line  .  meters ahead of the French team. And this year  the US team is in great shape. Based on their best performance this year  they arrive  .  meters ahead of the French team  based on the data. We are going to look at the race. At some point you will see  towards the end  that Torri Edwards  the fourth US runner  is ahead. Not surprising    this year she got the gold medal in the     meter race. And by the way  Chryste Gaines  the second runner in the US team  is the fastest woman on earth. So  there are  .  billion women on earth. Where are the two fastest  On the US team. And the two other runners on the US team are not bad  either. So clearly  the US team has won the war for talent. But behind  the average team is trying to catch up. Let's watch the race. Yves Morieux  So what happened  The fastest team did not win  the slower one did. By the way  I hope you appreciate the deep historical research I did to make the French look good. But let's not exaggerate    it's not archeology  either. But why  Because of cooperation. When you hear this sentence   Thanks to cooperation  the whole is worth more than the sum of the parts.  This is not poetry  this is not philosophy. This is math. Those who carry the baton are slower  but their baton is faster. Miracle of cooperation  it multiplies energy  intelligence in human efforts. It is the essence of human efforts  how we work together  how each effort contributes to the efforts of others. With cooperation  we can do more with less. Now  what happens to cooperation when the holy grail    the holy trinity  even    of clarity  measurement  accountability    appears  Clarity. Management reports are full of complaints about the lack of clarity. Compliance audits  consultants' diagnostics. We need more clarity  we need to clarify the roles  the processes. It is as though the runners on the team were saying   Let's be clear    where does my role really start and end  Am I supposed to run for    meters        ...   It's important  let's be clear. If you say     after    meters  people will drop the baton  whether there is someone to take it or not. Accountability. We are constantly trying to put accountability in someone's hands. Who is accountable for this process  We need somebody accountable for this process. So in the relay race  since passing the baton is so important  then we need somebody clearly accountable for passing the baton. So between each runner  now we will have a new dedicated athlete  clearly dedicated to taking the baton from one runner  and passing it to the next runner. And we will have at least two like that. Well  will we  in that case  win the race  That I don't know  but for sure  we would have a clear interface  a clear line of accountability. We will know who to blame. But we'll never win the race. If you think about it  we pay more attention to knowing who to blame in case we fail  than to creating the conditions to succeed. All the human intelligence put in organization design    urban structures  processing systems    what is the real goal  To have somebody guilty in case they fail. We are creating organizations able to fail  but in a compliant way  with somebody clearly accountable when we fail. And we are quite effective at that    failing. Measurement. What gets measured gets done. Look  to pass the baton  you have to do it at the right time  in the right hand  at the right speed. But to do that  you have to put energy in your arm. This energy that is in your arm will not be in your legs. It will come at the expense of your measurable speed. You have to shout early enough to the next runner when you will pass the baton  to signal that you are arriving  so that the next runner can prepare  can anticipate. And you have to shout loud. But the blood  the energy that will be in your throat will not be in your legs. Because you know  there are eight people shouting at the same time. So you have to recognize the voice of your colleague. You cannot say   Is it you   Too late  Now  let's look at the race in slow motion  and concentrate on the third runner. Look at where she allocates her efforts  her energy  her attention. Not all in her legs    that would be great for her own speed    but in also in her throat  arm  eye  brain. That makes a difference in whose legs  In the legs of the next runner. But when the next runner runs super fast  is it because she made a super effort  or because of the way the third runner passed the baton  There is no metric on earth that will give us the answer. And if we reward people on the basis of their measurable performance  they will put their energy  their attention  their blood in what can get measured    in their legs. And the baton will fall and slow down. To cooperate is not a super effort  it is how you allocate your effort. It is to take a risk  because you sacrifice the ultimate protection granted by objectively measurable individual performance. It is to make a super difference in the performance of others  with whom we are compared. It takes being stupid to cooperate  then. And people are not stupid  they don't cooperate. You know  clarity  accountability  measurement were OK when the world was simpler. But business has become much more complex. With my teams  we have measured the evolution of complexity in business. It is much more demanding today to attract and retain customers  to build advantage on a global scale  to create value. And the more business gets complex  the more  in the name of clarity  accountability  measurement we multiply structures  processes  systems. You know  this drive for clarity and accountability triggers a counterproductive multiplication of interfaces  middle offices  coordinators that do not only mobilize people and resources  but that also add obstacles. And the more complicated the organization  the more difficult it is to understand what is really happening. So we need summaries  proxies  reports  key performance indicators  metrics. So people put their energy in what can get measured  at the expense of cooperation. And as performance deteriorates  we add even more structure  process  systems. People spend their time in meetings  writing reports they have to do  undo and redo. Based on our analysis  teams in these organizations spend between    and    percent of their time wasting their time  but working harder and harder  longer and longer  on less and less value adding activities. This is what is killing productivity  what makes people suffer at work. Our organizations are wasting human intelligence. They have turned against human efforts. When people don't cooperate  don't blame their mindsets  their mentalities  their personality    look at the work situations. Is it really in their personal interest to cooperate or not  if  when they cooperate  they are individually worse off  Why would they cooperate  When we blame personalities instead of the clarity  the accountability  the measurement  we add injustice to ineffectiveness. We need to create organizations in which it becomes individually useful for people to cooperate. Remove the interfaces  the middle offices    all these complicated coordination structures. Don't look for clarity  go for fuzziness. Fuzziness overlaps. Remove most of the quantitative metrics to assess performance. Speed the  what.  Look at cooperation  the  how.  How did you pass the baton  Did you throw it  or did you pass it effectively  Am I putting my energy in what can get measured    my legs  my speed    or in passing the baton  You  as leaders  as managers  are you making it individually useful for people to cooperate  The future of our organizations  our companies  our societies hinges on your answer to these questions. Thank you. When I was    years old  I was interested in science    fascinated by it  excited to learn about it. And I had a high school science teacher who would say to the class   The girls don't have to listen to this.  Encouraging  yes. I chose not to listen    but to that statement alone. So let me take you to the Andes mountains in Chile      kilometers      miles northeast of Santiago. It's very remote  it's very dry and it's very beautiful. And there's not much there. There are condors  there are tarantulas  and at night  when the light dims  it reveals one of the darkest skies on Earth. It's kind of a magic place  the mountain. It's a wonderful combination of very remote mountaintop with exquisitely sophisticated technology. And our ancestors  for as long as there's been recorded history  have looked at the night sky and pondered the nature of our existence. And we're no exception  our generation. The only difficulty is that the night sky now is blocked by the glare of city lights. And so astronomers go to these very remote mountaintops to view and to study the cosmos. So telescopes are our window to the cosmos. It's no exaggeration to say that the Southern Hemisphere is going to be the future of astronomy for the   st century. We have an array of existing telescopes already  in the Andes mountains in Chile  and that's soon to be joined by a really sensational array of new capability. There will be two international groups that are going to be building giant telescopes  sensitive to optical radiation  as our eyes are. There will be a survey telescope that will be scanning the sky every few nights. There will be radio telescopes  sensitive to long wavelength radio radiation. And then there will be telescopes in space. There'll be a successor to the Hubble Space Telescope  it's called the James Webb Telescope  and it will be launched in     . There'll be a satellite called TESS that will discover planets outside of our solar system. For the last decade  I've been leading a group    a consortium    international group  to build what will be  when it's finished  the largest optical telescope in existence. It's called the Giant Magellan Telescope  or GMT. This telescope is going to have mirrors that are  .  meters in diameter    each of the mirrors. That's almost    feet. So it dwarfs this stage    maybe out to the fourth row in this audience. Each of the seven mirrors in this telescope will be almost    feet in diameter. Together  the seven mirrors in this telescope will comprise    feet in diameter. So  essentially the size of this entire auditorium. The whole telescope will stand about    meters high  and again  being in Rio  some of you have been to see the statue of the giant Christ. The scale is comparable in height  in fact  it's smaller than this telescope will be. It's comparable to the size of the Statue of Liberty. And it's going to be housed in an enclosure that's    stories       meters high. But it's an unusual building to protect this telescope. It will have open windows to the sky  be able to point and look at the sky  and it will actually rotate on a base          tons of rotating building. The Giant Magellan Telescope will have    times the resolution of the Hubble Space Telescope. It will be    million times more sensitive than the human eye. And it may  for the first time ever  be capable of finding life on planets outside of our solar system. It's going to allow us to look back at the first light in the universe    literally  the dawn of the cosmos. The cosmic dawn. It's a telescope that's going to allow us to peer back  witness galaxies as they were when they were actually assembling  the first black holes in the universe  the first galaxies. Now  for thousands of years  we have been studying the cosmos  we've been wondering about our place in the universe. The ancient Greeks told us that the Earth was the center of the universe. Five hundred years ago  Copernicus displaced the Earth  and put the Sun at the heart of the cosmos. And as we've learned over the centuries  since Galileo Galilei  the Italian scientist  first turned  in that time  a two inch  very small telescope  to the sky  every time we have built larger telescopes  we have learned something about the universe  we've made discoveries  without exception. We've learned in the   th century that the universe is expanding and that our own solar system is not at the center of that expansion. We know now that the universe is made of about     billion galaxies that are visible to us  and each one of those galaxies has     billion stars within it. So we're looking now at the deepest image of the cosmos that's ever been taken. It was taken using the Hubble Space Telescope  and by pointing the telescope at what was previously a blank region of sky  before the launch of Hubble. And if you can imagine this tiny area  it's only one fiftieth of the size of the full moon. So  if you can imagine the full moon. And there are now        galaxies visible within that image. And the faintness of those images and the tiny size is only a result of the fact that those galaxies are so far away  the vast distances. And each of those galaxies may contain within it a few billion or even hundreds of billions of individual stars. Telescopes are like time machines. So the farther back we look in space  the further back we see in time. And they're like light buckets    literally  they collect light. So larger the bucket  the larger the mirror we have  the more light we can see  and the farther back we can view. So  we've learned in the last century that there are exotic objects in the universe    black holes. We've even learned that there's dark matter and dark energy that we can't see. So you're looking now at an actual image of dark matter. You got it. Not all audiences get that. So the way we infer the presence of dark matter    we can't see it    but there's an unmistakable tug  due to gravity. We now can look out  we see this sea of galaxies in a universe that's expanding. What I do myself is to measure the expansion of the universe  and one of the projects that I carried out in the     s used the Hubble Space Telescope to measure how fast the universe is expanding. We can now trace back to    billion years. We've learned over time that stars have individual histories  that is  they have birth  they have middle ages and some of them even have dramatic deaths. So the embers from those stars actually then form the new stars that we see  most of which turn out to have planets going around them. And one of the really surprising results in the last    years has been the discovery of other planets going around other stars. These are called exoplanets. And until       we didn't even know the existence of any other planets  other than going around our own sun. But now  there are almost       other planets orbiting other stars that we can now detect  measure masses for. There are     of those that are multiple planet systems. And there are          and still counting    other candidates for planets orbiting other stars. They come in a bewildering variety of different kinds. There are Jupiter like planets that are hot  there are other planets that are icy  there are water worlds and there are rocky planets like the Earth  so called  super Earths   and there have even been planets that have been speculated diamond worlds. So we know there's at least one planet  our own Earth  in which there is life. We've even found planets that are orbiting two stars. That's no longer the province of science fiction. So around our own planet  we know there's life  we've developed a complex life  we now can question our own origins. And given all that we've discovered  the overwhelming numbers now suggest that there may be millions  perhaps    maybe even hundreds of millions    of other  planets  that are close enough    just the right distance from their stars that they're orbiting    to have the existence of liquid water and maybe could potentially support life. So we marvel now at those odds  the overwhelming odds  and the amazing thing is that within the next decade  the GMT may be able to take spectra of the atmospheres of those planets  and determine whether or not they have the potential for life. So  what is the GMT project  It's an international project. It includes Australia  South Korea  and I'm happy to say  being here in Rio  that the newest partner in our telescope is Brazil. It also includes a number of institutions across the United States  including Harvard University  the Smithsonian and the Carnegie Institutions  and the Universities of Arizona  Chicago  Texas Austin and Texas A M University. It also involves Chile. So  the making of the mirrors in this telescope is also fascinating in its own right. Take chunks of glass  melt them in a furnace that is itself rotating. This happens underneath the football stadium at the University of Arizona. It's tucked away under        seats. Nobody know it's happening. And there's essentially a rotating cauldron. The mirrors are cast and they're cooled very slowly  and then they're polished to an exquisite precision. And so  if you think about the precision of these mirrors  the bumps on the mirror  over the entire    feet  amount to less than one millionth of an inch. So  can you visualize that  Ow  That's one five thousandths of the width of one of my hairs  over this entire    feet. It's a spectacular achievement. It's what allows us to have the precision that we will have. So  what does that precision buy us  So the GMT  if you can imagine    if I were to hold up a coin  which I just happen to have  and I look at the face of that coin  I can see from here the writing on the coin  I can see the face on that coin. My guess that even in the front row  you can't see that. But if we were to turn the Giant Magellan Telescope  all    feet diameter that we see in this auditorium  and point it     miles away  if I were standing in S o Paulo  we could resolve the face of this coin. That's the extraordinary resolution and power of this telescope. And if we were    If an astronaut went up to the Moon  a quarter of a million miles away  and lit a candle    a single candle    then we would be able to detect it  using the GMT. Quite extraordinary. This is a simulated image of a cluster in a nearby galaxy.  Nearby  is astronomical  it's all relative. It's tens of millions of light years away. This is what this cluster would look like. So look at those four bright objects  and now lets compare it with a camera on the Hubble Space Telescope. You can see faint detail that starts to come through. And now finally    and look how dramatic this is    this is what the GMT will see. So  keep your eyes on those bright images again. This is what we see on one of the most powerful existing telescopes on the Earth  and this  again  what the GMT will see. Extraordinary precision. So  where are we  We have now leveled the top of the mountaintop in Chile. We blasted that off. We've tested and polished the first mirror. We've cast the second and the third mirrors. And we're about to cast the fourth mirror. We had a series of reviews this year  international panels that came in and reviewed us  and said   You're ready to go to construction.  And so we plan on building this telescope with the first four mirrors. We want to get on the air quickly  and be taking science data    what we astronomers call  first light   in     . And the full telescope will be finished in the middle of the next decade  with all seven mirrors. So we're now poised to look back at the distant universe  the cosmic dawn. We'll be able to study other planets in exquisite detail. But for me  one of the most exciting things about building the GMT is the opportunity to actually discover something that we don't know about    that we can't even imagine at this point  something completely new. And my hope is that with the construction of this and other facilities  that many young women and men will be inspired to reach for the stars. Thank you very much. Obrigado. Bruno Giussani  Thank you  Wendy. Stay with me  because I have a question for you. You mentioned different facilities. So the Magellan Telescope is going up  but also ALMA and others in Chile and elsewhere  including in Hawaii. Is it about cooperation and complementarity  or about competition  I know there's competition in terms of funding  but what about the science  Wendy Freedman  In terms of the science  they're very complementary. The telescopes that are in space  the telescopes on the ground  telescopes with different wavelength capability  telescopes even that are similar  but different instruments    they will all look at different parts of the questions that we're asking. So when we discover other planets  we'll be able to test those observations  we'll be able to measure the atmospheres  be able to look in space with very high resolution. So  they're very complementary. You're right about the funding  we compete  but scientifically  it's very complementary. BG  Wendy  thank you very much for coming to TEDGlobal. WF  Thank you. I will always remember the first time I met the girl in the blue uniform. I was eight at the time  living in the village with my grandmother  who was raising me and other children. Famine had hit my country of Zimbabwe  and we just didn't have enough to eat. We were hungry. And that's when the girl in the blue uniform came to my village with the United Nations to feed the children. As she handed me my porridge  I asked her why she was there  and without hesitation  she said   As Africans  we must uplift all the people of Africa.  I had absolutely no idea what she meant. But her words stuck with me. Two years later  famine hit my country for the second time. My grandmother had no choice but to send me to the city to live with an aunt I had never met before. So at the age of     I found myself in school for the very first time. And there  at the city school  I would experience what it was to be unequal. You see  in the village  we were all equal. But in the eyes and the minds of the other kids  I was not their equal. I couldn't speak English  and I was way behind in terms of reading and writing. But this feeling of inequality would get even more complex. Every school holiday spent back in the village with my grandmother made me consciously aware of the inequalities this incredible opportunity had created within my own family. Suddenly  I had much more than the rest of my village. And in their eyes  I was no longer their equal. I felt guilty. But I thought about the girl in the blue uniform  and I remember thinking   That's who I want to be    someone like her  someone who uplifts other people.  This childhood experience led me to the United Nations  and to my current role with UN Women  where we are addressing one of the greatest inequalities that affects more than half of the world's population    women and girls. Today  I want to share with you a simple idea that seeks to uplift all of us together. Eight months ago  under the visionary leadership of Phumzile Mlambo Ngcuka  head of UN Women  we launched a groundbreaking initiative called HeForShe  inviting men and boys from around the world to stand in solidarity with each other and with women  to create a shared vision for gender equality. This is an invitation for those who believe in equality for women and men  and those who don't yet know that they believe. The initiative is based on a simple idea  that what we share is much more powerful than what divides us. We all feel the same things. We all want the same things  even when those things sometimes remain unspoken. HeForShe is about uplifting all of us  women and men together. It's moving us towards an inflection point for gender equality. Imagine a blank page with one horizontal line splitting it in half. Now imagine that women are represented here  and men are represented here. In our current population  HeForShe is about moving the  .  billion men  one man at a time  across that line  so that ultimately  men can stand alongside women and be on the right side of history  making gender equality a reality in the   st century. However  engaging men in the movement would prove quite controversial. Why invite men  They are the problem. In fact  men don't care  we were told. But something incredible happened when we launched HeForShe. In just three days  more than         men had signed up and committed to be agents of change for equality. Within that first week  at least one man in every single country in the world stood up to be counted  and within that same week  HeForShe created more than  .  billion conversations on social media. And that's when the emails started pouring in  sometimes as many as a thousand a day. We heard from a man out of Zimbabwe  who  after hearing about HeForShe  created a  husband school.  He literally went around his village  hand picking all of the men that were abusive to their partners  and committed to turn them into better husbands and fathers. In Pune  India  a youth advocate organized an innovative bicycle rally  mobilizing     cyclists to share the HeForShe messages within their own community. In another impact story  a man sent a very personal note of something that had happened in his own community. He wrote   Dear Madam  I have lived all of my life next door to a man who continuously beats up his wife. Two weeks ago  I was listening to my radio  and your voice came on  and you spoke about something called the HeForShe  and the need for men to play their role. Within a few hours  I heard the woman cry again next door  but for the first time  I didn't just sit there. I felt compelled to do something  so I went over and I confronted the husband. Madam  it has been two weeks  and the woman has not cried since. Thank you for giving me a voice.  Personal impact stories such as these show that we are tapping into something within men  but getting to a world where women and men are equal is not just a matter of bringing men to the cause. We want concrete  systematic  structural change that can equalize the political  economic and social realities for women and men. We are asking men to make concrete actions  calling them to intervene at a personal level  to change their behavior. We are calling upon governments  businesses  universities  to change their policies. We want male leaders to become role models and change agents within their own institutions. Already  a number of prominent men and leaders have stepped up and made some concrete HeForShe commitments. In a few early success stories  a leading French hospitality company  Accor  has committed to eliminate the pay gap for all of its         employees by     . The government of Sweden  under its current feminist government  has committed to close both the employment and the pay gap for all of its citizens within the current electoral term. In Japan  the University of Nagoya is building  as part of their HeForShe commitments  what will become one of Japan's leading gender research centers. Now  eight months later  a movement is building. We are seeing men sign up from every single walk of life  and from every single corner in the world  from the United Nations' own Secretary General Ban Ki moon to the Secretary Generals of NATO and the EU Council  from the prime minister of Bhutan to the president of Sierra Leone. In Europe alone  all the male EU Commissioners and the members of Parliament of the Swedish and Iceland governments have signed up to be HeForShe. In fact  one in    men in Iceland has joined the movement. The rallying call of our passionate goodwill ambassador  Emma Watson  has garnered more than five billion media impressions  mobilizing hundreds and thousands of students around the world to create more than a hundred HeForShe student associations. Now this is the beginning of the vision that HeForShe has for the world that we want to see. Einstein once said   A human being is part of the whole ... but he experiences himself  his thoughts and feelings  as something separate from the rest ... This delusion is a kind of prison for us ... Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion.  If women and men are part of a greater whole  as Einstein suggests  it is my hope that HeForShe can help free us to realize that it is not our gender that defines us  but ultimately  our shared humanity. HeForShe is tapping into women's and men's dreams  the dreams that we have for ourselves  and the dreams that we have for our families  our children  friends  communities. So that's what it is about. HeForShe is about uplifting all of us together. Thank you. If you want to buy high quality  low price cocaine  there really is only one place to go  and that is the dark net anonymous markets. Now  you can't get to these sites with a normal browser    Chrome or Firefox    because they're on this hidden part of the Internet  known as Tor hidden services  where URLs are a string of meaningless numbers and letters that end in .onion  and which you access with a special browser called the Tor browser. Now  the Tor browser was originally a U.S. Naval intelligence project. It then became open source  and it allows anybody to browse the net without giving away their location. And it does this by encrypting your IP address and then routing it via several other computers around the world that use the same software. You can use it on the normal Internet  but it's also your key to the dark net. And because of this fiendishly clever encryption system  the    or       we don't know exactly    thousand sites that operate there are incredibly difficult to shut down. It is a censorship free world visited by anonymous users. Little wonder  then  that it's a natural place to go for anybody with something to hide  and that something  of course  need not be illegal. On the dark net  you will find whistle blower sites  The New Yorker. You will find political activism blogs. You will find libraries of pirated books. But you'll also find the drugs markets  illegal pornography  commercial hacking services  and much more besides. Now  the dark net is one of the most interesting  exciting places anywhere on the net. And the reason is  because although innovation  of course  takes place in big businesses  takes place in world class universities  it also takes place in the fringes  because those on the fringes    the pariahs  the outcasts    they're often the most creative  because they have to be. In this part of the Internet  you will not find a single lolcat  a single pop up advert anywhere. And that's one of the reasons why I think many of you here will be on the dark net fairly soon. Not that I'm suggesting anyone in this audience would use it to go and procure high quality narcotics. But let's say for a moment that you were. Bear with me. The first thing you will notice on signing up to one of these sites is how familiar it looks. Every single product    thousands of products    has a glossy  high res image  a detailed product description  a price. There's a  Proceed to checkout  icon. There is even  most beautifully of all  a  Report this item  button. Incredible. You browse through the site  you make your choice  you pay with the crypto currency bitcoin  you enter an address     preferably not your home address    and you wait for your product to arrive in the post  which it nearly always does. And the reason it does is not because of the clever encryption. That's important. Something far simpler than that. It's the user reviews. You see  every single vendor on these sites uses a pseudonym  naturally enough  but they keep the same pseudonym to build up a reputation. And because it's easy for the buyer to change allegiance whenever they want  the only way of trusting a vendor is if they have a good history of positive feedback from other users of the site. And this introduction of competition and choice does exactly what the economists would predict. Prices tend to go down  product quality tends to go up  and the vendors are attentive  they're polite  they're consumer centric  offering you all manner of special deals  one offs  buy one get one frees  free delivery  to keep you happy. I spoke to Drugsheaven. Drugsheaven was offering excellent and consistent marijuana at a reasonable price. He had a very generous refund policy  detailed T's and C's  and good shipping times.  Dear Drugsheaven   I wrote  via the internal emailing system that's also encrypted  of course.  I'm new here. Do you mind if I buy just one gram of marijuana   A couple of hours later  I get a reply. They always reply.  Hi there  thanks for your email. Starting small is a wise thing to do. I would  too  if I were you.   So no problem if you'd like to start with just one gram. I do hope we can do business together. Best wishes  Drugsheaven.  I don't know why he had a posh English accent  but I assume he did. Now  this kind of consumer centric attitude is the reason why  when I reviewed         pieces of feedback that had been left on one of these sites over a three month period     percent of them were five out of five. The customer  you see  is king. But what does that mean  Well  on the one hand  that means there are more drugs  more available  more easily  to more people. And by my reckoning  that is not a good thing. But  on the other hand  if you are going to take drugs  you have a reasonably good way of guaranteeing a certain level of purity and quality  which is incredibly important if you're taking drugs. And you can do so from the comfort of your own home  without the risks associated with buying on the streets. Now  as I said  you've got to be creative and innovative to survive in this marketplace. And the    or so sites that are currently in operation    by the way  they don't always work  they're not always perfect  the site that I showed you was shut down    months ago  but not before it had turned over a billion dollars' worth of trade. But these markets  because of the difficult conditions in which they are operating  the inhospitable conditions  are always innovating  always thinking of ways of getting smarter  more decentralized  harder to censor  and more customer friendly. Let's take the payment system. You don't pay with your credit card  of course    that would lead directly back to you. So you use the crypto currency bitcoin  which is easily exchanged for real world currencies and gives quite a high degree of anonymity to its users. But at the beginning of these sites  people noticed a flaw. Some of the unscrupulous dealers were running away with peoples' bitcoin before they'd mailed the drugs out. The community came up with a solution  called multi signature escrow payments. So on purchasing my item  I would send my bitcoin to a neutral  secure third digital wallet. The vendor  who would see that I'd sent it  would be confident that they could then send the product to me  and then when I received it  at least two of the three people engaged in the transaction    vendor  buyer  site administrator    would have to sign the transaction off with a unique digital signature  and then the money would be transferred. Brilliant  Elegant. It works. But then they realized there was a problem with bitcoin  because every bitcoin transaction is actually recorded publicly in a public ledger. So if you're clever  you can try and work out who's behind them. So they came up with a tumbling service. Hundreds of people send their bitcoin into one address  they're tumbled and jumbled up  and then the right amount is sent on to the right recipients  but they're different bitcoins  micro laundering systems. It's incredible. Interested in what drugs are trending right now on the dark net markets  Check Grams  the search engine. You can even buy some advertising space. Are you an ethical consumer worried about what the drugs industry is doing  Yeah. One vendor will offer you fair trade organic cocaine. That's not being sourced from Colombian druglords  but Guatemalan farmers. They even promised to reinvest    percent of any profits into local education programs. There's even a mystery shopper. Now  whatever you think about the morality of these sites    and I submit that it's not actually an easy question    the creation of functioning  competitive  anonymous markets  where nobody knows who anybody else is  constantly at risk of being shut down by the authorities  is a staggering achievement  a phenomenal achievement. And it's that kind of innovation that's why those on the fringes are often the harbingers of what is to come. It's easy to forget that because of its short life  the Internet has actually changed many times over the last    years or so. It started in the '  s as a military project  morphed in the     s to an academic network  co opted by commercial companies in the '  s  and then invaded by all of us via social media in the noughties  but I think it's going to change again. And I think things like the dark net markets    creative  secure  difficult to censor    I think that's the future. And the reason it's the future is because we're all worried about our privacy. Surveys consistently show concerns about privacy. The more time we spend online  the more we worry about them  and those surveys show our worries are growing. We're worried about what happens to our data. We're worried about who might be watching us. Since the revelations from Edward Snowden  there's been a huge increase in the number of people using various privacy enhancing tools. There are now between two and three million daily users of the Tor browser  the majority of which use is perfectly legitimate  sometimes even mundane. And there are hundreds of activists around the world working on techniques and tools to keep you private online    default encrypted messaging services. Ethereum  which is a project which tries to link up the connected but unused hard drives of millions of computers around the world  to create a sort of distributed Internet that no one really controls. Now  we've had distributed computing before  of course. We use it for everything from Skype to the search for extraterrestrial life. But you add distributed computing and powerful encryption    that's very  very hard to censor and control. Another called MaidSafe works on similar principles. Another called Twister  and so on and so on. And here's the thing    the more of us join  the more interesting those sites become  and then the more of us join  and so on. And I think that's what's going to happen. In fact  it's already happening. The dark net is no longer a den for dealers and a hideout for whistle blowers. It's already going mainstream. Just recently  the musician Aphex Twin released his album as a dark net site. Facebook has started a dark net site. A group of London architects have opened a dark net site for people worried about regeneration projects. Yes  the dark net is going mainstream  and I predict that fairly soon  every social media company  every major news outlet  and therefore most of you in this audience  will be using the dark net  too. So the Internet is about to get more interesting  more exciting  more innovative  more terrible  more destructive. That's good news if you care about liberty. It's good news if you care about freedom. It's good news if you care about democracy. It's also good news if you want to browse for illegal pornography and if you want to buy and sell drugs with impunity. Neither entirely dark  nor entirely light. It's not one side or the other that's going to win out  but both. Thank you very much  indeed. Chris Anderson  You were something of a mathematical phenom. You had already taught at Harvard and MIT at a young age. And then the NSA came calling. What was that about  Jim Simons  Well the NSA    that's the National Security Agency    they didn't exactly come calling. They had an operation at Princeton  where they hired mathematicians to attack secret codes and stuff like that. And I knew that existed. And they had a very good policy  because you could do half your time at your own mathematics  and at least half your time working on their stuff. And they paid a lot. So that was an irresistible pull. So  I went there. CA  You were a code cracker. JS  I was. CA  Until you got fired. JS  Well  I did get fired. Yes. CA  How come  JS  Well  how come  I got fired because  well  the Vietnam War was on  and the boss of bosses in my organization was a big fan of the war and wrote a New York Times article  a magazine section cover story  about how we would win in Vietnam. And I didn't like that war  I thought it was stupid. And I wrote a letter to the Times  which they published  saying not everyone who works for Maxwell Taylor  if anyone remembers that name  agrees with his views. And I gave my own views ... CA  Oh  OK. I can see that would    JS  ... which were different from General Taylor's. But in the end  nobody said anything. But then  I was    years old at this time  and some kid came around and said he was a stringer from Newsweek magazine and he wanted to interview me and ask what I was doing about my views. And I told him   I'm doing mostly mathematics now  and when the war is over  then I'll do mostly their stuff.  Then I did the only intelligent thing I'd done that day    I told my local boss that I gave that interview. And he said   What'd you say   And I told him what I said. And then he said   I've got to call Taylor.  He called Taylor  that took    minutes. I was fired five minutes after that. CA  OK. JS  But it wasn't bad. CA  It wasn't bad  because you went on to Stony Brook and stepped up your mathematical career. You started working with this man here. Who is this  JS  Oh   Shiing Shen  Chern. Chern was one of the great mathematicians of the century. I had known him when I was a graduate student at Berkeley. And I had some ideas  and I brought them to him and he liked them. Together  we did this work which you can easily see up there. There it is. CA  It led to you publishing a famous paper together. Can you explain at all what that work was  JS  No. JS  I mean  I could explain it to somebody. CA  How about explaining this  JS  But not many. Not many people. CA  I think you told me it had something to do with spheres  so let's start here. JS  Well  it did  but I'll say about that work    it did have something to do with that  but before we get to that    that work was good mathematics. I was very happy with it  so was Chern. It even started a little sub field that's now flourishing. But  more interestingly  it happened to apply to physics  something we knew nothing about    at least I knew nothing about physics  and I don't think Chern knew a heck of a lot. And about    years after the paper came out  a guy named Ed Witten in Princeton started applying it to string theory and people in Russia started applying it to what's called  condensed matter.  Today  those things in there called Chern Simons invariants have spread through a lot of physics. And it was amazing. We didn't know any physics. It never occurred to me that it would be applied to physics. But that's the thing about mathematics    you never know where it's going to go. CA  This is so incredible. So  we've been talking about how evolution shapes human minds that may or may not perceive the truth. Somehow  you come up with a mathematical theory  not knowing any physics  discover two decades later that it's being applied to profoundly describe the actual physical world. How can that happen  JS  God knows. But there's a famous physicist named  Eugene  Wigner  and he wrote an essay on the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics. Somehow  this mathematics  which is rooted in the real world in some sense    we learn to count  measure  everyone would do that    and then it flourishes on its own. But so often it comes back to save the day. General relativity is an example.  Hermann  Minkowski had this geometry  and Einstein realized   Hey  It's the very thing in which I can cast general relativity.  So  you never know. It is a mystery. It is a mystery. CA  So  here's a mathematical piece of ingenuity. Tell us about this. JS  Well  that's a ball    it's a sphere  and it has a lattice around it    you know  those squares. What I'm going to show here was originally observed by  Leonhard  Euler  the great mathematician  in the     s. And it gradually grew to be a very important field in mathematics  algebraic topology  geometry. That paper up there had its roots in this. So  here's this thing  it has eight vertices     edges  six faces. And if you look at the difference    vertices minus edges plus faces    you get two. OK  well  two. That's a good number. Here's a different way of doing it    these are triangles covering    this has    vertices and    edges and    faces     tiles. And vertices minus edges plus faces still equals two. And in fact  you could do this any which way    cover this thing with all kinds of polygons and triangles and mix them up. And you take vertices minus edges plus faces    you'll get two. Here's a different shape. This is a torus  or the surface of a doughnut     vertices covered by these rectangles     edges     faces. Vertices minus edges comes out to be zero. It'll always come out to zero. Every time you cover a torus with squares or triangles or anything like that  you're going to get zero. So  this is called the Euler characteristic. And it's what's called a topological invariant. It's pretty amazing. No matter how you do it  you're always get the same answer. So that was the first sort of thrust  from the mid     s  into a subject which is now called algebraic topology. CA  And your own work took an idea like this and moved it into higher dimensional theory  higher dimensional objects  and found new invariances  JS  Yes. Well  there were already higher dimensional invariants  Pontryagin classes    actually  there were Chern classes. There were a bunch of these types of invariants. I was struggling to work on one of them and model it sort of combinatorially  instead of the way it was typically done  and that led to this work and we uncovered some new things. But if it wasn't for Mr. Euler    who wrote almost    volumes of mathematics and had    children  who he apparently would dandle on his knee while he was writing    if it wasn't for Mr. Euler  there wouldn't perhaps be these invariants. CA  OK  so that's at least given us a flavor of that amazing mind in there. Let's talk about Renaissance. Because you took that amazing mind and having been a code cracker at the NSA  you started to become a code cracker in the financial industry. I think you probably didn't buy efficient market theory. Somehow you found a way of creating astonishing returns over two decades. The way it's been explained to me  what's remarkable about what you did wasn't just the size of the returns  it's that you took them with surprisingly low volatility and risk  compared with other hedge funds. So how on earth did you do this  Jim  JS  I did it by assembling a wonderful group of people. When I started doing trading  I had gotten a little tired of mathematics. I was in my late   s  I had a little money. I started trading and it went very well. I made quite a lot of money with pure luck. I mean  I think it was pure luck. It certainly wasn't mathematical modeling. But in looking at the data  after a while I realized  it looks like there's some structure here. And I hired a few mathematicians  and we started making some models    just the kind of thing we did back at IDA  Institute for Defense Analyses . You design an algorithm  you test it out on a computer. Does it work  Doesn't it work  And so on. CA  Can we take a look at this  Because here's a typical graph of some commodity. I look at that  and I say   That's just a random  up and down walk    maybe a slight upward trend over that whole period of time.  How on earth could you trade looking at that  and see something that wasn't just random  JS  In the old days    this is kind of a graph from the old days  commodities or currencies had a tendency to trend. Not necessarily the very light trend you see here  but trending in periods. And if you decided  OK  I'm going to predict today  by the average move in the past    days    maybe that would be a good prediction  and I'd make some money. And in fact  years ago  such a system would work    not beautifully  but it would work. You'd make money  you'd lose money  you'd make money. But this is a year's worth of days  and you'd make a little money during that period. It's a very vestigial system. CA  So you would test a bunch of lengths of trends in time and see whether  for example  a    day trend or a    day trend was predictive of what happened next. JS  Sure  you would try all those things and see what worked best. Trend following would have been great in the '  s  and it was sort of OK in the '  s. By the '  s  it wasn't. CA  Because everyone could see that. So  how did you stay ahead of the pack  JS  We stayed ahead of the pack by finding other approaches    shorter term approaches to some extent. The real thing was to gather a tremendous amount of data    and we had to get it by hand in the early days. We went down to the Federal Reserve and copied interest rate histories and stuff like that  because it didn't exist on computers. We got a lot of data. And very smart people    that was the key. I didn't really know how to hire people to do fundamental trading. I had hired a few    some made money  some didn't make money. I couldn't make a business out of that. But I did know how to hire scientists  because I have some taste in that department. So  that's what we did. And gradually these models got better and better  and better and better. CA  You're credited with doing something remarkable at Renaissance  which is building this culture  this group of people  who weren't just hired guns who could be lured away by money. Their motivation was doing exciting mathematics and science. JS  Well  I'd hoped that might be true. But some of it was money. CA  They made a lot of money. JS  I can't say that no one came because of the money. I think a lot of them came because of the money. But they also came because it would be fun. CA  What role did machine learning play in all this  JS  In a certain sense  what we did was machine learning. You look at a lot of data  and you try to simulate different predictive schemes  until you get better and better at it. It doesn't necessarily feed back on itself the way we did things. But it worked. CA  So these different predictive schemes can be really quite wild and unexpected. I mean  you looked at everything  right  You looked at the weather  length of dresses  political opinion. JS  Yes  length of dresses we didn't try. CA  What sort of things  JS  Well  everything. Everything is grist for the mill    except hem lengths. Weather  annual reports  quarterly reports  historic data itself  volumes  you name it. Whatever there is. We take in terabytes of data a day. And store it away and massage it and get it ready for analysis. You're looking for anomalies. You're looking for    like you said  the efficient market hypothesis is not correct. CA  But any one anomaly might be just a random thing. So  is the secret here to just look at multiple strange anomalies  and see when they align  JS  Any one anomaly might be a random thing  however  if you have enough data you can tell that it's not. You can see an anomaly that's persistent for a sufficiently long time    the probability of it being random is not high. But these things fade after a while  anomalies can get washed out. So you have to keep on top of the business. CA  A lot of people look at the hedge fund industry now and are sort of ... shocked by it  by how much wealth is created there  and how much talent is going into it. Do you have any worries about that industry  and perhaps the financial industry in general  Kind of being on a runaway train that's    I don't know    helping increase inequality  How would you champion what's happening in the hedge fund industry  JS  I think in the last three or four years  hedge funds have not done especially well. We've done dandy  but the hedge fund industry as a whole has not done so wonderfully. The stock market has been on a roll  going up as everybody knows  and price earnings ratios have grown. So an awful lot of the wealth that's been created in the last    let's say  five or six years    has not been created by hedge funds. People would ask me   What's a hedge fund   And I'd say   One and   .  Which means    now it's two and       it's two percent fixed fee and    percent of profits. Hedge funds are all different kinds of creatures. CA  Rumor has it you charge slightly higher fees than that. JS  We charged the highest fees in the world at one time. Five and     that's what we charge. CA  Five and   . So five percent flat     percent of upside. You still made your investors spectacular amounts of money. JS  We made good returns  yes. People got very mad   How can you charge such high fees   I said   OK  you can withdraw.  But  How can I get more   was what people were    But at a certain point  as I think I told you  we bought out all the investors because there's a capacity to the fund. CA  But should we worry about the hedge fund industry attracting too much of the world's great mathematical and other talent to work on that  as opposed to the many other problems in the world  JS  Well  it's not just mathematical. We hire astronomers and physicists and things like that. I don't think we should worry about it too much. It's still a pretty small industry. And in fact  bringing science into the investing world has improved that world. It's reduced volatility. It's increased liquidity. Spreads are narrower because people are trading that kind of stuff. So I'm not too worried about Einstein going off and starting a hedge fund. CA  You're at a phase in your life now where you're actually investing  though  at the other end of the supply chain    you're actually boosting mathematics across America. This is your wife  Marilyn. You're working on philanthropic issues together. Tell me about that. JS  Well  Marilyn started    there she is up there  my beautiful wife    she started the foundation about    years ago. I think '  . I claim it was '    she says it was '    but it was one of those two years. We started the foundation  just as a convenient way to give charity. She kept the books  and so on. We did not have a vision at that time  but gradually a vision emerged    which was to focus on math and science  to focus on basic research. And that's what we've done. Six years ago or so  I left Renaissance and went to work at the foundation. So that's what we do. CA  And so Math for America is basically investing in math teachers around the country  giving them some extra income  giving them support and coaching. And really trying to make that more effective and make that a calling to which teachers can aspire. JS  Yeah    instead of beating up the bad teachers  which has created morale problems all through the educational community  in particular in math and science  we focus on celebrating the good ones and giving them status. Yeah  we give them extra money         dollars a year. We have     math and science teachers in New York City in public schools today  as part of a core. There's a great morale among them. They're staying in the field. Next year  it'll be       and that'll be    percent of the math and science teachers in New York  City  public schools. CA  Jim  here's another project that you've supported philanthropically  Research into origins of life  I guess. What are we looking at here  JS  Well  I'll save that for a second. And then I'll tell you what you're looking at. Origins of life is a fascinating question. How did we get here  Well  there are two questions  One is  what is the route from geology to biology    how did we get here  And the other question is  what did we start with  What material  if any  did we have to work with on this route  Those are two very  very interesting questions. The first question is a tortuous path from geology up to RNA or something like that    how did that all work  And the other  what do we have to work with  Well  more than we think. So what's pictured there is a star in formation. Now  every year in our Milky Way  which has     billion stars  about two new stars are created. Don't ask me how  but they're created. And it takes them about a million years to settle out. So  in steady state  there are about two million stars in formation at any time. That one is somewhere along this settling down period. And there's all this crap sort of circling around it  dust and stuff. And it'll form probably a solar system  or whatever it forms. But here's the thing    in this dust that surrounds a forming star have been found  now  significant organic molecules. Molecules not just like methane  but formaldehyde and cyanide    things that are the building blocks    the seeds  if you will    of life. So  that may be typical. And it may be typical that planets around the universe start off with some of these basic building blocks. Now does that mean there's going to be life all around  Maybe. But it's a question of how tortuous this path is from those frail beginnings  those seeds  all the way to life. And most of those seeds will fall on fallow planets. CA  So for you  personally  finding an answer to this question of where we came from  of how did this thing happen  that is something you would love to see. JS  Would love to see. And like to know    if that path is tortuous enough  and so improbable  that no matter what you start with  we could be a singularity. But on the other hand  given all this organic dust that's floating around  we could have lots of friends out there. It'd be great to know. CA  Jim  a couple of years ago  I got the chance to speak with Elon Musk  and I asked him the secret of his success  and he said taking physics seriously was it. Listening to you  what I hear you saying is taking math seriously  that has infused your whole life. It's made you an absolute fortune  and now it's allowing you to invest in the futures of thousands and thousands of kids across America and elsewhere. Could it be that science actually works  That math actually works  JS  Well  math certainly works. Math certainly works. But this has been fun. Working with Marilyn and giving it away has been very enjoyable. CA  I just find it    it's an inspirational thought to me  that by taking knowledge seriously  so much more can come from it. So thank you for your amazing life  and for coming here to TED. Thank you. Jim Simons  So I grew up in Orlando  Florida. I was the son of an aerospace engineer. I lived and breathed the Apollo program. We either saw the launches from our backyard or we saw it by driving in the hour over to the Cape. I was impressed by  obviously  space and everything about it  but I was most impressed by the engineering that went into it. Behind me you see an amazing view  a picture that was taken from the International Space Station  and it shows a portion of our planet that's rarely seen and rarely studied and almost never explored. That place is called the stratosphere. If you start on the planet and you go up and up and up  it gets colder and colder and colder  until you reach the beginning of the stratosphere  and then an amazing thing happens. It gets colder at a much slower rate  and then it starts warming up  and then it gets warmer and warmer until the point where you can almost survive without any protection  about zero degrees  and then you end up getting colder and colder  and that's the top of the stratosphere. It is one of the least accessible places on our planet. Most often  when it's visited  it's by astronauts who are blazing up at it at probably several times the speed of sound  and they get a few seconds on the way up  and then they get this blazing ball of fire coming back in  on the way back in. But the question I asked is  is it possible to linger in the stratosphere  Is it possible to experience the stratosphere  Is it possible to explore the stratosphere  I studied this using my favorite search engine for quite a while  about a year  and then I made a scary phone call. It was a reference from a friend of mine to call Taber MacCallum from Paragon Space Development Corporation  and I asked him the question  is it possible to build a system to go into the stratosphere  And he said it was. And after a period of about three years  we proceeded to do just that. And on October    of last year  in this suit  I started on the ground  I went up in a balloon to         feet    but who's counting  Came back to Earth at speeds of up to     miles an hour. It was a four minute and    second descent. And when I got to        feet  I opened a parachute and I landed. But this is really a science talk  and it's really an engineering talk  and what was amazing to me about that experience is that Taber said  yes  I think we can build a stratospheric suit  and more than that  come down tomorrow and let's talk to the team that formed the core of the group that actually built it. And they did something which I think is important  which is they took the analogy of scuba diving. So in scuba diving  you have a self contained system. You have everything that you could ever need. You have a scuba tank. You have a wetsuit. You have visibility. And that scuba is exactly this system  and we're going to launch it into the stratosphere. Three years later  this is what we have. We've got an amazing suit that was made by ILC Dover. ILC Dover was the company that made all of the Apollo suits and all of the extravehicular activity suits. They had never sold a suit commercially  only to the government  but they sold one to me  which I am very grateful for. Up here we have a parachute. This was all about safety. Everyone on the team knew that I have a wife and two small children       and       and I wanted to come back safely. So there's a main parachute and a reserve parachute  and if I do nothing  the reserve parachute is going to open because of an automatic opening device. The suit itself can protect me from the cold. This area in the front here has thermal protection. It will actually heat water that will wrap around my body. It has two redundant oxygen tanks. Even if I was to get a quarter inch hole in this suit  which is extremely unlikely  this system would still protect me from the low pressure of space. The main advantage of this system is weight and complexity. So the system weighs about     pounds  and if you compare it to the other attempt recently to go up in the stratosphere  they used a capsule. And to do a capsule  there's an amazing amount of complexity that goes into it  and it weighed about       pounds  and to raise       pounds to an altitude of         feet  which was my target altitude  it would have taken a balloon that was    to    million cubic feet. Because I only weighed     pounds in this system  we could do it with a balloon that was five times smaller than that  and that allowed us to use a launch system that was dramatically simpler than what needs to be done for a much larger balloon. So with that  I want to take you to Roswell  New Mexico  on October   . We had an amazing team that got up in the middle of the night. And here's the suit. Again  this is using the front loader that you'll see in a second  and I want to play you a video of the actual launch. Roswell's a great place to launch balloons  but it's a fantastic place to land under a parachute  especially when you're going to land    miles away from the place you started. That's a helium truck in the background. It's darkness. I've already spent about an hour and a half pre breathing. And then here you see the suit going on. It takes about an hour to get the suit on. Astronauts get this really nice air conditioned van to go to the launch pad  but I got a front loader. You can see the top. You can see the balloon up there. That's where the helium is. This is Dave clearing the airspace with the FAA for    miles. And there we go. That's me waving with my left hand. The reason I'm waving with my left hand is because on the right hand is the emergency cutaway. My team forbade me from using my right hand. So the trip up is beautiful. It's kind of like Google Earth in reverse. It took two hours and seven minutes to go up  and it was the most peaceful two hours and seven minutes. I was mostly trying to relax. My heart rate was very low and I was trying not to use very much oxygen. You can see how the fields in the background are relatively big at this point  and you can see me going up and up. It's interesting here  because if you look  I'm right over the airport  and I'm probably at        feet  but immediately I'm about to go into a stratospheric wind of over     miles an hour. This is my flight director telling me that I had just gone higher than anybody else had ever gone in a balloon  and I was about       feet from release. This is what it looks like. You can see the darkness of space  the curvature of the Earth  the fragile planet below. I'm practicing my emergency procedures mentally right now. If anything goes wrong  I want to be ready. And the main thing that I want to do here is to have a release and fall and stay completely stable. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. Alan Eustace  There's the balloon going by  fully inflated at this point. And there you can see a drogue parachute  which I'll demonstrate in just a second  because that's really important. There's the balloon going by a second time. Right now  I'm about at the speed of sound. There's nothing for me to tell it's the speed of sound  and very soon I will actually be as fast as I ever get      miles an hour. AE  So now I'm down low right now and you can basically see the parachute come out right there. At this point  I'm very happy that there's a parachute out. I thought I was the only one happy  but it turns out mission control was really happy as well. The really nice thing about this is the moment I opened    I had a close of friend of mine  Blikkies  my parachute guy. He flew in another airplane  and he actually jumped out and landed right next to me. He was my wingman on the descent. This is my landing  but it's probably more properly called a crash. I hate to admit it  but this wasn't even close to my worst landing. AE  Hi there  Yay. So I want to tell you one thing that you might not have seen in that video  but one of the most critical parts of the entire thing was the release and what happens right after you release. And what we tried to do was use something called a drogue parachute  and a drogue parachute was there to stabilize me. And I'll show you one of those right now. If any of you have ever gone tandem skydiving  you probably used one of these. But the problem with one of these things is right when you release  you're in zero gravity. So it's very easy for this to just turn right around you. And before you know it  you can be tangled up or spinning  or you can release this drogue late  in which case what happens is you're going down at     miles an hour  and this thing is going to destroy itself and not be very useful. But the guys at United Parachute Technologies came up with this idea  and it was a roll that looks like that  but watch what happens when I pull it out. It's forming a pipe. This pipe is so solid that you can take this drogue parachute and wrap it around  and there's no way it will ever tangle with you. And that prevented a very serious potential problem. So nothing is possible without an amazing team of people. The core of this was about    people that worked on this for the three years  and they were incredible. People asked me what the best part of this whole thing was  and it was a chance to work with the best experts in meteorology and ballooning and parachute technology and environmental systems and high altitude medicine. It was fantastic. It's an engineer's dream to work with that group of people. And I also at the same time wanted to thank my friends at Google  both for supporting me during this effort and also covering for me in the times that I was away. But there's one other group I wanted to thank  and that's my family. Yay. I would constantly give them speeches about the safety of technology  and they weren't hearing any of it. It was super hard on them  and the only reason that my wife put up with it was because I came back incredibly happy after each of the     tests  and she didn't want to take that away from me. So I want to close with a story. My daughter Katelyn  my    year old  she and I were in the car  and we were driving down the road  and she was sitting there  and she had this idea  and she goes   Dad  I've got this idea.  And so I listened to her idea and I said   Katelyn  that's impossible.  And she looks at me and she goes   Dad  after what you just did  how can you call anything impossible   And I laughed  and I said   OK  it's not impossible  it's just very  very hard.  And then I paused for a second  and I said   Katelyn  it may not be impossible  it may not even be very  very hard  it's just that I don't know how to do it.  Thank you. Today I'm going to talk about work. And the question I want to ask and answer is this   Why do we work   Why do we drag ourselves out of bed every morning instead of living our lives just filled with bouncing from one TED like adventure to another  You may be asking yourselves that very question. Now  I know of course  we have to make a living  but nobody in this room thinks that that's the answer to the question   Why do we work   For folks in this room  the work we do is challenging  it's engaging  it's stimulating  it's meaningful. And if we're lucky  it might even be important. So  we wouldn't work if we didn't get paid  but that's not why we do what we do. And in general  I think we think that material rewards are a pretty bad reason for doing the work that we do. When we say of somebody that he's  in it for the money   we are not just being descriptive. Now  I think this is totally obvious  but the very obviousness of it raises what is for me an incredibly profound question. Why  if this is so obvious  why is it that for the overwhelming majority of people on the planet  the work they do has none of the characteristics that get us up and out of bed and off to the office every morning  How is it that we allow the majority of people on the planet to do work that is monotonous  meaningless and soul deadening  Why is it that as capitalism developed  it created a mode of production  of goods and services  in which all the nonmaterial satisfactions that might come from work were eliminated  Workers who do this kind of work  whether they do it in factories  in call centers  or in fulfillment warehouses  do it for pay. There is certainly no other earthly reason to do what they do except for pay. So the question is   Why   And here's the answer  the answer is technology. Now  I know  I know    yeah  yeah  yeah  technology  automation screws people  blah blah    that's not what I mean. I'm not talking about the kind of technology that has enveloped our lives  and that people come to TED to hear about. I'm not talking about the technology of things  profound though that is. I'm talking about another technology. I'm talking about the technology of ideas. I call it   idea technology     how clever of me. In addition to creating things  science creates ideas. Science creates ways of understanding. And in the social sciences  the ways of understanding that get created are ways of understanding ourselves. And they have an enormous influence on how we think  what we aspire to  and how we act. If you think your poverty is God's will  you pray. If you think your poverty is the result of your own inadequacy  you shrink into despair. And if you think your poverty is the result of oppression and domination  then you rise up in revolt. Whether your response to poverty is resignation or revolution  depends on how you understand the sources of your poverty. This is the role that ideas play in shaping us as human beings  and this is why idea technology may be the most profoundly important technology that science gives us. And there's something special about idea technology  that makes it different from the technology of things. With things  if the technology sucks  it just vanishes  right  Bad technology disappears. With ideas    false ideas about human beings will not go away if people believe that they're true. Because if people believe that they're true  they create ways of living and institutions that are consistent with these very false ideas. And that's how the industrial revolution created a factory system in which there was really nothing you could possibly get out of your day's work  except for the pay at the end of the day. Because the father    one of the fathers of the Industrial Revolution  Adam Smith    was convinced that human beings were by their very natures lazy  and wouldn't do anything unless you made it worth their while  and the way you made it worth their while was by incentivizing  by giving them rewards. That was the only reason anyone ever did anything. So we created a factory system consistent with that false view of human nature. But once that system of production was in place  there was really no other way for people to operate  except in a way that was consistent with Adam Smith's vision. So the work example is merely an example of how false ideas can create a circumstance that ends up making them true. It is not true that you  just can't get good help anymore.  It is true that you  can't get good help anymore  when you give people work to do that is demeaning and soulless. And interestingly enough  Adam Smith    the same guy who gave us this incredible invention of mass production  and division of labor    understood this. He said  of people who worked in assembly lines  of men who worked in assembly lines  he says   He generally becomes as stupid as it is possible for a human being to become.  Now  notice the word here is  become.   He generally becomes as stupid as it is possible for a human being to become.  Whether he intended it or not  what Adam Smith was telling us there  is that the very shape of the institution within which people work creates people who are fitted to the demands of that institution and deprives people of the opportunity to derive the kinds of satisfactions from their work that we take for granted. The thing about science    natural science    is that we can spin fantastic theories about the cosmos  and have complete confidence that the cosmos is completely indifferent to our theories. It's going to work the same damn way no matter what theories we have about the cosmos. But we do have to worry about the theories we have of human nature  because human nature will be changed by the theories we have that are designed to explain and help us understand human beings. The distinguished anthropologist  Clifford Geertz  said  years ago  that human beings are the  unfinished animals.  And what he meant by that was that it is only human nature to have a human nature that is very much the product of the society in which people live. That human nature  that is to say our human nature  is much more created than it is discovered. We design human nature by designing the institutions within which people live and work. And so you people    pretty much the closest I ever get to being with masters of the universe    you people should be asking yourself a question  as you go back home to run your organizations. Just what kind of human nature do you want to help design  Thank you. Thanks. Well  we all need a reason to wake up. For me  it just took        volts. I know you're too polite to ask  so I will tell you. One night  sophomore year of college  just back from Thanksgiving holiday  a few of my friends and I were horsing around  and we decided to climb atop a parked commuter train. It was just sitting there  with the wires that run overhead. Somehow  that seemed like a great idea at the time. We'd certainly done stupider things. I scurried up the ladder on the back  and when I stood up  the electrical current entered my arm  blew down and out my feet  and that was that. Would you believe that watch still works  Takes a licking  My father wears it now in solidarity. That night began my formal relationship with death    my death    and it also began my long run as a patient. It's a good word. It means one who suffers. So I guess we're all patients. Now  the American health care system has more than its fair share of dysfunction    to match its brilliance  to be sure. I'm a physician now  a hospice and palliative medicine doc  so I've seen care from both sides. And believe me  almost everyone who goes into healthcare really means well    I mean  truly. But we who work in it are also unwitting agents for a system that too often does not serve. Why  Well  there's actually a pretty easy answer to that question  and it explains a lot  because healthcare was designed with diseases  not people  at its center. Which is to say  of course  it was badly designed. And nowhere are the effects of bad design more heartbreaking or the opportunity for good design more compelling than at the end of life  where things are so distilled and concentrated. There are no do overs. My purpose today is to reach out across disciplines and invite design thinking into this big conversation. That is  to bring intention and creativity to the experience of dying. We have a monumental opportunity in front of us  before one of the few universal issues as individuals as well as a civil society  to rethink and redesign how it is we die. So let's begin at the end. For most people  the scariest thing about death isn't being dead  it's dying  suffering. It's a key distinction. To get underneath this  it can be very helpful to tease out suffering which is necessary as it is  from suffering we can change. The former is a natural  essential part of life  part of the deal  and to this we are called to make space  adjust  grow. It can be really good to realize forces larger than ourselves. They bring proportionality  like a cosmic right sizing. After my limbs were gone  that loss  for example  became fact  fixed    necessarily part of my life  and I learned that I could no more reject this fact than reject myself. It took me a while  but I learned it eventually. Now  another great thing about necessary suffering is that it is the very thing that unites caregiver and care receiver    human beings. This  we are finally realizing  is where healing happens. Yes  compassion    literally  as we learned yesterday    suffering together. Now  on the systems side  on the other hand  so much of the suffering is unnecessary  invented. It serves no good purpose. But the good news is  since this brand of suffering is made up  well  we can change it. How we die is indeed something we can affect. Making the system sensitive to this fundamental distinction between necessary and unnecessary suffering gives us our first of three design cues for the day. After all  our role as caregivers  as people who care  is to relieve suffering    not add to the pile. True to the tenets of palliative care  I function as something of a reflective advocate  as much as prescribing physician. Quick aside  palliative care    a very important field but poorly understood    while it includes  it is not limited to end of life care. It is not limited to hospice. It's simply about comfort and living well at any stage. So please know that you don't have to be dying anytime soon to benefit from palliative care. Now  let me introduce you to Frank. Sort of makes this point. I've been seeing Frank now for years. He's living with advancing prostate cancer on top of long standing HIV. We work on his bone pain and his fatigue  but most of the time we spend thinking out loud together about his life    really  about our lives. In this way  Frank grieves. In this way  he keeps up with his losses as they roll in  so that he's ready to take in the next moment. Loss is one thing  but regret  quite another. Frank has always been an adventurer    he looks like something out of a Norman Rockwell painting    and no fan of regret. So it wasn't surprising when he came into clinic one day  saying he wanted to raft down the Colorado River. Was this a good idea  With all the risks to his safety and his health  some would say no. Many did  but he went for it  while he still could. It was a glorious  marvelous trip  freezing water  blistering dry heat  scorpions  snakes  wildlife howling off the flaming walls of the Grand Canyon    all the glorious side of the world beyond our control. Frank's decision  while maybe dramatic  is exactly the kind so many of us would make  if we only had the support to figure out what is best for ourselves over time. So much of what we're talking about today is a shift in perspective. After my accident  when I went back to college  I changed my major to art history. Studying visual art  I figured I'd learn something about how to see    a really potent lesson for a kid who couldn't change so much of what he was seeing. Perspective  that kind of alchemy we humans get to play with  turning anguish into a flower. Flash forward  now I work at an amazing place in San Francisco called the Zen Hospice Project  where we have a little ritual that helps with this shift in perspective. When one of our residents dies  the mortuary men come  and as we're wheeling the body out through the garden  heading for the gate  we pause. Anyone who wants    fellow residents  family  nurses  volunteers  the hearse drivers too  now    shares a story or a song or silence  as we sprinkle the body with flower petals. It takes a few minutes  it's a sweet  simple parting image to usher in grief with warmth  rather than repugnance. Contrast that with the typical experience in the hospital setting  much like this    floodlit room lined with tubes and beeping machines and blinking lights that don't stop even when the patient's life has. Cleaning crew swoops in  the body's whisked away  and it all feels as though that person had never really existed. Well intended  of course  in the name of sterility  but hospitals tend to assault our senses  and the most we might hope for within those walls is numbness    anesthetic  literally the opposite of aesthetic. I revere hospitals for what they can do  I am alive because of them. But we ask too much of our hospitals. They are places for acute trauma and treatable illness. They are no place to live and die  that's not what they were designed for. Now mind you    I am not giving up on the notion that our institutions can become more humane. Beauty can be found anywhere. I spent a few months in a burn unit at St. Barnabas Hospital in Livingston  New Jersey  where I got really great care at every turn  including good palliative care for my pain. And one night  it began to snow outside. I remember my nurses complaining about driving through it. And there was no window in my room  but it was great to just imagine it coming down all sticky. Next day  one of my nurses smuggled in a snowball for me. She brought it in to the unit. I cannot tell you the rapture I felt holding that in my hand  and the coldness dripping onto my burning skin  the miracle of it all  the fascination as I watched it melt and turn into water. In that moment  just being any part of this planet in this universe mattered more to me than whether I lived or died. That little snowball packed all the inspiration I needed to both try to live and be OK if I did not. In a hospital  that's a stolen moment. In my work over the years  I've known many people who were ready to go  ready to die. Not because they had found some final peace or transcendence  but because they were so repulsed by what their lives had become    in a word  cut off  or ugly. There are already record numbers of us living with chronic and terminal illness  and into ever older age. And we are nowhere near ready or prepared for this silver tsunami. We need an infrastructure dynamic enough to handle these seismic shifts in our population. Now is the time to create something new  something vital. I know we can because we have to. The alternative is just unacceptable. And the key ingredients are known  policy  education and training  systems  bricks and mortar. We have tons of input for designers of all stripes to work with. We know  for example  from research what's most important to people who are closer to death  comfort  feeling unburdened and unburdening to those they love  existential peace  and a sense of wonderment and spirituality. Over Zen Hospice's nearly    years  we've learned much more from our residents in subtle detail. Little things aren't so little. Take Janette. She finds it harder to breathe one day to the next due to ALS. Well  guess what  She wants to start smoking again    and French cigarettes  if you please. Not out of some self destructive bent  but to feel her lungs filled while she has them. Priorities change. Or Kate    she just wants to know her dog Austin is lying at the foot of her bed  his cold muzzle against her dry skin  instead of more chemotherapy coursing through her veins    she's done that. Sensuous  aesthetic gratification  where in a moment  in an instant  we are rewarded for just being. So much of it comes down to loving our time by way of the senses  by way of the body    the very thing doing the living and the dying. Probably the most poignant room in the Zen Hospice guest house is our kitchen  which is a little strange when you realize that so many of our residents can eat very little  if anything at all. But we realize we are providing sustenance on several levels  smell  a symbolic plane. Seriously  with all the heavy duty stuff happening under our roof  one of the most tried and true interventions we know of  is to bake cookies. As long as we have our senses    even just one    we have at least the possibility of accessing what makes us feel human  connected. Imagine the ripples of this notion for the millions of people living and dying with dementia. Primal sensorial delights that say the things we don't have words for  impulses that make us stay present    no need for a past or a future. So  if teasing unnecessary suffering out of the system was our first design cue  then tending to dignity by way of the senses  by way of the body    the aesthetic realm    is design cue number two. Now this gets us quickly to the third and final bit for today  namely  we need to lift our sights  to set our sights on well being  so that life and health and healthcare can become about making life more wonderful  rather than just less horrible. Beneficence. Here  this gets right at the distinction between a disease centered and a patient  or human centered model of care  and here is where caring becomes a creative  generative  even playful act.  Play  may sound like a funny word here. But it is also one of our highest forms of adaptation. Consider every major compulsory effort it takes to be human. The need for food has birthed cuisine. The need for shelter has given rise to architecture. The need for cover  fashion. And for being subjected to the clock  well  we invented music. So  since dying is a necessary part of life  what might we create with this fact  By  play  I am in no way suggesting we take a light approach to dying or that we mandate any particular way of dying. There are mountains of sorrow that cannot move  and one way or another  we will all kneel there. Rather  I am asking that we make space    physical  psychic room  to allow life to play itself all the way out    so that rather than just getting out of the way  aging and dying can become a process of crescendo through to the end. We can't solve for death. I know some of you are working on this. Meanwhile  we can    We can design towards it. Parts of me died early on  and that's something we can all say one way or another. I got to redesign my life around this fact  and I tell you it has been a liberation to realize you can always find a shock of beauty or meaning in what life you have left  like that snowball lasting for a perfect moment  all the while melting away. If we love such moments ferociously  then maybe we can learn to live well    not in spite of death  but because of it. Let death be what takes us  not lack of imagination. Thank you. Billie Jean King  Hi  everyone  Thanks  Pat. Thank you  Getting me all wound up  now  Pat Mitchell  Good  You know  when I was watching the video again of the match  you must have felt like the fate of the world's women was on every stroke you took. Were you feeling that  BJK  First of all  Bobby Riggs    he was the former number one player  he wasn't just some hacker  by the way. He was one of my heroes and I admired him. And that's the reason I beat him  actually  because I respected him. It's true    my mom and especially my dad always said   Respect your opponent  and never underestimate them  ever.  And he was correct. He was absolutely correct. But I knew it was about social change. And I was really nervous whenever we announced it  and I felt like the whole world was on my shoulders. And I thought   If I lose  it's going to put women back    years  at least.  Title IX had just been passed the year before    June         . And women's professional tennis    there were nine of us who signed a one dollar contract in         now remember  the match is in '  . So we were only in our third year of having a tour where we could actually play  have a place to compete and make a living. So there were nine of us that signed that one dollar contract. And our dream was for any girl  born any place in the world    if she was good enough    there would be a place for her to compete and for us to make a living. Because before       we made    dollars a day  and we were under the control of organizations. So we really wanted to break away from that. But we knew it wasn't really about our generation so much  we knew it was about the future generations. We do stand on the shoulders of the people that came before us  there is no question. But every generation has the chance to make it better. That was really on my mind. I really wanted to start matching the hearts and minds to Title IX. Title IX  in case anybody doesn't know  which a lot of people probably don't  said that any federal funds given to a high school  college or university  either public or private  had to    finally    give equal monies to boys and girls. And that changed everything. So you can have a law  but it's changing the hearts and minds to match up with it. That's when it really rocks  totally. So that was on my mind. I wanted to start that change in the hearts and minds. But two things came out of that match. For women  self confidence  empowerment. They actually had enough nerve to ask for a raise. Some women have waited        years to ask. I said   More importantly  did you get it   And they did  And for the men  A lot of the men today don't realize it  but if you're in your   s    s or whatever  late   s  you're the first generation of men of the Women's Movement    whether you like it or not  And for the men  what happened for the men  they'd come up to me    and most times  the men are the ones who have tears in their eyes  it's very interesting. They go   Billie  I was very young when I saw that match  and now I have a daughter. And I am so happy I saw that as a young man.  And one of those young men  at    years old  was President Obama. And he actually told me that when I met him  he said   You don't realize it  but I saw that match at   . And now I have two daughters  and it has made a difference in how I raise them.  So both men and women got a lot out of it  but different things. PM  And now there are generations    at least one or two    who have experienced the equality that Title IX and other fights along the way made possible. And for women  there are generations who have also experienced teamwork. They got to play team sports in a way they hadn't before. So you had a legacy already built in terms of being an athlete  a legacy of the work you did to lobby for equal pay for women athletes and the Women's Sports Foundation. What now are you looking to accomplish with The Billie Jean King Leadership Initiative  BJK  I think it goes back to an epiphany I had at   . At     I wanted to be the number one tennis player in the world  and a friend had asked me to play and I said   What's that   Tennis was not in my family    basketball was  other sports. Fast forward to    years old  and I'm finally starting to play in tournaments where you get a ranking at the end of the year. So I was daydreaming at the Los Angeles Tennis Club  and I started thinking about my sport and how tiny it was  but also that everybody who played wore white shoes  white clothes  played with white balls    everybody who played was white. And I said to myself  at    years old   Where is everyone else   And that just kept sticking in my brain. And that moment  I promised myself I'd fight for equal rights and opportunities for boys and girls  men and women  the rest of my life. And that tennis  if I was fortunate enough to become number one    and I knew  being a girl  it would be harder to have influence  already at that age    that I had this platform. And tennis is global. And I thought   You know what  I've been given an opportunity that very few people have had.  I didn't know if I was going to make it    this was only   . I sure wanted it  but making it is a whole other discussion. I just remember I promised myself  and I really try to keep my word. That's who I truly am  just fighting for people. And  unfortunately  women have had less. And we are considered less. And so my attentions  where did they have to go  It was just ... you have to. And learn to stick up for yourself  hear your own voice. You hear the same words keep coming out all the time  and I got really lucky because I had an education. And I think if you can see it you can be it  you know  If you can see it  you can be it. You look at Pat  you look at other leaders  you look at these speakers  look at yourself  because everyone    everyone    can do something extraordinary. Every single person. PM  And your story  Billie  has inspired so many women everywhere. Now with the Billie Jean King Leadership Initiative  you're taking on an even bigger cause. Because one thing we hear a lot about is women taking their voice  working to find their way into leadership positions. But what you're talking about is even bigger than that. It's inclusive leadership. And this is a generation that has grown up thinking more inclusively    BJK  Isn't it great  Look at the technology  It's amazing how it connects us all  It's about connection. It's simply amazing what's possible because of it. But the Billie Jean King Leadership Initiative is really about the workforce mostly  and trying to change it  so people can actually go to work and be their authentic selves. Because most of us have two jobs  One  to fit in    I'll give you a perfect example. An African American woman gets up an hour earlier to go to work  straightens her hair in the bathroom  goes to the bathroom probably four  five  six times a day to keep straightening her hair  to keep making sure she fits in. So she's working two jobs. She's got this other job  whatever that may be  but she's also trying to fit in. Or this poor man who kept his diploma    he went to University of Michigan  but he never would talk about his poverty as a youngster  ever    just would not mention it. So he made sure they saw he was well educated. And then you see a gay guy who has an NFL    which means American football for all of you out there  it's a big deal  it's very macho    and he talked about football all the time  because he was gay and he didn't want anybody to know. It just goes on and on. So my wish for everyone is to be able to be their authentic self       that would be the ultimate. And we catch ourselves    I mean  I catch myself to this day. Even being gay I catch myself  you know  like  a little uncomfortable  a little surge in my gut  feeling not totally comfortable in my own skin. So  I think you have to ask yourself    I want people to be themselves  whatever that is  just let it be. PM  And the first research the Leadership Initiative did showed that  that these examples you just used    that many of us have the problem of being authentic. But what you've just looked at is this millennial generation  who have benefited from all these equal opportunities    which may not be equal but exist everywhere    BJK  First of all  I'm really lucky. Partnership with Teneo  a strategic company that's amazing. That's really the reason I'm able to do this. I've had two times in my life where I've actually had men really behind me with power. And that was in the old days with Philip Morris with Virginia Slims  and this is the second time in my entire life. And then Deloitte. The one thing I wanted was data    facts. So Deloitte sent out a survey  and over       people now have answered  and we're continuing in the workplace. And what do the millennials feel  Well  they feel a lot  but what they're so fantastic about is    you know  our generation was like   Oh  we're going to get representation.  So if you walk into a room  you see everybody represented. That's not good enough anymore  which is so good  So the millennials are fantastic  they want connection  engagement. They just want you to tell us what you're feeling  what you're thinking  and get into the solution. They're problem solvers  and of course  you've got the information at your fingertips  compared to when I was growing up. PM  What did the research show you about millennials  Are they going to make a difference  Are they going to create a world where there is really an inclusive work force  BJK  Well  in          percent of the global workforce is going to be millennials. I think they are going to help solve problems. I think they have the wherewithal to do it. I know they care a lot. They have big ideas and they can make big things happen. I want to stay in the now with the young people  I don't want to get behind. PM  I don't think there's any chance  But what you found out in the research about millennials is not really the experience that a lot of people have with millennials. BJK  No  well  if we want to talk    OK  I've been doing my little mini survey. I've been talking to the Boomers  who are their bosses  and I go   What do you think about the millennials   And I'm pretty excited  like it's good  and they get this face     Oh  you mean the 'Me' generation   I say   Do you really think so  Because I do think they care about the environment and all these things.  And they go   Oh  Billie  they cannot focus.  They actually have proven that the average focus for an    year old is    seconds. They can't focus. And they don't really care. I just heard a story the other night  a woman owns a gallery and she has these workers. She gets a text from one of the workers  like an intern  she's just starting    she goes   Oh  by the way  I'm going to be late because I'm at the hairdresser's.  So she arrives  and this boss says   What's going on   And she says   Oh  I was late  sorry  how's it going   She says   Well  guess what  I'd like you leave  you're finished.  She goes   OK.  No problem  PM  Now Billie  that story    I know  but that's what scares the boomers    I'm just telling you    so I think it's good for us to share. No  it is good for us to share  because we're our authentic selves and what we're really feeling  so we've got to take it both ways  you know  But I have great faith because    if you've been in sports like I have    every generation gets better. It's a fact. With the Women's Sports Foundation being the advocates for Title IX still  because we're trying to keep protecting the law  because it's in a tenuous position always  so we really are concerned  and we do a lot of research. That's very important to us. And I want to hear from people. But we really have to protect what Title IX stands for worldwide. And you heard President Carter talk about how Title IX is protected. And do you know that every single lawsuit that girls  at least in sports  have gone up against    whatever institutions    has won  Title IX is there to protect us. And it is amazing. But we still have to get the hearts and minds    the hearts and minds to match the legislation is huge. PM  So what gets you up every morning  What keeps you sustaining your work  sustaining the fight for equality  extending it  always exploring new areas  trying to find new ways ...   BJK  Well  I always drove my parents crazy because I was always the curious one. I'm highly motivated. My younger brother was a Major League Baseball player. My poor parents did not care if we were any good. And we drove them crazy because we pushed  we pushed because we wanted to be the best. And I think it's because of what I'm hearing today in TED talks. I think to listen to these different women  to listen to different people  to listen to President Carter       years old  by the way  and he we was throwing these figures out that I would never    I'd have to go   Excuse me  wait a minute  I need to get a list out of these figures.  He was rattling off    I mean  that's amazing  I'm sorry. PM  He's an amazing man. BJK  And then you're going to have President Mary Robinson  who's a former president    Thank you  Irish     percent  LGBTQ  Yes  Congress is voting in June on same sex marriage  so these are things that for some people are very hard to hear. But always remember  every one of us is an individual  a human being with a beating heart  who cares and wants to live their authentic life. OK  You don't have to agree with somebody  but everyone has the opportunity. I think we all have an obligation to continue to keep moving the needle forward  always. And these people have been so inspiring. Everyone matters. And every one of you is an influencer. You out there listening  out there in the world  plus the people here    every single person's an influencer. Never  ever forget that. OK  So don't ever give up on yourself. PM  Billie  you have been an inspiration for us. BJK  Thanks  Pat  Thanks  TED  Thanks a lot  What I'd like to do is talk to you a little bit about fear and the cost of fear and the age of fear from which we are now emerging. I would like you to feel comfortable with my doing that by letting you know that I know something about fear and anxiety. I'm a Jewish guy from New Jersey. I could worry before I could walk. Please  applaud that. Thank you. But I also grew up in a time where there was something to fear. We were brought out in the hall when I was a little kid and taught how to put our coats over our heads to protect us from global thermonuclear war. Now even my seven year old brain knew that wasn't going to work. But I also knew that global thermonuclear war was something to be concerned with. And yet  despite the fact that we lived for    years with the threat of such a war  the response of our government and of our society was to do wonderful things. We created the space program in response to that. We built our highway system in response to that. We created the Internet in response to that. So sometimes fear can produce a constructive response. But sometimes it can produce an un constructive response. On September              guys took over four airplanes and flew them into a couple of buildings. They exacted a horrible toll. It is not for us to minimize what that toll was. But the response that we had was clearly disproportionate    disproportionate to the point of verging on the unhinged. We rearranged the national security apparatus of the United States and of many governments to address a threat that  at the time that those attacks took place  was quite limited. In fact  according to our intelligence services  on September           there were     members of core Al Qaeda. There were just a few thousand terrorists. They posed an existential threat to no one. But we rearranged our entire national security apparatus in the most sweeping way since the end of the Second World War. We launched two wars. We spent trillions of dollars. We suspended our values. We violated international law. We embraced torture. We embraced the idea that if these    guys could do this  anybody could do it. And therefore  for the first time in history  we were seeing everybody as a threat. And what was the result of that  Surveillance programs that listened in on the emails and phone calls of entire countries    hundreds of millions of people    setting aside whether those countries were our allies  setting aside what our interests were. I would argue that    years later  since today there are more terrorists  more terrorist attacks  more terrorist casualties    this by the count of the U.S. State Department    since today the region from which those attacks emanate is more unstable than at any time in its history  since the Flood  perhaps  we have not succeeded in our response. Now you have to ask  where did we go wrong  What did we do  What was the mistake that was made  And you might say  well look  Washington is a dysfunctional place. There are political food fights. We've turned our discourse into a cage match. And that's true. But there are bigger problems  believe it or not  than that dysfunction  even though I would argue that dysfunction that makes it impossible to get anything done in the richest and most powerful country in the world is far more dangerous than anything that a group like ISIS could do  because it stops us in our tracks and it keeps us from progress. But there are other problems. And the other problems came from the fact that in Washington and in many capitals right now  we're in a creativity crisis. In Washington  in think tanks  where people are supposed to be thinking of new ideas  you don't get bold new ideas  because if you offer up a bold new idea  not only are you attacked on Twitter  but you will not get confirmed in a government job. Because we are reactive to the heightened venom of the political debate  you get governments that have an us versus them mentality  tiny groups of people making decisions. When you sit in a room with a small group of people making decisions  what do you get  You get groupthink. Everybody has the same worldview  and any view from outside of the group is seen as a threat. That's a danger. You also have processes that become reactive to news cycles. And so the parts of the U.S. government that do foresight  that look forward  that do strategy    the parts in other governments that do this    can't do it  because they're reacting to the news cycle. And so we're not looking ahead. On       we had a crisis because we were looking the wrong way. Today we have a crisis because  because of       we are still looking in the wrong direction  and we know because we see transformational trends on the horizon that are far more important than what we saw on       far more important than the threat posed by these terrorists  far more important even than the instability that we've got in some areas of the world that are racked by instability today. In fact  the things that we are seeing in those parts of the world may be symptoms. They may be a reaction to bigger trends. And if we are treating the symptom and ignoring the bigger trend  then we've got far bigger problems to deal with. And so what are those trends  Well  to a group like you  the trends are apparent. We are living at a moment in which the very fabric of human society is being rewoven. If you saw the cover of The Economist a couple of days ago    it said that    percent of the people on the planet  by the year       would have a smartphone. They would have a small computer connected to the Internet in their pocket. In most of Africa  the cell phone penetration rate is    percent. We passed the point last October when there were more mobile cellular devices  SIM cards  out in the world than there were people. We are within years of a profound moment in our history  when effectively every single human being on the planet is going to be part of a man made system for the first time  able to touch anyone else    touch them for good  touch them for ill. And the changes associated with that are changing the very nature of every aspect of governance and life on the planet in ways that our leaders ought to be thinking about  when they're thinking about these immediate threats. On the security side  we've come out of a Cold War in which it was too costly to fight a nuclear war  and so we didn't  to a period that I call Cool War  cyber war  where the costs of conflict are actually so low  that we may never stop. We may enter a period of constant warfare  and we know this because we've been in it for several years. And yet  we don't have the basic doctrines to guide us in this regard. We don't have the basic ideas formulated. If someone attacks us with a cyber attack  do have the ability to respond with a kinetic attack  We don't know. If somebody launches a cyber attack  how do we deter them  When China launched a series of cyber attacks  what did the U.S. government do  It said  we're going to indict a few of these Chinese guys  who are never coming to America. They're never going to be anywhere near a law enforcement officer who's going to take them into custody. It's a gesture    it's not a deterrent. Special forces operators out there in the field today discover that small groups of insurgents with cell phones have access to satellite imagery that once only superpowers had. In fact  if you've got a cell phone  you've got access to power that a superpower didn't have  and would have highly classified    years ago. In my cell phone  I have an app that tells me where every plane in the world is  and its altitude  and its speed  and what kind of aircraft it is  and where it's going and where it's landing. They have apps that allow them to know what their adversary is about to do. They're using these tools in new ways. When a cafe in Sydney was taken over by a terrorist  he went in with a rifle... and an iPad. And the weapon was the iPad. Because he captured people  he terrorized them  he pointed the iPad at them  and then he took the video and he put it on the Internet  and he took over the world's media. But it doesn't just affect the security side. The relations between great powers    we thought we were past the bipolar era. We thought we were in a unipolar world  where all the big issues were resolved. Remember  It was the end of history. But we're not. We're now seeing that our basic assumptions about the Internet    that it was going to connect us  weave society together    are not necessarily true. In countries like China  you have the Great Firewall of China. You've got countries saying no  if the Internet happens within our borders we control it within our borders. We control the content. We are going to control our security. We are going to manage that Internet. We are going to say what can be on it. We're going to set a different set of rules. Now you might think  well  that's just China. But it's not just China. It's China  India  Russia. It's Saudi Arabia  it's Singapore  it's Brazil. After the NSA scandal  the Russians  the Chinese  the Indians  the Brazilians  they said  let's create a new Internet backbone  because we can't be dependent on this other one. And so all of a sudden  what do you have  You have a new bipolar world in which cyber internationalism  our belief  is challenged by cyber nationalism  another belief. We are seeing these changes everywhere we look. We are seeing the advent of mobile money. It's happening in the places you wouldn't expect. It's happening in Kenya and Tanzania  where millions of people who haven't had access to financial services now conduct all those services on their phones. There are  .  million people who don't have financial service access that are going to get it soon. A billion of them are going to have the ability to access it on their cell phone soon. It's not just going to give them the ability to bank. It's going to change what monetary policy is. It's going to change what money is. Education is changing in the same way. Healthcare is changing in the same way. How government services are delivered is changing in the same way. And yet  in Washington  we are debating whether to call the terrorist group that has taken over Syria and Iraq ISIS or ISIL or Islamic State. We are trying to determine how much we want to give in a negotiation with the Iranians on a nuclear deal which deals with the technologies of    years ago  when in fact  we know that the Iranians right now are engaged in cyber war with us and we're ignoring it  partially because businesses are not willing to talk about the attacks that are being waged on them. And that gets us to another breakdown that's crucial  and another breakdown that couldn't be more important to a group like this  because the growth of America and real American national security and all of the things that drove progress even during the Cold War  was a public private partnership between science  technology and government that began when Thomas Jefferson sat alone in his laboratory inventing new things. But it was the canals and railroads and telegraph  it was radar and the Internet. It was Tang  the breakfast drink    probably not the most important of those developments. But what you had was a partnership and a dialogue  and the dialogue has broken down. It's broken down because in Washington  less government is considered more. It's broken down because there is  believe it or not  in Washington  a war on science    despite the fact that in all of human history  every time anyone has waged a war on science  science has won. But we have a government that doesn't want to listen  that doesn't have people at the highest levels that understand this. In the nuclear age  when there were people in senior national security jobs  they were expected to speak throw weight. They were expected to know the lingo  the vocabulary. If you went to the highest level of the U.S. government now and said   Talk to me about cyber  about neuroscience  about the things that are going to change the world of tomorrow   you'd get a blank stare. I know  because when I wrote this book  I talked to     people  many from the science and tech side  who felt like they were being shunted off to the kids' table. Meanwhile  on the tech side  we have lots of wonderful people creating wonderful things  but they started in garages and they didn't need the government and they don't want the government. Many of them have a political view that's somewhere between libertarian and anarchic  leave me alone. But the world's coming apart. All of a sudden  there are going to be massive regulatory changes and massive issues associated with conflict and massive issues associated with security and privacy. And we haven't even gotten to the next set of issues  which are philosophical issues. If you can't vote  if you can't have a job  if you can't bank  if you can't get health care  if you can't be educated without Internet access  is Internet access a fundamental right that should be written into constitutions  If Internet access is a fundamental right  is electricity access for the  .  billion who don't have access to electricity a fundamental right  These are fundamental issues. Where are the philosophers  Where's the dialogue  And that brings me to the reason that I'm here. I live in Washington. Pity me. The dialogue isn't happening there. These big issues that will change the world  change national security  change economics  create hope  create threats  can only be resolved when you bring together groups of people who understand science and technology back together with government. Both sides need each other. And until we recreate that connection  until we do what helped America grow and helped other countries grow  then we are going to grow ever more vulnerable. The risks associated with      will not be measured in terms of lives lost by terror attacks or buildings destroyed or trillions of dollars spent. They'll be measured in terms of the costs of our distraction from critical issues and our inability to get together scientists  technologists  government leaders  at a moment of transformation akin to the beginning of the Renaissance  akin to the beginning of the major transformational eras that have happened on Earth  and start coming up with  if not the right answers  then at least the right questions. We are not there yet  but discussions like this and groups like you are the places where those questions can be formulated and posed. And that's why I believe that groups like TED  discussions like this around the planet  are the place where the future of foreign policy  of economic policy  of social policy  of philosophy  will ultimately take place. And that's why it's been a pleasure speaking to you. Thank you very  very much. For the last    years  a lot of smart  well resourced people    some of you  no doubt    have been trying to figure out how to reduce poverty in the United States. People have created and invested millions of dollars into non profit organizations with the mission of helping people who are poor. They've created think tanks that study issues like education  job creation and asset building  and then advocated for policies to support our most marginalized communities. They've written books and columns and given passionate speeches  decrying the wealth gap that is leaving more and more people entrenched at the bottom end of the income scale. And that effort has helped. But it's not enough. Our poverty rates haven't changed that much in the last    years  since the War on Poverty was launched. I'm here to tell you that we have overlooked the most powerful and practical resource. Here it is  people who are poor. Up in the left hand corner is Jobana  Sintia and Bertha. They met when they all had small children  through a parenting class at a family resource center in San Francisco. As they grew together as parents and friends  they talked a lot about how hard it was to make money when your kids are little. Child care is expensive  more than they'd earn in a job. Their husbands worked  but they wanted to contribute financially  too. So they hatched a plan. They started a cleaning business. They plastered neighborhoods with flyers and handed business cards out to their families and friends  and soon  they had clients calling. Two of them would clean the office or house and one of them would watch the kids. They'd rotate who'd cleaned and who'd watch the kids. And they split the money three ways. It was not a full time gig  no one could watch the little ones all day. But it made a difference for their families. Extra money to pay for bills when a husband's work hours were cut. Money to buy the kids clothes as they were growing. A little extra money in their pockets to make them feel some independence. Up in the top right corner is Theresa and her daughter  Brianna. Brianna is one of those kids with this sparkly  infectious  outgoing personality. For example  when Rosie  a little girl who spoke only Spanish  moved in next door  Brianna  who spoke only English  borrowed her mother's tablet and found a translation app so the two of them could communicate. I know  right  Rosie's family credits Brianna with helping Rosie to learn English. A few years ago  Brianna started to struggle academically. She was growing frustrated and kind of withdrawn and acting out in class. And her mother was heartbroken over what was happening. Then they found out that she was going to have to repeat second grade and Brianna was devastated. Her mother felt hopeless and overwhelmed and alone because she knew that her daughter was not getting the support she needed  and she did not know how to help her. One afternoon  Theresa was catching up with a group of friends  and one of them said   Theresa  how are you   And she burst into tears. After she shared her story  one of her friends said   I went through the exact same thing with my son about a year ago.  And in that moment  Theresa realized that so much of her struggle was not having anybody to talk with about it. So she created a support group for parents like her. The first meeting was her and two other people. But word spread  and soon    people     people were showing up for these monthly meetings that she put together. She went from feeling helpless to realizing how capable she was of supporting her daughter  with the support of other people who were going through the same struggle. And Brianna is doing fantastic    she's doing great academically and socially. That in the middle is my man Baakir  standing in front of BlackStar Books and Caffe  which he runs out of part of his house. As you walk in the door  Baakir greets you with a  Welcome black home.  Once inside  you can order some Algiers jerk chicken  perhaps a vegan walnut burger  or jive turkey sammich. And that's sammich    not sandwich. You must finish your meal with a buttermilk drop  which is several steps above a donut hole and made from a very secret family recipe. For real  it's very secret  he won't tell you about it. But BlackStar is much more than a caf . For the kids in the neighborhood  it's a place to go after school to get help with homework. For the grown ups  it's where they go to find out what's going on in the neighborhood and catch up with friends. It's a performance venue. It's a home for poets  musicians and artists. Baakir and his partner Nicole  with their baby girl strapped to her back  are there in the mix of it all  serving up a cup of coffee  teaching a child how to play Mancala  or painting a sign for an upcoming community event. I have worked with and learned from people just like them for more than    years. I have organized against the prison system  which impacts poor folks  especially black  indigenous and Latino folks  at an alarming rate. I have worked with young people who manifest hope and promise  despite being at the effect of racist discipline practices in their schools  and police violence in their communities. I have learned from families who are unleashing their ingenuity and tenacity to collectively create their own solutions. And they're not just focused on money. They're addressing education  housing  health  community    the things that we all care about. Everywhere I go  I see people who are broke but not broken. I see people who are struggling to realize their good ideas  so that they can create a better life for themselves  their families  their communities. Jobana  Sintia  Bertha  Theresa and Baakir are the rule  not the shiny exception. I am the exception. I was raised by a quietly fierce single mother in Rochester  New York. I was bussed to a school in the suburbs  from a neighborhood that many of my classmates and their parents considered dangerous. At eight  I was a latchkey kid. I'd get myself home after school every day and do homework and chores  and wait for my mother to come home. After school  I'd go to the corner store and buy a can of Chef Boyardee ravioli  which I'd heat up on the stove as my afternoon snack. If I had a little extra money  I'd buy a Hostess Fruit Pie. Cherry. Not as good as a buttermilk drop. We were poor when I was a kid. But now  I own a home in a quickly gentrifying neighborhood in Oakland  California. I've built a career. My husband is a business owner. I have a retirement account. My daughter is not even allowed to turn on the stove unless there's a grown up at home and she doesn't have to  because she does not have to have the same kind of self reliance that I had to at her age. My kids' raviolis are organic and full of things like spinach and ricotta  because I have the luxury of choice when it comes to what my children eat. I am the exception  not because I'm more talented than Baakir or my mother worked any harder than Jobana  Sintia or Bertha  or cared any more than Theresa. Marginalized communities are full of smart  talented people  hustling and working and innovating  just like our most revered and most rewarded CEOs. They are full of people tapping into their resilience to get up every day  get the kids off to school and go to jobs that don't pay enough  or get educations that are putting them in debt. They are full of people applying their savvy intelligence to stretch a minimum wage paycheck  or balance a job and a side hustle to make ends meet. They are full of people doing for themselves and for others  whether it's picking up medication for an elderly neighbor  or letting a sibling borrow some money to pay the phone bill  or just watching out for the neighborhood kids from the front stoop. I am the exception because of luck and privilege  not hard work. And I'm not being modest or self deprecating    I am amazing. But most people work hard. Hard work is the common denominator in this equation  and I'm tired of the story we tell that hard work leads to success  because that allows    Thank you. ... because that story allows those of us who make it to believe we deserve it  and by implication  those who don't make it don't deserve it. We tell ourselves  in the back of our minds  and sometimes in the front of our mouths   There must be something a little wrong with those poor people.  We have a wide range of beliefs about what that something wrong is. Some people tell the story that poor folks are lazy freeloaders who would cheat and lie to get out of an honest day's work. Others prefer the story that poor people are helpless and probably had neglectful parents that didn't read to them enough  and if they were just told what to do and shown the right path  they could make it. For every story I hear demonizing low income single mothers or absentee fathers  which is how people might think of my parents  I've got    that tell a different story about the same people  showing up every day and doing their best. I'm not saying that some of the negative stories aren't true  but those stories allow us to not really see who people really are  because they don't paint a full picture. The quarter truths and limited plot lines have us convinced that poor people are a problem that needs fixing. What if we recognized that what's working is the people and what's broken is our approach  What if we realized that the experts we are looking for  the experts we need to follow  are poor people themselves  What if  instead of imposing solutions  we just added fire to the already burning flame that they have  Not directing    not even empowering    but just fueling their initiative. Just north of here  we have an example of what this could look like  Silicon Valley. A whole venture capital industry has grown up around the belief that if people have good ideas and the desire to manifest them  we should give them lots and lots and lots of money. Right  But where is our strategy for Theresa and Baakir  There are no incubators for them  no accelerators  no fellowships. How are Jobana  Sintia and Bertha really all that different from the Mark Zuckerbergs of the world  Baakir has experience and a track record. I'd put my money on him. So  consider this an invitation to rethink a flawed strategy. Let's grasp this opportunity to let go of a tired  faulty narrative and listen and look for true stories  more beautifully complex stories  about who marginalized people and families and communities are. I'm going to take a minute to speak to my people. We cannot wait for somebody else to get it right. Let us remember what we are capable of  all that we have built with blood  sweat and dreams  all the cogs that keep turning  and the people kept afloat because of our backbreaking work. Let us remember that we are magic. If you need some inspiration to jog your memory  read Octavia Butler's  Parable of the Sower.  Listen to Reverend King's  Letter from Birmingham Jail.  Listen to Suheir Hammad recite  First Writing Since   or Esperanza Spalding perform  Black Gold.  Set your gaze upon the art of Kehinde Wiley or Favianna Rodriguez. Look at the hands of your grandmother or into the eyes of someone who loves you. We are magic. Individually  we don't have a lot of wealth and power  but collectively  we are unstoppable. And we spend a lot of our time and energy organizing our power to demand change from systems that were not made for us. Instead of trying to alter the fabric of existing ways  let's weave and cut some fierce new cloth. Let's use some of our substantial collective power toward inventing and bringing to life new ways of being that work for us. Desmond Tutu talks about the concept of ubuntu  in the context of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation process that they embarked on after apartheid. He says it means   My humanity is caught up  is inextricably bound up  in yours  we belong to a bundle of life.  A bundle of life. The Truth and Reconciliation process started by elevating the voices of the unheard. If this country is going to live up to its promise of liberty and justice for all  then we need to elevate the voices of our unheard  of people like Jobana  Sintia and Bertha  Theresa and Baakir. We must leverage their solutions and their ideas. We must listen to their true stories  their more beautifully complex stories. Thank you. I'm here to recruit men to support gender equality. Wait  wait. What  What do men have to do with gender equality  Gender equality is about women  right  I mean  the word gender is about women. Actually  I'm even here speaking as a middle class white man. Now  I wasn't always a middle class white man. It all happened for me about    years ago when I was in graduate school  and a bunch of us graduate students got together one day  and we said  you know  there's an explosion of writing and thinking in feminist theory  but there's no courses yet. So we did what graduate students typically do in a situation like that. We said  OK  let's have a study group. We'll read a text  we'll talk about it  we'll have a potluck dinner. So every week     women and me got together. We would read some text in feminist theory and have a conversation about it. And during one of our conversations  I witnessed an interaction that changed my life forever. It was a conversation between two women. One of the women was white  and one was black. And the white woman said    this is going to sound very anachronistic now    the white woman said   All women face the same oppression as women. All women are similarly situated in patriarchy  and therefore all women have a kind of intuitive solidarity or sisterhood.  And the black woman said   I'm not so sure. Let me ask you a question.  So the black woman says to the white woman   When you wake up in the morning and you look in the mirror  what do you see   And the white woman said   I see a woman.  And the black woman said   You see  that's the problem for me. Because when I wake up in the morning and I look in the mirror   she said   I see a black woman. To me  race is visible. But to you  race is invisible. You don't see it.  And then she said something really startling. She said   That's how privilege works. Privilege is invisible to those who have it.  It is a luxury  I will say to the white people sitting in this room  not to have to think about race every split second of our lives. Privilege is invisible to those who have it. Now remember  I was the only man in this group  so when I witnessed this  I went   Oh no.  And somebody said   Well what was that reaction   And I said   Well  when I wake up in the morning and I look in the mirror  I see a human being. I'm kind of the generic person. You know  I'm a middle class white man. I have no race  no class  no gender. I'm universally generalizable.  So I like to think that was the moment I became a middle class white man  that class and race and gender were not about other people  they were about me. I had to start thinking about them  and it had been privilege that had kept it invisible to me for so long. Now  I wish I could tell you this story ends    years ago in that little discussion group  but I was reminded of it quite recently at my university where I teach. I have a colleague  and she and I both teach the sociology of gender course on alternate semesters. So she gives a guest lecture for me when I teach. I give a guest lecture for her when she teaches. So I walk into her class to give a guest lecture  about     students in the room  and as I walk in  one of the students looks up and says   Oh  finally  an objective opinion.  All that semester  whenever my colleague opened her mouth  what my students saw was a woman. I mean  if you were to say to my students   There is structural inequality based on gender in the United States   they'd say   Well of course you'd say that. You're a woman. You're biased.  When I say it  they go   Wow  is that interesting. Is that going to be on the test  How do you spell 'structural'   So I hope you all can see  this is what objectivity looks like. Disembodied Western rationality. And that  by the way  is why I think men so often wear ties. Because if you are going to embody disembodied Western rationality  you need a signifier  and what could be a better signifier of disembodied Western rationality than a garment that at one end is a noose and the other end points to the genitals  That is mind body dualism right there. So making gender visible to men is the first step to engaging men to support gender equality. Now  when men first hear about gender equality  when they first start thinking about it  they often think  many men think  well  that's right  that's fair  that's just  that's the ethical imperative. But not all men. Some men think    the lightning bolt goes off  and they go   Oh my God  yes  gender equality   and they will immediately begin to mansplain to you your oppression. They see supporting gender equality something akin to the cavalry  like   Thanks very much for bringing this to our attention  ladies  we'll take it from here.  This results in a syndrome that I like to call 'premature self congratulation.' There's another group  though  that actively resists gender equality  that sees gender equality as something that is detrimental to men. I was on a TV talk show opposite four white men. This is the beginning of the book I wrote  'Angry White Men.' These were four angry white men who believed that they  white men in America  were the victims of reverse discrimination in the workplace. And they all told stories about how they were qualified for jobs  qualified for promotions  they didn't get them  they were really angry. And the reason I'm telling you this is I want you to hear the title of this particular show. It was a quote from one of the men  and the quote was   A Black Woman Stole My Job.  And they all told their stories  qualified for jobs  qualified for promotions  didn't get it  really angry. And then it was my turn to speak  and I said   I have just one question for you guys  and it's about the title of the show  'A Black Woman Stole My Job.' Actually  it's about one word in the title. I want to know about the word 'my.' Where did you get the idea it was your job  Why isn't the title of the show  'A Black Woman Got the Job ' or 'A Black Woman Got A Job '  Because without confronting men's sense of entitlement  I don't think we'll ever understand why so many men resist gender equality. Look  we think this is a level playing field  so any policy that tilts it even a little bit  we think   Oh my God  water's rushing uphill. It's reverse discrimination against us.  So let me be very clear  white men in Europe and the United States are the beneficiaries of the single greatest affirmative action program in the history of the world. It is called  the history of the world.  So  now I've established some of the obstacles to engaging men  but why should we support gender equality  Of course  it's fair  it's right and it's just. But more than that  gender equality is also in our interest as men. If you listen to what men say about what they want in their lives  gender equality is actually a way for us to get the lives we want to live. Gender equality is good for countries. It turns out  according to most studies  that those countries that are the most gender equal are also the countries that score highest on the happiness scale. And that's not just because they're all in Europe. Even within Europe  those countries that are more gender equal also have the highest levels of happiness. It is also good for companies. Research by Catalyst and others has shown conclusively that the more gender equal companies are  the better it is for workers  the happier their labor force is. They have lower job turnover. They have lower levels of attrition. They have an easier time recruiting. They have higher rates of retention  higher job satisfaction  higher rates of productivity. So the question I'm often asked in companies is   Boy  this gender equality thing  that's really going to be expensive  huh   And I say   Oh no  in fact  what you have to start calculating is how much gender inequality is already costing you. It is extremely expensive.  So it is good for business. And the other thing is  it's good for men. It is good for the kind of lives we want to live  because young men especially have changed enormously  and they want to have lives that are animated by terrific relationships with their children. They expect their partners  their spouses  their wives  to work outside the home and be just as committed to their careers as they are. I was talking  to give you an illustration of this change    Some of you may remember this. When I was a lot younger  there was a riddle that was posed to us. Some of you may wince to remember this riddle. This riddle went something like this. A man and his son are driving on the freeway  and they're in a terrible accident  and the father is killed  and the son is brought to the hospital emergency room  and as they're bringing the son into the hospital emergency room  the emergency room attending physician sees the boy and says   Oh  I can't treat him  that's my son.  How is this possible  We were flummoxed by this. We could not figure this out. Well  I decided to do a little experiment with my    year old son. He had a bunch of his friends hanging out at the house watching a game on TV recently. So I decided I would pose this riddle to them  just to see  to gauge the level of change. Well     year old boys  they immediately turned to me and said   It's his mom.  Right  No problem. Just like that. Except for my son  who said   Well  he could have two dads.  That's an index  an indicator of how things have changed. Younger men today expect to be able to balance work and family. They want to be dual career  dual carer couples. They want to be able to balance work and family with their partners. They want to be involved fathers. Now  it turns out that the more egalitarian our relationships  the happier both partners are. Data from psychologists and sociologists are quite persuasive here. I think we have the persuasive numbers  the data  to prove to men that gender equality is not a zero sum game  but a win win. Here's what the data show. Now  when men begin the process of engaging with balancing work and family  we often have two phrases that we use to describe what we do. We pitch in and we help out. And I'm going to propose something a little bit more radical  one word   share.  Because here's what the data show  when men share housework and childcare  their children do better in school. Their children have lower rates of absenteeism  higher rates of achievement. They are less likely to be diagnosed with ADHD. They are less likely to see a child psychiatrist. They are less likely to be put on medication. So when men share housework and childcare  their children are happier and healthier  and men want this. When men share housework and childcare  their wives are happier. Duh. Not only that  their wives are healthier. Their wives are less likely to see a therapist  less likely to be diagnosed with depression  less likely to be put on medication  more likely to go to the gym  report higher levels of marital satisfaction. So when men share housework and childcare  their wives are happier and healthier  and men certainly want this as well. When men share housework and childcare  the men are healthier. They smoke less  drink less  take recreational drugs less often. They are less likely to go to the ER but more like to go to a doctor for routine screenings. They are less likely to see a therapist  less likely to be diagnosed with depression  less likely to be taking prescription medication. So when men share housework and childcare  the men are happier and healthier. And who wouldn't want that  And finally  when men share housework and childcare  they have more sex. Now  of these four fascinating findings  which one do you think Men's Health magazine put on its cover   Housework Makes Her Horny. Now  I will say  just to remind the men in the audience  these data were collected over a really long period of time  so I don't want listeners to say   Hmm  OK  I think I'll do the dishes tonight.  These data were collected over a really long period of time. But I think it shows something important  that when Men's Health magazine put it on their cover  they also called  you'll love this   Choreplay.  So  what we found is something really important  that gender equality is in the interest of countries  of companies  and of men  and their children and their partners  that gender equality is not a zero sum game. It's not a win lose. It is a win win for everyone. And what we also know is we cannot fully empower women and girls unless we engage boys and men. We know this. And my position is that men need the very things that women have identified that they need to live the lives they say they want to live in order to live the lives that we say we want to live. In       on the eve of one of the great suffrage demonstrations down Fifth Avenue in New York City  a writer in New York wrote an article in a magazine  and the title of the article was   Feminism for Men.  And this was the first line of that article   Feminism will make it possible for the first time for men to be free.  Thank you. I published this article in the New York Times Modern Love column in January of this year.  To Fall in Love With Anyone  Do This.  And the article is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the laboratory  and my own experience trying the study myself one night last summer. So the procedure is fairly simple  two strangers take turns asking each other    increasingly personal questions and then they stare into each other's eyes without speaking for four minutes. So here are a couple of sample questions. Number     If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability  what would it be  Number     When did you last cry in front of another person  By yourself  As you can see  they really do get more personal as they go along. Number     I really like this one  Tell your partner what you like about them  be very honest this time  saying things you might not say to someone you just met. So when I first came across this study a few years earlier  one detail really stuck out to me  and that was the rumor that two of the participants had gotten married six months later  and they'd invited the entire lab to the ceremony. So I was of course very skeptical about this process of just manufacturing romantic love  but of course I was intrigued. And when I got the chance to try this study myself  with someone I knew but not particularly well  I wasn't expecting to fall in love. But then we did  and    And I thought it made a good story  so I sent it to the Modern Love column a few months later. Now  this was published in January  and now it is August  so I'm guessing that some of you are probably wondering  are we still together  And the reason I think you might be wondering this is because I have been asked this question again and again and again for the past seven months. And this question is really what I want to talk about today. But let's come back to it. So the week before the article came out  I was very nervous. I had been working on a book about love stories for the past few years  so I had gotten used to writing about my own experiences with romantic love on my blog. But a blog post might get a couple hundred views at the most  and those were usually just my Facebook friends  and I figured my article in the New York Times would probably get a few thousand views. And that felt like a lot of attention on a relatively new relationship. But as it turned out  I had no idea. So the article was published online on a Friday evening  and by Saturday  this had happened to the traffic on my blog. And by Sunday  both the Today Show and Good Morning America had called. Within a month  the article would receive over   million views  and I was  to say the least  underprepared for this sort of attention. It's one thing to work up the confidence to write honestly about your experiences with love  but it is another thing to discover that your love life has made international news    and to realize that people across the world are genuinely invested in the status of your new relationship. And when people called or emailed  which they did every day for weeks  they always asked the same question first  are you guys still together  In fact  as I was preparing this talk  I did a quick search of my email inbox for the phrase  Are you still together   and several messages popped up immediately. They were from students and journalists and friendly strangers like this one. I did radio interviews and they asked. I even gave a talk  and one woman shouted up to the stage   Hey Mandy  where's your boyfriend   And I promptly turned bright red. I understand that this is part of the deal. If you write about your relationship in an international newspaper  you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it. But I just wasn't prepared for the scope of the response. The    questions seem to have taken on a life of their own. In fact  the New York Times published a follow up article for Valentine's Day  which featured readers' experiences of trying the study themselves  with varying degrees of success. So my first impulse in the face of all of this attention was to become very protective of my own relationship. I said no to every request for the two of us to do a media appearance together. I turned down TV interviews  and I said no to every request for photos of the two us. I think I was afraid that we would become inadvertent icons for the process of falling in love  a position I did not at all feel qualified for. And I get it  people didn't just want to know if the study worked  they wanted to know if it really worked  that is  if it was capable of producing love that would last  not just a fling  but real love  sustainable love. But this was a question I didn't feel capable of answering. My own relationship was only a few months old  and I felt like people were asking the wrong question in the first place. What would knowing whether or not we were still together really tell them  If the answer was no  would it make the experience of doing these    questions any less worthwhile  Dr. Arthur Aron first wrote about these questions in this study here in       and here  the researcher's goal was not to produce romantic love. Instead  they wanted to foster interpersonal closeness among college students  by using what Aron called  sustained  escalating  reciprocal  personalistic self disclosure.  Sounds romantic  doesn't it  But the study did work. The participants did feel closer after doing it  and several subsequent studies have also used Aron's fast friends protocol as a way to quickly create trust and intimacy between strangers. They've used it between members of the police and members of community  and they've used it between people of opposing political ideologies. The original version of the story  the one that I tried last summer  that pairs the personal questions with four minutes of eye contact  was referenced in this article  but unfortunately it was never published. So a few months ago  I was giving a talk at a small liberal arts college  and a student came up to me afterwards and he said  kind of shyly   So  I tried your study  and it didn't work.  He seemed a little mystified by this.  You mean  you didn't fall in love with the person you did it with   I asked.  Well...  He paused.  I think she just wants to be friends.   But did you become better friends   I asked.  Did you feel like you got to really know each other after doing the study   He nodded.  So  then it worked   I said. I don't think this is the answer he was looking for. In fact  I don't think this is the answer that any of us are looking for when it comes to love. I first came across this study when I was    and I was going through a really difficult breakup. I had been in the relationship since I was     which was basically my entire adult life  and he was my first real love  and I had no idea how or if I could make a life without him. So I turned to science. I researched everything I could find about the science of romantic love  and I think I was hoping that it might somehow inoculate me from heartache. I don't know if I realized this at the time    I thought I was just doing research for this book I was writing    but it seems really obvious in retrospect. I hoped that if I armed myself with the knowledge of romantic love  I might never have to feel as terrible and lonely as I did then. And all this knowledge has been useful in some ways. I am more patient with love. I am more relaxed. I am more confident about asking for what I want. But I can also see myself more clearly  and I can see that what I want is sometimes more than can reasonably be asked for. What I want from love is a guarantee  not just that I am loved today and that I will be loved tomorrow  but that I will continue to be loved by the person I love indefinitely. Maybe it's this possibility of a guarantee that people were really asking about when they wanted to know if we were still together. So the story that the media told about the    questions was that there might be a shortcut to falling in love. There might be a way to somehow mitigate some of the risk involved  and this is a very appealing story  because falling in love feels amazing  but it's also terrifying. The moment you admit to loving someone  you admit to having a lot to lose  and it's true that these questions do provide a mechanism for getting to know someone quickly  which is also a mechanism for being known  and I think this is the thing that most of us really want from love  to be known  to be seen  to be understood. But I think when it comes to love  we are too willing to accept the short version of the story. The version of the story that asks   Are you still together   and is content with a yes or no answer. So rather than that question  I would propose we ask some more difficult questions  questions like  How do you decide who deserves your love and who does not  How do you stay in love when things get difficult  and how do you know when to just cut and run  How do you live with the doubt that inevitably creeps into every relationship  or even harder  how do you live with your partner's doubt  I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions  but I think they're an important start at having a more thoughtful conversation about what it means to love someone. So  if you want it  the short version of the story of my relationship is this  a year ago  an acquaintance and I did a study designed to create romantic love  and we fell in love  and we are still together  and I am so glad. But falling in love is not the same thing as staying in love. Falling in love is the easy part. So at the end of my article  I wrote   Love didn't happen to us. We're in love because we each made the choice to be.  And I cringe a little when I read that now  not because it isn't true  but because at the time  I really hadn't considered everything that was contained in that choice. I didn't consider how many times we would each have to make that choice  and how many times I will continue to have to make that choice without knowing whether or not he will always choose me. I want it to be enough to have asked and answered    questions  and to have chosen to love someone so generous and kind and fun and to have broadcast that choice in the biggest newspaper in America. But what I have done instead is turn my relationship into the kind of myth I don't quite believe in. And what I want  what perhaps I will spend my life wanting  is for that myth to be true. I want the happy ending implied by the title to my article  which is  incidentally  the only part of the article that I didn't actually write. But what I have instead is the chance to make the choice to love someone  and the hope that he will choose to love me back  and it is terrifying  but that's the deal with love. Thank you. Wow  what an honor. I always wondered what this would feel like. So eight years ago  I got the worst career advice of my life. I had a friend tell me   Don't worry about how much you like the work you're doing now. It's all about just building your resume.  And I'd just come back from living in Spain for a while  and I'd joined this Fortune     company. I thought   This is fantastic. I'm going to have big impact on the world.  I had all these ideas. And within about two months  I noticed at about   am every morning I had this strange urge to want to slam my head through the monitor of my computer. I don't know if anyone's ever felt that. And I noticed pretty soon after that that all the competitors in our space had already automated my job role. And this is right about when I got this sage advice to build up my resume. Well  as I'm trying to figure out what two story window I'm going to jump out of and change things up  I read some altogether different advice from Warren Buffett  and he said   Taking jobs to build up your resume is the same as saving up sex for old age.  And I heard that  and that was all I needed. Within two weeks  I was out of there  and I left with one intention  to find something that I could screw up. That's how tough it was. I wanted to have some type of impact. It didn't matter what it was. And I found pretty quickly that I wasn't alone  it turns out that over    percent of the people around don't enjoy their work. I'm guessing this room is different  but that's the average that Deloitte has done with their studies. So I wanted to find out  what is it that sets these people apart  the people who do the passionate  world changing work  that wake up inspired every day  and then these people  the other    percent who lead these lives of quiet desperation. So I started to interview all these people doing this inspiring work  and I read books and did case studies      books altogether on purpose and career and all this  totally just self immersion  really for the selfish reason of    I wanted to find the work that I couldn't not do  what that was for me. But as I was doing this  more and more people started to ask me   You're into this career thing. I don't like my job. Can we sit down for lunch   I'd say   Sure.  But I would have to warn them  because at this point  my quit rate was also    percent. Of the people I'd sit down with for lunch     percent would quit their job within two months. I was proud of this  and it wasn't that I had any special magic. It was that I would ask one simple question. It was   Why are you doing the work that you're doing   And so often their answer would be   Well  because somebody told me I'm supposed to.  And I realized that so many people around us are climbing their way up this ladder that someone tells them to climb  and it ends up being leaned up against the wrong wall  or no wall at all. The more time I spent around these people and saw this problem  I thought  what if we could create a community  a place where people could feel like they belonged and that it was OK to do things differently  to take the road less traveled  where that was encouraged  and inspire people to change  And that later became what I now call Live Your Legend  which I'll explain in a little bit. But as I've made these discoveries  I noticed a framework of really three simple things that all these different passionate world changers have in common  whether you're a Steve Jobs or if you're just  you know  the person that has the bakery down the street. But you're doing work that embodies who you are. I want to share those three with you  so we can use them as a lens for the rest of today and hopefully the rest of our life. The first part of this three step passionate work framework is becoming a self expert and understanding yourself  because if you don't know what you're looking for  you're never going to find it. And the thing is that no one is going to do this for us. There's no major in university on passion and purpose and career. I don't know how that's not a required double major  but don't even get me started on that. I mean  you spend more time picking out a dorm room TV set than you do you picking your major and your area of study. But the point is  it's on us to figure that out  and we need a framework  we need a way to navigate through this. And so the first step of our compass is finding out what our unique strengths are. What are the things that we wake up loving to do no matter what  whether we're paid or we're not paid  the things that people thank us for  And the Strengths Finder  .  is a book and also an online tool. I highly recommend it for sorting out what it is that you're naturally good at. And next  what's our framework or our hierarchy for making decisions  Do we care about the people  our family  health  or is it achievement  success  all this stuff  We have to figure out what it is to make these decisions  so we know what our soul is made of  so that we don't go selling it to some cause we don't give a shit about. And then the next step is our experiences. All of us have these experiences. We learn things every day  every minute about what we love  what we hate  what we're good at  what we're terrible at. And if we don't spend time paying attention to that and assimilating that learning and applying it to the rest of our lives  it's all for nothing. Every day  every week  every month of every year I spend some time just reflecting on what went right  what went wrong  and what do I want to repeat  what can I apply more to my life. And even more so than that  as you see people  especially today  who inspire you  who are doing things where you say  Oh God  what Jeff is doing  I want to be like him.  Why are you saying that  Open up a journal. Write down what it is about them that inspires you. It's not going to be everything about their life  but whatever it is  take note on that  so over time we'll have this repository of things that we can use to apply to our life and have a more passionate existence and make a better impact. Because when we start to put these things together  we can then define what success actually means to us  and without these different parts of the compass  it's impossible. We end up in the situation    we have that scripted life that everybody seems to be living going up this ladder to nowhere. It's kind of like in Wall Street    if anybody saw that  the peon employee asks the big Wall Street banker CEO   What's your number  Everyone's got a number  where if they make this money  they'll leave it all.  He says   Oh  it's simple. More.  And he just smiles. And it's the sad state of most of the people that haven't spent time understanding what matters for them  who keep reaching for something that doesn't mean anything to us  but we're doing it because everyone said we're supposed to. But once we have this framework together  we can start to identify the things that make us come alive. You know  before this  a passion could come and hit you in the face  or maybe in your possible line of work  you might throw it away because you don't have a way of identifying it. But once you do  you can see something that's congruent with my strengths  my values  who I am as a person  so I'm going to grab ahold of this  I'm going to do something with it  and I'm going to pursue it and try to make an impact with it. And Live Your Legend and the movement we've built wouldn't exist if I didn't have this compass to identify   Wow  this is something I want to pursue and make a difference with.  If we don't know what we're looking for  we're never going to find it  but once we have this framework  this compass  then we can move on to what's next    and that's not me up there    doing the impossible and pushing our limits. There's two reasons why people don't do things. One is they tell themselves they can't do them  or people around them tell them they can't do them. Either way  we start to believe it. Either we give up  or we never start in the first place. The things is  everyone was impossible until somebody did it. Every invention  every new thing in the world  people thought were crazy at first. Roger Bannister and the four minute mile  it was a physical impossibility to break the four minute mile in a foot race until Roger Bannister stood up and did it. And then what happened  Two months later     people broke the four minute mile. The things that we have in our head that we think are impossible are often just milestones waiting to be accomplished if we can push those limits a bit. And I think this starts with probably your physical body and fitness more than anything  because we can control that. If you don't think you can run a mile  you show yourself you can run a mile or two  or a marathon  or lose five pounds  or whatever it is  you realize that confidence compounds and can be transferred into the rest of your world. And I've actually gotten into the habit of this a little bit with my friends. We have this little group. We go on physical adventures  and recently  I found myself in a kind of precarious spot. I'm terrified of deep  dark  blue water. I don't know if anyone's ever had that same fear ever since they watched Jaws         and   like six times when I was a kid. But anything above here  if it's murky  I can already feel it right now. I swear there's something in there. Even if it's Lake Tahoe  it's fresh water  totally unfounded fear  ridiculous  but it's there. Anyway  three years ago I find myself on this tugboat right down here in the San Francisco Bay. It's a rainy  stormy  windy day  and people are getting sick on the boat  and I'm sitting there wearing a wetsuit  and I'm looking out the window in pure terror thinking I'm about to swim to my death. I'm going to try to swim across the Golden Gate. And my guess is some people in this room might have done that before. I'm sitting there  and my buddy Jonathan  who had talked me into it  he comes up to me and he could see the state I was in. And he says   Scott  hey man  what's the worst that could happen  You're wearing a wetsuit. You're not going to sink. And If you can't make it  just hop on one of the    kayaks. Plus  if there's a shark attack  why are they going to pick you over the    people in the water   So thanks  that helps. He's like   But really  just have fun with this. Good luck.  And he dives in  swims off. OK. Turns out  the pep talk totally worked  and I felt this total feeling of calm  and I think it was because Jonathan was    years old. And of the    people swimming that day     of them were between the ages of nine and   . Think how you would have approached your world differently if at nine years old you found out you could swim a mile and a half in    degree water from Alcatraz to San Francisco. What would you have said yes to  What would you have not given up on  What would you have tried  As I'm finishing this swim  I get to Aquatic Park  and I'm getting out of the water and of course half the kids are already finished  so they're cheering me on and they're all excited. And I got total popsicle head  if anyone's ever swam in the Bay  and I'm trying to just thaw my face out  and I'm watching people finish. And I see this one kid  something didn't look right. And he's just flailing like this. And he's barely able to sip some air before he slams his head back down. And I notice other parents were watching too  and I swear they were thinking the same thing I was  this is why you don't let nine year olds swim from Alcatraz. This was not fatigue. All of a sudden  two parents run up and grab him  and they put him on their shoulders  and they're dragging him like this  totally limp. And then all of a sudden they walk a few more feet and they plop him down in his wheelchair. And he puts his fists up in the most insane show of victory I've ever seen. I can still feel the warmth and the energy on this guy when he made this accomplishment. I had seen him earlier that day in his wheelchair. I just had no idea he was going to swim. I mean  where is he going to be in    years  How many people told him he couldn't do that  that he would die if tried that  You prove people wrong  you prove yourself wrong  that you can make little incremental pushes of what you believe is possible. You don't have to be the fastest marathoner in the world  just your own impossibilities  to accomplish those  and it starts with little bitty steps. And the best way to do this is to surround yourself with passionate people. The fastest things to do things you don't think can be done is to surround yourself with people already doing them. There's this quote by Jim Rohn and it says.  You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.  And there is no bigger lifehack in the history of the world from getting where you are today to where you want to be than the people you choose to put in your corner. They change everything  and it's a proven fact. In       Norman Triplett did this study with a bunch of cyclists  and he would measure their times around the track in a group  and also individually. And he found that every time the cyclists in the group would cycle faster. And it's been repeated in all kinds of walks of life since then  and it proves the same thing over again  that the people around you matter  and environment is everything. But it's on you to control it  because it can go both ways. With    percent of people who don't like the work they do  that means most people around us  not in this room  but everywhere else  are encouraging complacency and keeping us from pursuing the things that matter to us so we have to manage those surroundings. I found myself in this situation    personal example  a couple years ago. Has anyone ever had a hobby or a passion they poured their heart and soul into  unbelievable amount of time  and they so badly want to call it a business  but no one's paying attention and it doesn't make a dime  OK  I was there for four years trying to build this Live Your Legend movement to help people do work that they genuinely cared about and that inspired them  and I was doing all I could  and there were only three people paying attention  and they're all right there  my mother  father and my wife  Chelsea. Thank you guys for the support. And this is how badly I wanted it  it grew at zero percent for four years  and I was about to shut it down  and right about then  I moved to San Francisco and started to meet some pretty interesting people who had these crazy lifestyles of adventure  of businesses and websites and blogs that surrounded their passions and helped people in a meaningful way. And one of my friends  now  he has a family of eight  and he supports his whole family with a blog that he writes for twice a week. They just came back from a month in Europe  all of them together. This blew my mind. How does this even exist  And I got unbelievably inspired by seeing this  and instead of shutting it down  I decided  let's take it seriously. And I did everything I could to spend my time  every waking hour possible trying to hound these guys  hanging out and having beers and workouts  whatever it was. And after four years of zero growth  within six months of hanging around these people  the community at Live Your Legend grew by    times. In another    months  it grew by     times. And today over        people from     countries use our career and connection tools on a monthly basis. And those people have made up that community of passionate folks who inspired that possibility that I dreamed of for Live Your Legend so many years back. The people change everything  and this is why    you know  you ask what was going on. Well  for four years  I knew nobody in this space  and I didn't even know it existed  that people could do this stuff  that you could have movements like this. And then I'm over here in San Francisco  and everyone around me was doing it. It became normal  so my thinking went from how could I possibly do this to how could I possibly not. And right then  when that happens  that switch goes on in your head  it ripples across your whole world. And without even trying  your standards go from here to here. You don't need to change your goals. You just need to change your surroundings. That's it  and that's why I love being around this whole group of people  why I go to every TED event I can  and watch them on my iPad on the way to work  whatever it is. Because this is the group of people that inspires possibility. We have a whole day to spend together and plenty more. To sum things up  in terms of these three pillars  they all have one thing in common more than anything else. They are     percent in our control. No one can tell you you can't learn about yourself. No one can tell you you can't push your limits and learn your own impossible and push that. No one can tell you you can't surround yourself with inspiring people or get away from the people who bring you down. You can't control a recession. You can't control getting fired or getting in a car accident. Most things are totally out of our hands. These three things are totally on us  and they can change our whole world if we decide to do something about it. And the thing is  it's starting to happen on a widespread level. I just read in Forbes  the US Government reported for the first time in a month where more people had quit their jobs than had been laid off. They thought this was an anomaly  but it's happened three months straight. In a time where people claim it's kind of a tough environment  people are giving a middle finger to this scripted life  the things that people say you're supposed to do  in exchange for things that matter to them and do the things that inspire them. And the thing is  people are waking up to this possibility  that really the only thing that limits possibility now is imagination. That's not a clich  anymore. I don't care what it is that you're into  what passion  what hobby. If you're into knitting  you can find someone who is killing it knitting  and you can learn from them. It's wild. And that's what this whole day is about  to learn from the folks speaking  and we profile these people on Live Your Legend every day  because when ordinary people are doing the extraordinary  and we can be around that  it becomes normal. And this isn't about being Gandhi or Steve Jobs  doing something crazy. It's just about doing something that matters to you  and makes an impact that only you can make. Speaking of Gandhi  he was a recovering lawyer  as I've heard the term  and he was called to a greater cause  something that mattered to him  he couldn't not do. And he has this quote that I absolutely live by.  First they ignore you  then they laugh at you  then they fight you  then you win.  Everything was impossible until somebody did it. You can either hang around the people who tell you it can't be done and tell you you're stupid for trying  or surround yourself with the people who inspire possibility  the people who are in this room. Because I see it as our responsibility to show the world that what's seen as impossible can become that new normal. And that's already starting to happen. First  do the things that inspire us  so we can inspire other people to do the things that inspire them. But we can't find that unless we know what we're looking for. We have to do our work on ourself  be intentional about that  and make those discoveries. Because I imagine a world where    percent of people love the work they do. What would that look like  What would the innovation be like  How would you treat the people around you  Things would start to change. And as we finish up  I have just one question to ask you guys  and I think it's the only question that matters. And it's what is the work you can't not do  Discover that  live it  not just for you  but for everybody around you  because that is what starts to change the world. What is the work you can't not do  Thank you guys. My father was five years old when he lost his father  but by the time I was born  he was already a businessman. But it didn't make a difference to him if his children were going to be a boy or a girl  they were going to go to school. So I guess I was the lucky one. My mother had    pregnancies. From    pregnancies  five of us are alive. You can imagine as a child what I went through. Day to day  I watched women being carried to a graveyard  or watched children going to a graveyard. At that time  when I finished my high school  I really wanted to be a doctor. I wanted to be a doctor to help women and children. So I completed my education  but I wanted to go to university. Unfortunately  in my country  there wasn't a dormitory for girls  so I was accepted in medical school  but I could not go there. So as a result  my father sent me to America. I came to America. I completed my education. While I was completing my education  my country was invaded by Russia. And do you know that at the time I was completing my education  I didn't know what was going on with my family or with my country. There were months  years  I didn't know about it. My family was in a refugee camp. So as soon as I completed my education  I brought my family to America. I wanted them to be safe. But where was my heart  My heart was in Afghanistan. Day after day  when I listened to the news  when I followed what was going on with my country  my heart was breaking up. I really wanted to go back to my country  but at the same time I knew I could not go there  because there was no place for me. I had a good job. I was a professor at a university. I earned good money. I had a good life. My family was here. I could live with them. But I wasn't happy. I wanted to go back home. So I went to the refugee camp. And when I went to the refugee camp in Pakistan  there were  .  million refugees.  .  million refugees. About    percent of them were women and children. Most of the men have been killed or they were in war. And you know  in the refugee camp  when I went day to day to do a survey  I found things you never could imagine. I saw a widow with five to eight children sitting there and weeping and not knowing what to do. I saw a young woman have no way to go anywhere  no education  no entertainment  no place to even live. I saw young men that had lost their father and their home  and they are supporting the family as a    to    year old boy    being the head of the household  trying to protect their sister and their mother and their children. So it was a very devastating situation. My heart was beating for my people  and I didn't know what to do. At that moment  we talk about momentum. At that moment  I felt  what can I do for these people  How could I help these people  I am one individual. What can I do for them  But at that moment  I knew that education changed my life. It transformed me. It gave me status. It gave me confidence. It gave me a career. It helped me to support my family  to bring my family to another country  to be safe. And I knew that at that moment that what I should give to my people is education and health  and that's what I went after. But do you think it was easy  No  because at that time  education was banned for girls  completely. And also  by Russia invading Afghanistan  people were not trusting anyone. It was very hard to come and say   I want to do this.  Who am I  Somebody who comes from the United States. Somebody who got educated here. Did they trust me  Of course not. So I really needed to build the trust in this community. How am I going to do that  I went and surveyed and looked and looked. I asked. Finally  I found one man. He was    years old. He was a mullah. I went to his tent in the camp  and I asked him   I want to make you a teacher.  And he looked at me  and he said   Crazy woman  crazy woman  how do you think I can be a teacher   And I told him   I will make you a teacher.  Finally  he accepted my offer  and once I started a class in his compound  the word spread all over. In a matter of one year  we had    schools set up         children going to school  and it was amazing. Thank you. Thank you. But of course  we're doing all our work  we were giving teacher training. We were training women's rights  human rights  democracy  rule of law. We were giving all kinds of training. And one day  I tell you  one day I was in the office in Peshawar  Pakistan. All of a sudden  I saw my staff running to rooms and locking the doors and telling me   Run away  hide   And you know  as a leader  what do you do  You're scared. You know it's dangerous. You know your life is on the line. But as a leader  you have to hold it together. You have to hold it together and show strength. So I said   What's going on   And these people were pouring into my office. So I invited them to the office. They came  and there were nine of them    nine Taliban. They were the ugliest looking men you can ever see. Very mean looking people  black clothes  black turban  and they pour into my office. And I invited them to have a seat and have tea. They said no. They are not going to drink tea. And of course  with the tone of voice they were using  it was very scary  but I was really shaking up. But also I was strong  holding myself up. And  of course  by that time  you know how I dress    I dress from head to toe in a black hijab. The only thing you could see  my eyes. They asked me   What are you doing  Don't you know that school is banned for girls  What are you doing here   And you know  I just looked at them  and I said   What school  Where is the school   And they look at my face  and they said   You are teaching girls here.  I said   This is a house of somebody. We have some students coming  and they are all learning Koran  Holy Book. And you know  Koran says that if you learn the Holy Book  the woman  they can be a good wife  and they can obey their husband.  And I tell you one thing  that's the way you work with those people  and you know    So by that time  they started speaking Pashto. They talked to each other  and they said   Let's go  leave her alone  she's OK.  And you know  this time  I offered them tea again  and they took a sip and they left. By that time  my staff poured into my office. They were scared to death. They didn't know why they didn't kill me. They didn't know why they didn't take me away. But everybody was happy to see me. Very happy  and I was happy to be alive  of course. Of course  I was happy to be alive. But also  as we continuously gave training during the fall of the Taliban    of course during the Taliban there is another story. We went underground and we provided education for    schoolgirls        students underground  and continuously we trained. With the fall of the Taliban  we went into the country  and we opened school after school. We opened women's learning center. We continuously opened clinics. We worked with mothers and children. We had reproductive health training. We had all kinds of training that you can imagine. I was very happy. I was delighted with the outcome of my work. And one day  with four trainers and one bodyguard  I was going up north of Kabul  and all of a sudden  again  I was stopped in the middle of the road by    young men. Rifles on their shoulders  they blocked the road. And I told my driver   What's going on   And the driver said   I don't know.  He asked them. They said   We have nothing to do with you.  They called my name. They said   We want her.  My bodyguard got out  said   I can answer you. What do you want   They said   Nothing.  They called my name. And by that time  the women are yelling and screaming inside the car. I am very shaken up  and I told myself  this is it. This time  we all are going to be killed. There is no doubt in my mind. But still  the moment comes  and you take strength from whatever you believe and whatever you do. It's in your heart. You believe in your worth  and you can walk on it. So I just hold myself on the side of the car. My leg was shaking  and I got outside. And I asked them   What can I do for you   You know what they said to me  They said   We know who you are. We know where you are going. Every day you go up north here and there. You train women  you teach them and also you give them an opportunity to have a job. You build their skills. How about us    And you know  how about us  What are we going to do   I looked at them  and I said   I don't know.  They said   It's OK. The only thing we can do  what we know  from the time we're born  we just hold the gun and kill. That's all we know.  And you know what that means. It's a trap to me  of course. So I walk out of there. They said   We'll let you go  go.  And so I walked into the car  I sit in the car  and I told the driver   Turn around and go back to the office.  At that time  we only were supporting girls. We only had money for women to train them  to send them to school  and nothing else. By the time I came to the office  of course my trainers were gone. They ran away home. Nobody stayed there. My bodyguard was the only one there  and my voice was completely gone. I was shaken up  and I sat on my table  and I said   What am I going to do   How am I going to solve this problem  Because we had training going on up north already. Hundreds of women were there coming to get training. So I was sitting there  all of a sudden  at this moment  talking about momentum  we are  at that moment  one of my wonderful donors called me about a report. And she asked me   Sakena   And I answered her. She said   It's not you. What's wrong with you   I said   Nothing.  I tried to cover. No matter what I tried to do  she didn't believe me  and she asked me again.  OK  tell me what's going on   I told her the whole story. At that time  she said   OK  you go next time  and you will help them. You will help them.  And when  two days later  I went the same route  and do you know  they were not in here  they were a little back further  the same young men  standing up there and holding the rifle and pointing to us to stop the car. So we stopped the car. I got out. I said   OK  let's go with me.  And they said   Yes.  I said   On one condition  that whatever I say  you accept it.  And they said  yes  they do. So I took them to the mosque  and to make a long story short  I told them I'd give them teachers. Today  they are the best trainers. They learn English  they learn how to be teachers  they learn computers  and they are my guides. Every area that is unknown to us in the mountain areas  they go with me. They are ahead  and we go. And they protect us. And    Thank you. That tells you that education transforms people. When you educate people  they are going to be different  and today all over  we need to work for gender equality. We cannot only train women but forget about the men  because the men are the real people who are giving women the hardest time. So we started training men because the men should know the potential of women  know how much these potential men has  and how much these women can do the same job they are doing. So we are continuously giving training to men  and I really believe strongly. I live in a country that was a beautiful country. I just want to share this with you. It was a beautiful country  beautiful  peaceful country. We were going everywhere. Women were getting education  lawyer  engineer  teacher  and we were going from house to house. We never locked our doors. But you know what happened to my country. Today  people cannot walk out of their door without security issues. But we want the same Afghanistan we had before. And I want to tell you the other side. Today  the women of Afghanistan are working very  very hard. They are earning degrees. They are training to be lawyers. They are training to be doctors  back again. They are training to be teachers  and they are running businesses. So it is so wonderful to see people like that reach their complete potential  and all of this is going to happen. I want to share this with you  because of love  because of compassion  and because of trust and honesty. If you have these few things with you  you will accomplish. We have one poet  Mawl n  R m . He said that by having compassion and having love  you can conquer the world. And I tell you  we could. And if we could do it in Afghanistan  I am sure     percent that everyone can do it in any part of the world. Thank you very  very much. Thank you. Thank you. For the last year  everyone's been watching the same show  and I'm not talking about  Game of Thrones   but a horrifying  real life drama that's proved too fascinating to turn off. It's a show produced by murderers and shared around the world via the Internet. Their names have become familiar  James Foley  Steven Sotloff  David Haines  Alan Henning  Peter Kassig  Haruna Yukawa  Kenji Goto Jogo. Their beheadings by the Islamic State were barbaric  but if we think they were archaic  from a remote  obscure age  then we're wrong. They were uniquely modern  because the murderers acted knowing well that millions of people would tune in to watch. The headlines called them savages and barbarians  because the image of one man overpowering another  killing him with a knife to the throat  conforms to our idea of ancient  primitive practices  the polar opposite of our urban  civilized ways. We don't do things like that. But that's the irony. We think a beheading has nothing to do with us  even as we click on the screen to watch. But it is to do with us. The Islamic State beheadings are not ancient or remote. They're a global    st century event  a   st century event that takes place in our living rooms  at our desks  on our computer screens. They're entirely dependent on the power of technology to connect us. And whether we like it or not  everyone who watches is a part of the show. And lots of people watch. We don't know exactly how many. Obviously  it's difficult to calculate. But a poll taken in the UK  for example  in August       estimated that  .  million people had watched the beheading of James Foley in the few days after it was released. And that's just the first few days  and just Britain. A similar poll taken in the United States in November      found that nine percent of those surveyed had watched beheading videos  and a further    percent had watched the videos but had stopped just before the death was shown. Nine percent may be a small minority of all the people who could watch  but it's still a very large crowd. And of course that crowd is growing all the time  because every week  every month  more people will keep downloading and keep watching. If we go back    years  before sites like YouTube and Facebook were born  it was a similar story. When innocent civilians like Daniel Pearl  Nick Berg  Paul Johnson  were beheaded  those videos were shown during the Iraq War. Nick Berg's beheading quickly became one of the most searched for items on the Internet. Within a day  it was the top search term across search engines like Google  Lycos  Yahoo. In the week after Nick Berg's beheading  these were the top    search terms in the United States. The Berg beheading video remained the most popular search term for a week  and it was the second most popular search term for the whole month of May  runner up only to  American Idol.  The al Qaeda linked website that first showed Nick Berg's beheading had to close down within a couple of days due to overwhelming traffic to the site. One Dutch website owner said that his daily viewing figures rose from         to         every time a beheading in Iraq was shown. He told reporters    months later that it had been downloaded many millions of times  and that's just one website. A similar pattern was seen again and again when videos of beheadings were released during the Iraq War. Social media sites have made these images more accessible than ever before  but if we take another step back in history  we'll see that it was the camera that first created a new kind of crowd in our history of beheadings as public spectacle. As soon as the camera appeared on the scene  a full lifetime ago on June           it had an immediate and unequivocal effect. That day  the first film of a public beheading was created in France. It was the execution  the guillotining  of a German serial killer  Eugen Weidmann  outside the prison Saint Pierre in Versailles. Weidmann was due to be executed at the crack of dawn  as was customary at the time  but his executioner was new to the job  and he'd underestimated how long it would take him to prepare. So Weidmann was executed at      in the morning  by which time on a June morning  there was enough light to take photographs  and a spectator in the crowd filmed the event  unbeknownst to the authorities. Several still photographs were taken as well  and you can still watch the film online today and look at the photographs. The crowd on the day of Weidmann's execution was called  unruly  and  disgusting  by the press  but that was nothing compared to the untold thousands of people who could now study the action over and over again  freeze framed in every detail. The camera may have made these scenes more accessible than ever before  but it's not just about the camera. If we take a bigger leap back in history  we'll see that for as long as there have been public judicial executions and beheadings  there have been the crowds to see them. In London  as late as the early   th century  there might be four or five thousand people to see a standard hanging. There could be        or        to see a famous criminal killed. And a beheading  which was a rare event in England at the time  attracted even more. In May       five men known as the Cato Street Conspirators were executed in London for plotting to assassinate members of the British government. They were hung and then decapitated. It was a gruesome scene. Each man's head was hacked off in turn and held up to the crowd. And         people  that's        more than can fit into Wembley Stadium  had turned out to watch. The streets were packed. People had rented out windows and rooftops. People had climbed onto carts and wagons in the street. People climbed lamp posts. People had been known to have died in the crush on popular execution days. Evidence suggests that throughout our history of public beheadings and public executions  the vast majority of the people who come to see are either enthusiastic or  at best  unmoved. Disgust has been comparatively rare  and even when people are disgusted and are horrified  it doesn't always stop them from coming out all the same to watch. Perhaps the most striking example of the human ability to watch a beheading and remain unmoved and even be disappointed was the introduction in France in      of the guillotine  that famous decapitation machine. To us in the   st century  the guillotine may seem like a monstrous contraption  but to the first crowds who saw it  it was actually a disappointment. They were used to seeing long  drawn out  torturous executions on the scaffold  where people were mutilated and burned and pulled apart slowly. To them  watching the guillotine in action  it was so quick  there was nothing to see. The blade fell  the head fell into a basket  out of sight immediately  and they called out   Give me back my gallows  give me back my wooden gallows.  The end of torturous public judicial executions in Europe and America was partly to do with being more humane towards the criminal  but it was also partly because the crowd obstinately refused to behave in the way that they should. All too often  execution day was more like a carnival than a solemn ceremony. Today  a public judicial execution in Europe or America is unthinkable  but there are other scenarios that should make us cautious about thinking that things are different now and we don't behave like that anymore. Take  for example  the incidents of suicide baiting. This is when a crowd gathers to watch a person who has climbed to the top of a public building in order to kill themselves  and people in the crowd shout and jeer   Get on with it  Go on and jump   This is a well recognized phenomenon. One paper in      found that in    out of    threatened suicide attempts  there was incidents of suicide baiting and jeering from a crowd. And there have been incidents reported in the press this year. This was a very widely reported incident in Telford and Shropshire in March this year. And when it happens today  people take photographs and they take videos on their phones and they post those videos online. When it comes to brutal murderers who post their beheading videos  the Internet has created a new kind of crowd. Today  the action takes place in a distant time and place  which gives the viewer a sense of detachment from what's happening  a sense of separation. It's nothing to do with me. It's already happened. We are also offered an unprecedented sense of intimacy. Today  we are all offered front row seats. We can all watch in private  in our own time and space  and no one need ever know that we've clicked on the screen to watch. This sense of separation    from other people  from the event itself    seems to be key to understanding our ability to watch  and there are several ways in which the Internet creates a sense of detachment that seems to erode individual moral responsibility. Our activities online are often contrasted with real life  as though the things we do online are somehow less real. We feel less accountable for our actions when we interact online. There's a sense of anonymity  a sense of invisibility  so we feel less accountable for our behavior. The Internet also makes it far easier to stumble upon things inadvertently  things that we would usually avoid in everyday life. Today  a video can start playing before you even know what you're watching. Or you may be tempted to look at material that you wouldn't look at in everyday life or you wouldn't look at if you were with other people at the time. And when the action is pre recorded and takes place in a distant time and space  watching seems like a passive activity. There's nothing I can do about it now. It's already happened. All these things make it easier as an Internet user for us to give in to our sense of curiosity about death  to push our personal boundaries  to test our sense of shock  to explore our sense of shock. But we're not passive when we watch. On the contrary  we're fulfilling the murderer's desire to be seen. When the victim of a decapitation is bound and defenseless  he or she essentially becomes a pawn in their killer's show. Unlike a trophy head that's taken in battle  that represents the luck and skill it takes to win a fight  when a beheading is staged  when it's essentially a piece of theater  the power comes from the reception the killer receives as he performs. In other words  watching is very much part of the event. The event no longer takes place in a single location at a certain point in time as it used to and as it may still appear to. Now the event is stretched out in time and place  and everyone who watches plays their part. We should stop watching  but we know we won't. History tells us we won't  and the killers know it too. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Thank you. Let me get this back. Thank you. Let's move here. While they install for the next performance  I want to ask you the question that probably many here have  which is how did you get interested in this topic  Frances Larson  I used to work at a museum called the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford  which was famous for its display of shrunken heads from South America. People used to say   Oh  the shrunken head museum  the shrunken head museum   And at the time  I was working on the history of scientific collections of skulls. I was working on the cranial collections  and it just struck me as ironic that here were people coming to see this gory  primitive  savage culture that they were almost fantasizing about and creating without really understanding what they were seeing  and all the while these vast    I mean hundreds of thousands of skulls in our museums  all across Europe and the States    were kind of upholding this Enlightenment pursuit of scientific rationality. So I wanted to kind of twist it round and say   Let's look at us.  We're looking through the glass case at these shrunken heads. Let's look at our own history and our own cultural fascination with these things. BG  Thank you for sharing that. FL  Thank you. A question I'm often asked is  where did I get my passion for human rights and justice  It started early. I grew up in the west of Ireland  wedged between four brothers  two older than me and two younger than me. So of course I had to be interested in human rights  and equality and justice  and using my elbows  And those issues stayed with me and guided me  and in particular  when I was elected the first woman President of Ireland  from      to     . I dedicated my presidency to having a space for those who felt marginalized on the island of Ireland  and bringing together communities from Northern Ireland with those from the Republic  trying to build peace. And I went as the first Irish president to the United Kingdom and met with Queen Elizabeth II  and also welcomed to my official residence    which we call   ras an Uachtar in   the house of the president    members of the royal family  including  notably  the Prince of Wales. And I was aware that at the time of my presidency  Ireland was a country beginning a rapid economic progress. We were a country that was benefiting from the solidarity of the European Union. Indeed  when Ireland first joined the European Union in       there were parts of the country that were considered developing  including my own beloved native county  County Mayo. I led trade delegations here to the United States  to Japan  to India  to encourage investment  to help to create jobs  to build up our economy  to build up our health system  our education    our development. What I didn't have to do as president was buy land on mainland Europe  so that Irish citizens could go there because our island was going underwater. What I didn't have to think about  either as president or as a constitutional lawyer  was the implications for the sovereignty of the territory because of the impact of climate change. But that is what President Tong  of the Republic of Kiribati  has to wake up every morning thinking about. He has bought land in Fiji as an insurance policy  what he calls   migration with dignity   because he knows that his people may have to leave their islands. As I listened to President Tong describing the situation  I really felt that this was a problem that no leader should have to face. And as I heard him speak about the pain of his problems  I thought about Eleanor Roosevelt. I thought about her and those who worked with her on the Commission on Human Rights  which she chaired in       and drew up the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. For them  it would have been unimaginable that a whole country could go out of existence because of human induced climate change. I came to climate change not as a scientist or an environmental lawyer  and I wasn't really impressed by the images of polar bears or melting glaciers. It was because of the impact on people  and the impact on their rights    their rights to food and safe water  health  education and shelter. And I say this with humility  because I came late to the issue of climate change. When I served as UN High Commissioner for Human Rights from      to       climate change wasn't at the front of my mind. I don't remember making a single speech on climate change. I knew that there was another part of the United Nations    the UN Convention on Climate Change    that was dealing with the issue of climate change. It was later when I started to work in African countries on issues of development and human rights. And I kept hearing this pervasive sentence   Oh  but things are so much worse now  things are so much worse.  And then I explored what was behind that  it was about changes in the climate    climate shocks  changes in the weather. I met Constance Okollet  who had formed a women's group in Eastern Uganda  and she told me that when she was growing up  she had a very normal life in her village and they didn't go hungry  they knew that the seasons would come as they were predicted to come  they knew when to sow and they knew when to harvest  and so they had enough food. But  in recent years  at the time of this conversation  they had nothing but long periods of drought  and then flash flooding  and then more drought. The school had been destroyed  livelihoods had been destroyed  their harvest had been destroyed. She forms this women's group to try to keep her community together. And this was a reality that really struck me  because of course  Constance Okollet wasn't responsible for the greenhouse gas emissions that were causing this problem. Indeed  I was very struck about the situation in Malawi in January of this year. There was an unprecedented flooding in the country  it covered about a third of the country  over     people were killed  and hundreds of thousands lost their livelihoods. And the average person in Malawi emits about    kg of CO  a year. The average US citizen emits about   .  metric tons. So those who are suffering disproportionately don't drive cars  don't have electricity  don't consume very significantly  and yet they are feeling more and more the impacts of the changes in the climate  the changes that are preventing them from knowing how to grow food properly  and knowing how to look after their future. I think it was really the importance of the injustice that really struck me very forcibly. And I know that we're not able to address some of that injustice because we're not on course for a safe world. Governments around the world agreed at the conference in Copenhagen  and have repeated it at every conference on climate  that we have to stay below two degrees Celsius of warming above pre Industrial standards. But we're on course for about four degrees. So we face an existential threat to the future of our planet. And that made me realize that climate change is the greatest threat to human rights in the   st century. And that brought me then to climate justice. Climate justice responds to the moral argument    both sides of the moral argument    to address climate change. First of all  to be on the side of those who are suffering most and are most effected. And secondly  to make sure that they're not left behind again  when we start to move and start to address climate change with climate action  as we are doing. In our very unequal world today  it's very striking how many people are left behind. In our world of  .  billion people  about   billion are left behind.  .  billion don't have access to electricity  and they light their homes with kerosene and candles  both of which are dangerous. And in fact they spend a lot of their tiny income on that form of lighting.  .  billion people cook on open fires    on coal  wood and animal dung. And this causes about   million deaths a year from indoor smoke inhalation  and of course  most of those who die are women. So we have a very unequal world  and we need to change from  business as usual.  And we shouldn't underestimate the scale and the transformative nature of the change which will be needed  because we have to go to zero carbon emissions by about       if we're going to stay below two degrees Celsius of warming. And that means we have to leave about two thirds of the known resources of fossil fuels in the ground. It's a very big change  and it means that obviously  industrialized countries must cut their emissions  must become much more energy efficient  and must move as quickly as possible to renewable energy. For developing countries and emerging economies  the problem and the challenge is to grow without emissions  because they must develop  they have very poor populations. So they must develop without emissions  and that is a different kind of problem. Indeed  no country in the world has actually grown without emissions. All the countries have developed with fossil fuels  and then may be moving to renewable energy. So it is a very big challenge  and it requires the total support of the international community  with the necessary finance and technology  and systems and support  because no country can make itself safe from the dangers of climate change. This is an issue that requires complete human solidarity. Human solidarity  if you like  based on self interest    because we are all in this together  and we have to work together to ensure that we reach zero carbon by     . The good news is that change is happening  and it's happening very fast. Here in California  there's a very ambitious emissions target to cut emissions. In Hawaii  they're passing legislation to have     percent renewable energy by     . And governments are very ambitious around the world. In Costa Rica  they have committed to being carbon neutral by     . In Ethiopia  the commitment is to be carbon neutral by     . Apple have pledged that their factories in China will use renewable energy. And there is a race on at the moment to convert electricity from tidal and wave power  in order that we can leave the coal in the ground. And that change is both welcome and is happening very rapidly. But it's still not enough  and the political will is still not enough. Let me come back to President Tong and his people in Kiribati. They actually could be able to live on their island and have a solution  but it would take a lot of political will. President Tong told me about his ambitious idea to either build up or even float the little islands where his people live. This  of course  is beyond the resources of Kiribati itself. It would require great solidarity and support from other countries  and it would require the kind of imaginative idea that we bring together when we want to have a space station in the air. But wouldn't it be wonderful to have this engineering wonder and to allow a people to remain in their sovereign territory  and be part of the community of nations  That is the kind of idea that we should be thinking about. Yes  the challenges of the transformation we need are big  but they can be solved. We are actually  as a people  very capable of coming together to solve problems. I was very conscious of this as I took part this year in commemoration of the   th anniversary of the end of the Second World War in     .      was an extraordinary year. It was a year when the world faced what must have seemed almost insoluble problems    the devastation of the world wars  particularly the Second World War  the fragile peace that had been brought about  the need for a whole economic regeneration. But the leaders of that time didn't flinch from this. They had the capacity  they had a sense of being driven by never again must the world have this kind of problem. And they had to build structures for peace and security. And what did we get  What did they achieve  The Charter of the United Nations  the Bretton Woods institutions  as they're called  The World Bank  and the International Monetary Fund. A Marshall Plan for Europe  a devastated Europe  to reconstruct it. And indeed a few years later  the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.      is a year that is similar in its importance to       with similar challenges and similar potential. There will be two big summits this year  the first one  in September in New York  is the summit for the sustainable development goals. And then the summit in Paris in December  to give us a climate agreement. The sustainable development goals are intended to help countries to live sustainably  in tune with Mother Earth  not to take out of Mother Earth and destroy ecosystems  but rather  to live in harmony with Mother Earth  by living under sustainable development. And the sustainable development goals will come into operation for all countries on January        . The climate agreement    a binding climate agreement    is needed because of the scientific evidence that we're on a trajectory for about a four degree world and we have to change course to stay below two degrees. So we need to take steps that will be monitored and reviewed  so that we can keep increasing the ambition of how we cut emissions  and how we move more rapidly to renewable energy  so that we have a safe world. The reality is that this issue is much too important to be left to politicians and to the United Nations. It's an issue for all of us  and it's an issue where we need more and more momentum. Indeed  the face of the environmentalist has changed  because of the justice dimension. It's now an issue for faith based organizations  under very good leadership from Pope Francis  and indeed  the Church of England  which is divesting from fossil fuels. It's an issue for the business community  and the good news is that the business community is changing very rapidly    except for the fossil fuel industries    Even they are beginning to slightly change their language    but only slightly. But business is not only moving rapidly to the benefits of renewable energy  but is urging politicians to give them more signals  so that they can move even more rapidly. It's an issue for the trade union movement. It's an issue for the women's movement. It's an issue for young people. I was very struck when I learned that Jibreel Khazan  one of the Greensboro Four who had taken part in the Woolworth sit ins  said quite recently that climate change is the lunch counter moment for young people. So  lunch counter moment for young people of the   st century    the sort of real human rights issue of the   st century  because he said it is the greatest challenge to humanity and justice in our world. I recall very much the Climate March last September  and that was a huge momentum  not just in New York  but all around the world. and we have to build on that. I was marching with some of The Elders family  and I saw a placard a little bit away from me  but we were wedged so closely together    because after all  there were         people out in the streets of New York    so I couldn't quite get to that placard  I would have just liked to have been able to step behind it  because it said   Angry Grannies   That's what I felt. And I have five grandchildren now  I feel very happy as an Irish grandmother to have five grandchildren  and I think about their world  and what it will be like when they will share that world with about   billion other people in     . We know that inevitably it will be a climate constrained world  because of the emissions we've already put up there  but it could be a world that is much more equal and much fairer  and much better for health  and better for jobs and better for energy security  than the world we have now  if we have switched sufficiently and early enough to renewable energy  and no one is left behind. No one is left behind. And just as we've been looking back this year    in      to       looking back    years    I would like to think that they will look back  that world will look back    years from          years to       and that they will say   Weren't they good to do what they did in       We really appreciate that they took the decisions that made a difference  and that put the world on the right pathway  and we benefit now from that pathway   that they will feel that somehow we took our responsibilities  we did what was done in      in similar terms  we didn't miss the opportunity  we lived up to our responsibilities. That's what this year is about. And somehow for me  it's captured in words of somebody that I admired very much. She was a mentor of mine  she was a friend  she died much too young  she was an extraordinary personality  a great champion of the environment  Wangari Maathai. Wangari said once   In the course of history  there comes a time when humanity is called upon to shift to a new level of consciousness  to reach a higher moral ground.  And that's what we have to do. We have to reach a new level of consciousness  a higher moral ground. And we have to do it this year in those two big summits. And that won't happen unless we have the momentum from people around the world who say   We want action now  we want to change course  we want a safe world  a safe world for future generations  a safe world for our children and our grandchildren  and we're all in this together.  Thank you. When I was only three or four  I fell in love with poetry  with the rhythms and the music of language  with the power of metaphor and of imagery  poetry being the essence of communication    the discipline  the distillation. And all these years later  the poems I'll read today are from my just finished seventh book of poetry. Well  five years ago  I was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. Though there's no cure yet  advances in treatment are really impressive. But you can imagine that I was appalled to learn that women are largely left out of research trials  despite gender specific medical findings having demonstrated that we are not actually just small men    who happen to have different reproductive systems. Gender specific medicine is good for men  too. But you bring to a crisis the person you already are  including the  yes  momentum that you've learned to invoke through passionate caring and through action  both of which require but also create energy. So as an activist  I began working with the Parkinson's Disease Foundation    that's pdf.org    to create a major initiative to put women on the Parkinson's disease map. And as a poet  I began working with this subject matter  finding it tragic  hilarious  sometimes even joyful. I do not feel diminished by Parkinson's  I feel distilled by it  and I actually very much like the woman I'm distilling into.  No Signs of Struggle  Growing small requires enormity of will  just sitting still in the doctor's waiting room watching the future shuffle in and out  watching it stoop  stare at you while you try not to look. Rare is an exchange  a smile of brief  wry recognition. You are the new kid on the block. Everyone here was you once. You are still learning that growing small requires a largeness of spirit you can't fit into yet  acceptance of irritating help from those who love you  giving way and over  but not up. You've swallowed hard the contents of the  Drink Me  bottle  and felt yourself shrink. Now  familiar furniture looms  floors tilt  and doorknobs yield only when wrestled round with both hands. It demands colossal patience  all this growing small  your diminished sleep at night  your handwriting  your voice  your height. You are more the incredible shrinking woman than the Buddhist mystic  serene  making do with less. Less is not always more. Yet in this emptying space  space glimmers  becoming visible. Here is a place behind the eyes of those accustomed by what some would call diminishment. It is a place of merciless poetry  a gift of presence previously ignored  drowned in the daily clutter. Here every gesture needs intention  is alive with consciousness. Nothing is automatic. You can spot it in the provocation of a button  an arm poking at a sleeve  a balancing act at a night time curb while negotiating the dark. Feats of such modest valor  who would suspect them to be exercises in an intimate  fierce discipline  a metaphysics of being relentlessly aware  Such understated power here  in these tottering dancers who exert stupendous effort on tasks most view as insignificant. Such quiet beauty here  in these  my soft voiced  stiff limbed people  such resolve masked by each placid face. There is immensity required in growing small  so bent on such unbending grace. Thank you. This one is called  On Donating My Brain to Science.  Not a problem. Skip over all the pages reassuring religious people. Already a universal donor  kidneys  corneas  liver  lungs  tissue  heart  veins  whatever. Odd that the modest brain never imagined its unique value in research  maybe saving someone else from what it is they're not quite sure I have. Flattering  that. So fill in the forms  drill through the answers  trill out a blithe spirit. And slice me  dice me  spread me on your slides. Find what I'm trying to tell you. Earn me  learn me  scan me  squint through your lens. Uncover what I'd hint at if I could. Be my guest  do your best  harvest me  track the clues. This was a good brain while alive. This was a brain that paid its dues. So slice me  dice me  smear me on your slides  stain me  explain me  drain me like a cup. Share me  hear me  I want to be used I want to be used I want to be used up. And this one's called  The Ghost Light.  Lit from within is the sole secure way to traverse dark matter. Some life forms    certain mushrooms  snails  jellyfish  worms    glow bioluminescent  and people as well  we emit infra red light from our most lucent selves. Our tragedy is we can't see it. We see by reflecting. We need biofluorescence to show our true colors. External illumination can distort  though. When gravity bends light  huge galaxy clusters can act as telescopes  elongating background images of star systems to faint arcs    a lensing effect like viewing distant street lamps through a glass of wine. A glass of wine or two now makes me weave as if acting the drunkard's part  as if  besotted with unrequited love for the dynamic Turner canvasses spied out by the Hubble  I could lurch down a city street set without provoking every pedestrian walk on stare. Stare as long as you need to. If you think about it  walking  even standing  is illogical    such tiny things  feet     especially when one's body is not al dente anymore. Besides  creature of extremes and excess  I've always thought Apollo beautiful but boring  and a bit of a dumb blonde. Dionysians don't do balance. Balance  in other words  has never been my strong point. But I digress. More and more these days  digression seems the most direct route through from where I've lost or found myself out of place  mind  turn  time. Place your foot just so  mind how you turn  too swift a swivel can bring you down. Take your time ushering the audience out  saying goodbye to the actors. The ghost light is what they call the single bulb hanging above the bare stage in an empty theater. In the empty theater of such a night  waking to meet no external radiance  this is the final struggle left to win  this the sole beacon to beckon the darkness in and let the rest begin  this the lens through which at last to see both Self and Other arrayed with the bright stain of original sin  lit from within. And this is the last one.  This Dark Hour  Late summer    A.M. The rain slows to a stop  dripping still from the broad leaves of blue hostas unseen in the garden's dark. Barefoot  careful on the slick slate slabs  I need no light  I know the way  stoop by the mint bed  scoop a fistful of moist earth  then grope for a chair  spread a shawl  and sit  breathing in the wet green August air. This is the small  still hour before the newspaper lands in the vestibule like a grenade  the phone shrills  the computer screen blinks and glares awake. There is this hour  poem in my head  soil in my hand  unnamable fullness. This hour  when blood of my blood bone of bone  child grown to manhood now    stranger  intimate  not distant but apart    lies safe  off dreaming melodies while love sleeps  safe  in his arms. To have come to this place  lived to this moment  immeasurable lightness. The density of black starts to blur umber. Tentative  a cardinal's coloratura  then the mourning dove's elegy. Sable glimmers toward grey  objects emerge  trailing shadows  night ages toward day. The city stirs. There will be other dawns  nights  gaudy noons. Likely  I'll lose my way. There will be stumbling  falling  cursing the dark. Whatever comes  there was this hour when nothing mattered  all was unbearably dear. And when I'm done with daylights  should those who loved me grieve too long a while  let them remember that I had this hour    this dark  perfect hour    and smile. Thank you. In the year       a woman called Auguste was taken to a medical asylum in Frankfurt. Auguste was delusional and couldn't remember even the most basic details of her life. Her doctor was called Alois. Alois didn't know how to help Auguste  but he watched over her until  sadly  she passed away in     . After she died  Alois performed an autopsy and found strange plaques and tangles in Auguste's brain    the likes of which he'd never seen before. Now here's the even more striking thing. If Auguste had instead been alive today  we could offer her no more help than Alois was able to     years ago. Alois was Dr. Alois Alzheimer. And Auguste Deter was the first patient to be diagnosed with what we now call Alzheimer's disease. Since       medicine has advanced greatly. We've discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from infections  many treatments for cancer  antiretrovirals for HIV  statins for heart disease and much more. But we've made essentially no progress at all in treating Alzheimer's disease. I'm part of a team of scientists who has been working to find a cure for Alzheimer's for over a decade. So I think about this all the time. Alzheimer's now affects    million people worldwide. But by       it will affect     million people    which  by the way  will include many of you. If you're hoping to live to be    or older  your chance of getting Alzheimer's will be almost one in two. In other words  odds are you'll spend your golden years either suffering from Alzheimer's or helping to look after a friend or loved one with Alzheimer's. Already in the United States alone  Alzheimer's care costs     billion dollars every year. One out of every five Medicare dollars get spent on Alzheimer's. It is today the most expensive disease  and costs are projected to increase fivefold by       as the baby boomer generation ages. It may surprise you that  put simply  Alzheimer's is one of the biggest medical and social challenges of our generation. But we've done relatively little to address it. Today  of the top    causes of death worldwide  Alzheimer's is the only one we cannot prevent  cure or even slow down. We understand less about the science of Alzheimer's than other diseases because we've invested less time and money into researching it. The US government spends    times more every year on cancer research than on Alzheimer's despite the fact that Alzheimer's costs us more and causes a similar number of deaths each year as cancer. The lack of resources stems from a more fundamental cause  a lack of awareness. Because here's what few people know but everyone should  Alzheimer's is a disease  and we can cure it. For most of the past     years  everyone  including scientists  mistakenly confused Alzheimer's with aging. We thought that becoming senile was a normal and inevitable part of getting old. But we only have to look at a picture of a healthy aged brain compared to the brain of an Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease. As well as triggering severe loss of memory and mental abilities  the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's significantly reduces life expectancy and is always fatal. Remember Dr. Alzheimer found strange plaques and tangles in Auguste's brain a century ago. For almost a century  we didn't know much about these. Today we know they're made from protein molecules. You can imagine a protein molecule as a piece of paper that normally folds into an elaborate piece of origami. There are spots on the paper that are sticky. And when it folds correctly  these sticky bits end up on the inside. But sometimes things go wrong  and some sticky bits are on the outside. This causes the protein molecules to stick to each other  forming clumps that eventually become large plaques and tangles. That's what we see in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. We've spent the past    years at the University of Cambridge trying to understand how this malfunction works. There are many steps  and identifying which step to try to block is complex    like defusing a bomb. Cutting one wire might do nothing. Cutting others might make the bomb explore. We have to find the right step to block  and then create a drug that does it. Until recently  we for the most part have been cutting wires and hoping for the best. But now we've got together a diverse group of people    medics  biologists  geneticists  chemists  physicists  engineers and mathematicians. And together  we've managed to identify a critical step in the process and are now testing a new class of drugs which would specifically block this step and stop the disease. Now let me show you some of our latest results. No one outside of our lab has seen these yet. Let's look at some videos of what happened when we tested these new drugs in worms. So these are healthy worms  and you can see they're moving around normally. These worms  on the other hand  have protein molecules sticking together inside them    like humans with Alzheimer's. And you can see they're clearly sick. But if we give our new drugs to these worms at an early stage  then we see that they're healthy  and they live a normal lifespan. This is just an initial positive result  but research like this shows us that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and we can cure. After     years of waiting  there's finally real hope for what can be achieved in the next    or    years. But to grow that hope  to finally beat Alzheimer's  we need help. This isn't about scientists like me    it's about you. We need you to raise awareness that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we try  we can beat it. In the case of other diseases  patients and their families have led the charge for more research and put pressure on governments  the pharmaceutical industry  scientists and regulators. That was essential for advancing treatment for HIV in the late     s. Today  we see that same drive to beat cancer. But Alzheimer's patients are often unable to speak up for themselves. And their families  the hidden victims  caring for their loved ones night and day  are often too worn out to go out and advocate for change. So  it really is down to you. Alzheimer's isn't  for the most part  a genetic disease. Everyone with a brain is at risk. Today  there are    million patients like Auguste  who can't create the change they need for themselves. Help speak up for them  and help demand a cure. Thank you. Last year  I went on my first book tour. In    months  I flew to    countries and gave some hundred talks. Every talk in every country began with an introduction  and every introduction began  alas  with a lie   Taiye Selasi comes from Ghana and Nigeria   or  Taiye Selasi comes from England and the States.  Whenever I heard this opening sentence  no matter the country that concluded it    England  America  Ghana  Nigeria    I thought   But that's not true.  Yes  I was born in England and grew up in the United States. My mum  born in England  and raised in Nigeria  currently lives in Ghana. My father was born in Gold Coast  a British colony  raised in Ghana  and has lived for over    years in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. For this reason  my introducers also called me  multinational.   But Nike is multinational   I thought   I'm a human being.  Then  one fine day  mid tour  I went to Louisiana  a museum in Denmark where I shared the stage with the writer Colum McCann. We were discussing the role of locality in writing  when suddenly it hit me. I'm not multinational. I'm not a national at all. How could I come from a nation  How can a human being come from a concept  It's a question that had been bothering me for going on two decades. From newspapers  textbooks  conversations  I had learned to speak of countries as if they were eternal  singular  naturally occurring things  but I wondered  to say that I came from a country suggested that the country was an absolute  some fixed point in place in time  a constant thing  but was it  In my lifetime  countries had disappeared    Czechoslovakia  appeared    Timor Leste  failed    Somalia. My parents came from countries that didn't exist when they were born. To me  a country    this thing that could be born  die  expand  contract    hardly seemed the basis for understanding a human being. And so it came as a huge relief to discover the sovereign state. What we call countries are actually various expressions of sovereign statehood  an idea that came into fashion only     years ago. When I learned this  beginning my masters degree in international relations  I felt a sort of surge of relief. It was as I had suspected. History was real  cultures were real  but countries were invented. For the next    years  I sought to re  or un define myself  my world  my work  my experience  beyond the logic of the state. In       I wrote an essay   What is an Afropolitan   sketching out an identity that privileged culture over country. It was thrilling how many people could relate to my experience  and instructional how many others didn't buy my sense of self.  How can Selasi claim to come from Ghana   one such critic asked   when she's never known the indignities of traveling abroad on a Ghanian passport   Now  if I'm honest  I knew just what she meant. I've got a friend named Layla who was born and raised in Ghana. Her parents are third generation Ghanians of Lebanese descent. Layla  who speaks fluent Twi  knows Accra like the back of her hand  but when we first met years ago  I thought   She's not from Ghana.  In my mind  she came from Lebanon  despite the patent fact that all her formative experience took place in suburban Accra. I  like my critics  was imagining some Ghana where all Ghanaians had brown skin or none held U.K. passports. I'd fallen into the limiting trap that the language of coming from countries sets    the privileging of a fiction  the singular country  over reality  human experience. Speaking with Colum McCann that day  the penny finally dropped.  All experience is local   he said.  All identity is experience   I thought.  I'm not a national   I proclaimed onstage.  I'm a local. I'm multi local.  See   Taiye Selasi comes from the United States   isn't the truth. I have no relationship with the United States  all    of them  not really. My relationship is with Brookline  the town where I grew up  with New York City  where I started work  with Lawrenceville  where I spend Thanksgiving. What makes America home for me is not my passport or accent  but these very particular experiences and the places they occur. Despite my pride in Ewe culture  the Black Stars  and my love of Ghanaian food  I've never had a relationship with the Republic of Ghana  writ large. My relationship is with Accra  where my mother lives  where I go each year  with the little garden in Dzorwulu where my father and I talk for hours. These are the places that shape my experience. My experience is where I'm from. What if we asked  instead of  Where are you from       Where are you a local   This would tell us so much more about who and how similar we are. Tell me you're from France  and I see what  a set of clich s  Adichie's dangerous single story  the myth of the nation of France  Tell me you're a local of Fez and Paris  better yet  Goutte d'Or  and I see a set of experiences. Our experience is where we're from. So  where are you a local  I propose a three step test. I call these the three  R s   rituals  relationships  restrictions. First  think of your daily rituals  whatever they may be  making your coffee  driving to work  harvesting your crops  saying your prayers. What kind of rituals are these  Where do they occur  In what city or cities in the world do shopkeepers know your face  As a child  I carried out fairly standard suburban rituals in Boston  with adjustments made for the rituals my mother brought from London and Lagos. We took off our shoes in the house  we were unfailingly polite with our elders  we ate slow cooked  spicy food. In snowy North America  ours were rituals of the global South. The first time I went to Delhi or to southern parts of Italy  I was shocked by how at home I felt. The rituals were familiar.  R  number one  rituals. Now  think of your relationships  of the people who shape your days. To whom do you speak at least once a week  be it face to face or on FaceTime  Be reasonable in your assessment  I'm not talking about your Facebook friends. I'm speaking of the people who shape your weekly emotional experience. My mother in Accra  my twin sister in Boston  my best friends in New York  these relationships are home for me.  R  number two  relationships. We're local where we carry out our rituals and relationships  but how we experience our locality depends in part on our restrictions. By restrictions  I mean  where are you able to live  What passport do you hold  Are you restricted by  say  racism  from feeling fully at home where you live  By civil war  dysfunctional governance  economic inflation  from living in the locality where you had your rituals as a child  This is the least sexy of the R s  less lyric than rituals and relationships  but the question takes us past  Where are you now   to  Why aren't you there  and why   Rituals  relationships  restrictions. Take a piece of paper and put those three words on top of three columns  then try to fill those columns as honestly as you can. A very different picture of your life in local context  of your identity as a set of experiences  may emerge. So let's try it. I have a friend named Olu. He's    years old. His parents  born in Nigeria  came to Germany on scholarships. Olu was born in Nuremberg and lived there until age   . When his family moved to Lagos  he studied in London  then came to Berlin. He loves going to Nigeria    the weather  the food  the friends    but hates the political corruption there. Where is Olu from  I have another friend named Udo. He's also    years old. Udo was born in C rdoba  in northwest Argentina  where his grandparents migrated from Germany  what is now Poland  after the war. Udo studied in Buenos Aires  and nine years ago came to Berlin. He loves going to Argentina     the weather  the food  the friends    but hates the economic corruption there. Where is Udo from  With his blonde hair and blue eyes  Udo could pass for German  but holds an Argentinian passport  so needs a visa to live in Berlin. That Udo is from Argentina has largely to do with history. That he's a local of Buenos Aires and Berlin  that has to do with life. Olu  who looks Nigerian  needs a visa to visit Nigeria. He speaks Yoruba with an English accent  and English with a German one. To claim that he's  not really Nigerian   though  denies his experience in Lagos  the rituals he practiced growing up  his relationship with family and friends. Meanwhile  though Lagos is undoubtedly one of his homes  Olu always feels restricted there  not least by the fact that he's gay. Both he and Udo are restricted by the political conditions of their parents' countries  from living where some of their most meaningful rituals and relationships occur. To say Olu is from Nigeria and Udo is from Argentina distracts from their common experience. Their rituals  their relationships  and their restrictions are the same. Of course  when we ask   Where are you from   we're using a kind of shorthand. It's quicker to say  Nigeria  than  Lagos and Berlin   and as with Google Maps  we can always zoom in closer  from country to city to neighborhood. But that's not quite the point. The difference between  Where are you from   and  Where are you a local   isn't the specificity of the answer  it's the intention of the question. Replacing the language of nationality with the language of locality asks us to shift our focus to where real life occurs. Even that most glorious expression of countryhood  the World Cup  gives us national teams comprised mostly of multilocal players. As a unit of measurement for human experience  the country doesn't quite work. That's why Olu says   I'm German  but my parents come from Nigeria.  The  but  in that sentence belies the inflexibility of the units  one fixed and fictional entity bumping up against another.  I'm a local of Lagos and Berlin   suggests overlapping experiences  layers that merge together  that can't be denied or removed. You can take away my passport  but you can't take away my experience. That I carry within me. Where I'm from comes wherever I go. To be clear  I'm not suggesting that we do away with countries. There's much to be said for national history  more for the sovereign state. Culture exists in community  and community exists in context. Geography  tradition  collective memory  these things are important. What I'm questioning is primacy. All of those introductions on tour began with reference to nation  as if knowing what country I came from would tell my audience who I was. What are we really seeking  though  when we ask where someone comes from  And what are we really seeing when we hear an answer  Here's one possibility  basically  countries represent power.  Where are you from   Mexico. Poland. Bangladesh. Less power. America. Germany. Japan. More power. China. Russia. Ambiguous. It's possible that without realizing it  we're playing a power game  especially in the context of multi ethnic countries. As any recent immigrant knows  the question  Where are you from   or  Where are you really from   is often code for  Why are you here   Then we have the scholar William Deresiewicz's writing of elite American colleges.  Students think that their environment is diverse if one comes from Missouri and another from Pakistan    never mind that all of their parents are doctors or bankers.  I'm with him. To call one student American  another Pakistani  then triumphantly claim student body diversity ignores the fact that these students are locals of the same milieu. The same holds true on the other end of the economic spectrum. A Mexican gardener in Los Angeles and a Nepali housekeeper in Delhi have more in common in terms of rituals and restrictions than nationality implies. Perhaps my biggest problem with coming from countries is the myth of going back to them. I'm often asked if I plan to  go back  to Ghana. I go to Accra every year  but I can't  go back  to Ghana. It's not because I wasn't born there. My father can't go back  either. The country in which he was born  that country no longer exists. We can never go back to a place and find it exactly where we left it. Something  somewhere will always have changed  most of all  ourselves. People. Finally  what we're talking about is human experience  this notoriously and gloriously disorderly affair. In creative writing  locality bespeaks humanity. The more we know about where a story is set  the more local color and texture  the more human the characters start to feel  the more relatable  not less. The myth of national identity and the vocabulary of coming from confuses us into placing ourselves into mutually exclusive categories. In fact  all of us are multi    multi local  multi layered. To begin our conversations with an acknowledgement of this complexity brings us closer together  I think  not further apart. So the next time that I'm introduced  I'd love to hear the truth   Taiye Selasi is a human being  like everybody here. She isn't a citizen of the world  but a citizen of worlds. She is a local of New York  Rome and Accra.  Thank you. So I've had the great privilege of traveling to some incredible places  photographing these distant landscapes and remote cultures all over the world. I love my job. But people think it's this string of epiphanies and sunrises and rainbows  when in reality  it looks more something like this. This is my office. We can't afford the fanciest places to stay at night  so we tend to sleep a lot outdoors. As long as we can stay dry  that's a bonus. We also can't afford the fanciest restaurants. So we tend to eat whatever's on the local menu. And if you're in the Ecuadorian P ramo  you're going to eat a large rodent called a cuy. But what makes our experiences perhaps a little bit different and a little more unique than that of the average person is that we have this gnawing thing in the back of our mind that even in our darkest moments  and those times of despair  we think   Hey  there might be an image to be made here  there might be a story to be told.  And why is storytelling important  Well  it helps us to connect with our cultural and our natural heritage. And in the Southeast  there's an alarming disconnect between the public and the natural areas that allow us to be here in the first place. We're visual creatures  so we use what we see to teach us what we know. Now the majority of us aren't going to willingly go way down to a swamp. So how can we still expect those same people to then advocate on behalf of their protection  We can't. So my job  then  is to use photography as a communication tool  to help bridge the gap between the science and the aesthetics  to get people talking  to get them thinking  and to hopefully  ultimately  get them caring. I started doing this    years ago right here in Gainesville  right here in my backyard. And I fell in love with adventure and discovery  going to explore all these different places that were just minutes from my front doorstep. There are a lot of beautiful places to find. Despite all these years that have passed  I still see the world through the eyes of a child and I try to incorporate that sense of wonderment and that sense of curiosity into my photography as often as I can. And we're pretty lucky because here in the South  we're still blessed with a relatively blank canvas that we can fill with the most fanciful adventures and incredible experiences. It's just a matter of how far our imagination will take us. See  a lot of people look at this and they say   Oh yeah  wow  that's a pretty tree.  But I don't just see a tree    I look at this and I see opportunity. I see an entire weekend. Because when I was a kid  these were the types of images that got me off the sofa and dared me to explore  dared me to go find the woods and put my head underwater and see what we have. And folks  I've been photographing all over the world and I promise you  what we have here in the South  what we have in the Sunshine State  rivals anything else that I've seen. But yet our tourism industry is busy promoting all the wrong things. Before most kids are     they'll have been to Disney World more times than they've been in a canoe or camping under a starry sky. And I have nothing against Disney or Mickey  I used to go there  too. But they're missing out on those fundamental connections that create a real sense of pride and ownership for the place that they call home. And this is compounded by the issue that the landscapes that define our natural heritage and fuel our aquifer for our drinking water have been deemed as scary and dangerous and spooky. When our ancestors first came here  they warned   Stay out of these areas  they're haunted. They're full of evil spirits and ghosts.  I don't know where they came up with that idea. But it's actually led to a very real disconnect  a very real negative mentality that has kept the public disinterested  silent  and ultimately  our environment at risk. We're a state that's surrounded and defined by water  and yet for centuries  swamps and wetlands have been regarded as these obstacles to overcome. And so we've treated them as these second class ecosystems  because they have very little monetary value and of course  they're known to harbor alligators and snakes    which  I'll admit  these aren't the most cuddly of ambassadors. So it became assumed  then  that the only good swamp was a drained swamp. And in fact  draining a swamp to make way for agriculture and development was considered the very essence of conservation not too long ago. But now we're backpedaling  because the more we come to learn about these sodden landscapes  the more secrets we're starting to unlock about interspecies relationships and the connectivity of habitats  watersheds and flyways. Take this bird  for example  this is the prothonotary warbler. I love this bird because it's a swamp bird  through and through  a swamp bird. They nest and they mate and they breed in these old growth swamps in these flooded forests. And so after the spring  after they raise their young  they then fly thousand of miles over the Gulf of Mexico into Central and South America. And then after the winter  the spring rolls around and they come back. They fly thousands of miles over the Gulf of Mexico. And where do they go  Where do they land  Right back in the same tree. That's nuts. This is a bird the size of a tennis ball    I mean  that's crazy  I used a GPS to get here today  and this is my hometown. It's crazy. So what happens  then  when this bird flies over the Gulf of Mexico into Central America for the winter and then the spring rolls around and it flies back  and it comes back to this  a freshly sodded golf course  This is a narrative that's all too commonly unraveling here in this state. And this is a natural process that's occurred for thousands of years and we're just now learning about it. So you can imagine all else we have to learn about these landscapes if we just preserve them first. Now despite all this rich life that abounds in these swamps  they still have a bad name. Many people feel uncomfortable with the idea of wading into Florida's blackwater. I can understand that. But what I loved about growing up in the Sunshine State is that for so many of us  we live with this latent but very palpable fear that when we put our toes into the water  there might be something much more ancient and much more adapted than we are. Knowing that you're not top dog is a welcomed discomfort  I think. How often in this modern and urban and digital age do you actually get the chance to feel vulnerable  or consider that the world may not have been made for just us  So for the last decade  I began seeking out these areas where the concrete yields to forest and the pines turn to cypress  and I viewed all these mosquitoes and reptiles  all these discomforts  as affirmations that I'd found true wilderness  and I embrace them wholly. Now as a conservation photographer obsessed with blackwater  it's only fitting that I'd eventually end up in the most famous swamp of all  the Everglades. Growing up here in North Central Florida  it always had these enchanted names  places like Loxahatchee and Fakahatchee  Corkscrew  Big Cypress. I started what turned into a five year project to hopefully reintroduce the Everglades in a new light  in a more inspired light. But I knew this would be a tall order  because here you have an area that's roughly a third the size the state of Florida  it's huge. And when I say Everglades  most people are like   Oh  yeah  the national park.  But the Everglades is not just a park  it's an entire watershed  starting with the Kissimmee chain of lakes in the north  and then as the rains would fall in the summer  these downpours would flow into Lake Okeechobee  and Lake Okeechobee would fill up and it would overflow its banks and spill southward  ever slowly  with the topography  and get into the river of grass  the Sawgrass Prairies  before meting into the cypress slews  until going further south into the mangrove swamps  and then finally    finally    reaching Florida Bay  the emerald gem of the Everglades  the great estuary  the     square mile estuary. So sure  the national park is the southern end of this system  but all the things that make it unique are these inputs that come in  the fresh water that starts     miles north. So no manner of these political or invisible boundaries protect the park from polluted water or insufficient water. And unfortunately  that's precisely what we've done. Over the last    years  we have drained  we have dammed  we have dredged the Everglades to where now only one third of the water that used to reach the bay now reaches the bay today. So this story is not all sunshine and rainbows  unfortunately. For better or for worse  the story of the Everglades is intrinsically tied to the peaks and the valleys of mankind's relationship with the natural world. But I'll show you these beautiful pictures  because it gets you on board. And while I have your attention  I can tell you the real story. It's that we're taking this  and we're trading it for this  at an alarming rate. And what's lost on so many people is the sheer scale of which we're discussing. Because the Everglades is not just responsible for the drinking water for   million Floridians  today it also provides the agricultural fields for the year round tomatoes and oranges for over     million Americans. And it's that same seasonal pulse of water in the summer that built the river of grass       years ago. Ironically  today  it's also responsible for the over half a million acres of the endless river of sugarcane. These are the same fields that are responsible for dumping exceedingly high levels of fertilizers into the watershed  forever changing the system. But in order for you to not just understand how this system works  but to also get personally connected to it  I decided to break the story down into several different narratives. And I wanted that story to start in Lake Okeechobee  the beating heart of the Everglade system. And to do that  I picked an ambassador  an iconic species. This is the Everglade snail kite. It's a great bird  and they used to nest in the thousands  thousands in the northern Everglades. And then they've gone down to about     nesting pairs today. And why is that  Well  it's because they eat one source of food  an apple snail  about the size of a ping pong ball  an aquatic gastropod. So as we started damming up the Everglades  as we started diking Lake Okeechobee and draining the wetlands  we lost the habitat for the snail. And thus  the population of the kites declined. And so  I wanted a photo that would not only communicate this relationship between wetland  snail and bird  but I also wanted a photo that would communicate how incredible this relationship was  and how very important it is that they've come to depend on each other  this healthy wetland and this bird. And to do that  I brainstormed this idea. I started sketching out these plans to make a photo  and I sent it to the wildlife biologist down in Okeechobee    this is an endangered bird  so it takes special permission to do. So I built this submerged platform that would hold snails just right under the water. And I spent months planning this crazy idea. And I took this platform down to Lake Okeechobee and I spent over a week in the water  wading waist deep    hour shifts from dawn until dusk  to get one image that I thought might communicate this. And here's the day that it finally worked   Video   Mac Stone narrating  After setting up the platform  I look off and I see a kite coming over the cattails. And I see him scanning and searching. And he gets right over the trap  and I see that he's seen it. And he beelines  he goes straight for the trap. And in that moment  all those months of planning  waiting  all the sunburn  mosquito bites    suddenly  they're all worth it. You can believe how excited I was when that happened. But what the idea was  is that for someone who's never seen this bird and has no reason to care about it  these photos  these new perspectives  will help shed a little new light on just one species that makes this watershed so incredible  so valuable  so important. Now  I know I can't come here to Gainesville and talk to you about animals in the Everglades without talking about gators. I love gators  I grew up loving gators. My parents always said I had an unhealthy relationship with gators. But what I like about them is  they're like the freshwater equivalent of sharks. They're feared  they're hated  and they are tragically misunderstood. Because these are a unique species  they're not just apex predators. In the Everglades  they are the very architects of the Everglades  because as the water drops down in the winter during the dry season  they start excavating these holes called gator holes. And they do this because as the water drops down  they'll be able to stay wet and they'll be able to forage. And now this isn't just affecting them  other animals also depend on this relationship  so they become a keystone species as well. So how do you make an apex predator  an ancient reptile  at once look like it dominates the system  but at the same time  look vulnerable  Well  you wade into a pit of about     of them  then you hope that you've made the right decision. I still have all my fingers  it's cool. But I understand  I know I'm not going to rally you guys  I'm not going to rally the troops to  Save the Everglades for the gators   It won't happen because they're so ubiquitous  we see them now  they're one of the great conservation success stories of the US. But there is one species in the Everglades that no matter who you are  you can't help but love  too  and that's the roseate spoonbill. These birds are great  but they've had a really tough time in the Everglades  because they started out with thousands of nesting pairs in Florida Bay  and at the turn of the   th century  they got down to two    two nesting pairs. And why  That's because women thought they looked better on their hats then they did flying in the sky. Then we banned the plume trade  and their numbers started rebounding. And as their numbers started rebounding  scientists began to pay attention  they started studying these birds. And what they found out is that these birds' behavior is intrinsically tied to the annual draw down cycle of water in the Everglades  the thing that defines the Everglades watershed. What they found out is that these birds started nesting in the winter as the water drew down  because they're tactile feeders  so they have to touch whatever they eat. And so they wait for these concentrated pools of fish to be able to feed enough to feed their young. So these birds became the very icon of the Everglades    an indicator species of the overall health of the system. And just as their numbers were rebounding in the mid   th century    shooting up to                             just as that started happening  we started draining the southern Everglades. And we stopped two thirds of that water from moving south. And it had drastic consequences. And just as those numbers started reaching their peak  unfortunately  today  the real spoonbill story  the real photo of what it looks like is more something like this. And we're down to less than    nesting pairs in Florida Bay today  because we've disrupted the system so much. So all these different organizations are shouting  they're screaming   The Everglades is fragile  It's fragile   It is not. It is resilient. Because despite all we've taken  despite all we've done and we've drained and we've dammed and we've dredged it  pieces of it are still here  waiting to be put back together. And this is what I've loved about South Florida  that in one place  you have this unstoppable force of mankind meeting the immovable object of tropical nature. And it's at this new frontier that we are forced with a new appraisal. What is wilderness worth  What is the value of biodiversity  or our drinking water  And fortunately  after decades of debate  we're finally starting to act on those questions. We're slowly undertaking these projects to bring more freshwater back to the bay. But it's up to us as citizens  as residents  as stewards to hold our elected officials to their promises. What can you do to help  It's so easy. Just get outside  get out there. Take your friends out  take your kids out  take your family out. Hire a fishing guide. Show the state that protecting wilderness not only makes ecological sense  but economic sense as well. It's a lot of fun  just do it    put your feet in the water. The swamp will change you  I promise. Over the years  we've been so generous with these other landscapes around the country  cloaking them with this American pride  places that we now consider to define us  Grand Canyon  Yosemite  Yellowstone. And we use these parks and these natural areas as beacons and as cultural compasses. And sadly  the Everglades is very commonly left out of that conversation. But I believe it's every bit as iconic and emblematic of who we are as a country as any of these other wildernesses. It's just a different kind of wild. But I'm encouraged  because maybe we're finally starting to come around  because what was once deemed this swampy wasteland  today is a World Heritage site. It's a wetland of international importance. And we've come a long way in the last    years. And as the world's largest and most ambitious wetland restoration project  the international spotlight is on us in the Sunshine State. Because if we can heal this system  it's going to become an icon for wetland restoration all over the world. But it's up to us to decide which legacy we want to attach our flag to. They say that the Everglades is our greatest test. If we pass it  we get to keep the planet. I love that quote  because it's a challenge  it's a prod. Can we do it  Will we do it  We have to  we must. But the Everglades is not just a test. It's also a gift  and ultimately  our responsibility. Thank you. Imagine being unable to say   I am hungry    I am in pain    thank you   or  I love you.  Being trapped inside your body  a body that doesn't respond to commands. Surrounded by people  yet utterly alone. Wishing you could reach out  to connect  to comfort  to participate. For    long years  that was my reality. Most of us never think twice about talking  about communicating. I've thought a lot about it. I've had a lot of time to think. For the first    years of my life  I was a normal  happy  healthy little boy. Then everything changed. I contracted a brain infection. The doctors weren't sure what it was  but they treated me the best they could. However  I progressively got worse. Eventually  I lost my ability to control my movements  make eye contact  and finally  my ability to speak. While in hospital  I desperately wanted to go home. I said to my mother   When home   Those were the last words I ever spoke with my own voice. I would eventually fail every test for mental awareness. My parents were told I was as good as not there. A vegetable  having the intelligence of a three month old baby. They were told to take me home and try to keep me comfortable until I died. My parents  in fact my entire family's lives  became consumed by taking care of me the best they knew how. Their friends drifted away. One year turned to two  two turned to three. It seemed like the person I once was began to disappear. The Lego blocks and electronic circuits I'd loved as a boy were put away. I had been moved out of my bedroom into another more practical one. I had become a ghost  a faded memory of a boy people once knew and loved. Meanwhile  my mind began knitting itself back together. Gradually  my awareness started to return. But no one realized that I had come back to life. I was aware of everything  just like any normal person. I could see and understand everything  but I couldn't find a way to let anybody know. My personality was entombed within a seemingly silent body  a vibrant mind hidden in plain sight within a chrysalis. The stark reality hit me that I was going to spend the rest of my life locked inside myself  totally alone. I was trapped with only my thoughts for company. I would never be rescued. No one would ever show me tenderness. I would never talk to a friend. No one would ever love me. I had no dreams  no hope  nothing to look forward to. Well  nothing pleasant. I lived in fear  and  to put it bluntly  was waiting for death to finally release me  expecting to die all alone in a care home. I don't know if it's truly possible to express in words what it's like not to be able to communicate. Your personality appears to vanish into a heavy fog and all of your emotions and desires are constricted  stifled and muted within you. For me  the worst was the feeling of utter powerlessness. I simply existed. It's a very dark place to find yourself because in a sense  you have vanished. Other people controlled every aspect of my life. They decided what I ate and when. Whether I was laid on my side or strapped into my wheelchair. I often spent my days positioned in front of the TV watching Barney reruns. I think because Barney is so happy and jolly  and I absolutely wasn't  it made it so much worse. I was completely powerless to change anything in my life or people's perceptions of me. I was a silent  invisible observer of how people behaved when they thought no one was watching. Unfortunately  I wasn't only an observer. With no way to communicate  I became the perfect victim  a defenseless object  seemingly devoid of feelings that people used to play out their darkest desires. For more than    years  people who were charged with my care abused me physically  verbally and sexually. Despite what they thought  I did feel. The first time it happened  I was shocked and filled with disbelief. How could they do this to me  I was confused. What had I done to deserve this  Part of me wanted to cry and another part wanted to fight. Hurt  sadness and anger flooded through me. I felt worthless. There was no one to comfort me. But neither of my parents knew this was happening. I lived in terror  knowing it would happen again and again. I just never knew when. All I knew was that I would never be the same. I remember once listening to Whitney Houston singing   No matter what they take from me  they can't take away my dignity.  And I thought to myself   You want to bet   Perhaps my parents could have found out and could have helped. But the years of constant caretaking  having to wake up every two hours to turn me  combined with them essentially grieving the loss of their son  had taken a toll on my mother and father. Following yet another heated argument between my parents  in a moment of despair and desperation  my mother turned to me and told me that I should die. I was shocked  but as I thought about what she had said  I was filled with enormous compassion and love for my mother  yet I could do nothing about it. There were many moments when I gave up  sinking into a dark abyss. I remember one particularly low moment. My dad left me alone in the car while he quickly went to buy something from the store. A random stranger walked past  looked at me and he smiled. I may never know why  but that simple act  the fleeting moment of human connection  transformed how I was feeling  making me want to keep going. My existence was tortured by monotony  a reality that was often too much to bear. Alone with my thoughts  I constructed intricate fantasies about ants running across the floor. I taught myself to tell the time by noticing where the shadows were. As I learned how the shadows moved as the hours of the day passed  I understood how long it would be before I was picked up and taken home. Seeing my father walk through the door to collect me was the best moment of the day. My mind became a tool that I could use to either close down to retreat from my reality or enlarge into a gigantic space that I could fill with fantasies. I hoped that my reality would change and someone would see that I had come back to life. But I had been washed away like a sand castle built too close to the waves  and in my place was the person people expected me to be. To some I was Martin  a vacant shell  the vegetable  deserving of harsh words  dismissal and even abuse. To others  I was the tragically brain damaged boy who had grown to become a man. Someone they were kind to and cared for. Good or bad  I was a blank canvas onto which different versions of myself were projected. It took someone new to see me in a different way. An aromatherapist began coming to the care home about once a week. Whether through intuition or her attention to details that others failed to notice  she became convinced that I could understand what was being said. She urged my parents to have me tested by experts in augmentative and alternative communication. And within a year  I was beginning to use a computer program to communicate. It was exhilarating  but frustrating at times. I had so many words in my mind  that I couldn't wait to be able to share them. Sometimes  I would say things to myself simply because I could. In myself  I had a ready audience  and I believed that by expressing my thoughts and wishes  others would listen  too. But as I began to communicate more  I realized that it was in fact only just the beginning of creating a new voice for myself. I was thrust into a world I didn't quite know how to function in. I stopped going to the care home and managed to get my first job making photocopies. As simple as this may sound  it was amazing. My new world was really exciting but often quite overwhelming and frightening. I was like a man child  and as liberating as it often was  I struggled. I also learned that many of those who had known me for a long time found it impossible to abandon the idea of Martin they had in their heads. While those I had only just met struggled to look past the image of a silent man in a wheelchair. I realized that some people would only listen to me if what I said was in line with what they expected. Otherwise  it was disregarded and they did what they felt was best. I discovered that true communication is about more than merely physically conveying a message. It is about getting the message heard and respected. Still  things were going well. My body was slowly getting stronger. I had a job in computing that I loved  and had even got Kojak  the dog I had been dreaming about for years. However  I longed to share my life with someone. I remember staring out the window as my dad drove me home from work  thinking I have so much love inside of me and nobody to give it to. Just as I had resigned myself to being single for the rest of my life  I met Joan. Not only is she the best thing that has ever happened to me  but Joan helped me to challenge my own misconceptions about myself. Joan said it was through my words that she fell in love with me. However  after all I had been through  I still couldn't shake the belief that nobody could truly see beyond my disability and accept me for who I am. I also really struggled to comprehend that I was a man. The first time someone referred to me as a man  it stopped me in my tracks. I felt like looking around and asking   Who  me   That all changed with Joan. We have an amazing connection and I learned how important it is to communicate openly and honestly. I felt safe  and it gave me the confidence to truly say what I thought. I started to feel whole again  a man worthy of love. I began to reshape my destiny. I spoke up a little more at work. I asserted my need for independence to the people around me. Being given a means of communication changed everything. I used the power of words and will to challenge the preconceptions of those around me and those I had of myself. Communication is what makes us human  enabling us to connect on the deepest level with those around us    telling our own stories  expressing wants  needs and desires  or hearing those of others by really listening. All this is how the world knows who we are. So who are we without it  True communication increases understanding and creates a more caring and compassionate world. Once  I was perceived to be an inanimate object  a mindless phantom of a boy in a wheelchair. Today  I am so much more. A husband  a son  a friend  a brother  a business owner  a first class honors graduate  a keen amateur photographer. It is my ability to communicate that has given me all this. We are told that actions speak louder than words. But I wonder  do they  Our words  however we communicate them  are just as powerful. Whether we speak the words with our own voices  type them with our eyes  or communicate them non verbally to someone who speaks them for us  words are among our most powerful tools. I have come to you through a terrible darkness  pulled from it by caring souls and by language itself. The act of you listening to me today brings me farther into the light. We are shining here together. If there is one most difficult obstacle to my way of communicating  it is that sometimes I want to shout and other times simply to whisper a word of love or gratitude. It all sounds the same. But if you will  please imagine these next two words as warmly as you can  Thank you. Raise your hand if you've ever been asked the question  What do you want to be when you grow up   Now if you had to guess  how old would you say you were when you were first asked this question  You can just hold up fingers. Three. Five. Three. Five. Five. OK. Now  raise your hand if the question  What do you want to be when you grow up   has ever caused you any anxiety. Any anxiety at all. I'm someone who's never been able to answer the question  What do you want to be when you grow up   See  the problem wasn't that I didn't have any interests    it's that I had too many. In high school  I liked English and math and art and I built websites and I played guitar in a punk band called Frustrated Telephone Operator. Maybe you've heard of us. This continued after high school  and at a certain point  I began to notice this pattern in myself where I would become interested in an area and I would dive in  become all consumed  and I'd get to be pretty good at whatever it was  and then I would hit this point where I'd start to get bored. And usually I would try and persist anyway  because I had already devoted so much time and energy and sometimes money into this field. But eventually this sense of boredom  this feeling of  like  yeah  I got this  this isn't challenging anymore    it would get to be too much. And I would have to let it go. But then I would become interested in something else  something totally unrelated  and I would dive into that  and become all consumed  and I'd be like   Yes  I found my thing   and then I would hit this point again where I'd start to get bored. And eventually  I would let it go. But then I would discover something new and totally different  and I would dive into that. This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety  for two reasons. The first was that I wasn't sure how I was going to turn any of this into a career. I thought that I would eventually have to pick one thing  deny all of my other passions  and just resign myself to being bored. The other reason it caused me so much anxiety was a little bit more personal. I worried that there was something wrong with this  and something wrong with me for being unable to stick with anything. I worried that I was afraid of commitment  or that I was scattered  or that I was self sabotaging  afraid of my own success. If you can relate to my story and to these feelings  I'd like you to ask yourself a question that I wish I had asked myself back then. Ask yourself where you learned to assign the meaning of wrong or abnormal to doing many things. I'll tell you where you learned it  you learned it from the culture. We are first asked the question  What do you want to be when you grow up   when we're about five years old. And the truth is that no one really cares what you say when you're that age. It's considered an innocuous question  posed to little kids to elicit cute replies  like   I want to be an astronaut   or  I want to be a ballerina   or  I want to be a pirate.  Insert Halloween costume here. But this question gets asked of us again and again as we get older in various forms    for instance  high school students might get asked what major they're going to pick in college. And at some point   What do you want to be when you grow up   goes from being the cute exercise it once was to the thing that keeps us up at night. Why  See  while this question inspires kids to dream about what they could be  it does not inspire them to dream about all that they could be. In fact  it does just the opposite  because when someone asks you what you want to be  you can't reply with    different things  though well meaning adults will likely chuckle and be like   Oh  how cute  but you can't be a violin maker and a psychologist. You have to choose.  This is Dr. Bob Childs    and he's a luthier and psychotherapist. And this is Amy Ng  a magazine editor turned illustrator  entrepreneur  teacher and creative director. But most kids don't hear about people like this. All they hear is that they're going to have to choose. But it's more than that. The notion of the narrowly focused life is highly romanticized in our culture. It's this idea of destiny or the one true calling  the idea that we each have one great thing we are meant to do during our time on this earth  and you need to figure out what that thing is and devote your life to it. But what if you're someone who isn't wired this way  What if there are a lot of different subjects that you're curious about  and many different things you want to do  Well  there is no room for someone like you in this framework. And so you might feel alone. You might feel like you don't have a purpose. And you might feel like there's something wrong with you. There's nothing wrong with you. What you are is a multipotentialite. A multipotentialite is someone with many interests and creative pursuits. It's a mouthful to say. It might help if you break it up into three parts  multi  potential  and ite. You can also use one of the other terms that connote the same idea  such as polymath  the Renaissance person. Actually  during the Renaissance period  it was considered the ideal to be well versed in multiple disciplines. Barbara Sher refers to us as  scanners.  Use whichever term you like  or invent your own. I have to say I find it sort of fitting that as a community  we cannot agree on a single identity. It's easy to see your multipotentiality as a limitation or an affliction that you need to overcome. But what I've learned through speaking with people and writing about these ideas on my website  is that there are some tremendous strengths to being this way. Here are three multipotentialite super powers. One  idea synthesis. That is  combining two or more fields and creating something new at the intersection. Sha Hwang and Rachel Binx drew from their shared interests in cartography  data visualization  travel  mathematics and design  when they founded Meshu. Meshu is a company that creates custom geographically inspired jewelry. Sha and Rachel came up with this unique idea not despite  but because of their eclectic mix of skills and experiences. Innovation happens at the intersections. That's where the new ideas come from. And multipotentialites  with all of their backgrounds  are able to access a lot of these points of intersection. The second multipotentialite superpower is rapid learning. When multipotentialites become interested in something  we go hard. We observe everything we can get our hands on. We're also used to being beginners  because we've been beginners so many times in the past  and this means that we're less afraid of trying new things and stepping out of our comfort zones. What's more  many skills are transferable across disciplines  and we bring everything we've learned to every new area we pursue  so we're rarely starting from scratch. Nora Dunn is a full time traveler and freelance writer. As a child concert pianist  she honed an incredible ability to develop muscle memory. Now  she's the fastest typist she knows. Before becoming a writer  Nora was a financial planner. She had to learn the finer mechanics of sales when she was starting her practice  and this skill now helps her write compelling pitches to editors. It is rarely a waste of time to pursue something you're drawn to  even if you end up quitting. You might apply that knowledge in a different field entirely  in a way that you couldn't have anticipated. The third multipotentialite superpower is adaptability  that is  the ability to morph into whatever you need to be in a given situation. Abe Cajudo is sometimes a video director  sometimes a web designer  sometimes a Kickstarter consultant  sometimes a teacher  and sometimes  apparently  James Bond. He's valuable because he does good work. He's even more valuable because he can take on various roles  depending on his clients' needs. Fast Company magazine identified adaptability as the single most important skill to develop in order to thrive in the   st century. The economic world is changing so quickly and unpredictably that it is the individuals and organizations that can pivot in order to meet the needs of the market that are really going to thrive. Idea synthesis  rapid learning and adaptability  three skills that multipotentialites are very adept at  and three skills that they might lose if pressured to narrow their focus. As a society  we have a vested interest in encouraging multipotentialites to be themselves. We have a lot of complex  multidimensional problems in the world right now  and we need creative  out of the box thinkers to tackle them. Now  let's say that you are  in your heart  a specialist. You came out of the womb knowing you wanted to be a pediatric neurosurgeon. Don't worry    there's nothing wrong with you  either. In fact  some of the best teams are comprised of a specialist and multipotentialite paired together. The specialist can dive in deep and implement ideas  while the multipotentialite brings a breadth of knowledge to the project. It's a beautiful partnership. But we should all be designing lives and careers that are aligned with how we're wired. And sadly  multipotentialites are largely being encouraged simply to be more like their specialist peers. So with that said  if there is one thing you take away from this talk  I hope that it is this  embrace your inner wiring  whatever that may be. If you're a specialist at heart  then by all means  specialize. That is where you'll do your best work. But to the multipotentialites in the room  including those of you who may have just realized in the last    minutes that you are one    to you I say  embrace your many passions. Follow your curiosity down those rabbit holes. Explore your intersections. Embracing our inner wiring leads to a happier  more authentic life. And perhaps more importantly    multipotentialites  the world needs us. Thank you. Over our lifetimes  we've all contributed to climate change. Actions  choices and behaviors will have led to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions. And I think that that's quite a powerful thought. But it does have the potential to make us feel guilty when we think about decisions we might have made around where to travel to  how often and how  about the energy that we choose to use in our homes or in our workplaces  or quite simply the lifestyles that we lead and enjoy. But we can also turn that thought on its head  and think that if we've had such a profound but a negative impact on our climate already  then we have an opportunity to influence the amount of future climate change that we will need to adapt to. So we have a choice. We can either choose to start to take climate change seriously  and significantly cut and mitigate our greenhouse gas emissions  and then we will have to adapt to less of the climate change impacts in future. Alternatively  we can continue to really ignore the climate change problem. But if we do that  we are also choosing to adapt to very much more powerful climate impacts in future. And not only that. As people who live in countries with high per capita emissions  we're making that choice on behalf of others as well. But the choice that we don't have is a no climate change future. Over the last two decades  our government negotiators and policymakers have been coming together to discuss climate change  and they've been focused on avoiding a two degree centigrade warming above pre industrial levels. That's the temperature that's associated with dangerous impacts across a range of different indicators  to humans and to the environment. So two degrees centigrade constitutes dangerous climate change. But dangerous climate change can be subjective. So if we think about an extreme weather event that might happen in some part of the world  and if that happens in a part of the world where there is good infrastructure  where there are people that are well insured and so on  then that impact can be disruptive. It can cause upset  it could cause cost. It could even cause some deaths. But if that exact same weather event happens in a part of the world where there is poor infrastructure  or where people are not well insured  or they're not having good support networks  then that same climate change impact could be devastating. It could cause a significant loss of home  but it could also cause significant amounts of death. So this is a graph of the CO  emissions at the left hand side from fossil fuel and industry  and time from before the Industrial Revolution out towards the present day. And what's immediately striking about this is that emissions have been growing exponentially. If we focus in on a shorter period of time from       we have established in      the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  the Rio Earth Summit in       then rolling on a few years  in      we had the Copenhagen Accord  where it established avoiding a two degree temperature rise in keeping with the science and on the basis of equity. And then in       we had the Rio    event. And all the way through  during all of these meetings and many others as well  emissions have continued to rise. And if we focus on our historical emission trend in recent years  and we put that together with our understanding of the direction of travel in our global economy  then we are much more on track for a four degree centigrade global warming than we are for the two degree centigrade. Now  let's just pause for a moment and think about this four degree global average temperature. Most of our planet is actually made up of the sea. Now  because the sea has a greater thermal inertia than the land  the average temperatures over land are actually going to be higher than they are over the sea. The second thing is that we as human beings don't experience global average temperatures. We experience hot days  cold days  rainy days  especially if you live in Manchester like me. So now put yourself in a city center. Imagine somewhere in the world  Mumbai  Beijing  New York  London. It's the hottest day that you've ever experienced. There's sun beating down  there's concrete and glass all around you. Now imagine that same day    but it's six  eight  maybe    to    degrees warmer on that day during that heat wave. That's the kind of thing we're going to experience under a four degree global average temperature scenario. And the problem with these extremes  and not just the temperature extremes  but also the extremes in terms of storms and other climate impacts  is our infrastructure is just not set up to deal with these sorts of events. So our roads and our rail networks have been designed to last for a long time and withstand only certain amounts of impacts in different parts of the world. And this is going to be extremely challenged. Our power stations are expected to be cooled by water to a certain temperature to remain effective and resilient. And our buildings are designed to be comfortable within a particular temperature range. And this is all going to be significantly challenged under a four degree type scenario. Our infrastructure has not been designed to cope with this. So if we go back  also thinking about four degrees  it's not just the direct impacts  but also some indirect impacts. So if we take food security  for example. Maize and wheat yields in some parts of the world are expected to be up to    percent lower under a four degree scenario  rice up to    percent lower. This will be absolutely devastating for global food security. So all in all  the kinds of impacts anticipated under this four degree centigrade scenario are going to be incompatible with global organized living. So back to our trajectories and our graphs of four degrees and two degrees. Is it reasonable still to focus on the two degree path  There are quite a lot of my colleagues and other scientists who would say that it's now too late to avoid a two degree warming. But I would just like to draw on my own research on energy systems  on food systems  aviation and also shipping  just to say that I think there is still a small fighting chance of avoiding this two degree dangerous climate change. But we really need to get to grips with the numbers to work out how to do it. So if you focus in on this trajectory and these graphs  the yellow circle there highlights that the departure from the red four degree pathway to the two degree green pathway is immediate. And that's because of cumulative emissions  or the carbon budget. So in other words  because of the lights and the projectors that are on in this room right now  the CO  that is going into our atmosphere as a result of that electricity consumption lasts a very long time. Some of it will be in our atmosphere for a century  maybe much longer. It will accumulate  and greenhouse gases tend to be cumulative. And that tells us something about these trajectories. First of all  it tells us that it's the area under these curves that matter  not where we reach at a particular date in future. And that's important  because it doesn't matter if we come up with some amazing whiz bang technology to sort out our energy problem on the last day of       just in the nick of time to sort things out. Because in the meantime  emissions will have accumulated. So if we continue on this red  four degree centigrade scenario pathway  the longer we continue on it  that will need to be made up for in later years to keep the same carbon budget  to keep the same area under the curve  which means that that trajectory  the red one there  becomes steeper. So in other words  if we don't reduce emissions in the short to medium term  then we'll have to make more significant year on year emission reductions. We also know that we have to decarbonize our energy system. But if we don't start to cut emissions in the short to medium term  then we will have to do that even sooner. So this poses really big challenges for us. The other thing it does is tells us something about energy policy. If you live in a part of the world where per capita emissions are already high  it points us towards reducing energy demand. And that's because with all the will in the world  the large scale engineering infrastructure that we need to roll out rapidly to decarbonize the supply side of our energy system is just simply not going to happen in time. So it doesn't matter whether we choose nuclear power or carbon capture and storage  upscale our biofuel production  or go for a much bigger roll out of wind turbines and wave turbines. All of that will take time. So because it's the area under the curve that matters  we need to focus on energy efficiency  but also on energy conservation    in other words  using less energy. And if we do that  that also means that as we continue to roll out the supply side technology  we will have less of a job to do if we've actually managed to reduce our energy consumption  because we will then need less infrastructure on the supply side. Another issue that we really need to grapple with is the issue of well being and equity. There are many parts of the world where the standard of living needs to rise. Bbut with energy systems currently reliant on fossil fuel  as those economies grow so will emissions. And now  if we're all constrained by the same amount of carbon budget  that means that if some parts of the world's emissions are needing to rise  then other parts of the world's emissions need to reduce. So that poses very significant challenges for wealthy nations. Because according to our research  if you're in a country where per capita emissions are really high    so North America  Europe  Australia    emissions reductions of the order of    percent per year  and starting immediately  will be required for a good chance of avoiding the two degree target. Let me just put that into context. The economist Nicholas Stern said that emission reductions of more than one percent per year had only ever been associated with economic recession or upheaval. So this poses huge challenges for the issue of economic growth  because if we have our high carbon infrastructure in place  it means that if our economies grow  then so do our emissions. So I'd just like to take a quote from a paper by myself and Kevin Anderson back in      where we said that to avoid the two degree framing of dangerous climate change  economic growth needs to be exchanged at least temporarily for a period of planned austerity in wealthy nations. This is a really difficult message to take  because what it suggests is that we really need to do things differently. This is not about just incremental change. This is about doing things differently  about whole system change  and sometimes it's about doing less things. And this applies to all of us  whatever sphere of influence we have. So it could be from writing to our local politician to talking to our boss at work or being the boss at work  or talking with our friends and family  or  quite simply  changing our lifestyles. Because we really need to make significant change. At the moment  we're choosing a four degree scenario. If we really want to avoid the two degree scenario  there really is no time like the present to act. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Alice  basically what you're saying  the talk is  unless wealthy nations start cutting    percent per year the emissions now  this year  not in      or '    we are going to go straight to the four plus degree scenario. I am wondering what's your take on the cut by    percent for     . Alice Bows Larkin  Yeah  it's just nowhere near enough to avoid two degrees. One of the things that often    when there are these modeling studies that look at what we need to do  is they tend to hugely overestimate how quickly other countries in the world can start to reduce emissions. So they make kind of heroic assumptions about that. The more we do that  because it's the cumulative emissions  the short term stuff that really matters. So it does make a huge difference. If a big country like China  for example  continues to grow even for just a few extra years  that will make a big difference to when we need to decarbonize. So I don't think we can even say when it will be  because it all depends on what we have to do in the short term. But I think we've just got huge scope  and we don't pull those levers that allow us to reduce the energy demand  which is a shame. BG  Alice  thank you for coming to TED and sharing this data. ABL  Thank you. I want to talk to you about the future of medicine. But before I do that  I want to talk a little bit about the past. Now  throughout much of the recent history of medicine  we've thought about illness and treatment in terms of a profoundly simple model. In fact  the model is so simple that you could summarize it in six words  have disease  take pill  kill something. Now  the reason for the dominance of this model is of course the antibiotic revolution. Many of you might not know this  but we happen to be celebrating the hundredth year of the introduction of antibiotics into the United States. But what you do know is that that introduction was nothing short of transformative. Here you had a chemical  either from the natural world or artificially synthesized in the laboratory  and it would course through your body  it would find its target  lock into its target    a microbe or some part of a microbe    and then turn off a lock and a key with exquisite deftness  exquisite specificity. And you would end up taking a previously fatal  lethal disease    a pneumonia  syphilis  tuberculosis    and transforming that into a curable  or treatable illness. You have a pneumonia  you take penicillin  you kill the microbe and you cure the disease. So seductive was this idea  so potent the metaphor of lock and key and killing something  that it really swept through biology. It was a transformation like no other. And we've really spent the last     years trying to replicate that model over and over again in noninfectious diseases  in chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension and heart disease. And it's worked  but it's only worked partly. Let me show you. You know  if you take the entire universe of all chemical reactions in the human body  every chemical reaction that your body is capable of  most people think that that number is on the order of a million. Let's call it a million. And now you ask the question  what number or fraction of reactions can actually be targeted by the entire pharmacopoeia  all of medicinal chemistry  That number is    . The rest is chemical darkness. In other words   .    percent of all chemical reactions in your body are actually targetable by this lock and key mechanism. You know  if you think about human physiology as a vast global telephone network with interacting nodes and interacting pieces  then all of our medicinal chemistry is operating on one tiny corner at the edge  the outer edge  of that network. It's like all of our pharmaceutical chemistry is a pole operator in Wichita  Kansas who is tinkering with about    or    telephone lines. So what do we do about this idea  What if we reorganized this approach  In fact  it turns out that the natural world gives us a sense of how one might think about illness in a radically different way  rather than disease  medicine  target. In fact  the natural world is organized hierarchically upwards  not downwards  but upwards  and we begin with a self regulating  semi autonomous unit called a cell. These self regulating  semi autonomous units give rise to self regulating  semi autonomous units called organs  and these organs coalesce to form things called humans  and these organisms ultimately live in environments  which are partly self regulating and partly semi autonomous. What's nice about this scheme  this hierarchical scheme building upwards rather than downwards  is that it allows us to think about illness as well in a somewhat different way. Take a disease like cancer. Since the     s  we've tried rather desperately to apply this lock and key model to cancer. We've tried to kill cells using a variety of chemotherapies  or targeted therapies  and as most of us know  that's worked. It's worked for diseases like leukemia. It's worked for some forms of breast cancer  but eventually you run to the ceiling of that approach. And it's only in the last    years or so that we've begun to think about using the immune system  remembering that in fact the cancer cell doesn't grow in a vacuum. It actually grows in a human organism. And could you use the organismal capacity  the fact that human beings have an immune system  to attack cancer  In fact  it's led to the some of the most spectacular new medicines in cancer. And finally there's the level of the environment  isn't there  You know  we don't think of cancer as altering the environment. But let me give you an example of a profoundly carcinogenic environment. It's called a prison. You take loneliness  you take depression  you take confinement  and you add to that  rolled up in a little white sheet of paper  one of the most potent neurostimulants that we know  called nicotine  and you add to that one of the most potent addictive substances that you know  and you have a pro carcinogenic environment. But you can have anti carcinogenic environments too. There are attempts to create milieus  change the hormonal milieu for breast cancer  for instance. We're trying to change the metabolic milieu for other forms of cancer. Or take another disease  like depression. Again  working upwards  since the     s and     s  we've tried  again  desperately to turn off molecules that operate between nerve cells    serotonin  dopamine    and tried to cure depression that way  and that's worked  but then that reached the limit. And we now know that what you really probably need to do is to change the physiology of the organ  the brain  rewire it  remodel it  and that  of course  we know study upon study has shown that talk therapy does exactly that  and study upon study has shown that talk therapy combined with medicines  pills  really is much more effective than either one alone. Can we imagine a more immersive environment that will change depression  Can you lock out the signals that elicit depression  Again  moving upwards along this hierarchical chain of organization. What's really at stake perhaps here is not the medicine itself but a metaphor. Rather than killing something  in the case of the great chronic degenerative diseases    kidney failure  diabetes  hypertension  osteoarthritis    maybe what we really need to do is change the metaphor to growing something. And that's the key  perhaps  to reframing our thinking about medicine. Now  this idea of changing  of creating a perceptual shift  as it were  came home to me to roost in a very personal manner about    years ago. About    years ago    I've been a runner most of my life    I went for a run  a Saturday morning run  I came back and woke up and I basically couldn't move. My right knee was swollen up  and you could hear that ominous crunch of bone against bone. And one of the perks of being a physician is that you get to order your own MRIs. And I had an MRI the next week  and it looked like that. Essentially  the meniscus of cartilage that is between bone had been completely torn and the bone itself had been shattered. Now  if you're looking at me and feeling sorry  let me tell you a few facts. If I was to take an MRI of every person in this audience     percent of you would show signs of bone degeneration and cartilage degeneration like this.    percent of all women by the age of    would show moderate to severe cartilage degeneration.    to    percent of the men in this audience would also have such signs. So this is a very common disease. Well  the second perk of being a physician is that you can get to experiment on your own ailments. So about    years ago we began  we brought this process into the laboratory  and we began to do simple experiments  mechanically trying to fix this degeneration. We tried to inject chemicals into the knee spaces of animals to try to reverse cartilage degeneration  and to put a short summary on a very long and painful process  essentially it came to naught. Nothing happened. And then about seven years ago  we had a research student from Australia. The nice thing about Australians is that they're habitually used to looking at the world upside down. And so Dan suggested to me   You know  maybe it isn't a mechanical problem. Maybe it isn't a chemical problem. Maybe it's a stem cell problem.  In other words  he had two hypotheses. Number one  there is such a thing as a skeletal stem cell    a skeletal stem cell that builds up the entire vertebrate skeleton  bone  cartilage and the fibrous elements of skeleton  just like there's a stem cell in blood  just like there's a stem cell in the nervous system. And two  that maybe that  the degeneration or dysfunction of this stem cell is what's causing osteochondral arthritis  a very common ailment. So really the question was  were we looking for a pill when we should have really been looking for a cell. So we switched our models  and now we began to look for skeletal stem cells. And to cut again a long story short  about five years ago  we found these cells. They live inside the skeleton. Here's a schematic and then a real photograph of one of them. The white stuff is bone  and these red columns that you see and the yellow cells are cells that have arisen from one single skeletal stem cell    columns of cartilage  columns of bone coming out of a single cell. These cells are fascinating. They have four properties. Number one is that they live where they're expected to live. They live just underneath the surface of the bone  underneath cartilage. You know  in biology  it's location  location  location. And they move into the appropriate areas and form bone and cartilage. That's one. Here's an interesting property. You can take them out of the vertebrate skeleton  you can culture them in petri dishes in the laboratory  and they are dying to form cartilage. Remember how we couldn't form cartilage for love or money  These cells are dying to form cartilage. They form their own furls of cartilage around themselves. They're also  number three  the most efficient repairers of fractures that we've ever encountered. This is a little bone  a mouse bone that we fractured and then let it heal by itself. These stem cells have come in and repaired  in yellow  the bone  in white  the cartilage  almost completely. So much so that if you label them with a fluorescent dye you can see them like some kind of peculiar cellular glue coming into the area of a fracture  fixing it locally and then stopping their work. Now  the fourth one is the most ominous  and that is that their numbers decline precipitously  precipitously  tenfold  fiftyfold  as you age. And so what had happened  really  is that we found ourselves in a perceptual shift. We had gone hunting for pills but we ended up finding theories. And in some ways we had hooked ourselves back onto this idea  cells  organisms  environments  because we were now thinking about bone stem cells  we were thinking about arthritis in terms of a cellular disease. And then the next question was  are there organs  Can you build this as an organ outside the body  Can you implant cartilage into areas of trauma  And perhaps most interestingly  can you ascend right up and create environments  You know  we know that exercise remodels bone  but come on  none of us is going to exercise. So could you imagine ways of passively loading and unloading bone so that you can recreate or regenerate degenerating cartilage  And perhaps more interesting  and more importantly  the question is  can you apply this model more globally outside medicine  What's at stake  as I said before  is not killing something  but growing something. And it raises a series of  I think  some of the most interesting questions about how we think about medicine in the future. Could your medicine be a cell and not a pill  How would we grow these cells  What we would we do to stop the malignant growth of these cells  We heard about the problems of unleashing growth. Could we implant suicide genes into these cells to stop them from growing  Could your medicine be an organ that's created outside the body and then implanted into the body  Could that stop some of the degeneration  What if the organ needed to have memory  In cases of diseases of the nervous system some of those organs had memory. How could we implant those memories back in  Could we store these organs  Would each organ have to be developed for an individual human being and put back  And perhaps most puzzlingly  could your medicine be an environment  Could you patent an environment  You know  in every culture  shamans have been using environments as medicines. Could we imagine that for our future  I've talked a lot about models. I began this talk with models. So let me end with some thoughts about model building. That's what we do as scientists. You know  when an architect builds a model  he or she is trying to show you a world in miniature. But when a scientist is building a model  he or she is trying to show you the world in metaphor. He or she is trying to create a new way of seeing. The former is a scale shift. The latter is a perceptual shift. Now  antibiotics created such a perceptual shift in our way of thinking about medicine that it really colored  distorted  very successfully  the way we've thought about medicine for the last hundred years. But we need new models to think about medicine in the future. That's what's at stake. You know  there's a popular trope out there that the reason we haven't had the transformative impact on the treatment of illness is because we don't have powerful enough drugs  and that's partly true. But perhaps the real reason is that we don't have powerful enough ways of thinking about medicines. It's certainly true that it would be lovely to have new medicines. But perhaps what's really at stake are three more intangible M's  mechanisms  models  metaphors. Thank you. Chris Anderson  I really like this metaphor. How does it link in  There's a lot of talk in technologyland about the personalization of medicine  that we have all this data and that medical treatments of the future will be for you specifically  your genome  your current context. Does that apply to this model you've got here  Siddhartha Mukherjee  It's a very interesting question. We've thought about personalization of medicine very much in terms of genomics. That's because the gene is such a dominant metaphor  again  to use that same word  in medicine today  that we think the genome will drive the personalization of medicine. But of course the genome is just the bottom of a long chain of being  as it were. That chain of being  really the first organized unit of that  is the cell. So  if we are really going to deliver in medicine in this way  we have to think of personalizing cellular therapies  and then personalizing organ or organismal therapies  and ultimately personalizing immersion therapies for the environment. So I think at every stage  you know    there's that metaphor  there's turtles all the way. Well  in this  there's personalization all the way. CA  So when you say medicine could be a cell and not a pill  you're talking about potentially your own cells. SM  Absolutely. CA  So converted to stem cells  perhaps tested against all kinds of drugs or something  and prepared. SM  And there's no perhaps. This is what we're doing. This is what's happening  and in fact  we're slowly moving  not away from genomics  but incorporating genomics into what we call multi order  semi autonomous  self regulating systems  like cells  like organs  like environments. CA  Thank you so much. SM  Pleasure. Thanks. Two twin domes  two radically opposed design cultures. One is made of thousands of steel parts  the other of a single silk thread. One is synthetic  the other organic. One is imposed on the environment  the other creates it. One is designed for nature  the other is designed by her. Michelangelo said that when he looked at raw marble  he saw a figure struggling to be free. The chisel was Michelangelo's only tool. But living things are not chiseled. They grow. And in our smallest units of life  our cells  we carry all the information that's required for every other cell to function and to replicate. Tools also have consequences. At least since the Industrial Revolution  the world of design has been dominated by the rigors of manufacturing and mass production. Assembly lines have dictated a world made of parts  framing the imagination of designers and architects who have been trained to think about their objects as assemblies of discrete parts with distinct functions. But you don't find homogenous material assemblies in nature. Take human skin  for example. Our facial skins are thin with large pores. Our back skins are thicker  with small pores. One acts mainly as filter  the other mainly as barrier  and yet it's the same skin  no parts  no assemblies. It's a system that gradually varies its functionality by varying elasticity. So here this is a split screen to represent my split world view  the split personality of every designer and architect operating today between the chisel and the gene  between machine and organism  between assembly and growth  between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin. These two worldviews  my left brain and right brain  analysis and synthesis  will play out on the two screens behind me. My work  at its simplest level  is about uniting these two worldviews  moving away from assembly and closer into growth. You're probably asking yourselves  Why now  Why was this not possible    or even five years ago  We live in a very special time in history  a rare time  a time when the confluence of four fields is giving designers access to tools we've never had access to before. These fields are computational design  allowing us to design complex forms with simple code  additive manufacturing  letting us produce parts by adding material rather than carving it out  materials engineering  which lets us design the behavior of materials in high resolution  and synthetic biology  enabling us to design new biological functionality by editing DNA. And at the intersection of these four fields  my team and I create. Please meet the minds and hands of my students. We design objects and products and structures and tools across scales  from the large scale  like this robotic arm with an    foot diameter reach with a vehicular base that will one day soon print entire buildings  to nanoscale graphics made entirely of genetically engineered microorganisms that glow in the dark. Here we've reimagined the mashrabiya  an archetype of ancient Arabic architecture  and created a screen where every aperture is uniquely sized to shape the form of light and heat moving through it. In our next project  we explore the possibility of creating a cape and skirt    this was for a Paris fashion show with Iris van Herpen    like a second skin that are made of a single part  stiff at the contours  flexible around the waist. Together with my long term  D printing collaborator Stratasys  we  D printed this cape and skirt with no seams between the cells  and I'll show more objects like it. This helmet combines stiff and soft materials in    micron resolution. This is the resolution of a human hair. It's also the resolution of a CT scanner. That designers have access to such high resolution analytic and synthetic tools  enables to design products that fit not only the shape of our bodies  but also the physiological makeup of our tissues. Next  we designed an acoustic chair  a chair that would be at once structural  comfortable and would also absorb sound. Professor Carter  my collaborator  and I turned to nature for inspiration  and by designing this irregular surface pattern  it becomes sound absorbent. We printed its surface out of    different properties  varying in rigidity  opacity and color  corresponding to pressure points on the human body. Its surface  as in nature  varies its functionality not by adding another material or another assembly  but by continuously and delicately varying material property. But is nature ideal  Are there no parts in nature  I wasn't raised in a religious Jewish home  but when I was young  my grandmother used to tell me stories from the Hebrew Bible  and one of them stuck with me and came to define much of what I care about. As she recounts   On the third day of Creation  God commands the Earth to grow a fruit bearing fruit tree.  For this first fruit tree  there was to be no differentiation between trunk  branches  leaves and fruit. The whole tree was a fruit. Instead  the land grew trees that have bark and stems and flowers. The land created a world made of parts. I often ask myself   What would design be like if objects were made of a single part  Would we return to a better state of creation   So we looked for that biblical material  that fruit bearing fruit tree kind of material  and we found it. The second most abundant biopolymer on the planet is called chitin  and some     million tons of it are produced every year by organisms such as shrimps  crabs  scorpions and butterflies. We thought if we could tune its properties  we could generate structures that are multifunctional out of a single part. So that's what we did. We called Legal Seafood    we ordered a bunch of shrimp shells  we grinded them and we produced chitosan paste. By varying chemical concentrations  we were able to achieve a wide array of properties    from dark  stiff and opaque  to light  soft and transparent. In order to print the structures in large scale  we built a robotically controlled extrusion system with multiple nozzles. The robot would vary material properties on the fly and create these    foot long structures made of a single material      percent recyclable. When the parts are ready  they're left to dry and find a form naturally upon contact with air. So why are we still designing with plastics  The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process were used to contain photosynthetic microorganisms that first appeared on our planet  .  billion year ago  as we learned yesterday. Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT  we embedded bacteria that were genetically engineered to rapidly capture carbon from the atmosphere and convert it into sugar. For the first time  we were able to generate structures that would seamlessly transition from beam to mesh  and if scaled even larger  to windows. A fruit bearing fruit tree. Working with an ancient material  one of the first lifeforms on the planet  plenty of water and a little bit of synthetic biology  we were able to transform a structure made of shrimp shells into an architecture that behaves like a tree. And here's the best part  for objects designed to biodegrade  put them in the sea  and they will nourish marine life  place them in soil  and they will help grow a tree. The setting for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system. We looked for the possibility of creating life sustaining clothing for interplanetary voyages. To do that  we needed to contain bacteria and be able to control their flow. So like the periodic table  we came up with our own table of the elements  new lifeforms that were computationally grown  additively manufactured and biologically augmented. I like to think of synthetic biology as liquid alchemy  only instead of transmuting precious metals  you're synthesizing new biological functionality inside very small channels. It's called microfluidics. We  D printed our own channels in order to control the flow of these liquid bacterial cultures. In our first piece of clothing  we combined two microorganisms. The first is cyanobacteria. It lives in our oceans and in freshwater ponds. And the second  E. coli  the bacterium that inhabits the human gut. One converts light into sugar  the other consumes that sugar and produces biofuels useful for the built environment. Now  these two microorganisms never interact in nature. In fact  they never met each other. They've been here  engineered for the first time  to have a relationship inside a piece of clothing. Think of it as evolution not by natural selection  but evolution by design. In order to contain these relationships  we've created a single channel that resembles the digestive tract  that will help flow these bacteria and alter their function along the way. We then started growing these channels on the human body  varying material properties according to the desired functionality. Where we wanted more photosynthesis  we would design more transparent channels. This wearable digestive system  when it's stretched end to end  spans    meters. This is half the length of a football field  and    times as long as our small intestines. And here it is for the first time unveiled at TED    our first photosynthetic wearable  liquid channels glowing with life inside a wearable clothing. Thank you. Mary Shelley said   We are unfashioned creatures  but only half made up.  What if design could provide that other half  What if we could create structures that would augment living matter  What if we could create personal microbiomes that would scan our skins  repair damaged tissue and sustain our bodies  Think of this as a form of edited biology. This entire collection  Wanderers  that was named after planets  was not to me really about fashion per se  but it provided an opportunity to speculate about the future of our race on our planet and beyond  to combine scientific insight with lots of mystery and to move away from the age of the machine to a new age of symbiosis between our bodies  the microorganisms that we inhabit  our products and even our buildings. I call this material ecology. To do this  we always need to return back to nature. By now  you know that a  D printer prints material in layers. You also know that nature doesn't. It grows. It adds with sophistication. This silkworm cocoon  for example  creates a highly sophisticated architecture  a home inside which to metamorphisize. No additive manufacturing today gets even close to this level of sophistication. It does so by combining not two materials  but two proteins in different concentrations. One acts as the structure  the other is the glue  or the matrix  holding those fibers together. And this happens across scales. The silkworm first attaches itself to the environment    it creates a tensile structure    and it then starts spinning a compressive cocoon. Tension and compression  the two forces of life  manifested in a single material. In order to better understand how this complex process works  we glued a tiny earth magnet to the head of a silkworm  to the spinneret. We placed it inside a box with magnetic sensors  and that allowed us to create this   dimensional point cloud and visualize the complex architecture of the silkworm cocoon. However  when we placed the silkworm on a flat patch  not inside a box  we realized it would spin a flat cocoon and it would still healthily metamorphisize. So we started designing different environments  different scaffolds  and we discovered that the shape  the composition  the structure of the cocoon  was directly informed by the environment. Silkworms are often boiled to death inside their cocoons  their silk unraveled and used in the textile industry. We realized that designing these templates allowed us to give shape to raw silk without boiling a single cocoon. They would healthily metamorphisize  and we would be able to create these things. So we scaled this process up to architectural scale. We had a robot spin the template out of silk  and we placed it on our site. We knew silkworms migrated toward darker and colder areas  so we used a sun path diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat on our structure. We then created holes  or apertures  that would lock in the rays of light and heat  distributing those silkworms on the structure. We were ready to receive the caterpillars. We ordered       silkworms from an online silk farm. And after four weeks of feeding  they were ready to spin with us. We placed them carefully at the bottom rim of the scaffold  and as they spin they pupate  they mate  they lay eggs  and life begins all over again    just like us but much  much shorter. Bucky Fuller said that tension is the great integrity  and he was right. As they spin biological silk over robotically spun silk  they give this entire pavilion its integrity. And over two to three weeks        silkworms spin       kilometers. In a curious symmetry  this is also the length of the Silk Road. The moths  after they hatch  produce  .  million eggs. This could be used for     additional pavilions for the future. So here they are  the two worldviews. One spins silk out of a robotic arm  the other fills in the gaps. If the final frontier of design is to breathe life into the products and the buildings around us  to form a two material ecology  then designers must unite these two worldviews. Which brings us back  of course  to the beginning. Here's to a new age of design  a new age of creation  that takes us from a nature inspired design to a design inspired nature  and that demands of us for the first time that we mother nature. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. I was just thinking that I have been missing you way too long There's something inside this weary head that wants us to love just instead But I was just thinking  merely thinking I've got loads of pictures  I've got the one of you in that dancing dress But man I feel silly in that dim light Just after doing you by the sight of my Kodak delights  I am sinking  merely sinking I think about long distance rates instead of kissing you babe I'm a singer without a song If I wait for you longer my affection is stronger and I ...

Singing is sharing. When you sing  you have to know what you're talking about intimately  and you have to be willing to share this insight and give away a piece of yourself. I look for this intention to share in everything  and I ask  what are the intentions behind this architecture or this product or this restaurant or this meal  And if your intentions are to impress people or to get the big applause at the end  then you are taking  not giving. And this is a song that's about    it's the kind of song that everyone has their version of. This song is called  Home   and it's sort of a  This is where I'm from  nice to meet you all   kind of song. Home is the sound of birds early in the morning Home is a song I've always remembered Home is the memory of my first day in school Home is the books that I carry around Home is an alley in a faraway town Home is the places I ve been and where I d like to go Home I'm always gonna feel at home No matter where I may roam I'm always gonna find my way back home No matter how far I m gone I m always gonna feel this longing No matter where I might stay Home is a feather twirling in the air Home is flowers in a windowsill Home is all the things she said to me Home is a photo I never threw away Home is the smile on my face when I die Home is the taste of an apple pie I met a woman  she always lived in the same place And she said home is where you re born and raised And I met a man  he sat looking out to the sea And he said home is where you want to be I met a girl in some downtown bar And she said I'll have whatever he's having And I asked her how come we never met before  And she said all my life I ve been trying to get a place of my own I m always gonna feel at home No matter where I may roam Always gonna find my way back home No matter how far I m gone I'm always gonna feel this longing No matter where I might stay In my lab  we build autonomous aerial robots like the one you see flying here. Unlike the commercially available drones that you can buy today  this robot doesn't have any GPS on board. So without GPS  it's hard for robots like this to determine their position. This robot uses onboard sensors  cameras and laser scanners  to scan the environment. It detects features from the environment  and it determines where it is relative to those features  using a method of triangulation. And then it can assemble all these features into a map  like you see behind me. And this map then allows the robot to understand where the obstacles are and navigate in a collision free manner. What I want to show you next is a set of experiments we did inside our laboratory  where this robot was able to go for longer distances. So here you'll see  on the top right  what the robot sees with the camera. And on the main screen    and of course this is sped up by a factor of four    on the main screen you'll see the map that it's building. So this is a high resolution map of the corridor around our laboratory. And in a minute you'll see it enter our lab  which is recognizable by the clutter that you see. But the main point I want to convey to you is that these robots are capable of building high resolution maps at five centimeters resolution  allowing somebody who is outside the lab  or outside the building to deploy these without actually going inside  and trying to infer what happens inside the building. Now there's one problem with robots like this. The first problem is it's pretty big. Because it's big  it's heavy. And these robots consume about     watts per pound. And this makes for a very short mission life. The second problem is that these robots have onboard sensors that end up being very expensive    a laser scanner  a camera and the processors. That drives up the cost of this robot. So we asked ourselves a question  what consumer product can you buy in an electronics store that is inexpensive  that's lightweight  that has sensing onboard and computation  And we invented the flying phone. So this robot uses a Samsung Galaxy smartphone that you can buy off the shelf  and all you need is an app that you can download from our app store. And you can see this robot reading the letters   TED  in this case  looking at the corners of the  T  and the  E  and then triangulating off of that  flying autonomously. That joystick is just there to make sure if the robot goes crazy  Giuseppe can kill it. In addition to building these small robots  we also experiment with aggressive behaviors  like you see here. So this robot is now traveling at two to three meters per second  pitching and rolling aggressively as it changes direction. The main point is we can have smaller robots that can go faster and then travel in these very unstructured environments. And in this next video  just like you see this bird  an eagle  gracefully coordinating its wings  its eyes and feet to grab prey out of the water  our robot can go fishing  too. In this case  this is a Philly cheesesteak hoagie that it's grabbing out of thin air. So you can see this robot going at about three meters per second  which is faster than walking speed  coordinating its arms  its claws and its flight with split second timing to achieve this maneuver. In another experiment  I want to show you how the robot adapts its flight to control its suspended payload  whose length is actually larger than the width of the window. So in order to accomplish this  it actually has to pitch and adjust the altitude and swing the payload through. But of course we want to make these even smaller  and we're inspired in particular by honeybees. So if you look at honeybees  and this is a slowed down video  they're so small  the inertia is so lightweight    that they don't care    they bounce off my hand  for example. This is a little robot that mimics the honeybee behavior. And smaller is better  because along with the small size you get lower inertia. Along with lower inertia    along with lower inertia  you're resistant to collisions. And that makes you more robust. So just like these honeybees  we build small robots. And this particular one is only    grams in weight. It consumes only six watts of power. And it can travel up to six meters per second. So if I normalize that to its size  it's like a Boeing     traveling ten times the speed of sound. And I want to show you an example. This is probably the first planned mid air collision  at one twentieth normal speed. These are going at a relative speed of two meters per second  and this illustrates the basic principle. The two gram carbon fiber cage around it prevents the propellers from entangling  but essentially the collision is absorbed and the robot responds to the collisions. And so small also means safe. In my lab  as we developed these robots  we start off with these big robots and then now we're down to these small robots. And if you plot a histogram of the number of Band Aids we've ordered in the past  that sort of tailed off now. Because these robots are really safe. The small size has some disadvantages  and nature has found a number of ways to compensate for these disadvantages. The basic idea is they aggregate to form large groups  or swarms. So  similarly  in our lab  we try to create artificial robot swarms. And this is quite challenging because now you have to think about networks of robots. And within each robot  you have to think about the interplay of sensing  communication  computation    and this network then becomes quite difficult to control and manage. So from nature we take away three organizing principles that essentially allow us to develop our algorithms. The first idea is that robots need to be aware of their neighbors. They need to be able to sense and communicate with their neighbors. So this video illustrates the basic idea. You have four robots    one of the robots has actually been hijacked by a human operator  literally. But because the robots interact with each other  they sense their neighbors  they essentially follow. And here there's a single person able to lead this network of followers. So again  it's not because all the robots know where they're supposed to go. It's because they're just reacting to the positions of their neighbors. So the next experiment illustrates the second organizing principle. And this principle has to do with the principle of anonymity. Here the key idea is that the robots are agnostic to the identities of their neighbors. They're asked to form a circular shape  and no matter how many robots you introduce into the formation  or how many robots you pull out  each robot is simply reacting to its neighbor. It's aware of the fact that it needs to form the circular shape  but collaborating with its neighbors it forms the shape without central coordination. Now if you put these ideas together  the third idea is that we essentially give these robots mathematical descriptions of the shape they need to execute. And these shapes can be varying as a function of time  and you'll see these robots start from a circular formation  change into a rectangular formation  stretch into a straight line  back into an ellipse. And they do this with the same kind of split second coordination that you see in natural swarms  in nature. So why work with swarms  Let me tell you about two applications that we are very interested in. The first one has to do with agriculture  which is probably the biggest problem that we're facing worldwide. As you well know  one in every seven persons in this earth is malnourished. Most of the land that we can cultivate has already been cultivated. And the efficiency of most systems in the world is improving  but our production system efficiency is actually declining. And that's mostly because of water shortage  crop diseases  climate change and a couple of other things. So what can robots do  Well  we adopt an approach that's called Precision Farming in the community. And the basic idea is that we fly aerial robots through orchards  and then we build precision models of individual plants. So just like personalized medicine  while you might imagine wanting to treat every patient individually  what we'd like to do is build models of individual plants and then tell the farmer what kind of inputs every plant needs    the inputs in this case being water  fertilizer and pesticide. Here you'll see robots traveling through an apple orchard  and in a minute you'll see two of its companions doing the same thing on the left side. And what they're doing is essentially building a map of the orchard. Within the map is a map of every plant in this orchard. Let's see what those maps look like. In the next video  you'll see the cameras that are being used on this robot. On the top left is essentially a standard color camera. On the left center is an infrared camera. And on the bottom left is a thermal camera. And on the main panel  you're seeing a three dimensional reconstruction of every tree in the orchard as the sensors fly right past the trees. Armed with information like this  we can do several things. The first and possibly the most important thing we can do is very simple  count the number of fruits on every tree. By doing this  you tell the farmer how many fruits she has in every tree and allow her to estimate the yield in the orchard  optimizing the production chain downstream. The second thing we can do is take models of plants  construct three dimensional reconstructions  and from that estimate the canopy size  and then correlate the canopy size to the amount of leaf area on every plant. And this is called the leaf area index. So if you know this leaf area index  you essentially have a measure of how much photosynthesis is possible in every plant  which again tells you how healthy each plant is. By combining visual and infrared information  we can also compute indices such as NDVI. And in this particular case  you can essentially see there are some crops that are not doing as well as other crops. This is easily discernible from imagery  not just visual imagery but combining both visual imagery and infrared imagery. And then lastly  one thing we're interested in doing is detecting the early onset of chlorosis    and this is an orange tree    which is essentially seen by yellowing of leaves. But robots flying overhead can easily spot this autonomously and then report to the farmer that he or she has a problem in this section of the orchard. Systems like this can really help  and we're projecting yields that can improve by about ten percent and  more importantly  decrease the amount of inputs such as water by    percent by using aerial robot swarms. Lastly  I want you to applaud the people who actually create the future  Yash Mulgaonkar  Sikang Liu and Giuseppe Loianno  who are responsible for the three demonstrations that you saw. Thank you. We all go to doctors. And we do so with trust and blind faith that the test they are ordering and the medications they're prescribing are based upon evidence    evidence that's designed to help us. However  the reality is that that hasn't always been the case for everyone. What if I told you that the medical science discovered over the past century has been based on only half the population  I'm an emergency medicine doctor. I was trained to be prepared in a medical emergency. It's about saving lives. How cool is that  OK  there's a lot of runny noses and stubbed toes  but no matter who walks through the door to the ER  we order the same tests  we prescribe the same medication  without ever thinking about the sex or gender of our patients. Why would we  We were never taught that there were any differences between men and women. A recent Government Accountability study revealed that    percent of the drugs withdrawn from the market are due to side effects on women. So let's think about that for a minute. Why are we discovering side effects on women only after a drug has been released to the market  Do you know that it takes years for a drug to go from an idea to being tested on cells in a laboratory  to animal studies  to then clinical trials on humans  finally to go through a regulatory approval process  to be available for your doctor to prescribe to you  Not to mention the millions and billions of dollars of funding it takes to go through that process. So why are we discovering unacceptable side effects on half the population after that has gone through  What's happening  Well  it turns out that those cells used in that laboratory  they're male cells  and the animals used in the animal studies were male animals  and the clinical trials have been performed almost exclusively on men. How is it that the male model became our framework for medical research  Let's look at an example that has been popularized in the media  and it has to do with the sleep aid Ambien. Ambien was released on the market over    years ago  and since then  hundreds of millions of prescriptions have been written  primarily to women  because women suffer more sleep disorders than men. But just this past year  the Food and Drug Administration recommended cutting the dose in half for women only  because they just realized that women metabolize the drug at a slower rate than men  causing them to wake up in the morning with more of the active drug in their system. And then they're drowsy and they're getting behind the wheel of the car  and they're at risk for motor vehicle accidents. And I can't help but think  as an emergency physician  how many of my patients that I've cared for over the years were involved in a motor vehicle accident that possibly could have been prevented if this type of analysis was performed and acted upon    years ago when this drug was first released. How many other things need to be analyzed by gender  What else are we missing  World War II changed a lot of things  and one of them was this need to protect people from becoming victims of medical research without informed consent. So some much needed guidelines or rules were set into place  and part of that was this desire to protect women of childbearing age from entering into any medical research studies. There was fear  what if something happened to the fetus during the study  Who would be responsible  And so the scientists at this time actually thought this was a blessing in disguise  because let's face it    men's bodies are pretty homogeneous. They don't have the constantly fluctuating levels of hormones that could disrupt clean data they could get if they had only men. It was easier. It was cheaper. Not to mention  at this time  there was a general assumption that men and women were alike in every way  apart from their reproductive organs and sex hormones. So it was decided  medical research was performed on men  and the results were later applied to women. What did this do to the notion of women's health  Women's health became synonymous with reproduction  breasts  ovaries  uterus  pregnancy. It's this term we now refer to as  bikini medicine.  And this stayed this way until about the     s  when this concept was challenged by the medical community and by the public health policymakers when they realized that by excluding women from all medical research studies we actually did them a disservice  in that apart from reproductive issues  virtually nothing was known about the unique needs of the female patient. Since that time  an overwhelming amount of evidence has come to light that shows us just how different men and women are in every way. You know  we have this saying in medicine  children are not just little adults. And we say that to remind ourselves that children actually have a different physiology than normal adults. And it's because of this that the medical specialty of pediatrics came to light. And we now conduct research on children in order to improve their lives. And I know the same thing can be said about women. Women are not just men with boobs and tubes. But they have their own anatomy and physiology that deserves to be studied with the same intensity. Let's take the cardiovascular system  for example. This area in medicine has done the most to try to figure out why it seems men and women have completely different heart attacks. Heart disease is the number one killer for both men and women  but more women die within the first year of having a heart attack than men. Men will complain of crushing chest pain    an elephant is sitting on their chest. And we call this typical. Women have chest pain  too. But more women than men will complain of  just not feeling right    can't seem to get enough air in    just so tired lately.  And for some reason we call this atypical  even though  as I mentioned  women do make up half the population. And so what is some of the evidence to help explain some of these differences  If we look at the anatomy  the blood vessels that surround the heart are smaller in women compared to men  and the way that those blood vessels develop disease is different in women compared to men. And the test that we use to determine if someone is at risk for a heart attack  well  they were initially designed and tested and perfected in men  and so aren't as good at determining that in women. And then if we think about the medications    common medications that we use  like aspirin. We give aspirin to healthy men to help prevent them from having a heart attack  but do you know that if you give aspirin to a healthy woman  it's actually harmful  What this is doing is merely telling us that we are scratching the surface. Emergency medicine is a fast paced business. In how many life saving areas of medicine  like cancer and stroke  are there important differences between men and women that we could be utilizing  Or even  why is it that some people get those runny noses more than others  or why the pain medication that we give to those stubbed toes work in some and not in others  The Institute of Medicine has said every cell has a sex. What does this mean  Sex is DNA. Gender is how someone presents themselves in society. And these two may not always match up  as we can see with our transgendered population. But it's important to realize that from the moment of conception  every cell in our bodies    skin  hair  heart and lungs    contains our own unique DNA  and that DNA contains the chromosomes that determine whether we become male or female  man or woman. It used to be thought that those sex determining chromosomes pictured here    XY if you're male  XX if you're female    merely determined whether you would be born with ovaries or testes  and it was the sex hormones that those organs produced that were responsible for the differences we see in the opposite sex. But we now know that that theory was wrong    or it's at least a little incomplete. And thankfully  scientists like Dr. Page from the Whitehead Institute  who works on the Y chromosome  and Doctor Yang from UCLA  they have found evidence that tells us that those sex determining chromosomes that are in every cell in our bodies continue to remain active for our entire lives and could be what's responsible for the differences we see in the dosing of drugs  or why there are differences between men and women in the susceptibility and severity of diseases. This new knowledge is the game changer  and it's up to those scientists that continue to find that evidence  but it's up to the clinicians to start translating this data at the bedside  today. Right now. And to help do this  I'm a co founder of a national organization called Sex and Gender Women's Health Collaborative  and we collect all of this data so that it's available for teaching and for patient care. And we're working to bring together the medical educators to the table. That's a big job. It's changing the way medical training has been done since its inception. But I believe in them. I know they're going to see the value of incorporating the gender lens into the current curriculum. It's about training the future health care providers correctly. And regionally  I'm a co creator of a division within the Department of Emergency Medicine here at Brown University  called Sex and Gender in Emergency Medicine  and we conduct the research to determine the differences between men and women in emergent conditions  like heart disease and stroke and sepsis and substance abuse  but we also believe that education is paramount. We've created a     degree model of education. We have programs for the doctors  for the nurses  for the students and for the patients. Because this cannot just be left up to the health care leaders. We all have a role in making a difference. But I must warn you  this is not easy. In fact  it's hard. It's essentially changing the way we think about medicine and health and research. It's changing our relationship to the health care system. But there's no going back. We now know just enough to know that we weren't doing it right. Martin Luther King  Jr. has said   Change does not roll in on the wheels of inevitability  but comes through continuous struggle.  And the first step towards change is awareness. This is not just about improving medical care for women. This is about personalized  individualized health care for everyone. This awareness has the power to transform medical care for men and women. And from now on  I want you to ask your doctors whether the treatments you are receiving are specific to your sex and gender. They may not know the answer    yet. But the conversation has begun  and together we can all learn. Remember  for me and my colleagues in this field  your sex and gender matter. Thank you. So this right here is the tiny village of Elle  close to Lista. It's right at the southernmost tip of Norway. And on January   this year  an elderly guy who lives in the village  he went out to see what was cast ashore during a recent storm. And on a patch of grass right next to the water's edge  he found a wetsuit. It was grey and black  and he thought it looked cheap. Out of each leg of the wetsuit there were sticking two white bones. It was clearly the remains of a human being. And usually  in Norway  dead people are identified quickly. So the police started searching through missing reports from the local area  national missing reports  and looked for accidents with a possible connection. They found nothing. So they ran a DNA profile  and they started searching internationally through Interpol. Nothing. This was a person that nobody seemed to be missing. It was an invisible life heading for a nameless grave. But then  after a month  the police in Norway got a message from the police in the Netherlands. A couple of months earlier  they had found a body  in an identical wetsuit  and they had no idea who this person was. But the police in the Netherlands managed to trace the wetsuit by an RFID chip that was sewn in the suit. So they were then able to tell that both wetsuits were bought by the same customer at the same time  October          in the French city of Calais by the English Channel. But this was all they were able to figure out. The customer paid cash. There was no surveillance footage from the shop. So it became a cold case. We heard this story  and it triggered me and my colleague  photographer Tomm Christiansen  and we of course had the obvious question  who were these people  At the time  I'd barely heard about Calais  but it took about two or three seconds to figure out Calais is basically known for two things. It's the spot in continental Europe closest to Britain  and a lot of migrants and refugees are staying in this camp and are trying desperately to cross over to Britain. And right there was a plausible theory about the identity of the two people  and the police made this theory as well. Because if you or I or anybody else with a firm connection to Europe goes missing off the coast of France  people would just know. Your friends or family would report you missing  the police would come search for you  the media would know  and there would be pictures of you on lampposts. It's difficult to disappear without a trace. But if you just fled the war in Syria  and your family  if you have any family left  don't necessarily know where you are  and you're staying here illegally amongst thousands of others who come and go every day. Well  if you disappear one day  nobody will notice. The police won't come search for you because nobody knows you're gone. And this is what happened to Shadi Omar Kataf and Mouaz Al Balkhi from Syria. Me and Tomm went to Calais for the first time in April this year  and after three months of investigation  we were able to tell the story about how these two young men fled the war in Syria  ended up stuck in Calais  bought wetsuits and drowned in what seems to have been an attempt to swim across the English Channel in order to reach England. It is a story about the fact that everybody has a name  everybody has a story  everybody is someone. But it is also a story about what it's like to be a refugee in Europe today. So this is where we started our search. This is in Calais. Right now  between       and       people are living here under horrible conditions. It has been dubbed the worst refugee camp in Europe. Limited access to food  limited access to water  limited access to health care. Disease and infections are widespread. And they're all stuck here because they're trying to get to England in order to claim asylum. And they do that by hiding in the back of trucks headed for the ferry  or the Eurotunnel  or they sneak inside the tunnel terminal at night to try to hide on the trains. Most want to go to Britain because they know the language  and so they figure it would be easier to restart their lives from there. They want to work  they want to study  they want to be able to continue their lives. A lot of these people are highly educated and skilled workers. If you go to Calais and talk to refugees  you'll meet lawyers  politicians  engineers  graphic designers  farmers  soldiers. You've got the whole spectrum. But who all of these people are usually gets lost in the way we talk about refugees and migrants  because we usually do that in statistics. So you have    million refugees globally. About half a million have made the crossing over the Mediterranean into Europe so far this year  and roughly       are staying in Calais. But these are numbers  and the numbers don't say anything about who these people are  where they came from  or why they're here. And first  I want to tell you about one of them. This is    year old Mouaz Al Balkhi from Syria. We first heard about him after being in Calais the first time looking for answers to the theory of the two dead bodies. And after a while  we heard this story about a Syrian man who was living in Bradford in England  and had been desperately searching for his nephew Mouaz for months. And it turned out the last time anybody had heard anything from Mouaz was October        . That was the same date the wetsuits were bought. So we flew over there and we met the uncle and we did DNA samples of him  and later on got additional DNA samples from Mouaz's closest relative who now lives in Jordan. The analysis concluded the body who was found in a wetsuit on a beach in the Netherlands was actually Mouaz Al Balkhi. And while we were doing all this investigation  we got to know Mouaz's story. He was born in the Syrian capital of Damascus in     . He was raised in a middle class family  and his father in the middle there is a chemical engineer who spent    years in prison for belonging to the political opposition in Syria. While his father was in prison  Mouaz took responsibility and he cared for his three sisters. They said he was that kind of guy. Mouaz studied to become an electrical engineer at the University of Damascus. So a couple of years into the Syrian war  the family fled Damascus and went to the neighboring country  Jordan. Their father had problems finding work in Jordan  and Mouaz could not continue his studies  so he figured   OK  the best thing I can do to help my family would be to go somewhere where I can finish my studies and find work.  So he goes to Turkey. In Turkey  he's not accepted at a university  and once he had left Jordan as a refugee  he was not allowed to reenter. So then he decides to head for the UK  where his uncle lives. He makes it into Algeria  walks into Libya  pays a people smuggler to help him with the crossing into Italy by boat  and from there on he heads to Dunkirk  the city right next to Calais by the English Channel. We know he made at least    failed attempts to cross the English Channel by hiding in a truck. But at some point  he must have given up all hope. The last night we know he was alive  he spent at a cheap hotel close to the train station in Dunkirk. We found his name in the records  and he seems to have stayed there alone. The day after  he went into Calais  entered a sports shop a couple of minutes before   o'clock in the evening  along with Shadi Kataf. They both bought wetsuits  and the woman in the shop was the last person we know of to have seen them alive. We have tried to figure out where Shadi met Mouaz  but we weren't able to do that. But they do have a similar story. We first heard about Shadi after a cousin of his  living in Germany  had read an Arabic translation of the story made of Mouaz on Facebook. So we got in touch with him. Shadi  a couple of years older than Mouaz  was also raised in Damascus. He was a working kind of guy. He ran a tire repair shop and later worked in a printing company. He lived with his extended family  but their house got bombed early in the war. So the family fled to an area of Damascus known as Camp Yarmouk. Yarmouk is being described as the worst place to live on planet Earth. They've been bombed by the military  they've been besieged  they've been stormed by ISIS and they've been cut off from supplies for years. There was a UN official who visited last year  and he said   They ate all the grass so there was no grass left.  Out of a population of          only        are believed to still be left in Yarmouk. Shadi and his sisters got out. The parents are still stuck inside. So Shadi and one of his sisters  they fled to Libya. This was after the fall of Gaddafi  but before Libya turned into full blown civil war. And in this last remaining sort of stability in Libya  Shadi took up scuba diving  and he seemed to spend most of his time underwater. He fell completely in love with the ocean  so when he finally decided that he could no longer be in Libya  late August       he hoped to find work as a diver when he reached Italy. Reality was not that easy. We don't know much about his travels because he had a hard time communicating with his family  but we do know that he struggled. And by the end of September  he was living on the streets somewhere in France. On October    he calls his cousin in Belgium  and explains his situation. He said   I'm in Calais. I need you to come get my backpack and my laptop. I can't afford to pay the people smugglers to help me with the crossing to Britain  but I will go buy a wetsuit and I will swim.  His cousin  of course  tried to warn him not to  but Shadi's battery on the phone went flat  and his phone was never switched on again. What was left of Shadi was found nearly three months later      kilometers away in a wetsuit on a beach in Norway. He's still waiting for his funeral in Norway  and none of his family will be able to attend. Many may think that the story about Shadi and Mouaz is a story about death  but I don't agree. To me  this is a story about two questions that I think we all share  what is a better life  and what am I willing to do to achieve it  And to me  and probably a lot of you  a better life would mean being able to do more of what we think of as meaningful  whether that be spending more time with your family and friends  travel to an exotic place  or just getting money to buy that cool new device or a pair of new sneakers. And this is all within our reach pretty easily. But if you are fleeing a war zone  the answers to those two questions are dramatically different. A better life is a life in safety. It's a life in dignity. A better life means not having your house bombed  not fearing being kidnapped. It means being able to send your children to school  go to university  or just find work to be able to provide for yourself and the ones you love. A better life would be a future of some possibilities compared to nearly none  and that's a strong motivation. And I have no trouble imagining that after spending weeks or even months as a second grade citizen  living on the streets or in a horrible makeshift camp with a stupid  racist name like  The Jungle   most of us would be willing to do just about anything. If I could ask Shadi and Mouaz the second they stepped into the freezing waters of the English Channel  they would probably say   This is worth the risk   because they could no longer see any other option. And that's desperation  but that's the reality of living as a refugee in Western Europe in     . Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Thank you  Anders. This is Tomm Christiansen  who took most of the pictures you have seen and they've done reporting together. Tomm  you two have been back to Calais recently. This was the third trip. It was after the publication of the article. What has changed  What have you seen there  Tomm Christiansen  The first time we were in Calais  it was about       refugees there. They had a difficult time  but they were positive  they had hope. The last time  the camp has grown  maybe four or five thousand people. It seemed more permanent  NGOs have arrived  a small school has opened. But the thing is that the refugees have stayed for a longer time  and the French government has managed to seal off the borders better  so now The Jungle is growing  along with the despair and hopelessness among the refugees. BG  Are you planning to go back  And continue the reporting  TC  Yes. BG  Anders  I'm a former journalist  and to me  it's amazing that in the current climate of slashing budgets and publishers in crisis  Dagbladet has consented so many resources for this story  which tells a lot about newspapers taking the responsibility  but how did you sell it to your editors  Anders Fjellberg  It wasn't easy at first  because we weren't able to know what we actually could figure out. As soon as it became clear that we actually could be able to identify who the first one was  we basically got the message that we could do whatever we wanted  just travel wherever you need to go  do whatever you need to do  just get this done. BG  That's an editor taking responsibility. The story  by the way  has been translated and published across several European countries  and certainly will continue to do. And we want to read the updates from you. Thank you Anders. Thank you Tomm. As a singer songwriter  people often ask me about my influences or  as I like to call them  my sonic lineages. And I could easily tell you that I was shaped by the jazz and hip hop that I grew up with  by the Ethiopian heritage of my ancestors  or by the     s pop on my childhood radio stations. But beyond genre  there is another question  how do the sounds we hear every day influence the music that we make  I believe that everyday soundscape can be the most unexpected inspiration for songwriting  and to look at this idea a little bit more closely  I'm going to talk today about three things  nature  language and silence    or rather  the impossibility of true silence. And through this I hope to give you a sense of a world already alive with musical expression  with each of us serving as active participants  whether we know it or not. I'm going to start today with nature  but before we do that  let's quickly listen to this snippet of an opera singer warming up. Here it is. It's beautiful  isn't it  Gotcha  That is actually not the sound of an opera singer warming up. That is the sound of a bird slowed down to a pace that the human ear mistakenly recognizes as its own. It was released as part of Peter Sz ke's      Hungarian recording  The Unknown Music of Birds   where he records many birds and slows down their pitches to reveal what's underneath. Let's listen to the full speed recording. Now  let's hear the two of them together so your brain can juxtapose them. It's incredible. Perhaps the techniques of opera singing were inspired by birdsong. As humans  we intuitively understand birds to be our musical teachers. In Ethiopia  birds are considered an integral part of the origin of music itself. The story goes like this        years ago  a young man was born in the Empire of Aksum  a major trading center of the ancient world. His name was Yared. When Yared was seven years old his father died  and his mother sent him to go live with an uncle  who was a priest of the Ethiopian Orthodox tradition  one of the oldest churches in the world. Now  this tradition has an enormous amount of scholarship and learning  and Yared had to study and study and study and study  and one day he was studying under a tree  when three birds came to him. One by one  these birds became his teachers. They taught him music    scales  in fact. And Yared  eventually recognized as Saint Yared  used these scales to compose five volumes of chants and hymns for worship and celebration. And he used these scales to compose and to create an indigenous musical notation system. And these scales evolved into what is known as ki it  the unique  pentatonic  five note  modal system that is very much alive and thriving and still evolving in Ethiopia today. Now  I love this story because it's true at multiple levels. Saint Yared was a real  historical figure  and the natural world can be our musical teacher. And we have so many examples of this  the Pygmies of the Congo tune their instruments to the pitches of the birds in the forest around them. Musician and natural soundscape expert Bernie Krause describes how a healthy environment has animals and insects taking up low  medium and high frequency bands  in exactly the same way as a symphony does. And countless works of music were inspired by bird and forest song. Yes  the natural world can be our cultural teacher. So let's go now to the uniquely human world of language. Every language communicates with pitch to varying degrees  whether it's Mandarin Chinese  where a shift in melodic inflection gives the same phonetic syllable an entirely different meaning  to a language like English  where a raised pitch at the end of a sentence ... As an Ethiopian American woman  I grew up around the language of Amharic  Amhari a. It was my first language  the language of my parents  one of the main languages of Ethiopia. And there are a million reasons to fall in love with this language  its depth of poetics  its double entendres  its wax and gold  its humor  its proverbs that illuminate the wisdom and follies of life. But there's also this melodicism  a musicality built right in. And I find this distilled most clearly in what I like to call emphatic language    language that's meant to highlight or underline or that springs from surprise. Take  for example  the word   indey.  Now  if there are Ethiopians in the audience  they're probably chuckling to themselves  because the word means something like  No   or  How could he   or  No  he didn't.  It kind of depends on the situation. But when I was a kid  this was my very favorite word  and I think it's because it has a pitch. It has a melody. You can almost see the shape as it springs from someone's mouth.  Indey     it dips  and then raises again. And as a musician and composer  when I hear that word  something like this is floating through my mind. Or take  for example  the phrase for  It is right  or  It is correct      Lickih nehu ... Lickih nehu.  It's an affirmation  an agreement.  Lickih nehu.  When I hear that phrase  something like this starts rolling through my mind. And in both of those cases  what I did was I took the melody and the phrasing of those words and phrases and I turned them into musical parts to use in these short compositions. And I like to write bass lines  so they both ended up kind of as bass lines. Now  this is based on the work of Jason Moran and others who work intimately with music and language  but it's also something I've had in my head since I was a kid  how musical my parents sounded when they were speaking to each other and to us. It was from them and from Amhari a that I learned that we are awash in musical expression with every word  every sentence that we speak  every word  every sentence that we receive. Perhaps you can hear it in the words I'm speaking even now. Finally  we go to the     s United States and the most seminal work of   th century avant garde composition  John Cage's         written for any instrument or combination of instruments. The musician or musicians are invited to walk onto the stage with a stopwatch and open the score  which was actually purchased by the Museum of Modern Art    the score  that is. And this score has not a single note written and there is not a single note played for four minutes and    seconds. And  at once enraging and enrapturing  Cage shows us that even when there are no strings being plucked by fingers or hands hammering piano keys  still there is music  still there is music  still there is music. And what is this music  It was that sneeze in the back. It is the everyday soundscape that arises from the audience themselves  their coughs  their sighs  their rustles  their whispers  their sneezes  the room  the wood of the floors and the walls expanding and contracting  creaking and groaning with the heat and the cold  the pipes clanking and contributing. And controversial though it was  and even controversial though it remains  Cage's point is that there is no such thing as true silence. Even in the most silent environments  we still hear and feel the sound of our own heartbeats. The world is alive with musical expression. We are already immersed. Now  I had my own moment of  let's say  remixing John Cage a couple of months ago when I was standing in front of the stove cooking lentils. And it was late one night and it was time to stir  so I lifted the lid off the cooking pot  and I placed it onto the kitchen counter next to me  and it started to roll back and forth making this sound. And it stopped me cold. I thought   What a weird  cool swing that cooking pan lid has.  So when the lentils were ready and eaten  I hightailed it to my backyard studio  and I made this. Now  John Cage wasn't instructing musicians to mine the soundscape for sonic textures to turn into music. He was saying that on its own  the environment is musically generative  that it is generous  that it is fertile  that we are already immersed. Musician  music researcher  surgeon and human hearing expert Charles Limb is a professor at Johns Hopkins University and he studies music and the brain. And he has a theory that it is possible    it is possible    that the human auditory system actually evolved to hear music  because it is so much more complex than it needs to be for language alone. And if that's true  it means that we're hard wired for music  that we can find it anywhere  that there is no such thing as a musical desert  that we are permanently hanging out at the oasis  and that is marvelous. We can add to the soundtrack  but it's already playing. And it doesn't mean don't study music. Study music  trace your sonic lineages and enjoy that exploration. But there is a kind of sonic lineage to which we all belong. So the next time you are seeking percussion inspiration  look no further than your tires  as they roll over the unusual grooves of the freeway  or the top right burner of your stove and that strange way that it clicks as it is preparing to light. When seeking melodic inspiration  look no further than dawn and dusk avian orchestras or to the natural lilt of emphatic language. We are the audience and we are the composers and we take from these pieces we are given. We make  we make  we make  we make  knowing that when it comes to nature or language or soundscape  there is no end to the inspiration    if we are listening. Thank you. Father Daniel Berrigan once said that  writing about prisoners is a little like writing about the dead.  I think what he meant is that we treat prisoners as ghosts. They're unseen and unheard. It's easy to simply ignore them and it's even easier when the government goes to great lengths to keep them hidden. As a journalist  I think these stories of what people in power do when no one is watching  are precisely the stories that we need to tell. That's why I began investigating the most secretive and experimental prison units in the United States  for so called  second tier  terrorists. The government calls these units Communications Management Units or CMUs. Prisoners and guards call them  Little Guantanamo.  They are islands unto themselves. But unlike Gitmo they exist right here  at home  floating within larger federal prisons. There are   CMUs. One was opened inside the prison in Terre Haute  Indiana  and the other is inside this prison  in Marion  Illinois. Neither of them underwent the formal review process that is required by law when they were opened. CMU prisoners have all been convicted of crimes. Some of their cases are questionable and some involve threats and violence. I'm not here to argue the guilt or innocence of any prisoner. I'm here because as Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall said   When the prisons and gates slam shut  prisoners do not lose their human quality.  Every prisoner I've interviewed has said there are three flecks of light in the darkness of prison  phone calls  letters and visits from family. CMUs aren't solitary confinement  but they radically restrict all of these to levels that meet or exceed the most extreme prisons in the United States. Their phone calls can be limited to    minutes a month  compared to the     minutes other prisoners receive. Their letters can be limited to six pieces of paper. Their visits can be limited to four hours per month  compared to the    hours that people like Olympic Park bomber Eric Rudolph receive in the supermax. On top of that  CMU visits are non contact which means prisoners are not allowed to even hug their family. As one CMU prisoner said   We're not being tortured here  except psychologically.  The government won't say who is imprisoned here. But through court documents  open records requests and interviews with current and former prisoners  some small windows into the CMUs have opened. There's an estimated    to    prisoners here  and they're overwhelmingly Muslim. They include people like Dr. Rafil Dhafir  who violated the economic sanctions on Iraq by sending medical supplies for the children there. They've included people like Yassin Aref. Aref and his family fled to New York from Saddam Hussein's Iraq as refugees. He was arrested in      as part of an FBI sting. Aref is an imam and he was asked to bear witness to a loan  which is a tradition in Islamic culture. It turned out that one of the people involved in the loan was trying to enlist someone else in a fake attack. Aref didn't know. For that  he was convicted of conspiracy to provide material support to a terrorist group. The CMUs also include some non Muslim prisoners. The guards call them  balancers   meaning they help balance out the racial numbers  in hopes of deflecting law suits. These balancers include animal rights and environmental activists like Daniel McGowan. McGowan was convicted of participating in two arsons in the name of defending the environment as part of the Earth Liberation Front. During his sentencing  he was afraid that he would be sent to a rumored secret prison for terrorists. The judge dismissed all those fears  saying that they weren't supported by any facts. But that might be because the government hasn't fully explained why some prisoners end up in a CMU  and who is responsible for these decisions. When McGowan was transferred  he was told it's because he is a  domestic terrorist   a term the FBI uses repeatedly when talking about environmental activists. Now  keep in mind there are about     prisoners in US prisons who are classified as terrorists  and only a handful of them are in the CMUs. In McGowan's case  he was previously at a low security prison and he had no communications violations. So  why was he moved  Like other CMU prisoners  McGowan repeatedly asked for an answer  a hearing  or some opportunity for an appeal. This example from another prisoner shows how those requests are viewed.  Wants a transfer.   Told him no.  At one point  the prison warden himself recommended McGowan's transfer out of the CMU citing his good behavior  but the warden was overruled by the Bureau of Prison's Counterterrorism Unit  working with the Joint Terrorism Task Force of the FBI. Later I found out that McGowan was really sent to a CMU not because of what he did  but what he has said. A memo from the Counterterrorism Unit cited McGowan's  anti government beliefs.  While imprisoned  he continued writing about environmental issues  saying that activists must reflect on their mistakes and listen to each other. Now  in fairness  if you've spent any time at all in Washington  DC  you know this is really a radical concept for the government. I actually asked to visit McGowan in the CMU. And I was approved. That came as quite a shock. First  because as I've discussed on this stage before  I learned that the FBI has been monitoring my work. Second  because it would make me the first and only journalist to visit a CMU. I had even learned through the Bureau of Prisons Counterterrorism Unit  that they had been monitoring my speeches about CMUs  like this one. So how could I possibly be approved to visit  A few days before I went out to the prison  I got an answer. I was allowed to visit McGowan as a friend  not a journalist. Journalists are not allowed here. McGowan was told by CMU officials that if I asked any questions or published any story  that he would be punished for my reporting. When I arrived for our visit  the guards reminded me that they knew who I was and knew about my work. And they said that if I attempted to interview McGowan  the visit would be terminated. The Bureau of Prisons describes CMUs as  self contained housing units.  But I think that's an Orwellian way of describing black holes. When you visit a CMU  you go through all the security checkpoints that you would expect. But then the walk to the visitation room is silent. When a CMU prisoner has a visit  the rest of the prison is on lockdown. I was ushered into a small room  so small my outstretched arms could touch each wall. There was a grapefruit sized orb in the ceiling for the visit to be live monitored by the Counterterrorism Unit in West Virginia. The unit insists that all the visits have to be in English for CMU prisoners  which is an additional hardship for many of the Muslim families. There is a thick sheet of foggy  bulletproof glass and on the other side was Daniel McGowan. We spoke through these handsets attached to the wall and talked about books and movies. We did our best to find reasons to laugh. To fight boredom and amuse himself while in the CMU  McGowan had been spreading a rumor that I was secretly the president of a Twilight fan club in Washington  DC For the record  I'm not. But I kind of the hope the FBI now thinks that Bella and Edward are terrorist code names. During our visit  McGowan spoke most and at length about his niece Lily  his wife Jenny and how torturous it feels to never be able to hug them  to never be able to hold their hands. Three months after our visit  McGowan was transferred out of the CMU and then  without warning  he was sent back again. I had published leaked CMU documents on my website and the Counterterrorism Unit said that McGowan had called his wife and asked her to mail them. He wanted to see what the government was saying about him  and for that he was sent back to the CMU. When he was finally released at the end of his sentence  his story got even more Kafkaesque. He wrote an article for the Huffington Post headlined   Court Documents Prove I was Sent to a CMU for my Political Speech.  The next day he was thrown back in jail for his political speech. His attorneys quickly secured his release  but the message was very clear  Don't talk about this place. Today  nine years after they were opened by the Bush administration  the government is codifying how and why CMUs were created. According to the Bureau of Prisons  they are for prisoners with  inspirational significance.  I think that is very nice way of saying these are political prisons for political prisoners. Prisoners are sent to a CMU because of their race  their religion or their political beliefs. Now  if you think that characterization is too strong  just look at some of the government's own documents. When some of McGowan's mail was rejected by the CMU  the sender was told it's because the letters were intended  for political prisoners.  When another prisoner  animal rights activist Andy Stepanian  was sent to a CMU  it was because of his anti government and anti corporate views. Now  I know all of this may be hard to believe  that it's happening right now  and in the United States. But the unknown reality is that the US has a dark history of disproportionately punishing people because of their political beliefs. In the     s  before Marion was home to the CMU  it was home to the notorious Control Unit. Prisoners were locked down in solitary for    hours a day. The warden said the unit was to  control revolutionary attitudes.  In the     s  another experiment called the Lexington High Security Unit held women connected to the Weather Underground  Black Liberation and Puerto Rican independent struggles. The prison radically restricted communication and used sleep deprivation  and constant light for so called  ideological conversion.  Those prisons were eventually shut down  but only through the campaigning of religious groups and human rights advocates  like Amnesty International. Today  civil rights lawyers with the Center for Constitutional Rights are challenging CMUs in court for depriving prisoners of their due process rights and for retaliating against them for their protected political and religious speech. Many of these documents would have never come to light without this lawsuit. The message of these groups and my message for you today is that we must bear witness to what is being done to these prisoners. Their treatment is a reflection of the values held beyond prison walls. This story is not just about prisoners. It is about us. It is about our own commitment to human rights. It is about whether we will choose to stop repeating the mistakes of our past. If we don't listen to what Father Berrigan described as the stories of the dead  they will soon become the stories of ourselves. Thank you. Tom Rielly  I have a couple questions. When I was in high school  I learned about the Bill of Rights  the Constitution  freedom of speech  due process and  about    other laws and rights that seem to be violated by this. How could this possibly be happening  Will Potter  I think that's the number one question I get throughout all of my work  and the short answer is that people don't know. I think the solution to any of these types of situations  any rights abuses  are really dependent on two things. They're dependent on knowledge that it's actually happening and then a means and efficacy to actually make a change. And unfortunately with these prisoners  one  people don't know what's happening at all and then they're already disenfranchised populations who don't have access to attorneys  not native English speakers. In some of these cases  they have great representation that I mentioned  but there's just not a public awareness of what's happening. TR  Isn't it guaranteed in prison that you have right to council or access to council  WP  There's a tendency in our culture to see when people have been convicted of a crime  no matter if that charge was bogus or legitimate  that whatever happens to them after that is warranted. And I think that's a really damaging and dangerous narrative that we have  that allows these types of things to happen  as the general public just kind of turns a blind eye to it. TR  All those documents on screen were all real documents  word for word  unchanged at all  right  WP  Absolutely. I've actually uploaded all of them to my website. It's willpotter.com CMU and it's a footnoted version of the talk  so you can see the documents for yourself without the little snippets. You can see the full version. I relied overwhelmingly on primary source documents or on primary interviews with former and current prisoners  with people that are dealing with this situation every day. And like I said  I've been there myself  as well. TR  You're doing courageous work. WP  Thank you very much. Thank you all. A few years ago  with my colleague  Emmanuelle Charpentier  I invented a new technology for editing genomes. It's called CRISPR Cas . The CRISPR technology allows scientists to make changes to the DNA in cells that could allow us to cure genetic disease. You might be interested to know that the CRISPR technology came about through a basic research project that was aimed at discovering how bacteria fight viral infections. Bacteria have to deal with viruses in their environment  and we can think about a viral infection like a ticking time bomb    a bacterium has only a few minutes to defuse the bomb before it gets destroyed. So  many bacteria have in their cells an adaptive immune system called CRISPR  that allows them to detect viral DNA and destroy it. Part of the CRISPR system is a protein called Cas   that's able to seek out  cut and eventually degrade viral DNA in a specific way. And it was through our research to understand the activity of this protein  Cas   that we realized that we could harness its function as a genetic engineering technology    a way for scientists to delete or insert specific bits of DNA into cells with incredible precision    that would offer opportunities to do things that really haven't been possible in the past. The CRISPR technology has already been used to change the DNA in the cells of mice and monkeys  other organisms as well. Chinese scientists showed recently that they could even use the CRISPR technology to change genes in human embryos. And scientists in Philadelphia showed they could use CRISPR to remove the DNA of an integrated HIV virus from infected human cells. The opportunity to do this kind of genome editing also raises various ethical issues that we have to consider  because this technology can be employed not only in adult cells  but also in the embryos of organisms  including our own species. And so  together with my colleagues  I've called for a global conversation about the technology that I co invented  so that we can consider all of the ethical and societal implications of a technology like this. What I want to do now is tell you what the CRISPR technology is  what it can do  where we are today and why I think we need to take a prudent path forward in the way that we employ this technology. When viruses infect a cell  they inject their DNA. And in a bacterium  the CRISPR system allows that DNA to be plucked out of the virus  and inserted in little bits into the chromosome    the DNA of the bacterium. And these integrated bits of viral DNA get inserted at a site called CRISPR. CRISPR stands for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats. A big mouthful    you can see why we use the acronym CRISPR. It's a mechanism that allows cells to record  over time  the viruses they have been exposed to. And importantly  those bits of DNA are passed on to the cells' progeny  so cells are protected from viruses not only in one generation  but over many generations of cells. This allows the cells to keep a record of infection  and as my colleague  Blake Wiedenheft  likes to say  the CRISPR locus is effectively a genetic vaccination card in cells. Once those bits of DNA have been inserted into the bacterial chromosome  the cell then makes a little copy of a molecule called RNA  which is orange in this picture  that is an exact replicate of the viral DNA. RNA is a chemical cousin of DNA  and it allows interaction with DNA molecules that have a matching sequence. So those little bits of RNA from the CRISPR locus associate    they bind    to protein called Cas   which is white in the picture  and form a complex that functions like a sentinel in the cell. It searches through all of the DNA in the cell  to find sites that match the sequences in the bound RNAs. And when those sites are found    as you can see here  the blue molecule is DNA    this complex associates with that DNA and allows the Cas  cleaver to cut up the viral DNA. It makes a very precise break. So we can think of the Cas  RNA sentinel complex like a pair of scissors that can cut DNA    it makes a double stranded break in the DNA helix. And importantly  this complex is programmable  so it can be programmed to recognize particular DNA sequences  and make a break in the DNA at that site. As I'm going to tell you now  we recognized that that activity could be harnessed for genome engineering  to allow cells to make a very precise change to the DNA at the site where this break was introduced. That's sort of analogous to the way that we use a word processing program to fix a typo in a document. The reason we envisioned using the CRISPR system for genome engineering is because cells have the ability to detect broken DNA and repair it. So when a plant or an animal cell detects a double stranded break in its DNA  it can fix that break  either by pasting together the ends of the broken DNA with a little  tiny change in the sequence of that position  or it can repair the break by integrating a new piece of DNA at the site of the cut. So if we have a way to introduce double stranded breaks into DNA at precise places  we can trigger cells to repair those breaks  by either the disruption or incorporation of new genetic information. So if we were able to program the CRISPR technology to make a break in DNA at the position at or near a mutation causing cystic fibrosis  for example  we could trigger cells to repair that mutation. Genome engineering is actually not new  it's been in development since the     s. We've had technologies for sequencing DNA  for copying DNA  and even for manipulating DNA. And these technologies were very promising  but the problem was that they were either inefficient  or they were difficult enough to use that most scientists had not adopted them for use in their own laboratories  or certainly for many clinical applications. So  the opportunity to take a technology like CRISPR and utilize it has appeal  because of its relative simplicity. We can think of older genome engineering technologies as similar to having to rewire your computer each time you want to run a new piece of software  whereas the CRISPR technology is like software for the genome  we can program it easily  using these little bits of RNA. So once a double stranded break is made in DNA  we can induce repair  and thereby potentially achieve astounding things  like being able to correct mutations that cause sickle cell anemia or cause Huntington's Disease. I actually think that the first applications of the CRISPR technology are going to happen in the blood  where it's relatively easier to deliver this tool into cells  compared to solid tissues. Right now  a lot of the work that's going on applies to animal models of human disease  such as mice. The technology is being used to make very precise changes that allow us to study the way that these changes in the cell's DNA affect either a tissue or  in this case  an entire organism. Now in this example  the CRISPR technology was used to disrupt a gene by making a tiny change in the DNA in a gene that is responsible for the black coat color of these mice. Imagine that these white mice differ from their pigmented litter mates by just a tiny change at one gene in the entire genome  and they're otherwise completely normal. And when we sequence the DNA from these animals  we find that the change in the DNA has occurred at exactly the place where we induced it  using the CRISPR technology. Additional experiments are going on in other animals that are useful for creating models for human disease  such as monkeys. And here we find that we can use these systems to test the application of this technology in particular tissues  for example  figuring out how to deliver the CRISPR tool into cells. We also want to understand better how to control the way that DNA is repaired after it's cut  and also to figure out how to control and limit any kind of off target  or unintended effects of using the technology. I think that we will see clinical application of this technology  certainly in adults  within the next    years. I think that it's likely that we will see clinical trials and possibly even approved therapies within that time  which is a very exciting thing to think about. And because of the excitement around this technology  there's a lot of interest in start up companies that have been founded to commercialize the CRISPR technology  and lots of venture capitalists that have been investing in these companies. But we have to also consider that the CRISPR technology can be used for things like enhancement. Imagine that we could try to engineer humans that have enhanced properties  such as stronger bones  or less susceptibility to cardiovascular disease or even to have properties that we would consider maybe to be desirable  like a different eye color or to be taller  things like that.  Designer humans   if you will. Right now  the genetic information to understand what types of genes would give rise to these traits is mostly not known. But it's important to know that the CRISPR technology gives us a tool to make such changes  once that knowledge becomes available. This raises a number of ethical questions that we have to carefully consider  and this is why I and my colleagues have called for a global pause in any clinical application of the CRISPR technology in human embryos  to give us time to really consider all of the various implications of doing so. And actually  there is an important precedent for such a pause from the     s  when scientists got together to call for a moratorium on the use of molecular cloning  until the safety of that technology could be tested carefully and validated. So  genome engineered humans are not with us yet  but this is no longer science fiction. Genome engineered animals and plants are happening right now. And this puts in front of all of us a huge responsibility  to consider carefully both the unintended consequences as well as the intended impacts of a scientific breakthrough. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Jennifer  this is a technology with huge consequences  as you pointed out. Your attitude about asking for a pause or a moratorium or a quarantine is incredibly responsible. There are  of course  the therapeutic results of this  but then there are the un therapeutic ones and they seem to be the ones gaining traction  particularly in the media. This is one of the latest issues of The Economist     Editing humanity.  It's all about genetic enhancement  it's not about therapeutics. What kind of reactions did you get back in March from your colleagues in the science world  when you asked or suggested that we should actually pause this for a moment and think about it  Jennifer Doudna  My colleagues were actually  I think  delighted to have the opportunity to discuss this openly. It's interesting that as I talk to people  my scientific colleagues as well as others  there's a wide variety of viewpoints about this. So clearly it's a topic that needs careful consideration and discussion. BG  There's a big meeting happening in December that you and your colleagues are calling  together with the National Academy of Sciences and others  what do you hope will come out of the meeting  practically  JD  Well  I hope that we can air the views of many different individuals and stakeholders who want to think about how to use this technology responsibly. It may not be possible to come up with a consensus point of view  but I think we should at least understand what all the issues are as we go forward. BG  Now  colleagues of yours  like George Church  for example  at Harvard  they say   Yeah  ethical issues basically are just a question of safety. We test and test and test again  in animals and in labs  and then once we feel it's safe enough  we move on to humans.  So that's kind of the other school of thought  that we should actually use this opportunity and really go for it. Is there a possible split happening in the science community about this  I mean  are we going to see some people holding back because they have ethical concerns  and some others just going forward because some countries under regulate or don't regulate at all  JD  Well  I think with any new technology  especially something like this  there are going to be a variety of viewpoints  and I think that's perfectly understandable. I think that in the end  this technology will be used for human genome engineering  but I think to do that without careful consideration and discussion of the risks and potential complications would not be responsible. BG  There are a lot of technologies and other fields of science that are developing exponentially  pretty much like yours. I'm thinking about artificial intelligence  autonomous robots and so on. No one seems    aside from autonomous warfare robots    nobody seems to have launched a similar discussion in those fields  in calling for a moratorium. Do you think that your discussion may serve as a blueprint for other fields  JD  Well  I think it's hard for scientists to get out of the laboratory. Speaking for myself  it's a little bit uncomfortable to do that. But I do think that being involved in the genesis of this really puts me and my colleagues in a position of responsibility. And I would say that I certainly hope that other technologies will be considered in the same way  just as we would want to consider something that could have implications in other fields besides biology. BG  Jennifer  thanks for coming to TED. JD  Thank you. I'd like to start by asking you all to go to your happy place  please. Yes  your happy place  I know you've got one even if it's fake. OK  so  comfortable  Good. Now I'd like to you to mentally answer the following questions. Is there any strip lighting in your happy place  Any plastic tables  Polyester flooring  Mobile phones  No  I think we all know that our happy place is meant to be somewhere natural  outdoors    on a beach  fireside. We'll be reading or eating or knitting. And we're surrounded by natural light and organic elements. Natural things make us happy. And happiness is a great motivator  we strive for happiness. Perhaps that's why we're always redesigning everything  in the hopes that our solutions might feel more natural. So let's start there    with the idea that good design should feel natural. Your phone is not very natural. And you probably think you're addicted to your phone  but you're really not. We're not addicted to devices  we're addicted to the information that flows through them. I wonder how long you would be happy in your happy place without any information from the outside world. I'm interested in how we access that information  how we experience it. We're moving from a time of static information  held in books and libraries and bus stops  through a period of digital information  towards a period of fluid information  where your children will expect to be able to access anything  anywhere at any time  from quantum physics to medieval viticulture  from gender theory to tomorrow's weather  just like switching on a lightbulb    Imagine that. Humans also like simple tools. Your phone is not a very simple tool. A fork is a simple tool. And we don't like them made of plastic  in the same way I don't really like my phone very much    it's not how I want to experience information. I think there are better solutions than a world mediated by screens. I don't hate screens  but I don't feel    and I don't think any of us feel that good about how much time we spend slouched over them. Fortunately  the big tech companies seem to agree. They're actually heavily invested in touch and speech and gesture  and also in senses    things that can turn dumb objects  like cups  and imbue them with the magic of the Internet  potentially turning this digital cloud into something we might touch and move. The parents in crisis over screen time need physical digital toys teaching their kids to read  as well as family safe app stores. And I think  actually  that's already really happening. Reality is richer than screens. For example  I love books. For me they are time machines    atoms and molecules bound in space  from the moment of their creation to the moment of my experience. But frankly  the content's identical on my phone. So what makes this a richer experience than a screen  I mean  scientifically. We need screens  of course. I'm going to show film  I need the enormous screen. But there's more than you can do with these magic boxes. Your phone is not the Internet's door bitch. We can build things    physical things  using physics and pixels  that can integrate the Internet into the world around us. And I'm going to show you a few examples of those. A while ago  I got to work with a design agency  Berg  on an exploration of what the Internet without screens might actually look like. And they showed us a range ways that light can work with simple senses and physical objects to really bring the Internet to life  to make it tangible. Like this wonderfully mechanical YouTube player. And this was an inspiration to me. Next I worked with the Japanese agency  AQ  on a research project into mental health. We wanted to create an object that could capture the subjective data around mood swings that's so essential to diagnosis. This object captures your touch  so you might press it very hard if you're angry  or stroke it if you're calm. It's like a digital emoji stick. And then you might revisit those moments later  and add context to them online. Most of all  we wanted to create an intimate  beautiful thing that could live in your pocket and be loved. The binoculars are actually a birthday present for the Sydney Opera House's   th anniversary. Our friends at Tellart in Boston brought over a pair of street binoculars  the kind you might find on the Empire State Building  and they fitted them with     degree views of other iconic world heritage sights    using Street View. And then we stuck them under the steps. So  they became this very physical  simple reappropriation  or like a portal to these other icons. So you might see Versailles or Shackleton's Hut. Basically  it's virtual reality circa     . In our office we use hacky sacks to exchange URLs. This is incredibly simple  it's like your Opal card. You basically put a website on the little chip in here  and then you do this and ... bosh     the website appears on your phone. It's about    cents. Treehugger is a project that we're working on with Grumpy Sailor and Finch  here in Sydney. And I'm very excited about what might happen when you pull the phones apart and you put the bits into trees  and that my children might have an opportunity to visit an enchanted forest guided by a magic wand  where they could talk to digital fairies and ask them questions  and be asked questions in return. As you can see  we're at the cardboard stage with this one. But I'm very excited by the possibility of getting kids back outside without screens  but with all the powerful magic of the Internet at their fingertips. And we hope to have something like this working by the end of the year. So let's recap. Humans like natural solutions. Humans love information. Humans need simple tools. These principles should underpin how we design for the future  not just for the Internet. You may feel uncomfortable about the age of information that we're moving into. You may feel challenged  rather than simply excited. Guess what  Me too. It's a really extraordinary period of human history. We are the people that actually build our world  there are no artificial intelligences... yet. It's us    designers  architects  artists  engineers. And if we challenge ourselves  I think that actually we can have a happy place filled with the information we love that feels as natural and as simple as switching on lightbulb. And although it may seem inevitable  that what the public wants is watches and websites and widgets  maybe we could give a bit of thought to cork and light and hacky sacks. Thank you very much. I would like to invite you to come along on a visit to a dark continent. It is the continent hidden under the surface of the earth. It is largely unexplored  poorly understood  and the stuff of legends. But it is made also of dramatic landscapes like this huge underground chamber  and it is rich with surprising biological and mineralogical worlds. Thanks to the efforts of intrepid voyagers in the last three centuries    actually  we know also thanks to satellite technology  of course    we know almost every single square meter of our planet's surface. However  we know still very little about what is hidden inside the earth. Because a cave landscape  like this deep shaft in Italy  is hidden  the potential of cave exploration    the geographical dimension    is poorly understood and unappreciated. Because we are creatures living on the surface  our perception of the inner side of the planet is in some ways skewed  as is that of the depth of the oceans or of the upper atmosphere. However  since systematic cave exploration started about one century ago  we know actually that caves exist in every continent of the world. A single cave system  like Mammoth Cave  which is in Kentucky  can be as long as more than     kilometers. And an abyss like Krubera Voronya  which is in the Caucasus region  actually the deepest cave explored in the world  can go as far as more than       meters below the surface. That means a journey of weeks for a cave explorer. Caves form in karstic regions. So karstic regions are areas of the world where the infiltrating water along cracks  fractures  can easily dissolve soluble lithologies  forming a drainage system of tunnels  conduits    a three dimensional network  actually. Karstic regions cover almost    percent of the continents' surface  and we know actually that speleologists in the last    years have explored roughly        kilometers of cave passages around the world  which is a big number. But geologists have estimated that what is still missing  to be discovered and mapped  is something around    million kilometers. That means that for each meter of a cave that we already know  that we have explored  there are still some tens of kilometers of undiscovered passages. That means that this is really an endless continent  and we will never be able to explore it completely. And this estimation is made without considering other types of caves  like  for example  inside glaciers or even volcanic caves  which are not karstic  but are formed by lava flows. And if we have a look at other planets like  for example  Mars  you will see that this characteristic is not so specific of our home planet. However  I will show to you now that we do not need to go to Mars to explore alien worlds. I'm a speleologist  that means a cave explorer. And I started with this passion when I was really young in the mountains not far from my hometown in North Italy  in the karstic regions of the Alps and the Dolomites. But soon  the quest for exploration brought me to the farthest corner of the planet  searching for new potential entrances of this undiscovered continent. And in       I had the opportunity to visit the tepui table mountains  which are in the Orinoco and Amazon basins. These massifs enchanted me from the first time I saw them. They are surrounded by vertical  vertiginous rock walls with silvery waterfalls that are lost in the forest. They really inspired in me a sense of wilderness  with a soul older than millions and millions of years. And this dramatic landscape inspired among other things also Conan Doyle's  The Lost World  novel in     . And they are  really  a lost world. Scientists consider those mountains as islands in time  being separated from the surrounding lowlands since tens of millions of years ago. They are surrounded by up to       meter high walls  resembling a fortress  impregnable by humans. And  in fact  only a few of these mountains have been climbed and explored on their top. These mountains contain also a scientific paradox  They are made by quartz  which is a very common mineral on the earth's crust  and the rock made up by quartz is called quartzite  and quartzite is one of the hardest and least soluble minerals on earth. So we do not expect at all to find a cave there. Despite this  in the last    years  speleologists from Italy  Slovakia  Czech Republic  and  of course  Venezuela and Brazil  have explored several caves in this area. So how can it be possible  To understand this contradiction  we have to consider the time factor  because the history of the tepuis is extremely long  starting about  .  billion years ago with the formation of the rock  and then evolving with the uplift of the region     million years ago  after the disruption of the Pangaea supercontinent and the opening of the Atlantic Ocean. So you can imagine that the water had tens or even hundreds of millions of years to sculpt the strangest forms on the tepuis' surfaces  but also to open the fractures and form stone cities  rock cities  fields of towers which are characterized in the famous landscape of the tepuis. But nobody could have imagined what was happening inside a mountain in so long a time frame. And so I was focusing in      on one of those massifs  the Auy n tepui  which is very famous because it hosts Angel Falls  which is the highest waterfall in the world    about     meters of vertical drop. And I was searching for hints of the existence of cave systems through satellite images  and finally we identified an area of collapses of the surface    so  big boulders  rock piles    and that means that there was a void below. It was a clear indication that there was something inside the mountain. So we did several attempts to reach this area  by land and with a helicopter  but it was really difficult because    you have to imagine that these mountains are covered by clouds most of the year  by fog. There are strong winds  and there are almost       millimeters of rainfall per year  so it's really  really difficult to find good conditions. And only in      we finally landed on the spot and we started the exploration of the cave. The cave is huge. It's a huge network under the surface of the tepui plateau  and in only ten days of expedition  we explored more than    kilometers of cave passages. And it's a huge network of underground rivers  channels  big rooms  extremely deep shafts. So it's really an incredible place. And we named it Imawar  Yeuta. That means  in the Pem n indigenous language   The House of the Gods.  You have to imagine that indigenous people have never been there. It was impossible for them to reach this area. However  there were legends about the existence of a cave in the mountain. So when we started the exploration  we had to explore with a great respect  both because of the religious beliefs of the indigenous people  but also because it was really a sacred place  because no human had entered there before. So we had to use special protocols to not contaminate the environment with our presence  and we tried also to share with the community  with the indigenous community  our discoveries. And the caves represent  really  a snapshot of the past. The time needed for their formation could be as long as    or even     million years  which makes them possibly the oldest caves that we can explore on earth. What you can find there is really evidence of a lost world. When you enter a quartzite cave  you have to completely forget what you know about caves    classic limestone caves or the touristic caves that you can visit in several places in the world. Because what seems a simple stalactite here is not made by calcium carbonate  but is made by opal  and one of those stalactites can require tens of millions of years to be formed. But you can find even stranger forms  like these mushrooms of silica growing on a boulder. And you can imagine our talks when we were exploring the cave. We were the first entering and discovering those unknown things  things like those monster eggs. And we were a bit scared because it was all a discovery  and we didn't want to find a dinosaur. We didn't find a dinosaur. Anyway  actually  we know that this kind of formation  after several studies  we know that these kinds of formations are living organisms. They are bacterial colonies using silica to build mineral structures resembling stromatolites. Stromatolites are some of the oldest forms of life that we can find on earth. And here in the tepuis  the interesting thing is that these bacteria colonies have evolved in complete isolation from the external surface  and without being in contact with humans. They have never been in contact with humans. So the implications for science are enormous  because here you could find  for example  microbes that could be useful to resolve diseases in medicine  or you could find even a new kind of material with unknown properties. And  in fact  we discovered in the cave a new mineral structure for science  which is rossiantonite  a phosphate sulfate. So whatever you find in the cave  even a small cricket  has evolved in the dark in complete isolation. And  really  everything that you can feel in the cave are real connections between the biological and the mineralogical world. So as we explore this dark continent and discover its mineralogical and biological diversity and uniqueness  we will find probably clues about the origin of life on our planet and on the relationship and evolution of life in relationship with the mineral world. What seems only a dark  empty environment could be in reality a chest of wonders full of useful information. With a team of Italian  Venezuelan and Brazilian speleologists  which is called La Venta Teraphosa  we will be back soon to Latin America  because we want to explore other tepuis in the farthest areas of the Amazon. There are still very unknown mountains  like Marahuaca  which is almost       meters high above sea level  or Arac   which is in the upper region of Rio Negro in Brazil. And we suppose that we could find there even bigger cave systems  and each one with its own undiscovered world. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Thank you  Francesco. Give me that to start so we don't forget. Francesco  you said we don't need to go to Mars to find alien life  and indeed  last time we spoke  you were in Sardinia and you were training European astronauts. So what do you  a speleologist  tell and teach to the astronauts  Francesco Sauro  Yeah  we are    it's a program of training for not only European  but also NASA  Roskosmos  JAXA astronauts  in a cave. So they stay in a cave for about one week in isolation. They have to work together in a real  real dangerous environment  and it's a real alien environment for them because it's unusual. It's always dark. They have to do science. They have a lot of tasks. And it's very similar to a journey to Mars or the International Space Station. BG  In principle. FS  Yes. BG  I want to go back to one of the pictures that was in your slide show  and it's just representative of the other photos    Weren't those photos amazing  Yeah  Audience  Yeah  FS  I have to thank the photographers from the team La Venta  because all of those photos are from the photographers. BG  You bring  actually  photographers with you in the expedition. They're professionals  they're speleologists and photographers. But when I look at these pictures  I wonder  there is zero light down there  and yet they look incredibly well exposed. How do you take these pictures  How do your colleagues  the photographers  take these pictures  FS  Yeah. They are working in a darkroom  basically  so you can open the shutter of the camera and use the lights to paint the environment. BG  So you're basically    FS  Yes. You can even keep the shutter open for one minute and then paint the environment. The final result is what you want to achieve. BG  You spray the environment with light and that's what you get. Maybe we can try this at home someday  I don't know. BG  Francesco  grazie. FS  Grazie. I want to tell you three stories about the power of relationships to solve the deep and complex social problems of this century. You know  sometimes it seems like all these problems of poverty  inequality  ill health  unemployment  violence  addiction    they're right there in one person's life. So I want to tell you about someone like this that I know. I'm going to call her Ella. Ella lives in a British city on a run down estate. The shops are closed  the pub's gone  the playground's pretty desolate and never used  and inside Ella's house  the tension is palpable and the noise levels are deafening. The TV's on at full volume. One of her sons is fighting with one of her daughters. Another son  Ryan  is keeping up this constant stream of abuse from the kitchen  and the dogs are locked behind the bedroom door and straining. Ella is stuck. She has lived with crisis for    years. She knows nothing else  and she knows no way out. She's had a whole series of abusive partners  and  tragically  one of her children has been taken into care by social services. The three children that still live with her suffer from a whole range of problems  and none of them are in education. And Ella says to me that she is repeating the cycle of her own mother's life before her. But when I met Ella  there were    different services on offer for her and her family in the city where she lives     different services run out of    departments in one city  and Ella and her partners and her children were known to most of them. They think nothing of calling social services to try and mediate one of the many arguments that broke out. And the family home was visited on a regular basis by social workers  youth workers  a health officer  a housing officer  a home tutor and the local policemen. And the governments say that there are         families in Britain today like Ella's  struggling to break the cycle of economic  social and environmental deprivation. And they also say that managing this problem costs a quarter of a million pounds per family per year and yet nothing changes. None of these well meaning visitors are making a difference. This is a chart we made in the same city with another family like Ella's. This shows    years of intervention in that family's life. And just as with Ella  not one of these interventions is part of an overall plan. There's no end goal in sight. None of the interventions are dealing with the underlying issues. These are just containment measures  ways of managing a problem. One of the policemen says to me   Look  I just deliver the message and then I leave.  So  I've spent time living with families like Ella's in different parts of the world  because I want to know  what can we learn from places where our social institutions just aren't working  I want to know what it feels like to live in Ella's family. I want to know what's going on and what we can do differently. Well  the first thing I learned is that cost is a really slippery concept. Because when the government says that a family like Ella's costs a quarter of a million pounds a year to manage  what it really means is that this system costs a quarter of a million pounds a year. Because not one penny of this money actually touches Ella's family in a way that makes a difference. Instead  the system is just like this costly gyroscope that spins around the families  keeping them stuck at its heart  exactly where they are. And I also spent time with the frontline workers  and I learned that it is an impossible situation. So Tom  who is the social worker for Ella's    year old son Ryan  has to spend    percent of his time servicing the system  meetings with colleagues  filling out forms  more meetings with colleagues to discuss the forms  and maybe most shockingly  the    percent of the time he has to be with Ryan is spent getting data and information for the system. So he says to Ryan   How often have you been smoking  Have you been drinking  When did you go to school   And this kind of interaction rules out the possibility of a normal conversation. It rules out the possibility of what's needed to build a relationship between Tom and Ryan. When we made this chart  the frontline workers  the professionals    they stared at it absolutely amazed. It snaked around the walls of their offices. So many hours  so well meant  but ultimately so futile. And there was this moment of absolute breakdown  and then of clarity  we had to work in a different way. So in a really brave step  the leaders of the city where Ella lives agreed that we could start by reversing Ryan's ratio. So everyone who came into contact with Ella or a family like Ella's would spend    percent of their time working with the families and only    percent servicing the system. And even more radically  the families would lead and they would decide who was in a best position to help them. So Ella and another mother were asked to be part of an interview panel  to choose from amongst the existing professionals who would work with them. And many  many people wanted to join us  because you don't go into this kind of work to manage a system  you go in because you can and you want to make a difference. So Ella and the mother asked everybody who came through the door   What will you do when my son starts kicking me   And so the first person who comes in says   Well  I'll look around for the nearest exit and I will back out very slowly  and if the noise is still going on  I'll call my supervisor.  And the mothers go   You're the system. Get out of here   And then the next person who comes is a policeman  and he says   Well  I'll tackle your son to the ground and then I'm not sure what I'll do.  And the mothers say   Thank you.  So  they chose professionals who confessed they didn't necessarily have the answers  who said    well  they weren't going to talk in jargon. They showed their human qualities and convinced the mothers that they would stick with them through thick and thin  even though they wouldn't be soft with them. So these new teams and the families were then given a sliver of the former budget  but they could spend the money in any way they chose. And so one of the families went out for supper. They went to McDonald's and they sat down and they talked and they listened for the first time in a long time. Another family asked the team if they would help them do up their home. And one mother took the money and she used it as a float to start a social enterprise. And in a really short space of time  something new started to grow  a relationship between the team and the workers. And then some remarkable changes took place. Maybe it's not surprising that the journey for Ella has had some big steps backwards as well as forwards. But today  she's completed an IT training course  she has her first paid job  her children are back in school  and the neighbors  who previously just hoped this family would be moved anywhere except next door to them  are fine. They've made some new friendships. And all the same people have been involved in this transformation    same families  same workers. But the relationship between them has been supported to change. So I'm telling you about Ella because I think that relationships are the critical resource we have in solving some of these intractable problems. But today  our relationships are all but written off by our politics  our social policies  our welfare institutions. And I've learned that this really has to change. So what do I mean by relationships  I'm talking about the simple human bonds between us  a kind of authentic sense of connection  of belonging  the bonds that make us happy  that support us to change  to be brave like Ella and try something new. And  you know  it's no accident that those who run and work in the institutions that are supposed to support Ella and her family don't talk about relationships  because relationships are expressly designed out of a welfare model that was drawn up in Britain and exported around the world. The contemporaries of William Beveridge  who was the architect of the first welfare state and the author of the Beveridge Report  had little faith in what they called the average sensual or emotional man. Instead  they trusted this idea of the impersonal system and the bureaucrat who would be detached and work in this system. And the impact of Beveridge on the way the modern state sees social issues just can't be underestimated. The Beveridge Report sold over         copies in the first weeks of publication alone. People queued in the rain on a November night to get hold of a copy  and it was read across the country  across the colonies  across Europe  across the United States of America  and it had this huge impact on the way that welfare states were designed around the globe. The cultures  the bureaucracies  the institutions    they are global  and they've come to seem like common sense. They've become so ingrained in us  that actually we don't even see them anymore. And I think it's really important to say that in the   th century  they were remarkably successful  these institutions. They led to longer lifespans  the eradication of mass disease  mass housing  almost universal education. But at the same time  Beveridge sowed the seeds of today's challenges. So let me tell you a second story. What do you think today is a bigger killer than a lifetime of smoking  It's loneliness. According to government statistics  one person over       one in three    doesn't speak to or see another person in a week. One person in     that's         people  doesn't speak to anyone else in a month. And we're not the only people with this problem  this problem touches the whole of the Western world. And it's even more acute in countries like China  where a process of rapid urbanization  mass migration  has left older people alone in the villages. And so the services that Beveridge designed and exported    they can't address this kind of problem. Loneliness is like a collective relational challenge  and it can't be addressed by a traditional bureaucratic response. So some years ago  wanting to understand this problem  I started to work with a group of about    older people in South London  where I live. I went shopping  I played bingo  but mainly I was just observing and listening. I wanted to know what we could do differently. And if you ask them  people tell you they want two things. They want somebody to go up a ladder and change a light bulb  or to be there when they come out of hospital. They want on demand  practical support. And they want to have fun. They want to go out  do interesting things with like minded people  and make friends like we've all made friends at every stage of our lives. So we rented a phone line  hired a couple of handymen  and started a service we called  Circle.  And Circle offers its local membership a toll free       number that they can call on demand for any support. And people have called us for so many reasons. They've called because their pets are unwell  their DVD is broken  they've forgotten how to use their mobile phone  or maybe they are coming out of hospital and they want someone to be there. And Circle also offers a rich social calendar    knitting  darts  museum tours  hot air ballooning    you name it. But here's the interesting thing  the really deep change  over time  the friendships that have formed have begun to replace the practical offer. So let me tell you about Belinda. Belinda's a Circle member  and she was going into hospital for a hip operation  so she called her local Circle to say they wouldn't see her for a bit. And Damon  who runs the local Circle  calls her back and says   How can I help   And Belinda says   Oh no  I'm fine    Jocelyn is doing the shopping  Tony's doing the gardening  Melissa and Joe are going to come in and cook and chat.  So five Circle members had organized themselves to take care of Belinda. And Belinda's     although she says that she feels    inside  but she also says that she felt stuck and pretty down when she joined Circle. But the simple act of encouraging her to come along to that first event led to a process where natural friendships formed  friendships that today are replacing the need for expensive services. It's relationships that are making the difference. So I think that three factors have converged that enable us to put relationships at the heart and center of how we solve social problems today. Firstly  the nature of the problems    they've changed  and they require different solutions. Secondly  the cost  human as much as financial  of doing business as usual. And thirdly  technology. I've talked about the first two factors. It's technology that enables these approaches to scale and potentially now support thousands of people. So the technology we've used is really simple  it's made up of available things like databases  mobile phones. Circle has got this very simple system that underpins it  enables a small local team to support a membership of up to a thousand. And you can contrast this with a neighborhood organization of the     s  when this kind of scale just wasn't possible  neither was the quality or the longevity that the spine of technology can provide. So it's relationships underpinned by technology that can turn the Beveridge models on their heads. The Beveridge models are all about institutions with finite resources  anonymously managing access. In my work at the front line  I've seen again and again how up to    percent of resource is spent keeping people out. So professionals have to administer these increasingly complex forms of administration that are basically about stopping people accessing the service or managing the queue. And Circle  like the relational services that we and others have designed  inverts this logic. What it says is  the more people  the more relationships  the stronger the solution. So I want to tell you my third and final story  which is about unemployment. In Britain  as in most places in the world  our welfare states were primarily designed to get people into work  to educate them for this  and to keep them healthy. But here  too  the systems are failing. And so the response has been to try and make these old systems even more efficient and transactional    to speed up processing times  divide people into ever smaller categories  try and target services at them more efficiently    in other words  the very opposite of relational. But guess how most people find work today  Through word of mouth. It turns out that in Britain today  most new jobs are not advertised. So it's friends that tell you about a job  it's friends that recommend you for a job  and it's a rich and diverse social network that helps you find work. Maybe some of you here this evening are thinking   But I found my job through an advert   but if you think back  it was probably a friend that showed you the ad and then encouraged you to apply. But not surprisingly  people who perhaps most need this rich and diverse network are those who are most isolated from it. So knowing this  and also knowing about the costs and failure of current systems  we designed something new with relationships at its heart. We designed a service that encourages people to meet up  people in and out of work  to work together in structured ways and try new opportunities. And  well  it's very hard to compare the results of these new systems with the old transactional models  but it looks like  with our first       members  we outperformed existing services by a factor of three  at a fraction of the cost. And here  too  we've used technology  but not to network people in the way that a social platform would do. We've used it to bring people face to face and connect them with each other  building real relationships and supporting people to find work. At the end of his life  in       Beveridge wrote a third report. And in it he said he had made a dreadful mistake. He had left people and their communities out. And this omission  he said  led to seeing people  and people starting to see themselves  within the categories of the bureaucracies and the institutions. And human relationships were already withering. But unfortunately  this third report was much less read than Beveridge's earlier work. But today  we need to bring people and their communities back into the heart of the way we design new systems and new services  in an approach that I call  Relational Welfare.  We need to leave behind these old  transactional  unsuitable  outdated models  and we need to adopt instead the shared collective relational responses that can support a family like Ella's  that can address an issue like loneliness  that can support people into work and up the skills curve in a modern labor market  that can also address challenges of education  of health care systems  and so many more of those problems that are pressing on our societies. It is all about relationships. Relationships are the critical resource we have. Thank you. When I was a kid  my parents would tell me   You can make a mess  but you have to clean up after yourself.  So freedom came with responsibility. But my imagination would take me to all these wonderful places  where everything was possible. So I grew up in a bubble of innocence    or a bubble of ignorance  I should say  because adults would lie to us to protect us from the ugly truth. And growing up  I found out that adults make a mess  and they're not very good at cleaning up after themselves. Fast forward  I am an adult now  and I teach citizen science and invention at the Hong Kong Harbour School. And it doesn't take too long before my students walk on a beach and stumble upon piles of trash. So as good citizens  we clean up the beaches    and no  he is not drinking alcohol  and if he is  I did not give it to him. And so it's sad to say  but today more than    percent  of the oceans have plastic in them. It's a horrifying fact. And in past decades  we've been taking those big ships out and those big nets  and we collect those plastic bits that we look at under a microscope  and we sort them  and then we put this data onto a map. But that takes forever  it's very expensive  and so it's quite risky to take those big boats out. So with my students  ages six to     we've been dreaming of inventing a better way. So we've transformed our tiny Hong Kong classroom into a workshop. And so we started building this small workbench  with different heights  so even really short kids can participate. And let me tell you  kids with power tools are awesome and safe. Not really. And so  back to plastic. We collect this plastic and we grind it to the size we find it in the ocean  which is very small because it breaks down. And so this is how we work. I let the imaginations of my students run wild. And my job is to try to collect the best of each kid's idea and try to combine it into something that hopefully would work. And so we have agreed that instead of collecting plastic bits  we are going to collect only the data. So we're going to get an image of the plastic with a robot    so robots  kids get very excited. And the next thing we do    we do what we call  rapid prototyping.  We are so rapid at prototyping that the lunch is still in the lunchbox when we're hacking it. And we hack table lamps and webcams  into plumbing fixtures and we assemble that into a floating robot that will be slowly moving through water and through the plastic that we have there    and this is the image that we get in the robot. So we see the plastic pieces floating slowly through the sensor  and the computer on board will process this image  and measure the size of each particle  so we have a rough estimate of how much plastic there is in the water. So we documented this invention step by step on a website for inventors called Instructables  in the hope that somebody would make it even better. What was really cool about this project was that the students saw a local problem  and boom    they are trying to immediately address it.  I can investigate my local problem  But my students in Hong Kong are hyperconnected kids. And they watch the news  they watch the Internet  and they came across this image. This was a child  probably under     cleaning up an oil spill bare handed  in the Sundarbans  which is the world's largest mangrove forest in Bangladesh. So they were very shocked  because this is the water they drink  this is the water they bathe in  this is the water they fish in    this is the place where they live. And also you can see the water is brown  the mud is brown and oil is brown  so when everything is mixed up  it's really hard to see what's in the water. But  there's a technology that's rather simple  that's called spectrometry  that allows you see what's in the water. So we built a rough prototype of a spectrometer  and you can shine light through different substances that produce different spectrums  so that can help you identify what's in the water. So we packed this prototype of a sensor  and we shipped it to Bangladesh. So what was cool about this project was that beyond addressing a local problem  or looking at a local problem  my students used their empathy and their sense of being creative to help  remotely  other kids.  I can investigate a remote problem  So I was very compelled by doing the second experiments  and I wanted to take it even further    maybe addressing an even harder problem  and it's also closer to my heart. So I'm half Japanese and half French  and maybe you remember in      there was a massive earthquake in Japan. It was so violent that it triggered several giant waves    they are called tsunami    and those tsunami destroyed many cities on the eastern coast of Japan. More than        people died in an instant. Also  it damaged the nuclear power plant of Fukushima  the nuclear power plant just by the water. And today  I read the reports and an average of     tons are leaking from the nuclear power plant into the Pacific Ocean. And today the whole Pacific Ocean has traces of contamination of cesium    . If you go outside on the West Coast  you can measure Fukushima everywhere. But if you look at the map  it can look like most of the radioactivity has been washed away from the Japanese coast  and most of it is now    it looks like it's safe  it's blue. Well  reality is a bit more complicated than this. So I've been going to Fukushima every year since the accident  and I measure independently and with other scientists  on land  in the river    and this time we wanted to take the kids. So of course we didn't take the kids  the parents wouldn't allow that to happen. But every night we would report to  Mission Control     different masks they're wearing. It could look like they didn't take the work seriously  but they really did because they're going to have to live with radioactivity their whole life. And so what we did with them is that we'd discuss the data we collected that day  and talk about where we should be going next    strategy  itinerary  etc... And to do this  we built a very rough topographical map of the region around the nuclear power plant. And so we built the elevation map  we sprinkled pigments to represent real time data for radioactivity  and we sprayed water to simulate the rainfall. And with this we could see that the radioactive dust was washing from the top of the mountain into the river system  and leaking into the ocean. So it was a rough estimate. But with this in mind  we organized this expedition  which was the closest civilians have been to the nuclear power plant. We are sailing  .  kilometers away from the nuclear power plant  and with the help of the local fisherman  we are collecting sediment from the seabed with a custom sediment sampler we've invented and built. We pack the sediment into small bags  we then dispatch them to hundreds of small bags that we send to different universities  and we produce the map of the seabed radioactivity  especially in estuaries where the fish will reproduce  and I will hope that we will have improved the safety of the local fishermen and of your favorite sushi. You can see a progression here    we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem. And it's been super exciting to work at these different scales  with also very simple  open source technologies. But at the same time  it's been increasingly frustrating because we have only started to measure the damage that we have done. We haven't even started to try to solve the problems. And so I wonder if we should just take a leap and try to invent better ways to do all these things. And so the classroom started to feel a little bit small  so we found an industrial site in Hong Kong  and we turned it into the largest mega space focused on social and environmental impact. It's in central Hong Kong  and it's a place we can work with wood  metal  chemistry  a bit of biology  a bit of optics  basically you can build pretty much everything there. And its a place where adults and kids can play together. It's a place where kids' dreams can come true  with the help of adults  and where adults can be kids again. Student  Acceleration  Acceleration  Cesar Harada  We're asking questions such as  can we invent the future of mobility with renewable energy  For example. Or  can we help the mobility of the aging population by transforming very standard wheelchairs into cool  electric vehicles  So plastic  oil and radioactivity are horrible  horrible legacies  but the very worst legacy that we can leave our children is lies. We can no longer afford to shield the kids from the ugly truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions. So citizen scientists  makers  dreamers    we must prepare the next generation that cares about the environment and people  and that can actually do something about it. Thank you. Interpreter  Piano   p   is my favorite musical symbol. It means to play softly. If you're playing a musical instrument and you notice a  p  in the score  you need to play softer. Two p's    even softer. Four p's    extremely soft. This is my drawing of a p tree  which demonstrates no matter how many thousands upon thousands of p's there may be  you'll never reach complete silence. That's my current definition of silence  a very obscure sound. I'd like to share a little bit about the history of American Sign Language  ASL  plus a bit of my own background. French sign language was brought to America during the early     s  and as time went by  mixed with local signs  it evolved into the language we know today as ASL. So it has a history of about     years. I was born deaf  and I was taught to believe that sound wasn't a part of my life. And I believed it to be true. Yet  I realize now that that wasn't the case at all. Sound was very much a part of my life  really  on my mind every day. As a Deaf person living in a world of sound  it's as if I was living in a foreign country  blindly following its rules  customs  behaviors and norms without ever questioning them. So how is it that I understand sound  Well  I watch how people behave and respond to sound. You people are like my loudspeakers  and amplify sound. I learn and mirror that behavior. At the same time  I've learned that I create sound  and I've seen how people respond to me. Thus I've learned  for example ...  Don't slam the door    Don't make too much noise when you're eating from the potato chip bag    Don't burp  and when you're eating  make sure you don't scrape your utensils on the plate.  All of these things I term  sound etiquette.  Maybe I think about sound etiquette more than the average hearing person does. I'm hyper vigilant around sound. And I'm always waiting in eager nervous anticipation around sound  about what's to come next. Hence  this drawing. TBD  to be decided. TBC  to be continued. TBA  to be announced. And you notice the staff    there are no notes contained in the lines. That's because the lines already contain sound through the subtle smudges and smears. In Deaf culture  movement is equivalent to sound. This is a sign for  staff  in ASL. A typical staff contains five lines. Yet for me  signing it with my thumb sticking up like that doesn't feel natural. That's why you'll notice in my drawings  I stick to four lines on paper. In the year       I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin  Germany  for an artist residency there. Prior to this time  I had been working as a painter. During this summer  I visited different museums and gallery spaces  and as I went from one place to the next  I noticed there was no visual art there. At that time  sound was trending  and this struck me ... there was no visual art  everything was auditory. Now sound has come into my art territory. Is it going to further distance me from art  I realized that doesn't have to be the case at all. I actually know sound. I know it so well that it doesn't have to be something just experienced through the ears. It could be felt tactually  or experienced as a visual  or even as an idea. So I decided to reclaim ownership of sound and to put it into my art practice. And everything that I had been taught regarding sound  I decided to do away with and unlearn. I started creating a new body of work. And when I presented this to the art community  I was blown away with the amount of support and attention I received. I realized  sound is like money  power  control    social currency. In the back of my mind  I've always felt that sound was your thing  a hearing person's thing. And sound is so powerful that it could either disempower me and my artwork  or it could empower me. I chose to be empowered. There's a massive culture around spoken language. And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate  in society's eyes it's as if I don't have a voice at all. So I need to work with individuals who can support me as an equal and become my voice. And that way  I'm able to maintain relevancy in society today. So at school  at work and institutions  I work with many different ASL interpreters. And their voice becomes my voice and identity. They help me to be heard. And their voices hold value and currency. Ironically  by borrowing out their voices  I'm able to maintain a temporary form of currency  kind of like taking out a loan with a very high interest rate. If I didn't continue this practice  I feel that I could just fade off into oblivion and not maintain any form of social currency. So with sound as my new art medium  I delved into the world of music. And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and ASL. For example  a musical note cannot be fully captured and expressed on paper. And the same holds true for a concept in ASL. They're both highly spatial and highly inflected    meaning that subtle changes can affect the entire meaning of both signs and sounds. I'd like to share with you a piano metaphor  to have you have a better understanding of how ASL works. So  envision a piano. ASL is broken down into many different grammatical parameters. If you assign a different parameter to each finger as you play the piano    such as facial expression  body movement  speed  hand shape and so on  as you play the piano    English is a linear language  as if one key is being pressed at a time. However  ASL is more like a chord    all    fingers need to come down simultaneously to express a clear concept or idea in ASL. If just one of those keys were to change the chord  it would create a completely different meaning. The same applies to music in regards to pitch  tone and volume. In ASL  by playing around with these different grammatical parameters  you can express different ideas. For example  take the sign TO LOOK AT. This is the sign TO LOOK AT. I'm looking at you. Staring at you. Oh    busted. Uh oh. What are you looking at  Aw  stop. I then started thinking   What if I was to look at ASL through a musical lens   If I was to create a sign and repeat it over and over  it could become like a piece of visual music. For example  this is the sign for  day   as the sun rises and sets. This is  all day.  If I was to repeat it and slow it down  visually it looks like a piece of music. All ... day. I feel the same holds true for  all night.   All night.  This is ALL NIGHT  represented in this drawing. And this led me to thinking about three different kinds of nights   last night    overnight   I feel like the third one has a lot more musicality than the other two. This represents how time is expressed in ASL and how the distance from your body can express the changes in time. For example   H is one hand   H is two hand  present tense happens closest and in front of the body  future is in front of the body and the past is to your back. So  the first example is  a long time ago.  Then  past    used to  and the last one  which is my favorite  with the very romantic and dramatic notion to it   once upon a time.   Common time  is a musical term with a specific time signature of four beats per measure. Yet when I see the word  common time   what automatically comes to mind for me is  at the same time.  So notice RH  right hand  LH  left hand. We have the staff across the head and the chest.  Head  RH  Flash claw   Common time   Chest  LH  Flash claw  I'm now going to demonstrate a hand shape called the  flash claw.  Can you please follow along with me  Everybody  hands up. Now we're going to do it in both the head and the chest  kind of like  common time  or at the same time. Yes  got it. That means  to fall in love  in International  Sign . International  Sign   as a note  is a visual tool to help communicate across cultures and sign languages around the world. The second one I'd like to demonstrate is this    please follow along with me again. And now this. This is  colonization  in ASL. Now the third    please follow along again. And again. This is  enlightenment  in ASL. So let's do all three together.  Fall in love    colonization  and  enlightenment.  Good job  everyone. Notice how all three signs are very similar  they all happen at the head and the chest  but they convey quite different meanings. So it's amazing to see how ASL is alive and thriving  just like music is. However  in this day and age  we live in a very audio centric world. And just because ASL has no sound to it  it automatically holds no social currency. We need to start thinking harder about what defines social currency and allow ASL to develop its own form of currency    without sound. And this could possibly be a step to lead to a more inclusive society. And maybe people will understand that you don't need to be deaf to learn ASL  nor do you have to be hearing to learn music. ASL is such a rich treasure that I'd like you to have the same experience. And I'd like to invite you to open your ears  to open your eyes  take part in our culture and experience our visual language. And you never know  you might just fall in love with us. Thank you. Denise Kahler Braaten  Hey  that's me. A year ago  we were invited by the Swiss Embassy in Berlin to present our art projects. We are used to invitations  but this invitation really thrilled us. The Swiss Embassy in Berlin is special. It is the only old building in the government district that was not destroyed during the Second World War  and it sits right next to the Federal Chancellery. No one is closer to Chancellor Merkel than the Swiss diplomats. The government district in Berlin also contains the Reichstag    Germany's parliament    and the Brandenburg Gate  and right next to the gate there are other embassies  in particular the US and the British Embassy. Although Germany is an advanced democracy  citizens are limited in their constitutional rights in its government district. The right of assembly and the right to demonstrate are restricted there. And this is interesting from an artistic point of view. The opportunities to exercise participation and to express oneself are always bound to a certain order and always subject to a specific regulation. With an awareness of the dependencies of these regulations  we can gain a new perspective. The given terms and conditions shape our perception  our actions and our lives. And this is crucial in another context. Over the last couple of years  we learned that from the roofs of the US and the British Embassy  the secret services have been listening to the entire district  including the mobile phone of Angela Merkel. The antennas of the British GCHQ are hidden in a white cylindrical radome  while the listening post of the American NSA is covered by radio transparent screens. But how to address these hidden and disguised forces  With my colleague  Christoph Wachter  we accepted the invitation of the Swiss Embassy. And we used this opportunity to exploit the specific situation. If people are spying on us  it stands to reason that they have to listen to what we are saying. On the roof of the Swiss Embassy  we installed a series of antennas. They weren't as sophisticated as those used by the Americans and the British. They were makeshift can antennas  not camouflaged but totally obvious and visible. The Academy of Arts joined the project  and so we built another large antenna on their rooftop  exactly between the listening posts of the NSA and the GCHQ. Never have we been observed in such detail while building an art installation. A helicopter circled over our heads with a camera registering each and every move we made  and on the roof of the US Embassy  security officers patrolled. Although the government district is governed by a strict police order  there are no specific laws relating to digital communication. Our installation was therefore perfectly legal  and the Swiss Ambassador informed Chancellor Merkel about it. We named the project  Can You Hear Me   The antennas created an open and free Wi Fi communication network in which anyone who wanted to would be able to participate using any Wi Fi enabled device without any hindrance  and be able to send messages to those listening on the frequencies that were being intercepted. Text messages  voice chat  file sharing    anything could be sent anonymously. And people did communicate. Over        messages were sent. Here are some examples.  Hello world  hello Berlin  hello NSA  hello GCHQ.   NSA Agents  Do the Right Thing  Blow the whistle    This is the NSA. In God we trust. All others we track          nonymous is watching  NSA  GCHQ   we are part of your organizations.   expect us. We will  shutdown   This is the NSA's Achilles heel. Open Networks.   Agents  what twisted story of yourself will you tell your grandchildren     NSA My neighbors are noisy. Please send a drone strike.   Make Love  Not cyberwar.  We invited the embassies and the government departments to participate in the open network  too  and to our surprise  they did. Files appeared on the network  including classified documents leaked from the parliamentary investigation commission  which highlights that the free exchange and discussion of vital information is starting to become difficult  even for members of a parliament. We also organized guided tours to experience and sound out the power constellations on site. The tours visited the restricted zones around the embassies  and we discussed the potential and the highlights of communication. If we become aware of the constellation  the terms and conditions of communication  it not only broadens our horizon  it allows us to look behind the regulations that limit our worldview  our specific social  political or aesthetic conventions. Let's look at an actual example. The fate of people living in the makeshift settlements on the outskirts of Paris is hidden and faded from view. It's a vicious circle. It's not poverty  not racism  not exclusion that are new. What is new is how these realities are hidden and how people are made invisible in an age of global and overwhelming communication and exchange. Such makeshift settlements are considered illegal  and therefore those living in them don't have a chance of making their voices heard. On the contrary  every time they appear  every time they risk becoming visible  merely gives grounds for further persecution  expulsion and suppression. What interested us was how we could come to know this hidden side. We were searching for an interface and we found one. It's not a digital interface  but a physical one  it's a hotel. We named the project  Hotel Gelem.  Together with Roma families  we created several Hotel Gelems in Europe  for example  in Freiburg in Germany  in Montreuil near Paris  and also in the Balkans. These are real hotels. People can stay there. But they aren't a commercial enterprise. They are a symbol. You can go online and ask for a personal invitation to come and live for a few days in the Hotel Gelem  in their homes  eating  working and living with the Roma families. Here  the Roma families are not the travelers  the visitors are. Here  the Roma families are not a minority  the visitors are. The point is not to make judgments  but rather to find out about the context that determines these disparate and seemingly insurmountable contradictions. In the world of globalization  the continents are drifting closer to each other. Cultures  goods and people are in permanent exchange  but at the same time  the gap between the world of the privileged and the world of the excluded is growing. We were recently in Australia. For us  it was no problem to enter the country. We have European passports  visas and air tickets. But asylum seekers who arrive by boat in Australia are deported or taken to prison. The interception of the boats and the disappearance of the people into the detention system are veiled by the Australian authorities. These procedures are declared to be secret military operations. After dramatic escapes from crisis zones and war zones  men  women and children are detained by Australia without trial  sometimes for years. During our stay  however  we managed to reach out and work with asylum seekers who were imprisoned  despite strict screening and isolation. From these contexts was born an installation in the art space of the Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane. On the face of it  it was a very simple installation. On the floor  a stylized compass gave the direction to each immigration detention center  accompanied by the distance and the name of the immigration facility. But the exhibition step came in the form of connectivity. Above every floor marking  there was a headset. Visitors were offered the opportunity to talk directly to a refugee who was or had been imprisoned in a specific detention facility and engage in a personal conversation. In the protected context of the art exhibition  asylum seekers felt free to talk about themselves  their story and their situation  without fear of consequences. Visitors immersed themselves in long conversations about families torn apart  about dramatic escapes from war zones  about suicide attempts  about the fate of children in detention. Emotions ran deep. Many wept. Several revisited the exhibition. It was a powerful experience. Europe is now facing a stream of migrants. The situation for the asylum seekers is made worse by contradictory policies and the temptation of militarized responses. We have also established communication systems in remote refugee centers in Switzerland and Greece. They are all about providing basic information    medical costs  legal information  guidance. But they are significant. Information on the Internet that could ensure survival along dangerous routes is being censored  and the provision of such information is becoming increasingly criminalized. This brings us back to our network and to the antennas on the roof of the Swiss Embassy in Berlin and the  Can You Hear Me   project. We should not take it for granted to be boundlessly connected. We should start making our own connections  fighting for this idea of an equal and globally interconnected world. This is essential to overcome our speechlessness and the separation provoked by rival political forces. It is only in truly exposing ourselves to the transformative power of this experience that we can overcome prejudice and exclusion. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Thank you  Mathias. The other half of your artistic duo is also here. Christoph Wachter  come onstage. First  tell me just a detail  the name of the hotel is not a random name. Gelem means something specific in the Roma language. Mathias Jud  Yes   Gelem  Gelem  is the title of the Romani hymn  the official  and it means  I went a long way.  BG  That's just to add the detail to your talk. But you two traveled to the island of Lesbos very recently  you're just back a couple of days ago  in Greece  where thousands of refugees are arriving and have been arriving over the last few months. What did you see there and what did you do there  Christoph Wachter  Well  Lesbos is one of the Greek islands close to Turkey  and during our stay  many asylum seekers arrived by boat on overcrowded dinghies  and after landing  they were left completely on their own. They are denied many services. For example  they are not allowed to buy a bus ticket or to rent a hotel room  so many families literally sleep in the streets. And we installed networks there to allow basic communication  because I think  I believe  it's not only that we have to speak about the refugees  I think we need to start talking to them. And by doing so  we can realize that it is about human beings  about their lives and their struggle to survive. BG  And allow them to talk as well. Christoph  thank you for coming to TED. Mathias  thank you for coming to TED and sharing your story. A few years ago  I broke into my own house. I had just driven home  it was around midnight in the dead of Montreal winter  I had been visiting my friend  Jeff  across town  and the thermometer on the front porch read minus    degrees    and don't bother asking if that's Celsius or Fahrenheit  minus    is where the two scales meet    it was very cold. And as I stood on the front porch fumbling in my pockets  I found I didn't have my keys. In fact  I could see them through the window  lying on the dining room table where I had left them. So I quickly ran around and tried all the other doors and windows  and they were locked tight. I thought about calling a locksmith    at least I had my cellphone  but at midnight  it could take a while for a locksmith to show up  and it was cold. I couldn't go back to my friend Jeff's house for the night because I had an early flight to Europe the next morning  and I needed to get my passport and my suitcase. So  desperate and freezing cold  I found a large rock and I broke through the basement window  cleared out the shards of glass  I crawled through  I found a piece of cardboard and taped it up over the opening  figuring that in the morning  on the way to the airport  I could call my contractor and ask him to fix it. This was going to be expensive  but probably no more expensive than a middle of the night locksmith  so I figured  under the circumstances  I was coming out even. Now  I'm a neuroscientist by training and I know a little bit about how the brain performs under stress. It releases cortisol that raises your heart rate  it modulates adrenaline levels and it clouds your thinking. So the next morning  when I woke up on too little sleep  worrying about the hole in the window  and a mental note that I had to call my contractor  and the freezing temperatures  and the meetings I had upcoming in Europe  and  you know  with all the cortisol in my brain  my thinking was cloudy  but I didn't know it was cloudy because my thinking was cloudy. And it wasn't until I got to the airport check in counter  that I realized I didn't have my passport. So I raced home in the snow and ice     minutes  got my passport  raced back to the airport  I made it just in time  but they had given away my seat to someone else  so I got stuck in the back of the plane  next to the bathrooms  in a seat that wouldn't recline  on an eight hour flight. Well  I had a lot of time to think during those eight hours and no sleep. And I started wondering  are there things that I can do  systems that I can put into place  that will prevent bad things from happening  Or at least if bad things happen  will minimize the likelihood of it being a total catastrophe. So I started thinking about that  but my thoughts didn't crystallize until about a month later. I was having dinner with my colleague  Danny Kahneman  the Nobel Prize winner  and I somewhat embarrassedly told him about having broken my window  and  you know  forgotten my passport  and Danny shared with me that he'd been practicing something called prospective hindsight. It's something that he had gotten from the psychologist Gary Klein  who had written about it a few years before  also called the pre mortem. Now  you all know what the postmortem is. Whenever there's a disaster  a team of experts come in and they try to figure out what went wrong  right  Well  in the pre mortem  Danny explained  you look ahead and you try to figure out all the things that could go wrong  and then you try to figure out what you can do to prevent those things from happening  or to minimize the damage. So what I want to talk to you about today are some of the things we can do in the form of a pre mortem. Some of them are obvious  some of them are not so obvious. I'll start with the obvious ones. Around the home  designate a place for things that are easily lost. Now  this sounds like common sense  and it is  but there's a lot of science to back this up  based on the way our spatial memory works. There's a structure in the brain called the hippocampus  that evolved over tens of thousands of years  to keep track of the locations of important things    where the well is  where fish can be found  that stand of fruit trees  where the friendly and enemy tribes live. The hippocampus is the part of the brain that in London taxicab drivers becomes enlarged. It's the part of the brain that allows squirrels to find their nuts. And if you're wondering  somebody actually did the experiment where they cut off the olfactory sense of the squirrels  and they could still find their nuts. They weren't using smell  they were using the hippocampus  this exquisitely evolved mechanism in the brain for finding things. But it's really good for things that don't move around much  not so good for things that move around. So this is why we lose car keys and reading glasses and passports. So in the home  designate a spot for your keys    a hook by the door  maybe a decorative bowl. For your passport  a particular drawer. For your reading glasses  a particular table. If you designate a spot and you're scrupulous about it  your things will always be there when you look for them. What about travel  Take a cell phone picture of your credit cards  your driver's license  your passport  mail it to yourself so it's in the cloud. If these things are lost or stolen  you can facilitate replacement. Now these are some rather obvious things. Remember  when you're under stress  the brain releases cortisol. Cortisol is toxic  and it causes cloudy thinking. So part of the practice of the pre mortem is to recognize that under stress you're not going to be at your best  and you should put systems in place. And there's perhaps no more stressful a situation than when you're confronted with a medical decision to make. And at some point  all of us are going to be in that position  where we have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or that of a loved one  to help them with a decision. And so I want to talk about that. And I'm going to talk about a very particular medical condition. But this stands as a proxy for all kinds of medical decision making  and indeed for financial decision making  and social decision making    any kind of decision you have to make that would benefit from a rational assessment of the facts. So suppose you go to your doctor and the doctor says   I just got your lab work back  your cholesterol's a little high.  Now  you all know that high cholesterol is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease  heart attack  stroke. And so you're thinking having high cholesterol isn't the best thing  and so the doctor says   You know  I'd like to give you a drug that will help you lower your cholesterol  a statin.  And you've probably heard of statins  you know that they're among the most widely prescribed drugs in the world today  you probably even know people who take them. And so you're thinking   Yeah  Give me the statin.  But there's a question you should ask at this point  a statistic you should ask for that most doctors don't like talking about  and pharmaceutical companies like talking about even less. It's for the number needed to treat. Now  what is this  the NNT  It's the number of people that need to take a drug or undergo a surgery or any medical procedure before one person is helped. And you're thinking  what kind of crazy statistic is that  The number should be one. My doctor wouldn't prescribe something to me if it's not going to help. But actually  medical practice doesn't work that way. And it's not the doctor's fault  if it's anybody's fault  it's the fault of scientists like me. We haven't figured out the underlying mechanisms well enough. But GlaxoSmithKline estimates that    percent of the drugs work in only    to    percent of the people. So the number needed to treat for the most widely prescribed statin  what do you suppose it is  How many people have to take it before one person is helped     . This is according to research by research practitioners Jerome Groopman and Pamela Hartzband  independently confirmed by Bloomberg.com. I ran through the numbers myself.     people have to take the drug for a year before one heart attack  stroke or other adverse event is prevented. Now you're probably thinking   Well  OK  one in     chance of lowering my cholesterol. Why not  doc  Give me the prescription anyway.  But you should ask at this point for another statistic  and that is   Tell me about the side effects.  Right  So for this particular drug  the side effects occur in five percent of the patients. And they include terrible things    debilitating muscle and joint pain  gastrointestinal distress    but now you're thinking   Five percent  not very likely it's going to happen to me  I'll still take the drug.  But wait a minute. Remember under stress you're not thinking clearly. So think about how you're going to work through this ahead of time  so you don't have to manufacture the chain of reasoning on the spot.     people take the drug  right  One person's helped  five percent of those     have side effects  that's    people. You're    times more likely to be harmed by the drug than you are to be helped by the drug. Now  I'm not saying whether you should take the statin or not. I'm just saying you should have this conversation with your doctor. Medical ethics requires it  it's part of the principle of informed consent. You have the right to have access to this kind of information to begin the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not. Now you might be thinking I've pulled this number out of the air for shock value  but in fact it's rather typical  this number needed to treat. For the most widely performed surgery on men over the age of     removal of the prostate for cancer  the number needed to treat is   . That's right     surgeries are done for every one person who's helped. And the side effects in that case occur in    percent of the patients. They include impotence  erectile dysfunction  urinary incontinence  rectal tearing  fecal incontinence. And if you're lucky  and you're one of the    percent who has these  they'll only last for a year or two. So the idea of the pre mortem is to think ahead of time to the questions that you might be able to ask that will push the conversation forward. You don't want to have to manufacture all of this on the spot. And you also want to think about things like quality of life. Because you have a choice oftentimes  do you I want a shorter life that's pain free  or a longer life that might have a great deal of pain towards the end  These are things to talk about and think about now  with your family and your loved ones. You might change your mind in the heat of the moment  but at least you're practiced with this kind of thinking. Remember  our brain under stress releases cortisol  and one of the things that happens at that moment is a whole bunch on systems shut down. There's an evolutionary reason for this. Face to face with a predator  you don't need your digestive system  or your libido  or your immune system  because if you're body is expending metabolism on those things and you don't react quickly  you might become the lion's lunch  and then none of those things matter. Unfortunately  one of the things that goes out the window during those times of stress is rational  logical thinking  as Danny Kahneman and his colleagues have shown. So we need to train ourselves to think ahead to these kinds of situations. I think the important point here is recognizing that all of us are flawed. We all are going to fail now and then. The idea is to think ahead to what those failures might be  to put systems in place that will help minimize the damage  or to prevent the bad things from happening in the first place. Getting back to that snowy night in Montreal  when I got back from my trip  I had my contractor install a combination lock next to the door  with a key to the front door in it  an easy to remember combination. And I have to admit  I still have piles of mail that haven't been sorted  and piles of emails that I haven't gone through. So I'm not completely organized  but I see organization as a gradual process  and I'm getting there. Thank you very much.
