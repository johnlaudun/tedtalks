A few years ago  my mom developed rheumatoid arthritis. Her wrists  knees and toes swelled up  causing crippling  chronic pain. She had to file for disability. She stopped attending our local mosque. Some mornings it was too painful for her to brush her teeth. I wanted to help. But I didn't know how. I'm not a doctor. So  what I am is a historian of medicine. So I started to research the history of chronic pain. Turns out  UCLA has an entire history of pain collection in their archives. And I found a story    a fantastic story    of a man who saved    rescued    millions of people from pain  people like my mom. Yet  I had never heard of him. There were no biographies of him  no Hollywood movies. His name was John J. Bonica. But when our story begins  he was better known as Johnny  Bull  Walker. It was a summer day in     . The circus had just arrived in the tiny town of Brookfield  New York. Spectators flocked to see the wire walkers  the tramp clowns    if they were lucky  the human cannonball. They also came to see the strongman  Johnny  Bull  Walker  a brawny bully who'd pin you for a dollar. You know  on that particular day  a voice rang out over the circus P.A. system. They needed a doctor urgently  in the live animal tent. Something had gone wrong with the lion tamer. The climax of his act had gone wrong  and his head was stuck inside the lion's mouth. He was running out of air  the crowd watched in horror as he struggled and then passed out. When the lion finally did relax its jaws  the lion tamer just slumped to the ground  motionless. When he came to a few minutes later  he saw a familiar figure hunched over him. It was Bull Walker. The strongman had given the lion tamer mouth to mouth  and saved his life. Now  the strongman hadn't told anyone  but he was actually a third year medical student. He toured with the circus during summers to pay tuition  but kept it a secret to protect his persona. He was supposed to be a brute  a villain    not a nerdy do gooder. His medical colleagues didn't know his secret  either. As he put it   If you were an athlete  you were a dumb dodo.  So he didn't tell them about the circus  or about how he wrestled professionally on evenings and weekends. He used a pseudonym like Bull Walker  or later  the Masked Marvel. He even kept it a secret that same year  when he was crowned the Light Heavyweight Champion of the world. Over the years  John J. Bonica lived these parallel lives. He was a wrestler  he was a doctor. He was a heel  he was a hero. He inflicted pain  and he treated it. And he didn t know it at the time  but over the next five decades  he'd draw on these dueling identities to forge a whole new way to think about pain. It'd change modern medicine so much so  that decades later  Time magazine would call him pain relief's founding father. But that all happened later. In       Bonica graduated medical school and married Emma  his sweetheart  whom he had met at one of his matches years before. He still wrestled in secret    he had to. His internship at New York's St. Vincent's Hospital paid nothing. With his championship belt  he wrestled in big ticket venues  like Madison Square Garden  against big time opponents  like Everett  The Blonde Bear  Marshall  or three time world champion  Angelo Savoldi. The matches took a toll on his body  he tore hip joints  fractured ribs. One night  The Terrible Turk's big toe scratched a scar like Capone's down the side of his face. The next morning at work  he had to wear a surgical mask to hide it. Twice Bonica showed up to the O.R. with one eye so bruised  he couldn't see out of it. But worst of all were his mangled cauliflower ears. He said they felt like two baseballs on the sides of his head. Pain just kept accumulating in his life. Next  he watched his wife go into labor at his hospital. She heaved and pushed  clearly in anguish. Her obstetrician called out to the intern on duty to give her a few drops of ether to ease her pain. But the intern was a young guy  just three weeks on the job    he was jittery  and in applying the ether  irritated Emma's throat. She vomited and choked  and started to turn blue. Bonica  who was watching all this  pushed the intern out of the way  cleared her airway  and saved his wife and his unborn daughter. At that moment  he decided to devote his life to anesthesiology. Later  he'd even go on to help develop the epidural  for delivering mothers. But before he could focus on obstetrics  Bonica had to report for basic training. Right around D Day  Bonica showed up to Madigan Army Medical Center  near Tacoma. At       beds  it was one of the largest army hospitals in America. Bonica was in charge of all pain control there. He was only   . Treating so many patients  Bonica started noticing cases that contradicted everything he had learned. Pain was supposed to be a kind of alarm bell    in a good way    a body's way of signaling an injury  like a broken arm. But in some cases  like after a patient had a leg amputated  that patient might still complain of pain in that nonexistent leg. But if the injury had been treated  why would the alarm bell keep ringing  There were other cases in which there was no evidence of an injury whatsoever  and yet  still the patient hurt. Bonica tracked down all the specialists at his hospital    surgeons  neurologists  psychiatrists  others. And he tried to get their opinions on his patients. It took too long  so he started organizing group meetings over lunch. It would be like a tag team of specialists going up against the patient's pain. No one had ever focused on pain this way before. After that  he hit the books. He read every medical textbook he could get his hands on  carefully noting every mention of the word  pain.  Out of the        pages he read  the word  pain  was on    and a half of them. Seventeen and a half. For the most basic  most common  most frustrating part of being a patient. Bonica was shocked    I'm quoting him  he said   What the hell kind of conclusion can you come to there  The most important thing from the patient's perspective  they don't talk about.  So over the next eight years  Bonica would talk about it. He'd write about it  he'd write those missing pages. He wrote what would later be known as the Bible of Pain. In it he proposed new strategies  new treatments using nerve block injections. He proposed a new institution  the Pain Clinic  based on those lunchtime meetings. But the most important thing about his book was that it was kind of an emotional alarm bell for medicine. A desperate plea to doctors to take pain seriously in patients' lives. He recast the very purpose of medicine. The goal wasn't to make patients better  it was to make patients feel better. He pushed his pain agenda for decades  before it finally took hold in the mid '  s. Hundreds of pain clinics sprung up all over the world. But as they did    a tragic twist. Bonica's years of wrestling caught up to him. He had been out of the ring for over    years  but those       professional bouts had left a mark on his body. Still in his mid   s  he suffered severe osteoarthritis. Over the next    years he'd have    surgeries  including four spine operations  and hip replacement after hip replacement. He could barely raise his arm  turn his neck. He needed aluminum crutches to walk. His friends and former students became his doctors. One recalled that he probably had more nerve block injections than anyone else on the planet. Already a workaholic  he worked even more        to    hour days. Healing others became more than just his job  it was his own most effective form of relief.  If I wasn't as busy as I am   he told a reporter at the time   I would be a completely disabled guy.  On a business trip to Florida in the early     s  Bonica got a former student to drive him to the Hyde Park area in Tampa. They drove past palm trees and pulled up to an old mansion  with giant silver howitzer cannons hidden in the garage. The house belonged to the Zacchini family  who were something like American circus royalty. Decades earlier  Bonica had watched them  clad in silver jumpsuits and goggles  doing the act they pioneered    the Human Cannonball. But now they were like him  retired. That generation is all dead now  including Bonica  so there's no way to know exactly what they said that day. But still  I love imagining it. The strongman and the human cannonballs reunited  showing off old scars  and new ones. Maybe Bonica gave them medical advice. Maybe he told them what he later said in an oral history  which is that his time in the circus and wrestling deeply molded his life. Bonica saw pain close up. He felt it. He lived it. And it made it impossible for him to ignore in others. Out of that empathy  he spun a whole new field  played a major role in getting medicine to acknowledge pain in and of itself. In that same oral history  Bonica claimed that pain is the most complex human experience. That it involves your past life  your current life  your interactions  your family. That was definitely true for Bonica. But it was also true for my mom. It's easy for doctors to see my mom as a kind of professional patient  a woman who just spends her days in waiting rooms. Sometimes I get stuck seeing her that same way. But as I saw Bonica's pain    a testament to his fully lived life    I started to remember all the things that my mom's pain holds. Before they got swollen and arthritic  my mom's fingers clacked away in the hospital H.R. department where she worked. They folded samosas for our entire mosque. When I was a kid  they cut my hair  wiped my nose  tied my shoes. Thank you. Every group of female friends has the funny one  the one you go to when you need a good cry  the one who tells you to suck it up when you've had a hard day. And this group was no different. Except that this was a community of groundbreaking women who came together    first to become teammates  then friends  and then family    in the least likely of places  on the Special Operations battlefield. This was a group of women whose friendship and valor was cemented not only by what they had seen and done at the tip of the spear  but by the fact that they were there at a time when women    officially  at least    remained banned from ground combat  and America had no idea they existed. This story begins with Special Operations leaders  some of the most tested men in the United States military  saying   We need women to help us wage this war.   America would never kill its way to the end of its wars   it argued.  Needed more knowledge and more understanding.  And as everyone knows  if you want to understand what's happening in a community and in a home  you talk to women  whether you're talking about Southern Afghanistan  or Southern California. But in this case  men could not talk to women  because in a conservative and traditional society like Afghanistan  that would cause grave offense. So you needed women soldiers out there. That meant  at this time in the war  that the women who would be recruited to serve alongside Army Rangers and Navy SEALs  would be seeing the kind of combat experienced by less than five percent of the entire United States military. Less than five percent. So the call went out.  Female soldiers  Become a part of history. Join Special Operations on the battlefield in Afghanistan.  This is in     . And from Alabama to Alaska  a group of women who had always wanted to do something that mattered alongside the best of the best  and to make a difference for their country  answered that call to serve. And for them it was not about politics  it was about serving with purpose. And so  the women who came to North Carolina to compete for a spot on these teams which would put women on the Special Operations front lines  landed and found very quickly a community  the likes of which they had never seen. Full of women who were as fierce and as fit as they were  and as driven to make a difference. They didn't have to apologize for who they were  and in fact  they could celebrate it. And what they found when they were there was that all of a sudden  there were lots of people like them. As one of them said   It was like you looked around and realized there was more than one giraffe at the zoo.  Among this team of standouts was Cassie  a young woman who managed to be an ROTC cadet  a sorority sister and a Women's Studies minor  all in one person. Tristan  a West Point track star  who always ran and road marched with no socks  and had shoes whose smell proved it. Amber  a Heidi look alike  who had always wanted to be in the infantry  and when she found out that women couldn't be  she decided to become an intel officer. She served in Bosnia  and later helped the FBI to bust drug gangs in Pennsylvania. And then there was Kate  who played high school football all four years  and actually wanted to drop out after the first  to go into the glee club  but when boys told her that girls couldn't play football  she decided to stay for all the little girls who would come after her. For them  biology had shaped part of their destiny  and put  as Cassie once said   everything noble out of reach for girls.  And yet  here was a chance to serve with the best of the best on a mission that mattered to their country  not despite the fact that they were female  but because of it. This team of women  in many ways  was like women everywhere. They wore makeup  and in fact  they would bond in the ladies' room over eyeliner and eye pencil. They also wore body armor. They would put    pounds of weight on their backs  and board the helicopter for an operation  and they would come back and watch a movie called  Bridesmaids.  They even wore a thing called Spanx  because  as they found very quickly  the uniforms made for men were big where they should be small  and small where they should be big. So Lane  an Iraq War veteran    you see her here on my left    decided she was going to go on Amazon and order a pair of Spanx to her base  so that her pants would fit better when she went out on mission each night. These women would get together over video conference from all around Afghanistan from their various bases  and they would talk about what it was like to be one of the only women doing what they were doing. They would swap jokes  they would talk about what was working  what wasn't  what they had learned to do well  what they needed to do better. And they would talk about some of the lighter moments of being women out on the Special Operations front lines  including the Shewee  which was a tool that let you pee like a guy  although it's said to have had only a    percent accuracy rate out there. These women lived in the  and.  They proved you could be fierce and you could be feminine. You could wear mascara and body armor. You could love CrossFit  and really like cross stitch. You could love to climb out of helicopters and you could also love to bake cookies. Women live in the and every single day  and these women brought that to this mission as well. On this life and death battlefield they never forgot that being female may have brought them to the front lines  but being a soldier is what would prove themselves there. There was the night Amber went out on mission  and in talking to the women of the house  realized that there was a barricaded shooter lying in wait for the Afghan and American forces who were waiting to enter the home. Another night it was Tristan who found out that there were pieces that make up explosives all around the house in which they were standing  and that in fact  explosives lay all the way between there and where they were about to head that night. There was the night another one of their teammates proved herself to a decidedly skeptical team of SEALs  when she found the intel item they were looking for wrapped up in a baby's wet diaper. And there was the night that Isabel  another one of their teammates  found the things that they were looking for  and received an Impact Award from the Rangers who said that without her  the things and the people they were looking for that night would never have been found. That night and so many others  they went out to prove themselves  not only for one another  but for everybody who would come after them. And also for the men alongside whom they served. We talk a lot about how behind every great man is a good woman. And in this case  next to these women stood men who wanted to see them succeed. The Army Ranger who trained them had served    deployments. And when they told him that he had to go train girls  he had no idea what to expect. But at the end of eight days with these women in the summer of       he told his fellow Ranger   We have just witnessed history. These may well be our own Tuskegee Airmen.  At the heart of this team was the one person who everyone called  the best of us.  She was a petite blonde dynamo  who barely reached five foot three. And she was this wild mix of Martha Stewart  and what we know as G.I. Jane. She was someone who loved to make dinner for her husband  her Kent State ROTC sweetheart who pushed her to be her best  and to trust herself  and to test every limit she could. She also loved to put    pounds of weight on her back and run for miles  and she loved to be a soldier. She was somebody who had a bread maker in her office in Kandahar  and would bake a batch of raisin bread  and then go to the gym and bust out    or    pull ups from a dead hang. She was the person who  if you needed an extra pair of boots or a home cooked dinner  would be on your speed dial. Because she never  ever would talk to you about how good she was  but let her character speak through action. She was famous for taking the hard right over the easy wrong. And she was also famous for walking up to a    foot rope  climbing it using only her arms  and then shuffling away and apologizing  because she knew she was supposed to use both her arms and her legs  as the Rangers had trained them. Some of our heroes return home to tell their stories. And some of them don't. And on October           First Lieutenant Ashley White was killed alongside two Rangers  Christopher Horns and Kristoffer Domeij. Her death threw this program built for the shadows into a very public spotlight. Because after all  the ban on women in combat was still very much in place. And at her funeral  the head of Army Special Operations came  and gave a public testimony not just to the courage of Ashley White  but to all her team of sisters.  Make no mistake about it   he said   these women are warriors  and they have written a new chapter in what it means to be a female in the United States Army.  Ashley's mom is a teacher's aide and a school bus driver  who bakes cookies on the side. She doesn't remember much about that overwhelming set of days  in which grief    enormous grief    mixed with pride. But she does remember one moment. A stranger with a child in her hand came up to her and she said   Mrs. White  I brought my daughter here today  because I wanted her to know what a hero was. And I wanted her to know that heroes could be women  too.  It is time to celebrate all the unsung heroines who reach into their guts and find the heart and the grit to keep going and to test every limit. This very unlikely band of sisters bound forever in life and afterward did indeed become part of history  and they paved the way for so many who would come after them  as much as they stood on the shoulders of those who had come before. These women showed that warriors come in all shapes and sizes. And women can be heroes  too. Thank you so much. My colleagues and I are fascinated by the science of moving dots. So what are these dots  Well  it's all of us. And we're moving in our homes  in our offices  as we shop and travel throughout our cities and around the world. And wouldn't it be great if we could understand all this movement  If we could find patterns and meaning and insight in it. And luckily for us  we live in a time where we're incredibly good at capturing information about ourselves. So whether it's through sensors or videos  or apps  we can track our movement with incredibly fine detail. So it turns out one of the places where we have the best data about movement is sports. So whether it's basketball or baseball  or football or the other football  we're instrumenting our stadiums and our players to track their movements every fraction of a second. So what we're doing is turning our athletes into    you probably guessed it    moving dots. So we've got mountains of moving dots and like most raw data  it's hard to deal with and not that interesting. But there are things that  for example  basketball coaches want to know. And the problem is they can't know them because they'd have to watch every second of every game  remember it and process it. And a person can't do that  but a machine can. The problem is a machine can't see the game with the eye of a coach. At least they couldn't until now. So what have we taught the machine to see  So  we started simply. We taught it things like passes  shots and rebounds. Things that most casual fans would know. And then we moved on to things slightly more complicated. Events like post ups  and pick and rolls  and isolations. And if you don't know them  that's okay. Most casual players probably do. Now  we've gotten to a point where today  the machine understands complex events like down screens and wide pins. Basically things only professionals know. So we have taught a machine to see with the eyes of a coach. So how have we been able to do this  If I asked a coach to describe something like a pick and roll  they would give me a description  and if I encoded that as an algorithm  it would be terrible. The pick and roll happens to be this dance in basketball between four players  two on offense and two on defense. And here's kind of how it goes. So there's the guy on offense without the ball the ball and he goes next to the guy guarding the guy with the ball  and he kind of stays there and they both move and stuff happens  and ta da  it's a pick and roll. So that is also an example of a terrible algorithm. So  if the player who's the interferer    he's called the screener    goes close by  but he doesn't stop  it's probably not a pick and roll. Or if he does stop  but he doesn't stop close enough  it's probably not a pick and roll. Or  if he does go close by and he does stop but they do it under the basket  it's probably not a pick and roll. Or I could be wrong  they could all be pick and rolls. It really depends on the exact timing  the distances  the locations  and that's what makes it hard. So  luckily  with machine learning  we can go beyond our own ability to describe the things we know. So how does this work  Well  it's by example. So we go to the machine and say   Good morning  machine. Here are some pick and rolls  and here are some things that are not. Please find a way to tell the difference.  And the key to all of this is to find features that enable it to separate. So if I was going to teach it the difference between an apple and orange  I might say   Why don't you use color or shape   And the problem that we're solving is  what are those things  What are the key features that let a computer navigate the world of moving dots  So figuring out all these relationships with relative and absolute location  distance  timing  velocities    that's really the key to the science of moving dots  or as we like to call it  spatiotemporal pattern recognition  in academic vernacular. Because the first thing is  you have to make it sound hard    because it is. The key thing is  for NBA coaches  it's not that they want to know whether a pick and roll happened or not. It's that they want to know how it happened. And why is it so important to them  So here's a little insight. It turns out in modern basketball  this pick and roll is perhaps the most important play. And knowing how to run it  and knowing how to defend it  is basically a key to winning and losing most games. So it turns out that this dance has a great many variations and identifying the variations is really the thing that matters  and that's why we need this to be really  really good. So  here's an example. There are two offensive and two defensive players  getting ready to do the pick and roll dance. So the guy with ball can either take  or he can reject. His teammate can either roll or pop. The guy guarding the ball can either go over or under. His teammate can either show or play up to touch  or play soft and together they can either switch or blitz and I didn't know most of these things when I started and it would be lovely if everybody moved according to those arrows. It would make our lives a lot easier  but it turns out movement is very messy. People wiggle a lot and getting these variations identified with very high accuracy  both in precision and recall  is tough because that's what it takes to get a professional coach to believe in you. And despite all the difficulties with the right spatiotemporal features we have been able to do that. Coaches trust our ability of our machine to identify these variations. We're at the point where almost every single contender for an NBA championship this year is using our software  which is built on a machine that understands the moving dots of basketball. So not only that  we have given advice that has changed strategies that have helped teams win very important games  and it's very exciting because you have coaches who've been in the league for    years that are willing to take advice from a machine. And it's very exciting  it's much more than the pick and roll. Our computer started out with simple things and learned more and more complex things and now it knows so many things. Frankly  I don't understand much of what it does  and while it's not that special to be smarter than me  we were wondering  can a machine know more than a coach  Can it know more than person could know  And it turns out the answer is yes. The coaches want players to take good shots. So if I'm standing near the basket and there's nobody near me  it's a good shot. If I'm standing far away surrounded by defenders  that's generally a bad shot. But we never knew how good  good  was  or how bad  bad  was quantitatively. Until now. So what we can do  again  using spatiotemporal features  we looked at every shot. We can see  Where is the shot  What's the angle to the basket  Where are the defenders standing  What are their distances  What are their angles  For multiple defenders  we can look at how the player's moving and predict the shot type. We can look at all their velocities and we can build a model that predicts what is the likelihood that this shot would go in under these circumstances  So why is this important  We can take something that was shooting  which was one thing before  and turn it into two things  the quality of the shot and the quality of the shooter. So here's a bubble chart  because what's TED without a bubble chart  Those are NBA players. The size is the size of the player and the color is the position. On the x axis  we have the shot probability. People on the left take difficult shots  on the right  they take easy shots. On the  y axis  is their shooting ability. People who are good are at the top  bad at the bottom. So for example  if there was a player who generally made    percent of their shots  that's all you knew before. But today  I can tell you that player takes shots that an average NBA player would make    percent of the time  and they are two percent worse. And the reason that's important is that there are lots of   s out there. And so it's really important to know if the    that you're considering giving     million dollars to is a good shooter who takes bad shots or a bad shooter who takes good shots. Machine understanding doesn't just change how we look at players  it changes how we look at the game. So there was this very exciting game a couple of years ago  in the NBA finals. Miami was down by three  there was    seconds left. They were about to lose the championship. A gentleman named LeBron James came up and he took a three to tie. He missed. His teammate Chris Bosh got a rebound  passed it to another teammate named Ray Allen. He sank a three. It went into overtime. They won the game. They won the championship. It was one of the most exciting games in basketball. And our ability to know the shot probability for every player at every second  and the likelihood of them getting a rebound at every second can illuminate this moment in a way that we never could before. Now unfortunately  I can't show you that video. But for you  we recreated that moment at our weekly basketball game about   weeks ago. And we recreated the tracking that led to the insights. So  here is us. This is Chinatown in Los Angeles  a park we play at every week  and that's us recreating the Ray Allen moment and all the tracking that's associated with it. So  here's the shot. I'm going to show you that moment and all the insights of that moment. The only difference is  instead of the professional players  it's us  and instead of a professional announcer  it's me. So  bear with me. Miami. Down three. Twenty seconds left. Jeff brings up the ball. Josh catches  puts up a three   Calculating shot probability   Shot quality   Rebound probability  Won't go   Rebound probability  Rebound  Noel. Back to Daria.  Shot quality  Her three pointer    bang  Tie game with five seconds left. The crowd goes wild. That's roughly how it happened. Roughly. That moment had about a nine percent chance of happening in the NBA and we know that and a great many other things. I'm not going to tell you how many times it took us to make that happen. Okay  I will  It was four. Way to go  Daria. But the important thing about that video and the insights we have for every second of every NBA game    it's not that. It's the fact you don't have to be a professional team to track movement. You do not have to be a professional player to get insights about movement. In fact  it doesn't even have to be about sports because we're moving everywhere. We're moving in our homes  in our offices  as we shop and we travel throughout our cities and around our world. What will we know  What will we learn  Perhaps  instead of identifying pick and rolls  a machine can identify the moment and let me know when my daughter takes her first steps. Which could literally be happening any second now. Perhaps we can learn to better use our buildings  better plan our cities. I believe that with the development of the science of moving dots  we will move better  we will move smarter  we will move forward. Thank you very much. I'll begin today by sharing a poem written by my friend from Malawi  Eileen Piri. Eileen is only    years old  but when we were going through the collection of poetry that we wrote  I found her poem so interesting  so motivating. So I'll read it to you. She entitled her poem  I'll Marry When I Want.   I'll marry when I want. My mother can't force me to marry. My father cannot force me to marry. My uncle  my aunt  my brother or sister  cannot force me to marry. No one in the world can force me to marry. I'll marry when I want. Even if you beat me  even if you chase me away  even if you do anything bad to me  I'll marry when I want. I'll marry when I want  but not before I am well educated  and not before I am all grown up. I'll marry when I want.  This poem might seem odd  written by a    year old girl  but where I and Eileen come from  this poem  which I have just read to you  is a warrior's cry. I am from Malawi. Malawi is one of the poorest countries  very poor  where gender equality is questionable. Growing up in that country  I couldn't make my own choices in life. I couldn't even explore personal opportunities in life. I will tell you a story of two different girls  two beautiful girls. These girls grew up under the same roof. They were eating the same food. Sometimes  they would share clothes  and even shoes. But their lives ended up differently  in two different paths. The other girl is my little sister. My little sister was only    years old when she got pregnant. It's a hurtful thing. Not only did it hurt her  even me. I was going through a hard time as well. As it is in my culture  once you reach puberty stage  you are supposed to go to initiation camps. In these initiation camps  you are taught how to sexually please a man. There is this special day  which they call  Very Special Day  where a man who is hired by the community comes to the camp and sleeps with the little girls. Imagine the trauma that these young girls go through every day. Most girls end up pregnant. They even contract HIV and AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. For my little sister  she ended up being pregnant. Today  she's only    years old and she has three children. Her first marriage did not survive  nor did her second marriage. On the other side  there is this girl. She's amazing. I call her amazing because she is. She's very fabulous. That girl is me.  Laughter  When I was    years old  I was told  you are grown up  you have now reached of age  you're supposed to go to the initiation camp. I was like   What  I'm not going to go to the initiation camps.  You know what the women said to me   You are a stupid girl. Stubborn. You do not respect the traditions of our society  of our community.  I said no because I knew where I was going. I knew what I wanted in life. I had a lot of dreams as a young girl. I wanted to get well educated  to find a decent job in the future. I was imagining myself as a lawyer  seated on that big chair. Those were the imaginations that were going through my mind every day. And I knew that one day  I would contribute something  a little something to my community. But every day after refusing  women would tell me   Look at you  you're all grown up. Your little sister has a baby. What about you   That was the music that I was hearing every day  and that is the music that girls hear every day when they don't do something that the community needs them to do. When I compared the two stories between me and my sister  I said   Why can't I do something  Why can't I change something that has happened for a long time in our community   That was when I called other girls just like my sister  who have children  who have been in class but they have forgotten how to read and write. I said   Come on  we can  remind each other how to read and write again  how to hold the pen  how to read  to hold the book.  It was a great time I had with them. Nor did I just learn a little about them  but they were able to tell me their personal stories  what they were facing every day as young mothers. That was when I was like  'Why can't we take all these things that are happening to us and present them and tell our mothers  our traditional leaders  that these are the wrong things   It was a scary thing to do  because these traditional leaders  they are already accustomed to the things that have been there for ages. A hard thing to change  but a good thing to try. So we tried. It was very hard  but we pushed. And I'm here to say that in my community  it was the first community after girls pushed so hard to our traditional leader  and our leader stood up for us and said no girl has to be married before the age of   . In my community  that was the first time a community  they had to call the bylaws  the first bylaw that protected girls in our community. We did not stop there. We forged ahead. We were determined to fight for girls not just in my community  but even in other communities. When the child marriage bill was being presented in February  we were there at the Parliament house. Every day  when the members of Parliament were entering  we were telling them   Would you please support the bill   And we don't have much technology like here  but we have our small phones. So we said   Why can't we get  their numbers and text them   So we did that. It was a good thing. So when the bill passed  we texted them back   Thank you for supporting the bill.  And when the bill was signed by the president  making it into law  it was a plus. Now  in Malawi     is the legal marriage age  from    to   . It's a good thing to know that the bill passed  but let me tell you this  There are countries where    is the legal marriage age  but don't we hear cries of women and girls every day  Every day  girls' lives are being wasted away. This is high time for leaders to honor their commitment. In honoring this commitment  it means keeping girls' issues at heart every time. We don't have to be subjected as second  but they have to know that women  as we are in this room  we are not just women  we are not just girls  we are extraordinary. We can do more. And another thing for Malawi  and not just Malawi but other countries  The laws which are there  you know how a law is not a law until it is enforced  The law which has just recently passed and the laws that in other countries have been there  they need to be publicized at the local level  at the community level  where girls' issues are very striking. Girls face issues  difficult issues  at the community level every day. So if these young girls know that there are laws that protect them  they will be able to stand up and defend themselves because they will know that there is a law that protects them. And another thing I would say is that girls' voices and women's voices are beautiful  they are there  but we cannot do this alone. Male advocates  they have to jump in  to step in and work together. It's a collective work. What we need is what girls elsewhere need  good education  and above all  not to marry whilst   . And furthermore  I know that together  we can transform the legal  the cultural and political framework that denies girls of their rights. I am standing here today and declaring that we can end child marriage in a generation. This is the moment where a girl and a girl  and millions of girls worldwide  will be able to say   I will marry when I want.  Thank you.  Applause  This summer I was back in Ohio for a family wedding  and when I was there  there was a meet and greet with Anna and Elsa from  Frozen.  Not the Anna and Elsa from  Frozen   as this was not a Disney sanctioned event. These two entrepreneurs had a business of running princess parties. Your kid is turning five  They'll come sing some songs  sprinkle some fairy dust  it's great. And they were not about to miss out on the opportunity that was the phenomenon and that was  Frozen.  So they get hired by a local toy store  kids come in on a Saturday morning  buy some Disney swag  get their picture taken with the princesses  call it a day. It's like Santa Claus without the seasonal restrictions. And my three and a half year old niece Samantha was in the thick of it. She could care less that these two women were signing posters and coloring books as Snow Queen and Princess Ana with one N to avoid copyright lawsuits. According to my niece and the     plus kids in the parking lot that day  this was the Anna and Elsa from  Frozen.  It is a blazing hot Saturday morning in August in Ohio. We get there at    o'clock  the scheduled start time  and we are handed number   . By    o'clock they had called numbers    through     this was going to be a while  and there is no amount of free face painting or temporary tattoos that could prevent the meltdowns that were occurring outside of the store. So  by       we get called      to     please.  And as we walk in  it is a scene I can only describe you as saying it looked like Norway threw up. There were cardboard cut out snowflakes covering the floor  glitter on every flat surface  and icicles all over the walls. And as we stood in line in an attempt to give my niece a better vantage point than the backside of the mother of number     I put her up on my shoulders  and she was instantly riveted by the sight of the princesses. And as we moved forward  her excitement only grew  and as we finally got to the front of the line  and number    unfurled her poster to be signed by the princesses  I could literally feel the excitement running through her body. And let's be honest  at that point  I was pretty excited too. I mean  the Scandinavian decadence was mesmerizing. So we get to the front of the line  and the haggard clerk turns to my niece and says   Hi  honey. You're next  Do you want to get down  or you're going to stay on your dad's shoulders for the picture ' And I was  for a lack of a better word  frozen. It's amazing that in an unexpected instant we are faced with the question  who am I  Am I an aunt  Or am I an advocate  Millions of people have seen my video about how to have a hard conversation  and there one was  right in front of me. At the same time  there's nothing more important to me than the kids in my life  so I found myself in a situation that we so often find ourselves in  torn between two things  two impossible choices. Would I be an advocate  Would I take my niece off my shoulders and turn to the clerk and explain to her that I was in fact her aunt  not her father  and that she should be more careful and not to jump to gender conclusions based on haircuts and shoulder rides    and while doing that  miss out on what was  to this point  the greatest moment of my niece's life. Or would I be an aunt  Would I brush off that comment  take a million pictures  and not be distracted for an instant from the pure joy of that moment  and by doing that  walk out with the shame that comes up for not standing up for myself  especially in front of my niece. Who was I  Which one was more important  Which role was more worth it  Was I an aunt  Or was I an advocate  And I had a split second to decide. We are taught right now that we are living in a world of constant and increasing polarity. It's so black and white  so us and them  so right and wrong. There is no middle  there is no gray  just polarity. Polarity is a state in which two ideas or opinions are completely opposite from each other  a diametrical opposition. Which side are you on  Are you unequivocally and without question antiwar  pro choice  anti death penalty  pro gun regulation  proponent of open borders and pro union  Or  are you absolutely  and uncompromisingly pro war  pro life  pro death penalty  a believer that the Second Amendment is absolute  anti immigrant and pro business  It's all or none  you're with us or against us. That is polarity. The problem with polarity  and absolutes is that it eliminates the individuality of our human experience and that makes it contradictory to our human nature. But if we are pulled in these two directions  but it's not really where we exist    polarity is not our actual reality    where do we go from there  What's at the other end of that spectrum  I don't think it's an unattainable  harmonious utopia  I think the opposite of polarity is duality. Duality is a state of having two parts  but not in diametrical opposition  in simultaneous existence. Don't think it's possible  Here are the people I know  I know Catholics who are pro choice  and feminists who wear hijabs  and veterans who are antiwar  and NRA members who think I should be able to get married. Those are the people I know  those are my friends and family  that is the majority of our society  that is you  that is me. Duality is the ability to hold both things. But the question is  Can we own our duality  Can we have the courage to hold both things  I work at a restaurant in town  I became really good friends with the busser. I was a server and we had  a great relationship  we had a really great time together. Her Spanish was great because she was from Mexico. That line actually went the other way. Her English was limited  but significantly better than my Spanish. But we were united by our similarities  not separated by our differences. And we were close  even though we came from very different worlds. She was from Mexico  she left her family behind so she could come here and afford them a better life back home. She was a devout conservative Catholic  a believer in traditional family values  stereotypical roles of men and women  and I was  well  me. But the things that bonded us were when she asked about my girlfriend  or she shared pictures that she had from her family back home. Those were the things that brought us together. So one day  we were in the back  scarfing down food as quickly as we could  gathered around a small table  during a very rare lull  and a new guy from the kitchen came over    who happened to be her cousin    and sat down with all the bravado and machismo that his    year old body could hold. And he said to her   in Spanish   Does Ash have a boyfriend   And she said   in Spanish   No  she has a girlfriend.  And he said   in Spanish   A girlfriend     And she set down her fork  and locked eyes with him  and said   in Spanish   Yes  a girlfriend. That is all.  And his smug smile quickly dropped to one of maternal respect  grabbed his plate  walked off  went back to work. She never made eye contact with me. She left  did the same thing    it was a    second conversation  such a short interaction. And on paper  she had so much more in common with him  language  culture  history  family  her community was her lifeline here  but her moral compass trumped all of that. And a little bit later  they were joking around in the kitchen in Spanish  that had nothing to do with me  and that is duality. She didn't have to choose some P.C. stance on gayness over her heritage. She didn't have to choose her family over our friendship. It wasn't Jesus or Ash. Her individual morality was so strongly rooted that she had the courage to hold both things. Our moral integrity is our responsibility and we must be prepared to defend it even when it's not convenient. That's what it means to be an ally  and if you're going to be an ally  you have to be an active ally  Ask questions  act when you hear something inappropriate  actually engage. I had a family friend who for years used to call my girlfriend my lover. Really  Lover  So overly sexual  so '  s gay porn. But she was trying  and she asked. She could have called her my friend  or my  friend   or my  special friend     or even worse  just not asked at all. Believe me  we would rather have you ask. I would rather have her say lover  than say nothing at all. People often say to me   Well  Ash  I don't care. I don't see race or religion or sexuality. It doesn't matter to me. I don't see it.  But I think the opposite of homophobia and racism and xenophobia is not love  it's apathy. If you don't see my gayness  then you don't see me. If it doesn't matter to you who I sleep with  then you cannot imagine what it feels like when I walk down the street late at night holding her hand  and approach a group of people and have to make the decision if I should hang on to it or if I should I drop it when all I want to do is squeeze it tighter. And the small victory I feel when I make it by and don't have to let go. And the incredible cowardice and disappointment I feel when I drop it. If you do not see that struggle that is unique to my human experience because I am gay  then you don't see me. If you are going to be an ally  I need you to see me. As individuals  as allies  as humans  we need to be able to hold both things  both the good and the bad  the easy and the hard. You don't learn how to hold two things just from the fluff  you learn it from the grit. And what if duality is just the first step  What if through compassion and empathy and human interaction we are able to learn to hold two things  And if we can hold two things  we can hold four  and if we can hold four  we can hold eight  and if we can hold eight  we can hold hundreds. We are complex individuals  swirls of contradiction. You are all holding so many things right now. What can you do to hold just a few more  So  back to Toledo  Ohio. I'm at the front of the line  niece on my shoulders  the frazzled clerk calls me Dad. Have you ever been mistaken for the wrong gender  Not even that. Have you ever been called something you are not  Here's what it feels like for me  I am instantly an internal storm of contrasting emotions. I break out into a sweat that is a combination of rage and humiliation  I feel like the entire store is staring at me  and I simultaneously feel invisible. I want to explode in a tirade of fury  and I want to crawl under a rock. And top all of that off with the frustration that I'm wearing an out of character tight fitting purple t shirt  so this whole store can see my boobs  to make sure this exact same thing doesn't happen. But  despite my best efforts to be seen as the gender I am  it still happens. And I hope with every ounce of my body that no one heard    not my sister  not my girlfriend  and certainly not my niece. I am accustomed to this familiar hurt  but I will do whatever I need to do to protect the people I love from it. But then I take my niece off my shoulders  and she runs to Elsa and Anna    the thing she's been waiting so long for    and all that stuff goes away. All that matters is the smile on her face. And as the    seconds we waited two and a half hours for comes to a close we gather up our things  and I lock eyes with the clerk again  and she gives me an apologetic smile and mouths   I am so sorry   And her humanity  her willingness to admit her mistake disarms me immediately  then I give her a   It's okay  it happens. But thanks.  And I realize in that moment that I don't have to be either an aunt or an advocate  I can be both. I can live in duality  and I can hold two things. And if I can hold two things in that environment  I can hold so many more things. As my girlfriend and my niece hold hands and skip out the front of the door  I turn to my sister and say   Was it worth it   And she said   Are you kidding me  Did you see the look on her face  This was the greatest day of her life    It was worth the two and a half hours in the heat  it was worth the overpriced coloring book that we already had a copy of.   It was even worth you  getting called Dad.  And for the first time ever in my life  it actually was. Thank you  Boulder. Have a good night. About    years ago  I went through a little bit of a hard time. So I decided to go see a therapist. I had been seeing her for a few months  when she looked at me one day and said   Who actually raised you until you were three   Seemed like a weird question. I said   My parents.  And she said   I don't think that's actually the case  because if it were  we'd be dealing with things that are far more complicated than just this.  It sounded like the setup to a joke  but I knew she was serious. Because when I first started seeing her  I was trying to be the funniest person in the room. And I would try and crack these jokes  but she caught on to me really quickly  and whenever I tried to make a joke  she would look at me and say   That is actually really sad.  It's terrible. So I knew I had to be serious  and I asked my parents who had actually raised me until I was three  And to my surprise  they said my primary caregiver had been a distant relative of the family. I had called her my auntie. I remember my auntie so clearly  it felt like she had been part of my life when I was much older. I remember the thick  straight hair  and how it would come around me like a curtain when she bent to pick me up  her soft  southern Thai accent  the way I would cling to her  even if she just wanted to go to the bathroom or get something to eat. I loved her  but  with  the ferocity that a child has sometimes before she understands that love also requires letting go. But my clearest and sharpest memory of my auntie  is also one of my first memories of life at all. I remember her being beaten and slapped by another member of my family. I remember screaming hysterically and wanting it to stop  as I did every single time it happened  for things as minor as wanting to go out with her friends  or being a little late. I became so hysterical over her treatment  that eventually  she was just beaten behind closed doors. Things got so bad for her that eventually she ran away. As an adult  I learned later that she had been just    when she was brought over from Thailand to the States to care for me  on a tourist visa. She wound up working in Illinois for a time  before eventually returning to Thailand  which is where I ran into her again  at a political rally in Bangkok. I clung to her again  as I had when I was a child  and I let go  and then I promised that I would call. I never did  though. Because I was afraid if I said everything that she meant to me    that I owed perhaps the best parts of who I became to her care  and that the words  I'm sorry  were like a thimble to bail out all the guilt and shame and rage I felt over everything she had endured to care for me for as long as she had    I thought if I said those words to her  I would never stop crying again. Because she had saved me. And I had not saved her. I'm a journalist  and I've been writing and researching human trafficking for the past eight years or so  and even so  I never put together this personal story with my professional life until pretty recently. I think this profound disconnect actually symbolizes most of our understanding about human trafficking. Because human trafficking is far more prevalent  complex and close to home than most of us realize. I spent time in jails and brothels  interviewed hundreds of survivors and law enforcement  NGO workers. And when I think about what we've done about human trafficking  I am hugely disappointed. Partly because we don't even talk about the problem right at all. When I say  human trafficking   most of you probably don't think about someone like my auntie. You probably think about a young girl or woman  who's been brutally forced into prostitution by a violent pimp. That is real suffering  and that is a real story. That story makes me angry for far more than just the reality of that situation  though. As a journalist  I really care about how we relate to each other through language  and the way we tell that story  with all the gory  violent detail  the salacious aspects    I call that  look at her scars  journalism. We use that story to convince ourselves that human trafficking is a bad man doing a bad thing to an innocent girl. That story lets us off the hook. It takes away all the societal context that we might be indicted for  for the structural inequality  or the poverty  or the barriers to migration. We let ourselves think that human trafficking is only about forced prostitution  when in reality  human trafficking is embedded in our everyday lives. Let me show you what I mean. Forced prostitution accounts for    percent of human trafficking. Ten percent is in state  imposed forced labor. but a whopping    percent is for the purpose of creating the goods and delivering the services that most of us rely on every day  in sectors like agricultural work  domestic work and construction. That is food and care and shelter. And somehow  these most essential workers are also among the world's most underpaid and exploited today. Human trafficking is the use of force  fraud or coercion to compel another person's labor. And it's found in cotton fields  and coltan mines  and even car washes in Norway and England. It's found in U.S. military bases in Iraq and Afghanistan. It's found in Thailand's fishing industry. That country has become the largest exporter of shrimp in the world. But what are the circumstances behind all that cheap and plentiful shrimp  Thai military were caught selling Burmese and Cambodian migrants onto fishing boats. Those fishing boats were taken out  the men put to work  and they were thrown overboard if they made the mistake of falling sick  or trying to resist their treatment. Those fish were then used to feed shrimp  The shrimp were then sold to four major global retailers  Costco  Tesco  Walmart and Carrefour. Human trafficking is found on a smaller scale than just that  and in places you would never even imagine. Traffickers have forced young people to drive ice cream trucks  or to sing in touring boys' choirs. Trafficking has even been found in a hair braiding salon in New Jersey. The scheme in that case was incredible. The traffickers found young families who were from Ghana and Togo  and they told these families that  your daughters are going to get a fine education in the United States.  They then located winners of the green card lottery  and they told them   We'll help you out. We'll get you a plane ticket. We'll pay your fees. All you have to do is take this young girl with you  say that she's your sister or your spouse. Once everyone arrived in New Jersey  the young girls were taken away  and put to work for    hour days  seven days a week  for five years. They made their traffickers nearly four million dollars. This is a huge problem. So what have we done about it  We've mostly turned to the criminal justice system. But keep in mind  most victims of human trafficking are poor and marginalized. They're migrants  people of color. Sometimes they're in the sex trade. And for populations like these  the criminal justice system is too often part of the problem  rather than the solution. In study after study  in countries ranging from Bangladesh to the United States  between    and    percent of the people in the sex trade who were surveyed said that they had been raped or assaulted by the police in the past year alone. People in prostitution  including people who have been trafficked into it  regularly receive multiple convictions for prostitution. Having that criminal record makes it so much more difficult to leave poverty  leave abuse  or leave prostitution  if that person so desires. Workers outside of the sex sector    if they try and resist their treatment  they risk deportation. In case after case I've studied  employers have no problem calling on law enforcement to try and threaten or deport their striking trafficked workers. If those workers run away  they risk becoming part of the great mass of undocumented workers who are also subject to the whims of law enforcement if they're caught. Law enforcement is supposed to identify victims and prosecute traffickers. But out of an estimated    million victims of human trafficking in the world  they have helped and identified fewer than        people. That's like comparing the population of the world to the population of Los Angeles  proportionally speaking. As for convictions  out of an estimated       convictions in       fewer than     were for labor trafficking. Keep in mind that labor trafficking accounts for    percent of all trafficking  but fewer than    percent of the convictions. I've heard one expert say that trafficking happens where need meets greed. I'd like to add one more element to that. Trafficking happens in sectors where workers are excluded from protections  and denied the right to organize. Trafficking doesn't happen in a vacuum. It happens in systematically degraded work environments. You might be thinking  oh  she's talking about failed states  or war torn states  or    I'm actually talking about the United States. Let me tell you what that looks like. I spent many months researching a trafficking case called Global Horizons  involving hundreds of Thai farm workers. They were sent all over the States  to work in Hawaii pineapple plantations  and Washington apple orchards  and anywhere the work was needed. They were promised three years of solid agricultural work. So they made a calculated risk. They sold their land  they sold their wives' jewelry  to make thousands in recruitment fees for this company  Global Horizons. But once they were brought over  their passports were confiscated. Some of the men were beaten and held at gunpoint. They worked so hard they fainted in the fields. This case hit me so hard. After I came back home  I was wandering through the grocery store  and I froze in the produce department. I was remembering the over the top meals the Global Horizons survivors would make for me every time I showed up to interview them. They finished one meal with this plate of perfect  long stemmed strawberries  and as they handed them to me  they said   Aren't these the kind of strawberries you eat with somebody special in the States  And don't they taste so much better when you know the people whose hands picked them for you   As I stood in that grocery store weeks later  I realized I had no idea of who to thank for this plenty  and no idea of how they were being treated. So  like the journalist I am  I started digging into the agricultural sector. And I found there are too many fields  and too few labor inspectors. I found multiple layers of plausible deniability between grower and distributor and processor  and God knows who else. The Global Horizons survivors had been brought to the States on a temporary guest worker program. That guest worker program ties a person's legal status to his or her employer  and denies that worker the right to organize. Mind you  none of what I am describing about this agricultural sector or the guest worker program is actually human trafficking. It is merely what we find legally tolerable. And I would argue this is fertile ground for exploitation. And all of this had been hidden to me  before I had tried to understand it. I wasn't the only person grappling with these issues. Pierre Omidyar  founder of eBay  is one of the biggest anti trafficking philanthropists in the world. And even he wound up accidentally investing nearly    million dollars in the pineapple plantation cited as having the worst working conditions in that Global Horizons case. When he found out  he and his wife were shocked and horrified  and they wound up writing an op ed for a newspaper  saying that it was up to all of us to learn everything we can about the labor and supply chains of the products that we support. I totally agree. What would happen if each one of us decided that we are no longer going to support companies if they don't eliminate exploitation from their labor and supply chains  If we demanded laws calling for the same  If all the CEOs out there decided that they were going to go through their businesses and say   no more   If we ended recruitment fees for migrant workers  If we decided that guest workers should have the right to organize without fear of retaliation  These would be decisions heard around the world. This isn't a matter of buying a fair trade peach and calling it a day  buying a guilt free zone with your money. That's not how it works. This is the decision to change a system that is broken  and that we have unwittingly but willingly allowed ourselves to profit from and benefit from for too long. We often dwell on human trafficking survivors' victimization. But that is not my experience of them. Over all the years that I've been talking to them  they have taught me that we are more than our worst days. Each one of us is more than what we have lived through. Especially trafficking survivors. These people were the most resourceful and resilient and responsible in their communities. They were the people that you would take a gamble on. You'd say  I'm gong to sell my rings  because I have the chance to send you off to a better future. They were the emissaries of hope. These survivors don't need saving. They need solidarity  because they're behind some of the most exciting social justice movements out there today. The nannies and housekeepers who marched with their families and their employers' families    their activism got us an international treaty on domestic workers' rights. The Nepali women who were trafficked into the sex trade    they came together  and they decided that they were going to make the world's first anti trafficking organization actually headed and run by trafficking survivors themselves. These Indian shipyard workers were trafficked to do post Hurricane Katrina reconstruction. They were threatened with deportation  but they broke out of their work compound and they marched from New Orleans to Washington  D.C.  to protest labor exploitation. They cofounded an organization called the National Guest Worker Alliance  and through this organization  they have wound up helping other workers bring to light exploitation and abuses in supply chains in Walmart and Hershey's factories. And although the Department of Justice declined to take their case  a team of civil rights lawyers won the first of a dozen civil suits this February  and got their clients    million dollars. These survivors are fighting for people they don't even know yet  other workers  and for the possibility of a just world for all of us. This is our chance to do the same. This is our chance to make the decision that tells us who we are  as a people and as a society  that our prosperity is no longer prosperity  as long as it is pinned to other people's pain  that our lives are inextricably woven together  and that we have the power to make a different choice. I was so reluctant to share my story of my auntie with you. Before I started this TED process and climbed up on this stage  I had told literally a handful of people about it  because  like many a journalist  I am far more interested in learning about your stories than sharing much  if anything  about my own. I also haven't done my journalistic due diligence on this. I haven't issued my mountains of document requests  and interviewed everyone and their mother  and I haven't found my auntie yet. I don't know her story of what happened  and of her life now. The story as I've told it to you is messy and unfinished. But I think it mirrors the messy and unfinished situation we're all in  when it comes to human trafficking. We are all implicated in this problem. But that means we are all also part of its solution. Figuring out how to build a more just world is our work to do  and our story to tell. So let us tell it the way we should have done  from the very beginning. Let us tell this story together. Thank you so much. It was the middle of summer and well past closing time in the downtown Berkeley bar where my friend Polly and I worked together as bartenders. Usually at the end of our shift we had a drink    but not that night.  I'm pregnant. Not sure what I'm going to do yet   I told Polly. Without hesitation  she replied   I've had an abortion.  Before Polly  no one had ever told me that she'd had an abortion. I'd graduated from college just a few months earlier and I was in a new relationship when I found out that I was pregnant. When I thought about my choices  I honestly did not know how to decide  what criteria I should use. How would I know what the right decision was  I worried that I would regret  an abortion later. Coming of age on the beaches of Southern California  I grew up in the middle of  our nation's abortion wars. I was born in a trailer on the third anniversary of Roe vs. Wade. Our community was surfing Christians. We cared about God  the less fortunate  and the ocean. Everyone was pro life. As a kid  the idea of abortion made me so sad that I knew if I ever got pregnant I could never have one. And then I did. It was a step towards the unknown. But Polly had given me a very special gift  the knowledge that I wasn't alone and the realization that abortion was something that we can talk about. Abortion is common. According to the Guttmacher Institute  one in three women in America will have an abortion in their lifetime. But for the last few decades  the dialogue around abortion in the United States has left little room for anything beyond  pro life and pro choice. It's political and polarizing. But as much as abortion is hotly debated  it's still rare for us  whether as fellow women or even just as fellow people  to talk with one another about the abortions that we have. There is a gap. Between what happens in politics and what happens in real life  and in that gap  a battlefield mentality. An  are you with us  or against us   stance takes root. This isn't just about abortion. There are so many important issues  that we can't talk about. And so finding ways to shift the conflict to a place of conversation is the work of my life. There are two main ways to get started. One way is to listen closely. And the other way is to share stories. So     years ago  I cofounded an organization called Exhale to start listening to people  who have had abortions. The first thing we did was create  a talk line  where women and men could call to get emotional support. Free of judgment and politics  believe it or not  nothing like our sevice had ever existed. We needed a new framework that could  hold all the experiences that we were hearing on our talk line. The feminist who regrets her abortion. The Catholic who is grateful for hers. The personal experiences that weren't  fitting neatly into one box or the other. We didn't think it was right  to ask women to pick a side. We wanted to show them that the whole world was on their side  as they were going through this deeply personal experience. So we invented  pro voice.  Beyond abortion  pro voice works on hard issues that we've struggled with globally for years  issues like immigration  religious tolerance  violence against women. It also works on deeply personal topics  that might only matter to you and your immediate family and friends. They have a terminal illness   their mother just died  they have a child with special needs and they can't talk about it. Listening and storytelling are the hallmarks of pro voice practice. Listening and storytelling. That sounds pretty nice. Sounds maybe  easy  We could all do that. It's not easy. It's very hard. Pro voice is hard because we are talking about things everyone's fighting about or the things that no one  wants to talk about. I wish I could tell you that when you  decide to be pro voice  that you'll find beautiful moments of breakthrough  and gardens full of flowers  where listening and storytelling creates wonderful  a ha  moments. I wish I could tell you that there would be a feminist welcoming party for you  or that there's a long lost sisterhood of people who are just ready to have your back when you get slammed. But it can be vulnerable and exhausting  to tell our own stories when it feels like nobody cares. And if we truly listen to one another  we will hear things that demand that we shift our own perceptions. There is no perfect time and there is no perfect place to start a difficult conversation. There's never a time when everyone will be on the same page  share the same lens  or know the same history. So  let's talk about listening and how to be a good listener. There's lots of ways to be a good listener and I'm going to give you just a couple. One is to ask open ended questions. You can ask yourself or someone  that you know   How are you feeling    What was that like    What do you hope for  now   Another way to be a good listener  is to use reflective language. If someone is talking about their own personal experience  use the words that they use. If someone is talking about an abortion and they say the word  baby   you can say  baby.  If they say  fetus   you can say  fetus.  If someone describes themselves as gender queer to you  you can say  gender queer.  If someone kind of looks like a he  but they say they're a she    it's cool. Call that person a she. When we reflect the language of the person who is sharing their own story  we are conveying that we are interested in understanding who they are and what they're going through. The same way that we hope people are  interested in knowing us. So  I'll never forget being in one  of the Exhale counselor meetings  listening to a volunteer talk about how she was getting a lot of calls from Christian women who  were talking about God. Now  some of our volunteers are religious  but this particular one was not. At first  it felt a little weird for her  to talk to callers about God. So  she decided to get comfortable. And she stood in front of her mirror  at home  and she said the word  God.   God.   God.   God.   God.   God.   God.  Over and over and over again until the word no longer felt strange coming out her mouth. Saying the word God did not turn this  volunteer into a Christian  but it did make her a much  better listener of Christian women. So  another way to be pro voice is to share stories  and one risk that you take on  when you share your story with someone else  is that given the same set of circumstances as you they might actually make a different decision. For example  if you're telling a story  about your abortion  realize that she might have had the baby. She might have placed for adoption. She might have told her parents  and her partner    or not. She might have felt relief and confidence  even though you felt sad and lost. This is okay. Empathy gets created the moment we imagine ourselves in someone else's shoes. It doesn't mean we all have  to end up in the same place. It's not agreement  it's not sameness that pro voice is after. It creates a culture and a society that  values what make us special and unique. It values what makes us human  our flaws and our imperfections. And this way of thinking allows us to see our differences with respect  instead of fear. And it generates the empathy that we need to overcome all the ways that we try to hurt one another. Stigma  shame  prejudice   discrimination  oppression. Pro voice is contagious  and the more it's practiced the more it spreads. So  last year I was pregnant again. This time I was looking forward  to the birth of my son. And while pregnant  I had never been asked how I was feeling so much in all my life. And however I replied  whether I was feeling wonderful and excited or scared and totally freaked out  there was always someone there giving me a  been there  response. It was awesome. It was a welcome  yet dramatic departure from what I experience when I talk about my mixed feelings of my abortion. Pro voice is about the real stories of real people making an impact on the way abortion and so many other politicized and stigmatized issues are understood and discussed. From sexuality and mental health to poverty and incarceration. Far beyond definition as single right or wrong decisions  our experiences can exist on a spectrum. Pro voice focuses that conversation on human experience and it makes support and respect possible for all. Thank you. Alec Soth  So about    years ago  I got a call from a woman in Texas  Stacey Baker  and she'd seen some of my photographs in an art exhibition and was wondering if she could commission me to take a portrait of her parents. Now  at the time I hadn't met Stacey  and I thought this was some sort of wealthy oil tycoon and I'd struck it rich  but it was only later that I found out she'd actually taken out a loan to make this happen. I took the picture of her parents  but I was actually more excited about photographing Stacey. The picture I made that day ended up becoming one of my best known portraits. At the time I made this picture  Stacey was working as an attorney for the State of Texas. Not long after  she left her job to study photography in Maine  and while she was there  she ended up meeting the director of photography at the New York Times Magazine and was actually offered a job. Stacey Baker  In the years since  Alec and I have done a number of magazine projects together  and we've become friends. A few months ago  I started talking to Alec about a fascination of mine. I've always been obsessed with how couples meet. I asked Alec how he and his wife Rachel met  and he told me the story of a high school football game where she was    and he was     and he asked her out. He liked her purple hair. She said yes  and that was it. I then asked Alec if he'd be interested in doing a photography project exploring this question. AS  And I was interested in the question  but I was actually much more interested in Stacey's motivation for asking it  particularly since I'd never known Stacey to have a boyfriend. So as part of this project  I thought it'd be interesting if she tried to meet someone. So my idea was to have Stacey here go speed dating in Las Vegas on Valentine's Day. SB  We ended up at what was advertised as the world's largest speed dating event. I had    dates and each date lasted three minutes. Participants were given a list of ice  breaker questions to get the ball rolling  things like   If you could be any kind of animal  what would you be   That sort of thing. My first date was Colin. He's from England  and he once married a woman he met after placing an ad for a Capricorn. Alec and I saw him at the end of the evening  and he said he'd kissed a woman in line at one of the concession stands. Zack and Chris came to the date a thon together. This is Carl. I asked Carl   What's the first thing you notice about a woman   He said   Tits.  Matthew is attracted to women with muscular calves. We talked about running. He does triathlons  I run half marathons. Alec actually liked his eyes and asked if I was attracted to him  but I wasn't  and I don't think he was attracted to me either. Austin and Mike came together. Mike asked me a hypothetical question. He said   You're in an elevator running late for a meeting. Someone makes a dash for the elevator. Do you hold it open for them   And I said I would not. Cliff said the first thing he notices about a woman is her teeth  and we complimented each other's teeth. Because he's an open mouth sleeper  he says he has to floss more to help prevent gum disease  and so I asked him how often he flosses  and he said   Every other day.  Now  as someone who flosses twice a day  I wasn't really sure that that was flossing more but I don't think I said that out loud. Bill is an auditor  and we talked the entire three minutes about auditing.  Laughter  The first thing Spencer notices about a woman is her complexion. He feels a lot of women wear too much makeup  and that they should only wear enough to accentuate the features that they have. I told him I didn't wear any makeup at all and he seemed to think that that was a good thing. Craig told me he didn't think I was willing to be vulnerable. He was also frustrated when I couldn't remember my most embarrassing moment. He thought I was lying  but I wasn't. I didn't think he liked me at all  but at the end of the night  he came back to me and he gave me a box of chocolates. William was really difficult to talk to. I think he was drunk. Actor Chris McKenna was the MC of the event. He used to be on  The Young and the Restless.  I didn't actually go on a date with him. Alec said he saw several women give their phone numbers to him. Needless to say  I didn't fall in love. I didn't feel a particular connection with any of the men that I went on dates with  and I didn't feel like they felt a particular connection with me either. AS  Now  the most beautiful thing to me    The physical exterior reveals a crack in which you can get a glimpse at a more fragile interior. At this date a thon event  I saw so many examples of that  but as I watched Stacey's dates and talked to her about them  I realized how different photographic love is from real love. What is real love  How does it work  In order to work on this question and to figure out how someone goes from meeting on a date to having a life together  Stacey and I went to Sun City Summerlin  which is the largest retirement community in Las Vegas. Our contact there was George  who runs the community's photography club. He arranged for us to meet other couples in their makeshift photo studio. SB  After    years of marriage  Anastasia's husband died two years ago  so we asked if she had an old wedding picture. She met her husband when she was a    year old waitress at a small barbecue place in Michigan. He was   . She'd lied about her age. He was the first person she'd dated. Dean had been named photographer of the year in Las Vegas two years in a row  and this caught Alec's attention  as did the fact  that he met his wife  Judy  at the same age when Alec met Rachel. Dean admitted that he likes to look at beautiful women  but he's never questioned his decision to marry Judy. AS  George met Josephine at a parish dance. He was     she was   . Like a lot of the couples we met  they weren't especially philosophical about their early choices. George said something that really stuck with me. He said   When you get that feeling  you just go with it.  Bob and Trudy met on a blind date when she was still in high school. They said they weren't particularly attracted to each other when the first met. Nevertheless  they were married soon after. SB  The story that stayed with me the most was that of George  the photography club president  and his wife  Mary. This was George and Mary's second marriage. They met at a country western club in Louisville  Kentucky called the Sahara. He was there alone drinking and she was with friends. When they started dating  he owed the IRS       dollars in taxes  and she offered to help him get out of debt  so for the next year  he turned his paychecks over to Mary  and she got him out of debt. George was actually an alcoholic when they married  and Mary knew it. At some point in their marriage  he says he consumed    beers in one day. Another time  when he was drunk  he threatened to kill Mary and her two kids  but they escaped and a SWAT team was called to the house. Amazingly  Mary took him back  and eventually things got better. George has been involved in Alcoholics Anonymous and hasn't had a drink in    years. At the end of the day  after we left Sun City  I told Alec that I didn't actually think that the stories of how these couples met were all that interesting. What was more interesting was how they managed to stay together. AS  They all had this beautiful quality of endurance  but that was true of the singles  too. The world is hard  and the singles were out there trying to connect with other people  and the couples were holding onto each other after all these decades. My favorite pictures on this trip were of Joe and Roseanne. Now  by the time we met Joe and Roseanne  we'd gotten in the habit of asking couples if they had an old wedding photograph. In their case  they simultaneously pulled out of their wallets the exact same photograph. What's more beautiful  I thought to myself  this image of a young couple who has just fallen in love or the idea of these two people holding onto this image for decades  Thank you. This back here was my brain cancer. Isn't it nice  The key phrase is  was   phew. Having brain cancer was really  as you can imagine  shocking news for me. I knew nothing about cancer. In Western cultures  when you have cancer  it's as if you disappear in a way. Your life as a complex human being is replaced by medical data  Your images  your exams  your lab values  a list of medicines. And everyone changes as well. You suddenly become a disease on legs. Doctors start speaking a language which you don't understand. They start pointing their fingers at your body and your images. People start changing as well because they start dealing with the disease  instead of with the human being. They say   What did the doctor say   before even saying   Hello.  And in the meanwhile  you're left with questions to which nobody gives an answer. These are the  Can I   questions  Can I work while I have cancer  Can I study  Can I make love  Can I be creative  And you wonder   What have I done to deserve this   You wonder   Can I change something about my lifestyle   You wonder   Can I do something  Are there any other options   And  obviously  doctors are the good guys in all these scenarios  because they are very professional and dedicated to curing you. But they also are very used to having to deal with patients  so I'd say that they sometimes lose the idea that this is torture for you and that you become  literally  a patient     patient  means  the one who waits.  Things are changing  but classically  they tend to not engage you in any way to learn about your condition  to get your friends and family engaged  or showing you ways in which you can change your lifestyle to minimize the risks of what you're going through. But instead  you're forced there to wait in the hands of a series of very professional strangers. While I was in the hospital  I asked for a printed out picture of my cancer and I spoke with it. It was really hard to obtain  because it's not common practice to ask for a picture of your own cancer. I talked to it and I said   Okay  cancer  you're not all there is to me. There's more to me. A cure  whichever it is  will have to deal with the whole of me.  And so  the next day  I left the hospital against medical advice. I was determined to change my relationship with the cancer and I was determined to learn more about my cancer before doing anything as drastic as a surgery. I'm an artist  I use several forms of open source technologies and open information in my practice. So my best bet was to get it all out there  get the information out there  and use it so that it could be accessed by anyone. So I created a website  which is called La Cura  on which I put my medical data  online. I actually had to hack it and that's a thing which we can talk about in another speech. I chose this word  La Cura    La Cura in Italian means  the cure     because in many different cultures  the word  cure  can mean many different things. In our Western cultures  it means eradicating or reversing a disease  but in different cultures  for example  a culture from Asia  from the Mediterranean  from Latin countries  from Africa  it can mean many more things. Of course  I was interested in the opinions of doctors and healthcare providers  but I was also interested in the cure of the artist  of the poet  of the designer  of  who knows  the musicians. I was interested in the social cure  I was interested in the psychological cure  I was interested in the spiritual cure  I was interested in the emotional cure  I was interested in any form of cure. And  it worked. The La Cura website went viral. I received lots of media attention from Italy and from abroad and I quickly received more than         contacts    emails  social networking    most of them were a suggestion on how to cure my cancer  but more of them were about how to cure myself as a full individual. For example  many thousands of videos  images  pictures  art performances were produced for La Cura. For example  here we see Francesca Fini in her performance. Or  as artist Patrick Lichty has done  He produced a  D sculpture of my tumor and put it on sale on Thingiverse. Now you can have my cancer  too  Which is a nice thing  if you think about it  we can share our cancer. And this was going on    scientists  the traditional medicine experts  several researchers  doctors    all connected with me to give advice. With all this information and support  I was able to form a team of several neurosurgeons  traditional doctors  oncologists  and several hundred volunteers with whom I was able to discuss the information I was receiving  which is very important. And together  we were able to form a strategy for my own cure in many languages  according to many cultures. And the current strategy spans the whole world and thousands of years of human history  which is quite remarkable for me.  Surgery  The follow up MRIs showed  luckily  little to no growth of the cancer. So I was able to take my time and choose. I chose the doctor I wanted to work with  I chose the hospital I wanted to stay in  and in the meanwhile  I was supported by thousands of people  none of whom felt pity for me. Everyone felt like they could take an active role in helping me to get well  and this was the most important part of La Cura. What are the outcomes  I'm fine  as you can see  pretty fine. I had excellent news after the surgery    I have    I had a very low grade glioma  which is a  good  kind of cancer which doesn't grow a lot. I have completely changed my life and my lifestyle. Everything I did was thoughtfully designed to get me engaged. Up until the very last few minutes of the surgery  which was very intense  a matrix of electrodes was implanted in my brain from this side  to be able to build a functional map of what the brain controls. And right before the operation  we were able to discuss the functional map of my brain with the doctor  to understand which risks I was running into and if there were any I wanted to avoid. Obviously  there were.  Open  And this openness was really the fundamental part of La Cura. Thousands of people shared their stories  their experiences. Doctors got to talk with people they don't usually consult when they think about cancer. I'm a self founding  continuous state of translation among many different languages  in which science meets emotion and conventional research meets traditional research.  Society  The most important thing of La Cura was to feel like a part of a really engaged and connected society whose wellness really depends on the wellness of all of its components. This global performance is my open source cure for cancer. And from what I feel  it's a cure for me  but for us all. Thank you. So  people are more afraid of insects than they are of dying. At least  according to a       Book of Lists  survey which preceded all those online best  worst  funniest lists that you see today. Only heights and public speaking exceeded the six legged as sources of fear. And I suspect if you had put spiders in there  the combinations of insects and spiders would have just topped the chart. Now  I am not one of those people. I really love insects. I think they're interesting and beautiful  and sometimes even cute. And I'm not alone. For centuries  some of the greatest minds in science  from Charles Darwin to E.O. Wilson  have drawn inspiration from studying some of the smallest minds on Earth. Well  why is that  What is that keeps us coming back to insects  Some of it  of course  is just the sheer magnitude of almost everything about them. They're more numerous than any other kind of animal. We don't even know how many species of insects there are  because new ones are being discovered all the time. There are at least a million  maybe as many as    million. This means that you could have an insect of the month calendar and not have to reuse a species for over        years. Take that  pandas and kittens  More seriously  insects are essential. We need them. It's been estimated that   out of every   bites of food is made possible by a pollinator. Scientist use insects to make fundamental discoveries about everything from the structure of our nervous systems to how our genes and DNA work. But what I love most about insects is what they can tell us about our own behavior. Insects seem like they do everything that people do. They meet  they mate  they fight  they break up. And they do so with what looks like love or animosity. But what drives their behaviors is really different than what drives our own  and that difference can be really illuminating. There's nowhere where that's more true than when it comes to one of our most consuming interests    sex. Now  I will maintain. and I think I can defend  what may seem like a surprising statement. I think sex in insects is more interesting than sex in people. And the wild variety that we see makes us challenge some of our own assumptions about what it means to be male and female. Of course  to start with  a lot of insects don't need to have sex at all to reproduce. Female aphids can make little  tiny clones of themselves without ever mating. Virgin birth  right there. On your rose bushes. When they do have sex  even their sperm is more interesting than human sperm. There are some kinds of fruit flies whose sperm is longer than the male's own body. And that's important because the males use their sperm to compete. Now  male insects do compete with weapons  like the horns on these beetles. But they also compete after mating with their sperm. Dragonflies and damselflies have penises that look kind of like Swiss Army knives with all of the attachments pulled out. They use these formidable devices like scoops  to remove the sperm from previous males that the female has mated with. So  what can we learn from this  All right  it is not a lesson in the sense of us imitating them or of them setting an example for us to follow. Which  given this  is probably just as well. And also  did I mention sexual cannibalism is rampant among insects  So  no  that's not the point. But what I think insects do  is break a lot of the rules that we humans have about the sex roles. So  people have this idea that nature dictates kind of a     s sitcom version of what males and females are like. So that males are always supposed to be dominant and aggressive  and females are passive and coy. But that's just not the case. So for example  take katydids  which are relatives of crickets and grasshoppers. The males are very picky about who they mate with  because they not only transfer sperm during mating  they also give the female something called a nuptial gift. You can see two katydids mating in these photos. In both panels  the male's the one on the right  and that sword like appendage is the female's egg laying organ. The white blob is the sperm  the green blob is the nuptial gift  and the male manufactures this from his own body and it's extremely costly to produce. It can weigh up to a third of his body mass. I will now pause for a moment and let you think about what it would be like if human men  every time they had sex  had to produce something that weighed            pounds. Okay  they would not be able to do that very often. And indeed  neither can the katydids. And so what that means is the katydid males are very choosy about who they offer these nuptial gifts to. Now  the gift is very nutritious  and the female eats it during and after mating. So  the bigger it is  the better off the male is  because that means more time for his sperm to drain into her body and fertilize her eggs. But it also means that the males are very passive about mating  whereas the females are extremely aggressive and competitive  in an attempt to get as many of these nutritious nuptial gifts as they can. So  it's not exactly a stereotypical set of rules. Even more generally though  males are actually not all that important in the lives of a lot of insects. In the social insects    the bees and wasps and ants    the individuals that you see every day    the ants going back and forth to your sugar bowl  the honey bees that are flitting from flower to flower    all of those are always female. People have had a hard time getting their head around that idea for millennia. The ancient Greeks knew that there was a class of bees  the drones  that are larger than the workers  although they disapproved of the drones' laziness because they could see that the drones just hang around the hive until the mating flight    they're the males. They hang around until the mating flight  but they don't participate in gathering nectar or pollen. The Greeks couldn't figure out the drones' sex  and part of the confusion was that they were aware of the stinging ability of bees but they found it difficult to believe that any animals that bore such a weapon could possibly be a female. Aristotle tried to get involved as well. He suggested   OK  if the stinging individuals are going to be the males ...  Then he got confused  because that would have meant the males were also taking care of the young in a colony  and he seemed to think that would be completely impossible. He then concluded that maybe bees had the organs of both sexes in the same individual  which is not that far fetched  some animals do that  but he never really did get it figured out. And you know  even today  my students  for instance  call every animal they see  including insects  a male. And when I tell them that the ferocious army ant soldiers with their giant jaws  used to defend the colony  are all always female  they seem to not quite believe me. And certainly all of the movies    Antz  Bee Movie    portray the main character in the social insects as being male. Well  what difference does this make  These are movies. They're fiction. They have talking animals in them. What difference does it make if they talk like Jerry Seinfeld  I think it does matter  and it's a problem that actually is part of a much deeper one that has implications for medicine and health and a lot of other aspects of our lives. You all know that scientists use what we call model systems  which are creatures    white rats or fruit flies    that are kind of stand ins for all other animals  including people. And the idea is that what's true for a person will also be true for the white rat. And by and large  that turns out to be the case. But you can take the idea of a model system too far. And what I think we've done  is use males  in any species  as though they are the model system. The norm. The way things are supposed to be. And females as a kind of variant    something special that you only study after you get the basics down. And so  back to the insects. I think what that means is that people just couldn't see what was in front of them. Because they assumed that the world's stage was largely occupied by male players and females would only have minor  walk on roles. But when we do that  we really miss out on a lot of what nature is like. And we can also miss out on the way natural  living things  including people  can vary. And I think that's why we've used males as models in a lot of medical research  something that we know now to be a problem if we want the results to apply to both men and women. Well  the last thing I really love about insects is something that a lot of people find unnerving about them. They have little  tiny brains with very little cognitive ability  the way we normally think of it. They have complicated behavior  but they lack complicated brains. And so  we can't just think of them as though they're little people because they don't do things the way that we do. I really love that it's difficult to anthropomorphize insects  to look at them and just think of them like they're little people in exoskeletons  with six legs. Instead  you really have to accept them on their own terms  because insects make us question what's normal and what's natural. Now  you know  people write fiction and talk about parallel universes. They speculate about the supernatural  maybe the spirits of the departed walking among us. The allure of another world is something that people say is part of why they want to dabble in the paranormal. But as far as I'm concerned  who needs to be able to see dead people  when you can see live insects  Thank you. In the early days of Twitter  it was like a place of radical de shaming. People would admit shameful secrets about themselves  and other people would say   Oh my God  I'm exactly the same.  Voiceless people realized that they had a voice  and it was powerful and eloquent. If a newspaper ran some racist or homophobic column  we realized we could do something about it. We could get them. We could hit them with a weapon that we understood but they didn't    a social media shaming. Advertisers would withdraw their advertising. When powerful people misused their privilege  we were going to get them. This was like the democratization of justice. Hierarchies were being leveled out. We were going to do things better. Soon after that  a disgraced pop science writer called Jonah Lehrer    he'd been caught plagiarizing and faking quotes  and he was drenched in shame and regret  he told me. And he had the opportunity to publicly apologize at a foundation lunch. This was going to be the most important speech of his life. Maybe it would win him some salvation. He knew before he arrived that the foundation was going to be live streaming his event  but what he didn't know until he turned up  was that they'd erected a giant screen Twitter feed right next to his head. Another one in a monitor screen in his eye line. I don't think the foundation did this because they were monstrous. I think they were clueless  I think this was a unique moment when the beautiful naivety of Twitter was hitting the increasingly horrific reality. And here were some of the Tweets that were cascading into his eye line  as he was trying to apologize   Jonah Lehrer  boring us into forgiving him.  And   Jonah Lehrer has not proven that he is capable of feeling shame.  That one must have been written by the best psychiatrist ever  to know that about such a tiny figure behind a lectern. And   Jonah Lehrer is just a frigging sociopath.  That last word is a very human thing to do  to dehumanize the people we hurt. It's because we want to destroy people but not feel bad about it. Imagine if this was an actual court  and the accused was in the dark  begging for another chance  and the jury was yelling out   Bored  Sociopath   You know  when we watch courtroom dramas  we tend to identify with the kindhearted defense attorney  but give us the power  and we become like hanging judges. Power shifts fast. We were getting Jonah because he was perceived to have misused his privilege  but Jonah was on the floor then  and we were still kicking  and congratulating ourselves for punching up. And it began to feel weird and empty when there wasn't a powerful person who had misused their privilege that we could get. A day without a shaming began to feel like a day picking fingernails and treading water. Let me tell you a story. It's about a woman called Justine Sacco. She was a PR woman from New York with     Twitter followers  and she'd Tweet little acerbic jokes to them  like this one on a plane from New York to London   Weird German Dude  You're in first class. It's     . Get some deodorant.   Inner monologue as inhale BO. Thank god for pharmaceuticals.  So Justine chuckled to herself  and pressed send  and got no replies  and felt that sad feeling that we all feel when the Internet doesn't congratulate us for being funny. Black silence when the Internet doesn't talk back. And then she got to Heathrow  and she had a little time to spare before her final leg  so she thought up another funny little acerbic joke   Going to Africa. Hope I don't get AIDS. Just kidding. I'm white   And she chuckled to herself  pressed send  got on the plane  got no replies  turned off her phone  fell asleep  woke up    hours later  turned on her phone while the plane was taxiing on the runway  and straightaway there was a message from somebody that she hadn't spoken to since high school  that said   I am so sorry to see what's happening to you.  And then another message from a best friend   You need to call me right now. You are the worldwide number one trending topic on Twitter.  What had happened is that one of her     followers had sent the Tweet to a Gawker journalist  and he retweeted it to his        followers   And now  a funny holiday joke from IAC's PR boss  And then it was like a bolt of lightning. A few weeks later  I talked to the Gawker journalist. I emailed him and asked him how it felt  and he said   It felt delicious.  And then he said   But I'm sure she's fine.  But she wasn't fine  because while she slept  Twitter took control of her life and dismantled it piece by piece. First there were the philanthropists   If  JustineSacco's unfortunate words ... bother you  join me in supporting  CARE's work in Africa.   In light of ... disgusting  racist tweet  I'm donating to  care today  Then came the beyond horrified   ... no words for that horribly disgusting racist as fuck tweet from Justine Sacco. I am beyond horrified.  Was anybody on Twitter that night  A few of you. Did Justine's joke overwhelm your Twitter feed the way it did mine  It did mine  and I thought what everybody thought that night  which was   Wow  somebody's screwed  Somebody's life is about to get terrible   And I sat up in my bed  and I put the pillow behind my head  and then I thought  I'm not entirely sure that joke was intended to be racist. Maybe instead of gleefully flaunting her privilege  she was mocking the gleeful flaunting of privilege. There's a comedy tradition of this  like South Park or Colbert or Randy Newman. Maybe Justine Sacco's crime was not being as good at it as Randy Newman. In fact  when I met Justine a couple of weeks later in a bar  she was just crushed  and I asked her to explain the joke  and she said   Living in America puts us in a bit of a bubble when it comes to what is going on in the Third World. I was making of fun of that bubble.  You know  another woman on Twitter that night  a New Statesman writer Helen Lewis  she reviewed my book on public shaming and wrote that she Tweeted that night   I'm not sure that her joke was intended to be racist   and she said straightaway she got a fury of Tweets saying   Well  you're just a privileged bitch  too.  And so to her shame  she wrote  she shut up and watched as Justine's life got torn apart. It started to get darker   Everyone go report this cunt  JustineSacco  Then came the calls for her to be fired.  Good luck with the job hunt in the new year.  GettingFired  Thousands of people around the world decided it was their duty to get her fired.   JustineSacco last tweet of your career.  SorryNotSorry Corporations got involved  hoping to sell their products on the back of Justine's annihilation   Next time you plan to tweet something stupid before you take off  make sure you are getting on a  Gogo flight   A lot of companies were making good money that night. You know  Justine's name was normally Googled    times a month. That month  between December the   th and the end of December  her name was Googled           times. And one Internet economist told me that that meant that Google made somewhere between         dollars and         dollars from Justine's annihilation  whereas those of us doing the actual shaming    we got nothing. We were like unpaid shaming interns for Google. And then came the trolls   I'm actually kind of hoping Justine Sacco gets aids  lol  Somebody else on that wrote   Somebody HIV positive should rape this bitch and then we'll find out if her skin color protects her from AIDS.  And that person got a free pass. Nobody went after that person. We were all so excited about destroying Justine  and our shaming brains are so simple minded  that we couldn't also handle destroying somebody who was inappropriately destroying Justine. Justine was really uniting a lot of disparate groups that night  from philanthropists to  rape the bitch.    JustineSacco I hope you get fired  You demented bitch... Just let the world know you're planning to ride bare back while in Africa.  Women always have it worse than men. When a man gets shamed  it's   I'm going to get you fired.  When a woman gets shamed  it's   I'm going to get you fired and raped and cut out your uterus.  And then Justine's employers got involved   IAC on  JustineSacco tweet  This is an outrageous  offensive comment. Employee in question currently unreachable on an intl flight.  And that's when the anger turned to excitement   All I want for Christmas is to see  JustineSacco's face when her plane lands and she checks her inbox voicemail.  fired   Oh man   justinesacco is going to have the most painful phone turning on moment ever when her plane lands.   We are about to watch this  JustineSacco bitch get fired. In REAL time. Before she even KNOWS she's getting fired.  What we had was a delightful narrative arc. We knew something that Justine didn't. Can you think of anything less judicial than this  Justine was asleep on a plane and unable to explain herself  and her inability was a huge part of the hilarity. On Twitter that night  we were like toddlers crawling towards a gun. Somebody worked out exactly which plane she was on  so they linked to a flight tracker website.  British Airways Flight    On time   arrives in   hour    minutes  A hashtag began trending worldwide    hasJustineLandedYet   It is kinda wild to see someone self destruct without them even being aware of it.  hasJustineLandedYet   Seriously. I just want to go home to go to bed  but everyone at the bar is SO into  HasJustineLandedYet. Can't look away. Can't leave.    HasJustineLandedYet may be the best thing to happen to my Friday night.   Is no one in Cape Town going to the airport to tweet her arrival  Come on  twitter  I'd like pictures  And guess what  Yes there was.   JustineSacco HAS in fact landed at Cape Town international. And if you want to know what it looks like to discover that you've just been torn to shreds because of a misconstrued liberal joke  not by trolls  but by nice people like us  this is what it looks like   ... She's decided to wear sunnies as a disguise.  So why did we do it  I think some people were genuinely upset  but I think for other people  it's because Twitter is basically a mutual approval machine. We surround ourselves with people who feel the same way we do  and we approve each other  and that's a really good feeling. And if somebody gets in the way  we screen them out. And do you know what that's the opposite of  It's the opposite of democracy. We wanted to show that we cared about people dying of AIDS in Africa. Our desire to be seen to be compassionate is what led us to commit this profoundly un compassionate act. As Meghan O'Gieblyn wrote in the Boston Review   This isn't social justice. It's a cathartic alternative.  For the past three years  I've been going around the world meeting people like Justine Sacco    and believe me  there's a lot of people like Justine Sacco. There's more every day. And we want to think they're fine  but they're not fine. The people I met were mangled. They talked to me about depression  and anxiety and insomnia and suicidal thoughts. One woman I talked to  who also told a joke that landed badly  she stayed home for a year and a half. Before that  she worked with adults with learning difficulties  and was apparently really good at her job. Justine was fired  of course  because social media demanded it. But it was worse than that. She was losing herself. She was waking up in the middle of the night  forgetting who she was. She was got because she was perceived to have misused her privilege. And of course  that's a much better thing to get people for than the things we used to get people for  like having children out of wedlock. But the phrase  misuse of privilege  is becoming a free pass to tear apart pretty much anybody we choose to. It's becoming a devalued term  and it's making us lose our capacity for empathy and for distinguishing between serious and unserious transgressions. Justine had     Twitter followers  and so to make it work  she had to be fictionalized. Word got around that she was the daughter the mining billionaire Desmond Sacco.  Let us not be fooled by  JustineSacco her father is a SA mining billionaire. She's not sorry. And neither is her father.  I thought that was true about Justine  until I met her at a bar  and I asked her about her billionaire father  and she said   My father sells carpets.  And I think back on the early days of Twitter  when people would admit shameful secrets about themselves  and other people would say   Oh my God  I'm exactly the same.  These days  the hunt is on for people's shameful secrets. You can lead a good  ethical life  but some bad phraseology in a Tweet can overwhelm it all  become a clue to your secret inner evil. Maybe there's two types of people in the world  those people who favor humans over ideology  and those people who favor ideology over humans. I favor humans over ideology  but right now  the ideologues are winning  and they're creating a stage for constant artificial high dramas where everybody's either a magnificent hero or a sickening villain  even though we know that's not true about our fellow humans. What's true is that we are clever and stupid  what's true is that we're grey areas. The great thing about social media was how it gave a voice to voiceless people  but we're now creating a surveillance society  where the smartest way to survive is to go back to being voiceless. Let's not do that. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Thank you  Jon. Jon Ronson  Thanks  Bruno. BG  Don't go away. What strikes me about Justine's story is also the fact that if you Google her name today  this story covers the first     pages of Google results    there is nothing else about her. In your book  you mention another story of another victim who actually got taken on by a reputation management firm  and by creating blogs and posting nice  innocuous stories about her love for cats and holidays and stuff  managed to get the story off the first couple pages of Google results  but it didn't last long. A couple of weeks later  they started creeping back up to the top result. Is this a totally lost battle  Jon Ronson  You know  I think the very best thing we can do  if you see a kind of unfair or an ambiguous shaming  is to speak up  because I think the worst thing that happened to Justine was that nobody supported her    like  everyone was against her  and that is profoundly traumatizing  to be told by tens of thousands of people that you need to get out. But if a shaming happens and there's a babble of voices  like in a democracy  where people are discussing it  I think that's much less damaging. So I think that's the way forward  but it's hard  because if you do stand up for somebody  it's incredibly unpleasant. BG  So let's talk about your experience  because you stood up by writing this book. By the way  it's mandatory reading for everybody  okay  You stood up because the book actually puts the spotlight on shamers. And I assume you didn't only have friendly reactions on Twitter. JR  It didn't go down that well with some people. I mean  you don't want to just concentrate    because lots of people understood  and were really nice about the book. But yeah  for    years I've been writing stories about abuses of power  and when I say the powerful people over there in the military  or in the pharmaceutical industry  everybody applauds me. As soon as I say   We are the powerful people abusing our power now   I get people saying   Well you must be a racist too.  BG  So the other night    yesterday    we were at dinner  and there were two discussions going on. On one side you were talking with people around the table    and that was a nice  constructive discussion. On the other  every time you turned to your phone  there is this deluge of insults. JR  Yeah. This happened last night. We had like a TED dinner last night. We were chatting and it was lovely and nice  and I decided to check Twitter. Somebody said   You are a white supremacist.  And then I went back and had a nice conversation with somebody  and then I went back to Twitter  somebody said my very existence made the world a worse place. My friend Adam Curtis says that maybe the Internet is like a John Carpenter movie from the     s  when eventually everyone will start screaming at each other and shooting each other  and then eventually everybody would flee to somewhere safer  and I'm starting to think of that as a really nice option. BG  Jon  thank you. JR  Thank you  Bruno. So on my way here  the passenger next to me and I had a very interesting conversation during my flight. He told me   It seems like the United States has run out of jobs  because they're just making some up  cat psychologist  dog whisperer  tornado chaser.  A couple of seconds later  he asked me   So what do you do   And I was like   Peacebuilder   Every day  I work to amplify the voices of women and to highlight their experiences and their participation in peace processes and conflict resolution  and because of my work  I recognize that the only way to ensure the full participation of women globally is by reclaiming religion. Now  this matter is vitally important to me. As a young Muslim woman  I am very proud of my faith. It gives me the strength and conviction to do my work every day. It's the reason I can be here in front of you. But I can't overlook the damage that has been done in the name of religion  not just my own  but all of the world's major faiths. The misrepresentation and misuse and manipulation of religious scripture has influenced our social and cultural norms  our laws  our daily lives  to a point where we sometimes don't recognize it. My parents moved from Libya  North Africa  to Canada in the early     s  and I am the middle child of    children. Yes    . But growing up  I saw my parents  both religiously devout and spiritual people  pray and praise God for their blessings  namely me of course  but among others.  Laughter  They were kind and funny and patient  limitlessly patient  the kind of patience that having    kids forces you to have. And they were fair. I was never subjected to religion through a cultural lens. I was treated the same  the same was expected of me. I was never taught that God judged differently based on gender. And my parents' understanding of God as a merciful and beneficial friend and provider shaped the way I looked at the world. Now  of course  my upbringing had additional benefits. Being one of    children is Diplomacy    .  Laughter  To this day  I am asked where I went to school  like   Did you go to Kennedy School of Government   and I look at them and I'm like   No  I went to the Murabit School of International Affairs.  It's extremely exclusive. You would have to talk to my mom to get in. Lucky for you  she's here. But being one of    children and having    siblings teaches you a lot about power structures and alliances. It teaches you focus  you have to talk fast or say less  because you will always get cut off. It teaches you the importance of messaging. You have to ask questions in the right way to get the answers you know you want  and you have to say no in the right way to keep the peace. But the most important lesson I learned growing up was the importance of being at the table. When my mom's favorite lamp broke  I had to be there when she was trying to find out how and by who  because I had to defend myself  because if you're not  then the finger is pointed at you  and before you know it  you will be grounded. I am not speaking from experience  of course. When I was    in       I completed high school and I moved from Canada    Saskatoon    to Zawiya  my parents' hometown in Libya  a very traditional city. Mind you  I had only ever been to Libya before on vacation  and as a seven year old girl  it was magic. It was ice cream and trips to the beach and really excited relatives. Turns out it's not the same as a    year old young lady. I very quickly became introduced to the cultural aspect of religion. The words  haram     meaning religiously prohibited    and  aib     meaning culturally inappropriate    were exchanged carelessly  as if they meant the same thing and had the same consequences. And I found myself in conversation after conversation with classmates and colleagues  professors  friends  even relatives  beginning to question my own role and my own aspirations. And even with the foundation my parents had provided for me  I found myself questioning the role of women in my faith. So at the Murabit School of International Affairs  we go very heavy on the debate  and rule number one is do your research  so that's what I did  and it surprised me how easy it was to find women in my faith who were leaders  who were innovative  who were strong    politically  economically  even militarily. Khadija financed the Islamic movement in its infancy. We wouldn't be here if it weren't for her. So why weren't we learning about her  Why weren't we learning about these women  Why were women being relegated to positions which predated the teachings of our faith  And why  if we are equal in the eyes of God  are we not equal in the eyes of men  To me  it all came back to the lessons I had learned as a child. The decision maker  the person who gets to control the message  is sitting at the table  and unfortunately  in every single world faith  they are not women. Religious institutions are dominated by men and driven by male leadership  and they create policies in their likeness  and until we can change the system entirely  then we can't realistically expect to have full economic and political participation of women. Our foundation is broken. My mom actually says  you can't build a straight house on a crooked foundation. In       the Libyan revolution broke out  and my family was on the front lines. And there's this amazing thing that happens in war  a cultural shift almost  very temporary. And it was the first time that I felt it was not only acceptable for me to be involved  but it was encouraged. It was demanded. Myself and other women had a seat at the table. We weren't holding hands or a medium. We were part of decision making. We were information sharing. We were crucial. And I wanted and needed for that change to be permanent. Turns out  that's not that easy. It only took a few weeks before the women that I had previously worked with were returning back to their previous roles  and most of them were driven by words of encouragement from religious and political leaders  most of whom cited religious scripture as their defense. It's how they gained popular support for their opinions. So initially  I focused on the economic and political empowerment of women. I thought that would lead to cultural and social change. It turns out  it does a little  but not a lot. I decided to use their defense as my offense  and I began to cite and highlight Islamic scripture as well. In      and       my organization led the single largest and most widespread campaign in Libya. We entered homes and schools and universities  even mosques. We spoke to        people directly  and hundreds of thousands more through billboards and television commercials  radio commercials and posters. And you're probably wondering how a women's rights organization was able to do this in communities which had previously opposed our sheer existence. I used scripture. I used verses from the Quran and sayings of the Prophet  Hadiths  his sayings which are  for example   The best of you is the best to their family.   Do not let your brother oppress another.  For the first time  Friday sermons led by local community imams promoted the rights of women. They discussed taboo issues  like domestic violence. Policies were changed. In certain communities  we actually had to go as far as saying the International Human Rights Declaration  which you opposed because it wasn't written by religious scholars  well  those same principles are in our book. So really  the United Nations just copied us. By changing the message  we were able to provide an alternative narrative which promoted the rights of women in Libya. It's something that has now been replicated internationally  and while I am not saying it's easy    believe me  it's not. Liberals will say you're using religion and call you a bad conservative. Conservatives will call you a lot of colorful things. I've heard everything from   Your parents must be extremely ashamed of you     false  they're my biggest fans    to  You will not make it to your next birthday     again wrong  because I did. And I remain a very strong believer that women's rights and religion are not mutually exclusive. But we have to be at the table. We have to stop giving up our position  because by remaining silent  we allow for the continued persecution and abuse of women worldwide. By saying that we're going to fight for women's rights and fight extremism with bombs and warfare  we completely cripple local societies which need to address these issues so that they're sustainable. It is not easy  challenging distorted religious messaging. You will have your fair share of insults and ridicule and threats. But we have to do it. We have no other option than to reclaim the message of human rights  the principles of our faith  not for us  not for the women in your families  not for the women in this room  not even for the women out there  but for societies that would be transformed with the participation of women. And the only way we can do that  our only option  is to be  and remain  at the table. Thank you. This is a map of New York State that was made in      by the General Drafting Company. It's an extremely famous map among cartography nerds  because down here at the bottom of the Catskill Mountains  there is a little town called Roscoe    actually  this will go easier if I just put it up here    There's Roscoe  and then right above Roscoe is Rockland  New York  and then right above that is the tiny town of Agloe  New York. Agloe  New York  is very famous to cartographers  because it's a paper town. It's also known as a copyright trap. Mapmakers    because my map of New York and your map of New York are going to look very similar  on account of the shape of New York    often  mapmakers will insert fake places onto their maps  in order to protect their copyright. Because then  if my fake place shows up on your map  I can be well and truly sure that you have robbed me. Agloe is a scrabblization of the initials of the two guys who made this map  Ernest Alpers and Otto  G.  Lindberg  and they released this map in     . Decades later  Rand McNally releases a map with Agloe  New York  on it  at the same exact intersection of two dirt roads in the middle of nowhere. Well  you can imagine the delight over at General Drafting. They immediately call Rand McNally  and they say   We've caught you  We made Agloe  New York  up. It is a fake place. It's a paper town. We're going to sue your pants off   And Rand McNally says   No  no  no  no  Agloe is real.  Because people kept going to that intersection of two dirt roads    in the middle of nowhere  expecting there to be a place called Agloe    someone built a place called Agloe  New York. It had a gas station  a general store  two houses at its peak. And this is of course a completely irresistible metaphor to a novelist  because we would all like to believe that the stuff that we write down on paper can change the actual world in which we're actually living  which is why my third book is called  Paper Towns . But what interests me ultimately more than the medium in which this happened  is the phenomenon itself. It's easy enough to say that the world shapes our maps of the world  right  Like the overall shape of the world is obviously going to affect our maps. But what I find a lot more interesting is the way that the manner in which we map the world changes the world. Because the world would truly be a different place if North were down. And the world would be a truly different place if Alaska and Russia weren't on opposite sides of the map. And the world would be a different place if we projected Europe to show it in its actual size. The world is changed by our maps of the world. The way that we choose    sort of  our personal cartographic enterprise  also shapes the map of our lives  and that in turn shapes our lives. I believe that what we map changes the life we lead. And I don't mean that in some  like  secret y Oprah's Angels network  like  you can think your way  out of cancer sense. But I do believe that while maps don't show you where you will go in your life  they show you where you might go. You very rarely go to a place that isn't on your personal map. So I was a really terrible student when I was a kid. My GPA was consistently in the low  s. And I think the reason that I was such a terrible student is that I felt like education was just a series of hurdles that had been erected before me  and I had to jump over in order to achieve adulthood. And I didn't really want to jump over these hurdles  because they seemed completely arbitrary  so I often wouldn't  and then people would threaten me  you know  they'd threaten me with this  going on  my  permanent record   or  You'll never get a good job.  I didn't want a good job  As far as I could tell at eleven or twelve years old  like  people with good jobs woke up very early in the morning  and the men who had good jobs  one of the first things they did was tie a strangulation item of clothing around their necks. They literally put nooses on themselves  and then they went off to their jobs  whatever they were. That's not a recipe for a happy life. These people    in my  symbol obsessed  twelve year old imagination    these people who are strangling themselves as one of the first things they do each morning  they can't possibly be happy. Why would I want to jump over all of these hurdles and have that be the end  That's a terrible end  And then  when I was in tenth grade  I went to this school  Indian Springs School  a small boarding school  outside of Birmingham  Alabama. And all at once I became a learner. And I became a learner  because I found myself in a community of learners. I found myself surrounded by people who celebrated intellectualism and engagement  and who thought that my ironic oh so cool disengagement wasn't clever  or funny  but  like  it was a simple and unspectacular response to very complicated and compelling problems. And so I started to learn  because learning was cool. I learned that some infinite sets are bigger than other infinite sets  and I learned that iambic pentameter is and why it sounds so good to human ears. I learned that the Civil War was a nationalizing conflict  I learned some physics  I learned that correlation shouldn't be confused with causation    all of these things  by the way  enriched my life on a literally daily basis. And it's true that I don't use most of them for my  job   but that's not what it's about for me. It's about cartography. What is the process of cartography  It's  you know  sailing upon some land  and thinking   I think I'll draw that bit of land   and then wondering   Maybe there's some more land to draw.  And that's when learning really began for me. It's true that I had teachers that didn't give up on me  and I was very fortunate to have those teachers  because I often gave them cause to think there was no reason to invest in me. But a lot of the learning that I did in high school wasn't about what happened inside the classroom  it was about what happened outside of the classroom. For instance  I can tell you that  There's a certain Slant of light  Winter Afternoons    That oppresses  like the Heft Of Cathedral Tunes     not because I memorized Emily Dickinson in school when I was in high school  but because there was a girl when I was in high school  and her name was Amanda  and I had a crush on her  and she liked Emily Dickinson poetry. The reason I can tell you what opportunity cost is  is because one day when I was playing Super Mario Kart on my couch  my friend Emmet walked in  and he said   How long have you been playing Super Mario Kart   And I said   I don't know  like  six hours   and he said   Do you realize that if you'd worked at Baskin Robbins those six hours  you could have made    dollars  so in some ways  you just paid thirty dollars to play Super Mario Kart.  And I was  like   I'll take that deal.  But I learned what opportunity cost is. And along the way  the map of my life got better. It got bigger  it contained more places. There were more things that might happen  more futures I might have. It wasn't a formal  organized learning process  and I'm happy to admit that. It was spotty  it was inconsistent  there was a lot I didn't know. I might know  you know  Cantor's idea that some infinite sets are larger than other infinite sets  but I didn't really understand the calculus behind that idea. I might know the idea of opportunity cost  but I didn't know the law of diminishing returns. But the great thing about imagining learning as cartography  instead of imagining it as arbitrary hurdles that you have to jump over  is that you see a bit of coastline  and that makes you want to see more. And so now I do know at least some of the calculus that underlies all of that stuff. So  I had one learning community in high school  then I went to another for college  and then I went to another  when I started working at a magazine called  Booklist   where I was an assistant  surrounded by astonishingly well read people. And then I wrote a book. And like all authors dream of doing  I promptly quit my job. And for the first time since high school  I found myself without a learning community  and it was miserable. I hated it. I read many  many books during this two year period. I read books about Stalin  and books about how the Uzbek people came to identify as Muslims  and I read books about how to make atomic bombs  but it just felt like I was creating my own hurdles  and then jumping over them myself  instead of feeling the excitement of being part of a community of learners  a community of people who are engaged together in the cartographic enterprise of trying to better understand and map the world around us. And then  in       I met that guy. His name is Ze Frank. I didn't actually meet him  just on the Internet. Ze Frank was running  at the time  a show called  The Show with Ze Frank   and I discovered the show  and that was my way back into being a community learner again. Here's Ze talking about Las Vegas  Almost everything here was brought from somewhere else    the sort of rocks  the trees  the waterfalls. These fish are almost as out of place as my pig that flew. Contrasted to the scorching desert that surrounds this place  so are these people. Things from all over the world have been rebuilt here  away from their histories  and away from the people that experience them differently. Sometimes improvements were made    even the Sphinx got a nose job. Here  there's no reason to feel like you're missing anything. This New York means the same to me as it does to everyone else. Everything is out of context  and that means context allows for everything  Self Parking  Events Center  Shark Reef. This fabrication of place could be one of the world's greatest achievements  because no one belongs here  everyone does. As I walked around this morning  I noticed most of the buildings were huge mirrors reflecting the sun back into the desert. But unlike most mirrors  which present you with an outside view of yourself embedded in a place  these mirrors come back empty. John Green  Makes me nostalgic for the days when you could see the pixels in online video. Ze isn't just a great public intellectual  he's also a brilliant community builder  and the community of people that built up around these videos was in many ways a community of learners. So we played Ze Frank at chess collaboratively  and we beat him. We organized ourselves to take a young man on a road trip across the United States. We turned the Earth into a sandwich  by having one person hold a piece of bread at one point on the Earth  and on the exact opposite point of the Earth  have another person holding a piece of bread. I realize that these are silly ideas  but they are also  learny  ideas  and that was what was so exciting to me  and if you go online  you can find communities like this all over the place. Follow the calculus tag on Tumblr  and yes  you will see people complaining about calculus  but you'll also see people re blogging those complaints  making the argument that calculus is interesting and beautiful  and here's a way in to thinking about the problem that you find unsolvable. You can go to places like Reddit  and find sub Reddits  like  Ask a Historian  or  Ask Science   where you can ask people who are in these fields a wide range of questions  from very serious ones to very silly ones. But to me  the most interesting communities of learners that are growing up on the Internet right now are on YouTube  and admittedly  I am biased. But I think in a lot of ways  the YouTube page resembles a classroom. Look for instance at  Minute Physics   a guy who's teaching the world about physics  As of July          the Higgs boson is the last fundamental piece of the standard model of particle physics to be discovered experimentally. But  you might ask  why was the Higgs boson included in the standard model  alongside well known particles like electrons and photons and quarks  if it hadn't been discovered back then in the     s  Good question. There are two main reasons. First  just like the electron is an excitation in the electron field  the Higgs boson is simply a particle which is an excitation of the everywhere permeating Higgs field. The Higgs field in turn plays an integral role in our model for the weak nuclear force. In particular  the Higgs field helps explain why it's so weak. We'll talk more about this in a later video  but even though weak nuclear theory was confirmed in the     s  in the equations  the Higgs field is so inextricably jumbled with the weak force  that until now we've been unable to confirm its actual and independent existence. JG  Or here's a video that I made as part of my show  Crash Course   talking about World War I  of the Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand  on June           by a Bosnian Serb nationalist named Gavrilo Princip. Quick aside  It's worth noting that the first big war of the twentieth century began with an act of terrorism. So Franz Ferdinand wasn't particularly well liked by his uncle  the emperor Franz Joseph    now that is a mustache  But even so  the assassination led Austria to issue an ultimatum to Serbia  whereupon Serbia accepted some  but not all  of Austria's demands  leading Austria to declare war against Serbia. And then Russia  due to its alliance with the Serbs  mobilized its army. Germany  because it had an alliance with Austria  told Russia to stop mobilizing  which Russia failed to do  so then Germany mobilized its own army  declared war on Russia  cemented an alliance with the Ottomans  and then declared war on France  because  you know  France. And it's not just physics and world history that people are choosing to learn through YouTube. Here's a video about abstract mathematics. because they make you go every single day. And you're learning about  I don't know  the sums of infinite series. That's a high school topic  right  Which is odd  because it's a cool topic  but they somehow manage to ruin it anyway. So I guess that's why they allow infinite series in the curriculum. So  in a quite understandable need for distraction  you're doodling and thinking more about what the plural of  series  should be than about the topic at hand   serieses    seriese    seriesen   and  serii   Or is it that the singular should be changed  one  serie   or  serum   just like the singular of  sheep  should be  shoop.  But the whole concept of things like                        and so on approaches one  is useful if  say  you want to draw a line of elephants  each holding the tail of the next one  normal elephant  young elephant  baby elephant  dog sized elephant  puppy sized elephant  all the way down to Mr. Tusks and beyond. Which is at least a tiny bit awesome  because you can get an infinite number of elephants in a line  and still have it fit across a single notebook page. JG  And lastly  here's Destin  from  Smarter Every Day   talking about the conservation of angular momentum  and  since it's YouTube  cats  So you've probably observed that cats almost always land on their feet. Today's question is  why  Like most simple questions  there's a very complex answer. For instance  let me reword this question  How does a cat go from feet up to feet down in a falling reference frame  without violating the conservation of angular momentum  JG  So  here's something all four of these videos have in common  They all have more than half a million views on YouTube. And those are people watching not in classrooms  but because they are part of the communities of learning that are being set up by these channels. And I said earlier that YouTube is like a classroom to me  and in many ways it is  because here is the instructor    it's like the old fashioned classroom  here's the instructor  and then beneath the instructor are the students  and they're all having a conversation. And I know that YouTube comments have a very bad reputation in the world of the Internet  but in fact  if you go on comments for these channels  what you'll find is people engaging the subject matter  asking difficult  complicated questions that are about the subject matter  and then other people answering those questions. And because the YouTube page is set up so that the page in which I'm talking to you is on the exact    the place where I'm talking to you is on the exact same page as your comments  you are participating in a live and real and active way in the conversation. And because I'm in comments usually  I get to participate with you. And you find this whether it's world history  or mathematics  or science  or whatever it is. You also see young people using the tools and the sort of genres of the Internet in order to create places for intellectual engagement  instead of the ironic detachment that maybe most of us associate with memes and other Internet conventions    you know   Got bored. Invented calculus.  Or  here's Honey Boo Boo criticizing industrial capitalism    Liberal capitalism is not at all the Good of humanity. Quite the contrary  it is the vehicle of savage  destructive nihilism.   In case you can't see what she says ... yeah. I really believe that these spaces  these communities  have become for a new generation of learners  the kind of communities  the kind of cartographic communities that I had when I was in high school  and then again when I was in college. And as an adult  re finding these communities has re introduced me to a community of learners  and has encouraged me to continue to be a learner even in my adulthood  so that I no longer feel like learning is something reserved for the young. Vi Hart and  Minute Physics  introduced me to all kinds of things that I didn't know before. And I know that we all hearken back to the days of the Parisian salon in the Enlightenment  or to the Algonquin Round Table  and wish   Oh  I wish I could have been a part of that  I wish I could have laughed at Dorothy Parker's jokes.  But I'm here to tell you that these places exist  they still exist. They exist in corners of the Internet  where old men fear to tread. And I truly  truly believe that when we invented Agloe  New York  in the     s  when we made Agloe real  we were just getting started. Thank you. In       when I painted the minaret of Jara Mosque in my hometown of Gab s  in the south of Tunisia  I never thought that graffiti would bring so much attention to a city. At the beginning  I was just looking for a wall in my hometown  and it happened that the minaret was built in '  . And for    years  those    meters of concrete stayed grey. When I met the imam for the first time  and I told him what I wanted to do  he was like   Thank God you finally came   and he told me that for years he was waiting for somebody to do something on it. The most amazing thing about this imam is that he didn't ask me anything    neither a sketch  or what I was going to write. In every work that I create  I write messages with my style of calligraffiti    a mix of calligraphy and graffiti. I use quotes or poetry. For the minaret  I thought that the most relevant message to be put on a mosque should come from the Quran  so I picked this verse   Oh humankind  we have created you from a male and a female  and made you people and tribe  so you may know each other.  It was a universal call for peace  tolerance  and acceptance coming from the side that we don't usually portray in a good way in the media. I was amazed to see how the local community reacted to the painting  and how it made them proud to see the minaret getting so much attention from international press all around the world. For the imam  it was not just the painting  it was really deeper than that. He hoped that this minaret would become a monument for the city  and attract people to this forgotten place of Tunisia. The universality of the message  the political context of Tunisia at this time  and the fact that I was writing Quran in a graffiti way were not insignificant. It reunited the community. Bringing people  future generations  together through Arabic calligraphy is what I do. Writing messages is the essence of my artwork. What is funny  actually  is that even Arabic speaking people really need to focus a lot to decipher what I'm writing. You don't need to know the meaning to feel the piece. I think that Arabic script touches your soul before it reaches your eyes. There is a beauty in it that you don't need to translate. Arabic script speaks to anyone  I believe  to you  to you  to you  to anybody  and then when you get the meaning  you feel connected to it. I always make sure to write messages that are relevant to the place where I'm painting  but messages that have a universal dimension  so anybody around the world can connect to it. I was born and raised in France  in Paris  and I started learning how to write and read Arabic when I was   . Today I only write messages in Arabic. One of the reasons this is so important to me  is because of all the reaction that I've experienced all around the world. In Rio de Janeiro  I translated this Portuguese poem from Gabriela T rres Barbosa  who was giving an homage to the poor people of the favela  and then I painted it on the rooftop. The local community were really intrigued by what I was doing  but as soon as I gave them the meaning of the calligraphy  they thanked me  as they felt connected to the piece. In South Africa  in Cape Town  the local community of Philippi offered me the only concrete wall of the slum. It was a school  and I wrote on it a quote from Nelson Mandela  saying    in Arabic    which means   It seems impossible until it's done.  Then this guy came to me and said   Man  why you don't write in English   and I replied to him   I would consider your concern legit if you asked me why I didn't write in Zulu.  In Paris  once  there was this event  and someone gave his wall to be painted. And when he saw I was painting in Arabic  he got so mad    actually  hysterical    and he asked for the wall to be erased. I was mad and disappointed. But a week later  the organizer of the event asked me to come back  and he told me that there was a wall right in front of this guy's house. So  this guy    like  was forced to see it every day. At the beginning  I was going to write    In Arabic    which means   In your face   but    I decided to be smarter and I wrote    In Arabic    which means   Open your heart.  I'm really proud of my culture  and I'm trying to be an ambassador of it through my artwork. And I hope that I can break the stereotypes we all know  with the beauty of Arabic script. Today  I don't write the translation of the message anymore on the wall. I don't want the poetry of the calligraphy to be broken  as it's art and you can appreciate it without knowing the meaning  as you can enjoy any music from other countries. Some people see that as a rejection or a closed door  but for me  it's more an invitation    to my language  to my culture  and to my art. Thank you. Seventy thousand years ago  our ancestors were insignificant animals. The most important thing to know about prehistoric humans is that they were unimportant. Their impact on the world was not much greater than that of jellyfish or fireflies or woodpeckers. Today  in contrast  we control this planet. And the question is  How did we come from there to here  How did we turn ourselves from insignificant apes  minding their own business in a corner of Africa  into the rulers of planet Earth  Usually  we look for the difference between us and all the other animals on the individual level. We want to believe    I want to believe    that there is something special about me  about my body  about my brain  that makes me so superior to a dog or a pig  or a chimpanzee. But the truth is that  on the individual level  I'm embarrassingly similar to a chimpanzee. And if you take me and a chimpanzee and put us together on some lonely island  and we had to struggle for survival to see who survives better  I would definitely place my bet on the chimpanzee  not on myself. And this is not something wrong with me personally. I guess if they took almost any one of you  and placed you alone with a chimpanzee on some island  the chimpanzee would do much better. The real difference between humans and all other animals is not on the individual level  it's on the collective level. Humans control the planet because they are the only animals that can cooperate both flexibly and in very large numbers. Now  there are other animals    like the social insects  the bees  the ants    that can cooperate in large numbers  but they don't do so flexibly. Their cooperation is very rigid. There is basically just one way in which a beehive can function. And if there's a new opportunity or a new danger  the bees cannot reinvent the social system overnight. They cannot  for example  execute the queen and establish a republic of bees  or a communist dictatorship of worker bees. Other animals  like the social mammals    the wolves  the elephants  the dolphins  the chimpanzees    they can cooperate much more flexibly  but they do so only in small numbers  because cooperation among chimpanzees is based on intimate knowledge  one of the other. I'm a chimpanzee and you're a chimpanzee  and I want to cooperate with you. I need to know you personally. What kind of chimpanzee are you  Are you a nice chimpanzee  Are you an evil chimpanzee  Are you trustworthy  If I don't know you  how can I cooperate with you  The only animal that can combine the two abilities together and cooperate both flexibly and still do so in very large numbers is us  Homo sapiens. One versus one  or even    versus     chimpanzees might be better than us. But  if you pit       humans against       chimpanzees  the humans will win easily  for the simple reason that a thousand chimpanzees cannot cooperate at all. And if you now try to cram         chimpanzees into Oxford Street  or into Wembley Stadium  or Tienanmen Square or the Vatican  you will get chaos  complete chaos. Just imagine Wembley Stadium with         chimpanzees. Complete madness. In contrast  humans normally gather there in tens of thousands  and what we get is not chaos  usually. What we get is extremely sophisticated and effective networks of cooperation. All the huge achievements of humankind throughout history  whether it's building the pyramids or flying to the moon  have been based not on individual abilities  but on this ability to cooperate flexibly in large numbers. Think even about this very talk that I'm giving now  I'm standing here in front of an audience of about     or     people  most of you are complete strangers to me. Similarly  I don't really know all the people who have organized and worked on this event. I don't know the pilot and the crew members of the plane that brought me over here  yesterday  to London. I don't know the people who invented and manufactured this microphone and these cameras  which are recording what I'm saying. I don't know the people who wrote all the books and articles that I read in preparation for this talk. And I certainly don't know all the people who might be watching this talk over the Internet  somewhere in Buenos Aires or in New Delhi. Nevertheless  even though we don't know each other  we can work together to create this global exchange of ideas. This is something chimpanzees cannot do. They communicate  of course  but you will never catch a chimpanzee traveling to some distant chimpanzee band to give them a talk about bananas or about elephants  or anything else that might interest chimpanzees. Now cooperation is  of course  not always nice  all the horrible things humans have been doing throughout history    and we have been doing some very horrible things    all those things are also based on large scale cooperation. Prisons are a system of cooperation  slaughterhouses are a system of cooperation  concentration camps are a system of cooperation. Chimpanzees don't have slaughterhouses and prisons and concentration camps. Now suppose I've managed to convince you perhaps that yes  we control the world because we can cooperate flexibly in large numbers. The next question that immediately arises in the mind of an inquisitive listener is  How  exactly  do we do it  What enables us alone  of all the animals  to cooperate in such a way  The answer is our imagination. We can cooperate flexibly with countless numbers of strangers  because we alone  of all the animals on the planet  can create and believe fictions  fictional stories. And as long as everybody believes in the same fiction  everybody obeys and follows the same rules  the same norms  the same values. All other animals use their communication system only to describe reality. A chimpanzee may say   Look  There's a lion  let's run away   Or   Look  There's a banana tree over there  Let's go and get bananas   Humans  in contrast  use their language not merely to describe reality  but also to create new realities  fictional realities. A human can say   Look  there is a god above the clouds  And if you don't do what I tell you to do  when you die  God will punish you and send you to hell.  And if you all believe this story that I've invented  then you will follow the same norms and laws and values  and you can cooperate. This is something only humans can do. You can never convince a chimpanzee to give you a banana by promising him   ... after you die  you'll go to chimpanzee heaven ...   ... and you'll receive lots and lots of bananas for your good deeds. So now give me this banana.  No chimpanzee will ever believe such a story. Only humans believe such stories  which is why we control the world  whereas the chimpanzees are locked up in zoos and research laboratories. Now you may find it acceptable that yes  in the religious field  humans cooperate by believing in the same fictions. Millions of people come together to build a cathedral or a mosque or fight in a crusade or a jihad  because they all believe in the same stories about God and heaven and hell. But what I want to emphasize is that exactly the same mechanism underlies all other forms of mass scale human cooperation  not only in the religious field. Take  for example  the legal field. Most legal systems today in the world are based on a belief in human rights. But what are human rights  Human rights  just like God and heaven  are just a story that we've invented. They are not an objective reality  they are not some biological effect about homo sapiens. Take a human being  cut him open  look inside  you will find the heart  the kidneys  neurons  hormones  DNA  but you won't find any rights. The only place you find rights are in the stories that we have invented and spread around over the last few centuries. They may be very positive stories  very good stories  but they're still just fictional stories that we've invented. The same is true of the political field. The most important factors in modern politics are states and nations. But what are states and nations  They are not an objective reality. A mountain is an objective reality. You can see it  you can touch it  you can ever smell it. But a nation or a state  like Israel or Iran or France or Germany  this is just a story that we've invented and became extremely attached to. The same is true of the economic field. The most important actors today in the global economy are companies and corporations. Many of you today  perhaps  work for a corporation  like Google or Toyota or McDonald's. What exactly are these things  They are what lawyers call legal fictions. They are stories invented and maintained by the powerful wizards we call lawyers. And what do corporations do all day  Mostly  they try to make money. Yet  what is money  Again  money is not an objective reality  it has no objective value. Take this green piece of paper  the dollar bill. Look at it    it has no value. You cannot eat it  you cannot drink it  you cannot wear it. But then came along these master storytellers    the big bankers  the finance ministers  the prime ministers    and they tell us a very convincing story   Look  you see this green piece of paper  It is actually worth    bananas.  And if I believe it  and you believe it  and everybody believes it  it actually works. I can take this worthless piece of paper  go to the supermarket  give it to a complete stranger whom I've never met before  and get  in exchange  real bananas which I can actually eat. This is something amazing. You could never do it with chimpanzees. Chimpanzees trade  of course   Yes  you give me a coconut  I'll give you a banana.  That can work. But  you give me a worthless piece of paper and you except me to give you a banana  No way  What do you think I am  a human  Money  in fact  is the most successful story ever invented and told by humans  because it is the only story everybody believes. Not everybody believes in God  not everybody believes in human rights  not everybody believes in nationalism  but everybody believes in money  and in the dollar bill. Take  even  Osama Bin Laden. He hated American politics and American religion and American culture  but he had no objection to American dollars. He was quite fond of them  actually. To conclude  then  We humans control the world because we live in a dual reality. All other animals live in an objective reality. Their reality consists of objective entities  like rivers and trees and lions and elephants. We humans  we also live in an objective reality. In our world  too  there are rivers and trees and lions and elephants. But over the centuries  we have constructed on top of this objective reality a second layer of fictional reality  a reality made of fictional entities  like nations  like gods  like money  like corporations. And what is amazing is that as history unfolded  this fictional reality became more and more powerful so that today  the most powerful forces in the world are these fictional entities. Today  the very survival of rivers and trees and lions and elephants depends on the decisions and wishes of fictional entities  like the United States  like Google  like the World Bank    entities that exist only in our own imagination. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Yuval  you have a new book out. After Sapiens  you wrote another one  and it's out in Hebrew  but not yet translated into ... Yuval Noah Harari  I'm working on the translation as we speak. BG  In the book  if I understand it correctly  you argue that the amazing breakthroughs that we are experiencing right now not only will potentially make our lives better  but they will create    and I quote you     ... new classes and new class struggles  just as the industrial revolution did.  Can you elaborate for us  YNH  Yes. In the industrial revolution  we saw the creation of a new class of the urban proletariat. And much of the political and social history of the last     years involved what to do with this class  and the new problems and opportunities. Now  we see the creation of a new massive class of useless people. As computers become better and better in more and more fields  there is a distinct possibility that computers will out perform us in most tasks and will make humans redundant. And then the big political and economic question of the   st century will be   What do we need humans for    or at least   What do we need so many humans for   BG  Do you have an answer in the book  YNH  At present  the best guess we have is to keep them happy with drugs and computer games ... but this doesn't sound like a very appealing future. BG  Ok  so you're basically saying in the book and now  that for all the discussion about the growing evidence of significant economic inequality  we are just kind of at the beginning of the process  YNH  Again  it's not a prophecy  it's seeing all kinds of possibilities before us. One possibility is this creation of a new massive class of useless people. Another possibility is the division of humankind into different biological castes  with the rich being upgraded into virtual gods  and the poor being degraded to this level of useless people. BG  I feel there is another TED talk coming up in a year or two. Thank you  Yuval  for making the trip. YNH  Thanks
