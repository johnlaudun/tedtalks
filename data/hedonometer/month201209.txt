In System D  this is a store  and what I mean by that is that this is a photograph I took in Makoko  shantytown in Lagos  Nigeria. It's built over the lagoon  and there are no streets where there can be stores to shop  and so the store comes to you. And in the same community  this is business synergy. This is the boat that that lady was paddling around in  and this artisan makes the boat and the paddles and sells directly to the people who need the boat and the paddles. And this is a global business. Ogandiro smokes fish in Makoko in Lagos  and I asked her   Where does the fish come from   And I thought she'd say   Oh  you know  up the lagoon somewhere  or maybe across Africa   but you'll be happy to know she said it came from here  it comes from the North Sea. It's caught here  frozen  shipped down to Lagos  smoked  and sold for a tiny increment of profit on the streets of Lagos. And this is a business incubator. This is Olusosun dump  the largest garbage dump in Lagos  and       people work here  and I found this out from this fellow  Andrew Saboru. Andrew spent    years scavenging materials on the dump  earned enough money to turn himself into a contract scaler  which meant he carried a scale and went around and weighed all the materials that people had scavenged from the dump. Now he's a scrap dealer. That's his little depot behind him  and he earns twice the Nigerian minimum wage. This is a shopping mall. This is Oshodi Market in Lagos. Jorge Luis Borges had a story called  The Aleph   and the Aleph is a point in the world where absolutely everything exists  and for me  this image is a point in the world where absolutely everything exists. So  what am I talking about when I talk about System D  It's traditionally called the informal economy  the underground economy  the black market. I don't conceive of it that way. I think it's really important to understand that something like this is totally open. It's right there for you to find. All of this is happening openly  and aboveboard. There's nothing underground about it. It's our prejudgment that it's underground. I've pirated the term System D from the former French colonies. There's a word in French that is d brouillardise  that means to be self reliant  and the former French colonies have turned that into System D for the economy of self reliance  or the DIY economy. But governments hate the DIY economy  and that's why    I took this picture in       and this is the same market in         and I think  when the organizers of this conference were talking about radical openness  they didn't mean that the streets should be open and the people should be gone. I think what we have is a pickle problem. I had a friend who worked at a pickle factory  and the cucumbers would come flying down this conveyer belt  and his job was to pick off the ones that didn't look so good and throw them in the bin labeled  relish  where they'd be crushed and mixed with vinegar and used for other kinds of profit. This is the pickle economy. We're all focusing on   this is a statistic from earlier this month in the Financial Times   we're all focusing on the luxury economy. It's worth  .  trillion dollars every year  and that's a vast amount of money  right  That's three times the Gross Domestic Product of Switzerland. So it's vast. But it should come with an asterisk  and the asterisk is that it excludes two thirds of the workers of the world.  .  billion people around the world work in the economy that is unregulated and informal. That's a huge number  and what does that mean  Well  it means if it were united in a single political system  one country  call it  The United Street Sellers Republic   the U.S.S.R.  or  Bazaaristan   it would be worth    trillion dollars every year  and that would make it the second largest economy in the world  after the United States. And given that projections are that the bulk of economic growth over the next    years will come from emerging economies in the developing world  it could easily overtake the United States and become the largest economy in the world. So the implications of that are vast  because it means that this is where employment is    .  billion people   and this is where we can create a more egalitarian world  because people are actually able to earn money and live and thrive  as Andrew Saboru did. Big businesses have recognized this  and what's fascinating about this slide  it's not that the guys can carry boxes on their heads and run around without dropping them off. it's that the Gala sausage roll is a product that's made by a global company called UAC foods that's active throughout Africa and the Middle East  but the Gala sausage roll is not sold in stores. UAC foods has recognized that it won't sell if it's in stores. It's only sold by a phalanx of street hawkers who run around the streets of Lagos at bus stations and in traffic jams and sell it as a snack  and it's been sold that way for    years. It's a business plan for a corporation. And it's not just in Africa. Here's Mr. Clean looking amorously at all the other Procter   Gamble products  and Procter   Gamble  you know  the statistic always cited is that Wal Mart is their largest customer  and it's true  as one store  Wal Mart buys    percent  thus    percent of Procter   Gamble's business is with Wal Mart  but their largest market segment is something that they call  high frequency stores   which is all these tiny kiosks and the lady in the canoe and all these other businesses that exist in System D  the informal economy  and Procter   Gamble makes    percent of its money from that market segment  and it's the only market segment that's growing. So Procter   Gamble says   We don't care whether a store is incorporated or registered or anything like that. We want our products in that store.  And then there's mobile phones. This is an ad for MTN  which is a South African multinational active in about    countries  and when they came into Nigeria   Nigeria is the big dog in Africa. One in seven Africans is a Nigerian  and so everyone wants in to the mobile phone market in Nigeria. And when MTN came in  they wanted to sell the mobile service like I get in the United States or like people get here in the U.K. or in Europe    expensive monthly plans  you get a phone  you pay overages  you're killed with fees    and their plan crashed and burned. And they went back to the drawing board  and they retooled  and they came up with another plan  We don't sell you the phone  we don't sell you the monthly plan. We only sell you airtime. And where's the airtime sold  It's sold at umbrella stands all over the streets  where people are unregistered  unlicensed  but MTN makes most of its profits  perhaps    percent of its profits  from selling through System D  the informal economy. And where do the phones come from  Well  they come from here. This is in Guangzhou  China  and if you go upstairs in this rather sleepy looking electronics mall  you find the Guangzhou Dashatou second hand trade center  and if you go in there  you follow the guys with the muscles who are carrying the boxes  and where are they going  They're going to Eddy in Lagos. Now  most of the phones there are not second hand at all. The name is a misnomer. Most of them are pirated. They have the name brand on them  but they're not manufactured by the name brand. Now  are there downsides to that  Well  I guess. You know  China has no   Versace without the vowels. Zhuomani instead of Armani. S. Guuuci  and     Laughter   Applause  All around the world this is how products are being distributed  so  for instance  in one street market on Rua    de Mar o in S o Paulo  Brazil  you can buy fake designer glasses. You can buy cloned cologne. You can buy pirated DVDs  of course. You can buy New York Yankees caps in all sorts of unauthorized patterns. You can buy cuecas baratas  designer underwear that isn't really manufactured by a designer  and even pirated evangelical mixtapes.  Laughter  Now  businesses tend to complain about this  and their  they  I don't want to take away from their entire validity of complaining about it  but I did ask a major sneaker manufacturer earlier this year what they thought about piracy  and they told me   Well  you can't quote me on this  because if you quote me on this  I have to kill you   but they use piracy as market research. The sneaker manufacturer told me that if they find that Pumas are being pirated  or Adidas are being pirated and their sneakers aren't being pirated  they know they've done something wrong.  Laughter  So it's very important to them to track piracy exactly because of this  and the people who are buying  the pirates  are not their customers anyway  because their customers want the real deal. Now  there's another problem. This is a real street sign in Lagos  Nigeria. All of System D really doesn't pay taxes  right  And when I think about that  first of all I think that government is a social contract between the people and the government  and if the government isn't transparent  then the people aren't going to be transparent either  but also that we're blaming the little guy who doesn't pay his taxes  and we're not recognizing that everyone's fudging things all over the world  including some extremely respected businesses  and I'll give you one example. There was one company that paid       bribes in the first decade of this millennium  and a million dollars in bribes every business day  right  All over the world. And that company was the big German electronics giant Siemens. So this goes on in the formal economy as well as the informal economy  so it's wrong of us to blame   and I'm not singling out Siemens  I'm saying everyone does it. Okay  I just want to end by saying that if Adam Smith had framed out a theory of the flea market instead of the free market  what would be some of the principles  First  it would be to understand that it could be considered a cooperative  and this is a thought from the Brazilian legal scholar Roberto Mangabeira Unger. Cooperative development is a way forward. Secondly  from the  Austrian  anarchist philosopher Paul Feyerabend  facts are relative  and what is a massive right of self reliance to a Nigerian businessperson is considered unauthorized and horrible to other people  and we have to recognize that there are differences in how people define things and what their facts are. And third is  and I'm taking this from the great American beat poet Allen Ginsberg  that alternate economies barter and different kinds of currency  alternate currencies are also very important  and he talked about buying what he needed just with his good looks. And so I just want to leave you there  and say that this economy is a tremendous force for global development and we need to think about it that way. Thank you very much.  Applause  I'd like to tell you about two games of chess. The first happened in       in which Garry Kasparov  a human  lost to Deep Blue  a machine. To many  this was the dawn of a new era  one where man would be dominated by machine. But here we are     years on  and the greatest change in how we relate to computers is the iPad  not HAL. The second game was a freestyle chess tournament in       in which man and machine could enter together as partners  rather than adversaries  if they so chose. At first  the results were predictable. Even a supercomputer was beaten by a grandmaster with a relatively weak laptop. The surprise came at the end. Who won  Not a grandmaster with a supercomputer  but actually two American amateurs using three relatively weak laptops. Their ability to coach and manipulate their computers to deeply explore specific positions effectively counteracted the superior chess knowledge of the grandmasters and the superior computational power of other adversaries. This is an astonishing result  average men  average machines beating the best man  the best machine. And anyways  isn't it supposed to be man versus machine  Instead  it's about cooperation  and the right type of cooperation. We've been paying a lot of attention to Marvin Minsky's vision for artificial intelligence over the last    years. It's a sexy vision  for sure. Many have embraced it. It's become the dominant school of thought in computer science. But as we enter the era of big data  of network systems  of open platforms  and embedded technology  I'd like to suggest it's time to reevaluate an alternative vision that was actually developed around the same time. I'm talking about J.C.R. Licklider's human computer symbiosis  perhaps better termed  intelligence augmentation   I.A. Licklider was a computer science titan who had a profound effect on the development of technology and the Internet. His vision was to enable man and machine to cooperate in making decisions  controlling complex situations without the inflexible dependence on predetermined programs. Note that word  cooperate.  Licklider encourages us not to take a toaster and make it Data from  Star Trek   but to take a human and make her more capable. Humans are so amazing    how we think  our non linear approaches  our creativity  iterative hypotheses  all very difficult if possible at all for computers to do. Licklider intuitively realized this  contemplating humans setting the goals  formulating the hypotheses  determining the criteria  and performing the evaluation. Of course  in other ways  humans are so limited. We're terrible at scale  computation and volume. We require high end talent management to keep the rock band together and playing. Licklider foresaw computers doing all the routinizable work that was required to prepare the way for insights and decision making. Silently  without much fanfare  this approach has been compiling victories beyond chess. Protein folding  a topic that shares the incredible expansiveness of chess   there are more ways of folding a protein than there are atoms in the universe. This is a world changing problem with huge implications for our ability to understand and treat disease. And for this task  supercomputer field brute force simply isn't enough. Foldit  a game created by computer scientists  illustrates the value of the approach. Non technical  non biologist amateurs play a video game in which they visually rearrange the structure of the protein  allowing the computer to manage the atomic forces and interactions and identify structural issues. This approach beat supercomputers    percent of the time and tied    percent of the time. Foldit recently made a notable and major scientific discovery by deciphering the structure of the Mason Pfizer monkey virus. A protease that had eluded determination for over    years was solved was by three players in a matter of days  perhaps the first major scientific advance to come from playing a video game. Last year  on the site of the Twin Towers  the      memorial opened. It displays the names of the thousands of victims using a beautiful concept called  meaningful adjacency.  It places the names next to each other based on their relationships to one another  friends  families  coworkers. When you put it all together  it's quite a computational challenge        victims        adjacency requests  the importance of the overall physical specifications and the final aesthetics. When first reported by the media  full credit for such a feat was given to an algorithm from the New York City design firm Local Projects. The truth is a bit more nuanced. While an algorithm was used to develop the underlying framework  humans used that framework to design the final result. So in this case  a computer had evaluated millions of possible layouts  managed a complex relational system  and kept track of a very large set of measurements and variables  allowing the humans to focus on design and compositional choices. So the more you look around you  the more you see Licklider's vision everywhere. Whether it's augmented reality in your iPhone or GPS in your car  human computer symbiosis is making us more capable. So if you want to improve human computer symbiosis  what can you do  You can start by designing the human into the process. Instead of thinking about what a computer will do to solve the problem  design the solution around what the human will do as well. When you do this  you'll quickly realize that you spent all of your time on the interface between man and machine  specifically on designing away the friction in the interaction. In fact  this friction is more important than the power of the man or the power of the machine in determining overall capability. That's why two amateurs with a few laptops handily beat a supercomputer and a grandmaster. What Kasparov calls process is a byproduct of friction. The better the process  the less the friction. And minimizing friction turns out to be the decisive variable. Or take another example  big data. Every interaction we have in the world is recorded by an ever growing array of sensors  your phone  your credit card  your computer. The result is big data  and it actually presents us with an opportunity to more deeply understand the human condition. The major emphasis of most approaches to big data focus on   How do I store this data  How do I search this data  How do I process this data   These are necessary but insufficient questions. The imperative is not to figure out how to compute  but what to compute. How do you impose human intuition on data at this scale  Again  we start by designing the human into the process. When PayPal was first starting as a business  their biggest challenge was not   How do I send money back and forth online   It was   How do I do that without being defrauded by organized crime   Why so challenging  Because while computers can learn to detect and identify fraud based on patterns  they can't learn to do that based on patterns they've never seen before  and organized crime has a lot in common with this audience  brilliant people  relentlessly resourceful  entrepreneurial spirit    Laughter    and one huge and important difference  purpose. And so while computers alone can catch all but the cleverest fraudsters  catching the cleverest is the difference between success and failure. There's a whole class of problems like this  ones with adaptive adversaries. They rarely if ever present with a repeatable pattern that's discernable to computers. Instead  there's some inherent component of innovation or disruption  and increasingly these problems are buried in big data. For example  terrorism. Terrorists are always adapting in minor and major ways to new circumstances  and despite what you might see on TV  these adaptations  and the detection of them  are fundamentally human. Computers don't detect novel patterns and new behaviors  but humans do. Humans  using technology  testing hypotheses  searching for insight by asking machines to do things for them. Osama bin Laden was not caught by artificial intelligence. He was caught by dedicated  resourceful  brilliant people in partnerships with various technologies. As appealing as it might sound  you cannot algorithmically data mine your way to the answer. There is no  Find Terrorist  button  and the more data we integrate from a vast variety of sources across a wide variety of data formats from very disparate systems  the less effective data mining can be. Instead  people will have to look at data and search for insight  and as Licklider foresaw long ago  the key to great results here is the right type of cooperation  and as Kasparov realized  that means minimizing friction at the interface. Now this approach makes possible things like combing through all available data from very different sources  identifying key relationships and putting them in one place  something that's been nearly impossible to do before. To some  this has terrifying privacy and civil liberties implications. To others it foretells of an era of greater privacy and civil liberties protections  but privacy and civil liberties are of fundamental importance. That must be acknowledged  and they can't be swept aside  even with the best of intents. So let's explore  through a couple of examples  the impact that technologies built to drive human computer symbiosis have had in recent time. In October        U.S. and coalition forces raided an al Qaeda safe house in the city of Sinjar on the Syrian border of Iraq. They found a treasure trove of documents      biographical sketches of foreign fighters. These foreign fighters had left their families in the Gulf  the Levant and North Africa to join al Qaeda in Iraq. These records were human resource forms. The foreign fighters filled them out as they joined the organization. It turns out that al Qaeda  too  is not without its bureaucracy.  Laughter  They answered questions like   Who recruited you    What's your hometown    What occupation do you seek   In that last question  a surprising insight was revealed. The vast majority of foreign fighters were seeking to become suicide bombers for martyrdom    hugely important  since between      and       Iraq had       suicide bombings  a major source of instability. Analyzing this data was hard. The originals were sheets of paper in Arabic that had to be scanned and translated. The friction in the process did not allow for meaningful results in an operational time frame using humans  PDFs and tenacity alone. The researchers had to lever up their human minds with technology to dive deeper  to explore non obvious hypotheses  and in fact  insights emerged. Twenty percent of the foreign fighters were from Libya     percent of those from a single town in Libya  hugely important since prior statistics put that figure at three percent. It also helped to hone in on a figure of rising importance in al Qaeda  Abu Yahya al Libi  a senior cleric in the Libyan Islamic fighting group. In March of       he gave a speech  after which there was a surge in participation amongst Libyan foreign fighters. Perhaps most clever of all  though  and least obvious  by flipping the data on its head  the researchers were able to deeply explore the coordination networks in Syria that were ultimately responsible for receiving and transporting the foreign fighters to the border. These were networks of mercenaries  not ideologues  who were in the coordination business for profit. For example  they charged Saudi foreign fighters substantially more than Libyans  money that would have otherwise gone to al Qaeda. Perhaps the adversary would disrupt their own network if they knew they cheating would be jihadists. In January        a devastating  .  earthquake struck Haiti  third deadliest earthquake of all time  left one million people     percent of the population  homeless. One seemingly small aspect of the overall relief effort became increasingly important as the delivery of food and water started rolling. January and February are the dry months in Haiti  yet many of the camps had developed standing water. The only institution with detailed knowledge of Haiti's floodplains had been leveled in the earthquake  leadership inside. So the question is  which camps are at risk  how many people are in these camps  what's the timeline for flooding  and given very limited resources and infrastructure  how do we prioritize the relocation  The data was incredibly disparate. The U.S. Army had detailed knowledge for only a small section of the country. There was data online from a      environmental risk conference  other geospatial data  none of it integrated. The human goal here was to identify camps for relocation based on priority need. The computer had to integrate a vast amount of geospacial information  social media data and relief organization information to answer this question. By implementing a superior process  what was otherwise a task for    people over three months became a simple job for three people in    hours  all victories for human computer symbiosis. We're more than    years into Licklider's vision for the future  and the data suggests that we should be quite excited about tackling this century's hardest problems  man and machine in cooperation together. Thank you.  Applause  I'm going to tell you about why I became a sculptor  and you may think that sculptors  well  they deal with meta  they deal with objects  they deal with bodies  but I think  really  what I care about most is making space  and that's what I've called this talk  Making Space. Space that exists within us  and without us. So  when I was a child  I don't know how many of you grew up in the '  s  but I was sent upstairs for an enforced rest.  Laughter  It's a really bad idea. I mean  after lunch  you're  you know  you're six  and you want to go and climb a tree. But I had to go upstairs  this tiny little room that was actually made out of an old balcony  so it was incredibly hot  small and light  and I had to lie there. It was ridiculous. But anyway  for some reason  I promised myself that I wasn't going to move  that I was going to do this thing that Mummy wanted me to do. And there I was  lying there in this tiny space  hot  dark  claustrophobic  matchbox sized  behind my eyes  but it was really weird  like  after this went on for days  weeks  months  that space would get bigger and darker and cooler until I really looked forward to that half an hour of enforced immobility and rest  and I really looked forward to going to that place of darkness. Do you mind if we do something completely different  Can we all just close our eyes for a minute  Now  this isn't going to be freaky. It isn't some cultic thing.  Laughter  It's just  it's just  I just would like us all to go there. So I'm going to do it too. We'll all be there together. So close your eyes for a minute. Here we are  in a space  the subjective  collective space of the darkness of the body. I think of this as the place of imagination  of potential  but what are its qualities  It is objectless. There are no things in it. It is dimensionless. It is limitless. It is endless. Okay  open your eyes. That's the space that I think sculpture    which is a bit of a paradox  sculpture that is about making material propositions    but I think that's the space that sculpture can connect us with. So  imagine we're in the middle of America. You're asleep. You wake up  and without lifting your head from the earth on your sleeping bag  you can see for    miles. This is a dry lake bed. I was young. I'd just finished art school. I wanted to do something that was working directly with the world  directly with place. This was a wonderful place  because it was a place where you could imagine that you were the first person to be there. It was a place where nothing very much had happened. Anyway  bear with me. I picked up a hand sized stone  threw it as far as I was able  it was about    meters. I then cleared all the stones within that radius and made a pile. And that was the pile  by the way. And then  I stood on the pile  and threw all of those rocks out again  and here is rearranged desert. You could say  well  it doesn't look very different from when he started. What's all the fuss about  In fact  Chris was worried and said   Look  don't show them that slide  because they're just going to think you're another one of those crazy modern artists who doesn't do much. But the fact is  this is evidence of a living body on other bodies  rocks that have been the subject of geological formation  erosion  the action of time on objects. This is a place  in a way  that I just would like you to  in a way  look at differently because of this event that has happened in it  a human event  and in general  it just asks us to look again at this world  so different from  in a way  the world that we have been sharing with each other  the technological world  to look again at the elemental world. The elemental world that we all live in is that space that we all visited together  the darkness of the body. I wanted to start again with that environment  the environment of the intimate  subjective space that each of us lives in  but from the other side of appearance. So here is a daily activity of the studio. You can see I don't do much. I'm just standing there  again with my eyes closed  and other people are molding me  evidential. This is an indexical register of a lived moment of a body in time. Can we map that space  using the language of neutrinos or cosmic rays  taking the bounding condition of the body as its limit  but in complete reversal of  in a way  the most traditional Greek idea of pointing  In the old days they used to take a lump of Pentelic marble and drill from the surface in order to identify the skin  the appearance  what Aristotle defined as the distinction between substance and appearance  the thing that makes things visible  but here we're working from the other side. Or can we do it as an exclusive membrane  This is a lead case made around the space that my body occupied  but it's now void. This is a work called  Learning To See.  It's a bit of  well  we could call it night  we could call it the    percent of gravity that we don't know about  dark matter  placed in space  anyway  another version of a human space in space at large  but I don't know if you can see  the eyes are indicated  they're closed. It's called  Learning To See  because it's about an object that hopefully works reflexively and talks about that vision or connection with the darkness of the body that I see as a space of potential. Can we do it another way  using the language of particles around a nucleus  and talk about the body as an energy center  No longer about statues  no longer having to take that duty of standing  the standing of a human body  or the standing of a statue  release it  allow it to be an energy field  a space in space that talks about human life  between becoming an entropy as a sort of concentration of attention  a human place of possibility in space at large. Is there another way  Dark matter now placed against a horizon. If minds live in bodies  if bodies live in clothes  and then in rooms  and then in buildings  and then in cities  do they also have a final skin  and is that skin perceptual  The horizon. And is art about trying to imagine what lies beyond the horizon  Can we use  in a way  a body as an empty catalyst for a kind of empathy with the experience of space time as it is lived  as I am standing here in front of you trying to feel and make a connection in this space time that we are sharing  can we use  at it were  the memory of a body  of a human space in space to catalyze an experience  again  firsthand experience  of elemental time. Human time  industrial time  tested against the time of the tides  in which these memories of a particular body  that could be any body  multiplied as in the time of mechanical reproduction  many times  placed over three square miles  a mile out to sea  disappearing  in different conditions of day and night. You can see this work. It's on the mouth of the Mersey  just outside Liverpool. And there you can see what a Liverpool sea looks like on a typical afternoon. The pieces appear and disappear  but maybe more importantly    this is just looking north from the center of the installation    they create a field  a field that involves living and the surrogate bodies in a kind of relation  a relation with each other and a relation with that limit  the edge  the horizon. Just moving on  is it possible  taking that idea of mind  body  body building  to supplant the first body  the biological body  with the second  the body of architecture and the built environment. This is a work called  Room for the Great Australian Desert.  It's in an undefined location and I've never published where it is. It's an object for the mind. I think of it as a   st century Buddha. Again  the darkness of the body  now held within this bunker shape of the minimum position that a body needs to occupy  a crouching body. There's a hole at the anus  penis level. There are holes at ears. There are no holes at the eyes. There's a slot for the mouth. It's two and a half inches thick  concrete with a void interior. Again  a site found with a completely flat     degree horizon. This is just simply asking  again  as if we had arrived for the first time  what is the relationship of the human project to time and space  Taking that idiom of  as it were  the darkness of the body transferred to architecture  can you use architectural space not for living but as a metaphor  and use its systolic  diastolic smaller and larger spaces to provide a kind of firsthand somatic narrative for a journey through space  light and darkness  This is a work of some proportion and some weight that makes the body into a city  an aggregation of cells that are all interconnected and that allow certain visual access at certain places. The last work that I just wanted to share with you is  Blind Light   which is perhaps the most open work  and in a conference of radical openness  I think maybe this is as radical as I get  using light and water vapor as my materials. Here is a box filled at one and a half atmospheres of atmospheric pressure  with a cloud and with very bright light. As you walk towards the ever open threshold  you disappear  both to yourselves and to others. If you hold your hand out in front of you  you can't see it. If you look down  you can't see your feet. You are now consciousness without an object  freed from the dimensionful and measured way in which life links us to the obligatory. But this is a space that is actually filled with people  disembodied voices  and out of that ambient environment  when people come close to your own body zone  very close  they appear to you as representations. When they appear close to the edge  they are representations  representations in which the viewers have become the viewed. For me  art is not about objects of high monetary exchange. It's about reasserting our firsthand experience in present time. As John Cage said   We are not moving towards some kind of goal. We are at the goal  and it is changing with us. If art has any purpose  it is to open our eyes to that fact.  Thank you very much. Some years ago  I set out to try to understand if there was a possibility to develop biofuels on a scale that would actually compete with fossil fuels but not compete with agriculture for water  fertilizer or land. So here's what I came up with. Imagine that we build an enclosure where we put it just underwater  and we fill it with wastewater and some form of microalgae that produces oil  and we make it out of some kind of flexible material that moves with waves underwater  and the system that we're going to build  of course  will use solar energy to grow the algae  and they use CO   which is good  and they produce oxygen as they grow. The algae that grow are in a container that distributes the heat to the surrounding water  and you can harvest them and make biofuels and cosmetics and fertilizer and animal feed  and of course you'd have to make a large area of this  so you'd have to worry about other stakeholders like fishermen and ships and such things  but hey  we're talking about biofuels  and we know the importance of potentially getting an alternative liquid fuel. Why are we talking about microalgae  Here you see a graph showing you the different types of crops that are being considered for making biofuels  so you can see some things like soybean  which makes    gallons per acre per year  or sunflower or canola or jatropha or palm  and that tall graph there shows what microalgae can contribute. That is to say  microalgae contributes between       and       gallons per acre per year  compared to the    gallons per acre per year from soy. So what are microalgae  Microalgae are micro    that is  they're extremely small  as you can see here a picture of those single celled organisms compared to a human hair. Those small organisms have been around for millions of years and there's thousands of different species of microalgae in the world  some of which are the fastest growing plants on the planet  and produce  as I just showed you  lots and lots of oil. Now  why do we want to do this offshore  Well  the reason we're doing this offshore is because if you look at our coastal cities  there isn't a choice  because we're going to use waste water  as I suggested  and if you look at where most of the waste water treatment plants are  they're embedded in the cities. This is the city of San Francisco  which has     miles of sewer pipes under the city already  and it releases its waste water offshore. So different cities around the world treat their waste water differently. Some cities process it. Some cities just release the water. But in all cases  the water that's released is perfectly adequate for growing microalgae. So let's envision what the system might look like. We call it OMEGA  which is an acronym for Offshore Membrane Enclosures for Growing Algae. At NASA  you have to have good acronyms. So how does it work  I sort of showed you how it works already. We put waste water and some source of CO  into our floating structure  and the waste water provides nutrients for the algae to grow  and they sequester CO  that would otherwise go off into the atmosphere as a greenhouse gas. They of course use solar energy to grow  and the wave energy on the surface provides energy for mixing the algae  and the temperature is controlled by the surrounding water temperature. The algae that grow produce oxygen  as I've mentioned  and they also produce biofuels and fertilizer and food and other bi algal products of interest. And the system is contained. What do I mean by that  It's modular. Let's say something happens that's totally unexpected to one of the modules. It leaks. It's struck by lightning. The waste water that leaks out is water that already now goes into that coastal environment  and the algae that leak out are biodegradable  and because they're living in waste water  they're fresh water algae  which means they can't live in salt water  so they die. The plastic we'll build it out of is some kind of well known plastic that we have good experience with  and we'll rebuild our modules to be able to reuse them again. So we may be able to go beyond that when thinking about this system that I'm showing you  and that is to say we need to think in terms of the water  the fresh water  which is also going to be an issue in the future  and we're working on methods now for recovering the waste water. The other thing to consider is the structure itself. It provides a surface for things in the ocean  and this surface  which is covered by seaweeds and other organisms in the ocean  will become enhanced marine habitat so it increases biodiversity. And finally  because it's an offshore structure  we can think in terms of how it might contribute to an aquaculture activity offshore. So you're probably thinking   Gee  this sounds like a good idea. What can we do to try to see if it's real   Well  I set up laboratories in Santa Cruz at the California Fish and Game facility  and that facility allowed us to have big seawater tanks to test some of these ideas. We also set up experiments in San Francisco at one of the three waste water treatment plants  again a facility to test ideas. And finally  we wanted to see where we could look at what the impact of this structure would be in the marine environment  and we set up a field site at a place called Moss Landing Marine Lab in Monterey Bay  where we worked in a harbor to see what impact this would have on marine organisms. The laboratory that we set up in Santa Cruz was our skunkworks. It was a place where we were growing algae and welding plastic and building tools and making a lot of mistakes  or  as Edison said  we were finding the        ways that the system wouldn't work. Now  we grew algae in waste water  and we built tools that allowed us to get into the lives of algae so that we could monitor the way they grow  what makes them happy  how do we make sure that we're going to have a culture that will survive and thrive. So the most important feature that we needed to develop were these so called photobioreactors  or PBRs. These were the structures that would be floating at the surface made out of some inexpensive plastic material that'll allow the algae to grow  and we had built lots and lots of designs  most of which were horrible failures  and when we finally got to a design that worked  at about    gallons  we scaled it up to     gallons in San Francisco. So let me show you how the system works. We basically take waste water with algae of our choice in it  and we circulate it through this floating structure  this tubular  flexible plastic structure  and it circulates through this thing  and there's sunlight of course  it's at the surface  and the algae grow on the nutrients. But this is a bit like putting your head in a plastic bag. The algae are not going to suffocate because of CO   as we would. They suffocate because they produce oxygen  and they don't really suffocate  but the oxygen that they produce is problematic  and they use up all the CO . So the next thing we had to figure out was how we could remove the oxygen  which we did by building this column which circulated some of the water  and put back CO   which we did by bubbling the system before we recirculated the water. And what you see here is the prototype  which was the first attempt at building this type of column. The larger column that we then installed in San Francisco in the installed system. So the column actually had another very nice feature  and that is the algae settle in the column  and this allowed us to accumulate the algal biomass in a context where we could easily harvest it. So we would remove the algaes that concentrated in the bottom of this column  and then we could harvest that by a procedure where you float the algae to the surface and can skim it off with a net. So we wanted to also investigate what would be the impact of this system in the marine environment  and I mentioned we set up this experiment at a field site in Moss Landing Marine Lab. Well  we found of course that this material became overgrown with algae  and we needed then to develop a cleaning procedure  and we also looked at how seabirds and marine mammals interacted  and in fact you see here a sea otter that found this incredibly interesting  and would periodically work its way across this little floating water bed  and we wanted to hire this guy or train him to be able to clean the surface of these things  but that's for the future. Now really what we were doing  we were working in four areas. Our research covered the biology of the system  which included studying the way algae grew  but also what eats the algae  and what kills the algae. We did engineering to understand what we would need to be able to do to build this structure  not only on the small scale  but how we would build it on this enormous scale that will ultimately be required. I mentioned we looked at birds and marine mammals and looked at basically the environmental impact of the system  and finally we looked at the economics  and what I mean by economics is  what is the energy required to run the system  Do you get more energy out of the system than you have to put into the system to be able to make the system run  And what about operating costs  And what about capital costs  And what about  just  the whole economic structure  So let me tell you that it's not going to be easy  and there's lots more work to do in all four of those areas to be able to really make the system work. But we don't have a lot of time  and I'd like to show you the artist's conception of how this system might look if we find ourselves in a protected bay somewhere in the world  and we have in the background in this image  the waste water treatment plant and a source of flue gas for the CO   but when you do the economics of this system  you find that in fact it will be difficult to make it work. Unless you look at the system as a way to treat waste water  sequester carbon  and potentially for photovoltaic panels or wave energy or even wind energy  and if you start thinking in terms of integrating all of these different activities  you could also include in such a facility aquaculture. So we would have under this system a shellfish aquaculture where we're growing mussels or scallops. We'd be growing oysters and things that would be producing high value products and food  and this would be a market driver as we build the system to larger and larger scales so that it becomes  ultimately  competitive with the idea of doing it for fuels. So there's always a big question that comes up  because plastic in the ocean has got a really bad reputation right now  and so we've been thinking cradle to cradle. What are we going to do with all this plastic that we're going to need to use in our marine environment  Well  I don't know if you know about this  but in California  there's a huge amount of plastic that's used in fields right now as plastic mulch  and this is plastic that's making these tiny little greenhouses right along the surface of the soil  and this provides warming the soil to increase the growing season  it allows us to control weeds  and  of course  it makes the watering much more efficient. So the OMEGA system will be part of this type of an outcome  and that when we're finished using it in the marine environment  we'll be using it  hopefully  on fields. Where are we going to put this  and what will it look like offshore  Here's an image of what we could do in San Francisco Bay. San Francisco produces    million gallons a day of waste water. If we imagine a five day retention time for this system  we'd need     million gallons to accomodate  and that would be about       acres of these OMEGA modules floating in San Francisco Bay. Well  that's less than one percent of the surface area of the bay. It would produce  at       gallons per acre per year  it would produce over   million gallons of fuel  which is about    percent of the biodiesel  or of the diesel that would be required in San Francisco  and that's without doing anything about efficiency. Where else could we potentially put this system  There's lots of possibilities. There's  of course  San Francisco Bay  as I mentioned. San Diego Bay is another example  Mobile Bay or Chesapeake Bay  but the reality is  as sea level rises  there's going to be lots and lots of new opportunities to consider.  Laughter  So what I'm telling you about is a system of integrated activities. Biofuels production is integrated with alternative energy is integrated with aquaculture. I set out to find a pathway to innovative production of sustainable biofuels  and en route I discovered that what's really required for sustainability is integration more than innovation. Long term  I have great faith in our collective and connected ingenuity. I think there is almost no limit to what we can accomplish if we are radically open and we don't care who gets the credit. Sustainable solutions for our future problems are going to be diverse and are going to be many. I think we need to consider everything  everything from alpha to OMEGA. Thank you.  Applause  Chris Anderson  Just a quick question for you  Jonathan. Can this project continue to move forward within NASA or do you need some very ambitious green energy fund to come and take it by the throat  Jonathan Trent  So it's really gotten to a stage now in NASA where they would like to spin it out into something which would go offshore  and there are a lot of issues with doing it in the United States because of limited permitting issues and the time required to get permits to do things offshore. It really requires  at this point  people on the outside  and we're being radically open with this technology in which we're going to launch it out there for anybody and everybody who's interested to take it on and try to make it real. CA  So that's interesting. You're not patenting it. You're publishing it. JT  Absolutely. CA  All right. Thank you so much. JT  Thank you.  Applause  I thought I would start with a very brief history of cities. Settlements typically began with people clustered around a well  and the size of that settlement was roughly the distance you could walk with a pot of water on your head. In fact  if you fly over Germany  for example  and you look down and you see these hundreds of little villages  they're all about a mile apart. You needed easy access to the fields. And for hundreds  even thousands of years  the home was really the center of life. Life was very small for most people. It was a center of entertainment  of energy production  of work  a center of health care. That's where babies were born and people died. Then  with industrialization  everything started to become centralized. You had dirty factories that were moved to the outskirts of cities. Production was centralized in assembly plants. You had centralized energy production. Learning took place in schools. Health care took place in hospitals. And then you had networks that developed. You had water  sewer networks that allowed for this kind of unchecked expansion. You had separated functions  increasingly. You had rail networks that connected residential  industrial  commercial areas. You had auto networks. In fact  the model was really  give everybody a car  build roads to everything  and give people a place to park when they get there. It was not a very functional model. And we still live in that world  and this is what we end up with. So you have the sprawl of LA  the sprawl of Mexico City. You have these unbelievable new cities in China  which you might call tower sprawl. They're all building cities on the model that we invented in the '  s and '  s  which is really obsolete  I would argue  and there are hundreds and hundreds of new cities that are being planned all over the world. In China alone      million people  some say     million people  will move to the city over the next    years. That means building the equivalent of the entire built infrastructure of the US in    years. Imagine that. And we should all care about this whether you live in cities or not. Cities will account for    percent of the population growth     percent of the global CO      percent of energy use  but at the same time it's where people want to be  increasingly. More than half the people now in the world live in cities  and that will just continue to escalate. Cities are places of celebration  personal expression. You have the flash mobs of pillow fights that    I've been to a couple. They're quite fun. You have    Cities are where most of the wealth is created  and particularly in the developing world  it's where women find opportunities. That's a lot of the reason why cities are growing very quickly. Now there's some trends that will impact cities. First of all  work is becoming distributed and mobile. The office building is basically obsolete for doing private work. The home  once again  because of distributed computation    Communication is becoming a center of life  so it's a center of production and learning and shopping and health care and all of these things that we used to think of as taking place outside of the home. And increasingly  everything that people buy  every consumer product  in one way or another  can be personalized. And that's a very important trend to think about. So this is my image of the city of the future. In that it's a place for people  you know. Maybe not the way people dress  but    You know  the question now is  how can we have all the good things that we identify with cities without all the bad things  This is Bangalore. It took me a couple of hours to get a few miles in Bangalore last year. So with cities  you also have congestion and pollution and disease and all these negative things. How can we have the good stuff without the bad  So we went back and started looking at the great cities that evolved before the cars. Paris was a series of these little villages that came together  and you still see that structure today. The    arrondissements of Paris are these little neighborhoods. Most of what people need in life can be within a five  or    minute walk. And if you look at the data  when you have that kind of a structure  you get a very even distribution of the shops and the physicians and the pharmacies and the cafes in Paris. And then you look at cities that evolved after the automobile  and it's not that kind of a pattern. There's very little that's within a five minute walk of most areas of places like Pittsburgh. Not to pick on Pittsburgh  but most American cities really have evolved this way. So we said  well  let's look at new cities  and we're involved in a couple of new city projects in China. So we said  let's start with that neighborhood cell. We think of it as a compact urban cell. So provide most of what most people want within that    minute walk. This can also be a resilient electrical microgrid  community heating  power  communication networks  etc. can be concentrated there. Stewart Brand would put a micronuclear reactor right in the center  probably. And he might be right. And then we can form  in effect  a mesh network. It's something of an Internet typology pattern  so you can have a series of these neighborhoods. You can dial up the density    about        people per cell  if it's Cambridge. Go up to        if it's Manhattan density. You connect everything with mass transit and you provide most of what most people need within that neighborhood. You can begin to develop a whole typology of streetscapes and the vehicles that can go on them. I won't go through all of them. I'll just show one. This is Boulder. It's a great example of kind of a mobility parkway  a superhighway for joggers and bicyclists  where you can go from one end of the city to the other without crossing the street  and they also have bike sharing  which I'll get into in a minute. This is even a more interesting solution in Seoul  Korea. They took the elevated highway  they got rid of it  they reclaimed the street  the river down below  below the street  and you can go from one end of Seoul to the other without crossing a pathway for cars. The High Line in Manhattan is very similar. You have these rapidly emerging bike lanes all over the world. I lived in Manhattan for    years. I went back a couple of weekends ago  took this photograph of these fabulous new bike lanes that they have installed. They're still not to where Copenhagen is  where something like    percent of the trips within the city are by bicycle. It's mostly just because they have fantastic infrastructure there. We actually did exactly the wrong thing in Boston. The Big Dig    So we got rid of the highway but we created a traffic island  and it's certainly not a mobility pathway for anything other than cars. Mobility on demand is something we've been thinking about  so we think we need an ecosystem of these shared use vehicles connected to mass transit. These are some of the vehicles that we've been working on. But shared use is really key. If you share a vehicle  you can have at least four people use one vehicle  as opposed to one. We have Hubway here in Boston  the V lib' system in Paris. We've been developing  at the Media Lab  this little city car that is optimized for shared use in cities. We got rid of all the useless things like engines and transmissions. We moved everything to the wheels  so you have the drive motor  the steering motor  the breaking    all in the wheel. That left the chassis unencumbered  so you can do things like fold  so you can fold this little vehicle up to occupy a tiny little footprint. This was a video that was on European television last week showing the Spanish Minister of Industry driving this little vehicle  and when it's folded  it can spin. You don't need reverse. You don't need parallel parking. You just spin and go directly in. So we've been working with a company to commercialize this. My PhD student Ryan Chin presented these early ideas two years ago at a TEDx conference. So what's interesting is  then if you begin to add new things to it  like autonomy  you get out of the car  you park at your destination  you pat it on the butt  it goes and it parks itself  it charges itself  and you can get something like seven times as many vehicles in a given area as conventional cars  and we think this is the future. Actually  we could do this today. It's not really a problem. We can combine shared use and folding and autonomy and we get something like    times the land utilization with that kind of strategy. One of our graduate students then says  well  how does a driverless car communicate with pedestrians  You have nobody to make eye contact with. You don't know if it's going to run you over. So he's developing strategies so the vehicle can communicate with pedestrians  so    So the headlights are eyeballs  the pupils can dilate  we have directional audio  we can throw sound directly at people. What I love about this project is he solved a problem that doesn't exist yet  so    We also think that we can democratize access to bike lanes. You know  bike lanes are mostly used by young guys in stretchy pants. So    We think we can develop a vehicle that operates on bike lanes  accessible to elderly and disabled  women in skirts  businesspeople  and address the issues of energy congestion  mobility  aging and obesity simultaneously. That's our challenge. This is an early design for this little three wheel. It's an electronic bike. You have to pedal to operate it in a bike lane  but if you're an older person  that's a switch. If you're a healthy person  you might have to work really hard to go fast. You can dial in    calories going into work and     going home  when you can take a shower. We hope to have that built this fall. Housing is another area where we can really improve. Mayor Menino in Boston says lack of affordable housing for young people is one of the biggest problems the city faces. Developers say  OK  we'll build little teeny apartments. People say  we don't really want to live in a little teeny conventional apartment. So we're saying  let's build a standardized chassis  much like our car. Let's bring advanced technology into the apartment  technology enabled infill  give people the tools within this open loft chassis to go through a process of defining what their needs and values and activities are  and then a matching algorithm will match a unique assembly of integrated infill components  furniture  and cabinetry  that are personalized to that individual  and they give them the tools to go through the process and to refine it  and it's something like working with an architect  where the dialogue starts when you give an alternative to a person to react to. Now  the most interesting implementation of that for us is when you can begin to have robotic walls  so your space can convert from exercise to a workplace  if you run a virtual company. You have guests over  you have two guest rooms that are developed. You have a conventional one bedroom arrangement when you need it. Maybe that's most of the time. You have a dinner party. The table folds out to fit    people in otherwise a conventional one bedroom  or maybe you want a dance studio. I mean  architects have been thinking about these ideas for a long time. What we need to do now  develop things that can scale to those     million Chinese people that would like to live in the city  and very comfortably. We think we can make a very small apartment that functions as if it's twice as big by utilizing these strategies. I don't believe in smart homes. That's sort of a bogus concept. I think you have to build dumb homes and put smart stuff in it. And so we've been working on a chassis of the wall itself. You know  standardized platform with the motors and the battery when it operates  little solenoids that will lock it in place and get low voltage power. We think this can all be standardized  and then people can personalize the stuff that goes into that wall  and like the car  we can integrate all kinds of sensing to be aware of human activity  so if there's a baby or a puppy in the way  you won't have a problem. So the developers say  well  this is great. OK  so if we have a conventional building  we have a fixed envelope  maybe we can put in    units. If they function as if they're twice as big  we can get    units in. That means twice as much parking  though. Parking's really expensive. It's about        dollars per space to build a conventional parking spot inside a building. So if you can have folding and autonomy  you can do that in one seventh of the space. That goes down to        dollars per car  just for the cost of the parking. You add shared use  and you can even go further. We can also integrate all kinds of advanced technology through this process. There's a path to market for innovative companies to bring technology into the home. In this case  a project we're doing with Siemens. We have sensors on all the furniture  all the infill  that understands where people are and what they're doing. Blue light is very efficient  so we have these tunable    bit LED lighting fixtures. It recognizes where the person is  what they're doing  fills out the light when necessary to full spectrum white light  and saves maybe        percent in energy consumption  we think  over even conventional state of the art lighting systems. This just shows you the data that comes from the sensors that are embedded in the furniture. We don't really believe in cameras to do things in homes. We think these little wireless sensors are more effective. We think we can also personalize sunlight. That's sort of the ultimate personalization in some ways. So we've looked at articulating mirrors of the facade that can throw shafts of sunlight anywhere into the space  therefore allowing you to shade most of the glass on a hot day like today. In this case  she picks up her phone  she can map food preparation at the kitchen island to a particular location of sunlight. An algorithm will keep it in that location as long as she's engaged in that activity. This can be combined with LED lighting as well. We think workplaces should be shared. I mean  this is really the workplace of the future  I think. This is Starbucks  you know. Maybe a third    And you see everybody has their back to the wall and they have food and coffee down the way and they're in their own little personal bubble. We need shared spaces for interaction and collaboration. We're not doing a very good job with that. At the Cambridge Innovation Center  you can have shared desks. I've spent a lot of time in Finland at the design factory of Aalto University  where the they have a shared shop and shared fab lab  shared quiet spaces  electronics spaces  recreation places. We think ultimately  all of this stuff can come together  a new model for mobility  a new model for housing  a new model for how we live and work  a path to market for advanced technologies. But in the end  the main thing we need to focus on are people. Cities are all about people. They're places for people. There's no reason why we can't dramatically improve the livability and creativity of cities like they've done in Melbourne with the laneways while at the same time dramatically reducing CO  and energy. It's a global imperative. We have to get this right. Thank you. The murder happened a little over    years ago  January the   th        in a small bedroom community of Lynwood  California  just a few miles southeast of Los Angeles. A father came out of his house to tell his teenage son and his five friends that it was time for them to stop horsing around on the front lawn and on the sidewalk  to get home  finish their schoolwork  and prepare themselves for bed. And as the father was administering these instructions  a car drove by  slowly  and just after it passed the father and the teenagers  a hand went out from the front passenger window  and     Bam  Bam      killing the father. And the car sped off. The police  investigating officers  were amazingly efficient. They considered all the usual culprits  and in less than    hours  they had selected their suspect  Francisco Carrillo  a    year old kid who lived about two or three blocks away from where the shooting occurred. They found photos of him. They prepared a photo array  and the day after the shooting  they showed it to one of the teenagers  and he said   That's the picture. That's the shooter I saw that killed the father.  That was all a preliminary hearing judge had to listen to  to bind Mr. Carrillo over to stand trial for a first degree murder. In the investigation that followed before the actual trial  each of the other five teenagers was shown photographs  the same photo array. The picture that we best can determine was probably the one that they were shown in the photo array is in your bottom left hand corner of these mug shots. The reason we're not sure absolutely is because of the nature of evidence preservation in our judicial system  but that's another whole TEDx talk for later.  Laughter  So at the actual trial  all six of the teenagers testified  and indicated the identifications they had made in the photo array. He was convicted. He was sentenced to life imprisonment  and transported to Folsom Prison. So what's wrong  Straightforward  fair trial  full investigation. Oh yes  no gun was ever found. No vehicle was ever identified as being the one in which the shooter had extended his arm  and no person was ever charged with being the driver of the shooter's vehicle. And Mr. Carrillo's alibi  Which of those parents here in the room might not lie concerning the whereabouts of your son or daughter in an investigation of a killing  Sent to prison  adamantly insisting on his innocence  which he has consistently for    years. So what's the problem  The problems  actually  for this kind of case come manyfold from decades of scientific research involving human memory. First of all  we have all the statistical analyses from the Innocence Project work  where we know that we have  what           documented cases now where people have been wrongfully convicted and subsequently exonerated  some from death row  on the basis of later DNA analysis  and you know that over three quarters of all of those cases of exoneration involved only eyewitness identification testimony during the trial that convicted them. We know that eyewitness identifications are fallible. The other comes from an interesting aspect of human memory that's related to various brain functions but I can sum up for the sake of brevity here in a simple line  The brain abhors a vacuum. Under the best of observation conditions  the absolute best  we only detect  encode and store in our brains bits and pieces of the entire experience in front of us  and they're stored in different parts of the brain. So now  when it's important for us to be able to recall what it was that we experienced  we have an incomplete  we have a partial store  and what happens  Below awareness  with no requirement for any kind of motivated processing  the brain fills in information that was not there  not originally stored  from inference  from speculation  from sources of information that came to you  as the observer  after the observation. But it happens without awareness such that you don't  aren't even cognizant of it occurring. It's called reconstructed memories. It happens to us in all the aspects of our life  all the time. It was those two considerations  among others    reconstructed memory  the fact about the eyewitness fallibility    that was part of the instigation for a group of appeal attorneys led by an amazing lawyer named Ellen Eggers to pool their experience and their talents together and petition a superior court for a retrial for Francisco Carrillo. They retained me  as a forensic neurophysiologist  because I had expertise in eyewitness memory identification  which obviously makes sense for this case  right  But also because I have expertise and testify about the nature of human night vision. Well  what's that got to do with this  Well  when you read through the case materials in this Carrillo case  one of the things that suddenly strikes you is that the investigating officers said the lighting was good at the crime scene  at the shooting. All the teenagers testified during the trial that they could see very well. But this occurred in mid January  in the Northern Hemisphere  at   p.m. at night. So when I did the calculations for the lunar data and the solar data at that location on Earth at the time of the incident of the shooting  all right  it was well past the end of civil twilight and there was no moon up that night. So all the light in this area from the sun and the moon is what you see on the screen right here. The only lighting in that area had to come from artificial sources  and that's where I go out and I do the actual reconstruction of the scene with photometers  with various measures of illumination and various other measures of color perception  along with special cameras and high speed film  right  Take all the measurements and record them  right  And then take photographs  and this is what the scene looked like at the time of the shooting from the position of the teenagers looking at the car going by and shooting. This is looking directly across the street from where they were standing. Remember  the investigating officers' report said the lighting was good. The teenagers said they could see very well. This is looking down to the east  where the shooting vehicle sped off  and this is the lighting directly behind the father and the teenagers. As you can see  it is at best poor. No one's going to call this well lit  good lighting  and in fact  as nice as these pictures are  and the reason we take them is I knew I was going to have to testify in court  and a picture is worth more than a thousand words when you're trying to communicate numbers  abstract concepts like lux  the international measurement of illumination  the Ishihara color perception test values. When you present those to people who are not well versed in those aspects of science and that  they become salamanders in the noonday sun. It's like talking about the tangent of the visual angle  all right  Their eyes just glaze over  all right  A good forensic expert also has to be a good educator  a good communicator  and that's part of the reason why we take the pictures  to show not only where the light sources are  and what we call the spill  the distribution  but also so that it's easier for the trier of fact to understand the circumstances. So these are some of the pictures that  in fact  I used when I testified  but more importantly were  to me as a scientist  are those readings  the photometer readings  which I can then convert into actual predictions of the visual capability of the human eye under those circumstances  and from my readings that I recorded at the scene under the same solar and lunar conditions at the same time  so on and so forth  right  I could predict that there would be no reliable color perception  which is crucial for face recognition  and that there would be only scotopic vision  which means there would be very little resolution  what we call boundary or edge detection  and that furthermore  because the eyes would have been totally dilated under this light  the depth of field  the distance at which you can focus and see details  would have been less than    inches away. I testified to that to the court  and while the judge was very attentive  it had been a very  very long hearing for this petition for a retrial  and as a result  I noticed out of the corner of my eye that I thought that maybe the judge was going to need a little more of a nudge than just more numbers. And here I became a bit audacious  and I turned and I asked the judge  I said   Your Honor  I think you should go out and look at the scene yourself.  Now I may have used a tone which was more like a dare than a request    Laughter    but nonetheless  it's to this man's credit and his courage that he said   Yes  I will.  A shocker in American jurisprudence. So in fact  we found the same identical conditions  we reconstructed the entire thing again  he came out with an entire brigade of sheriff's officers to protect him in this community  all right   Laughter  We had him stand actually slightly in the street  so closer to the suspect vehicle  the shooter vehicle  than the actual teenagers were  so he stood a few feet from the curb toward the middle of the street. We had a car that came by  same identical car as described by the teenagers  right  It had a driver and a passenger  and after the car had passed the judge by  the passenger extended his hand  pointed it back to the judge as the car continued on  just as the teenagers had described it  right  Now  he didn't use a real gun in his hand  so he had a black object in his hand that was similar to the gun that was described. He pointed by  and this is what the judge saw. This is the car    feet away from the judge. There's an arm sticking out of the passenger side and pointed back at you. That's    feet away. Some of the teenagers said that in fact the car was    feet away when it shot. Okay. There's    feet. At this point  I became a little concerned. This judge is someone you'd never want to play poker with. He was totally stoic. I couldn't see a twitch of his eyebrow. I couldn't see the slightest bend of his head. I had no sense of how he was reacting to this  and after he looked at this reenactment  he turned to me and he says   Is there anything else you want me to look at   I said   Your honor   and I don't know whether I was emboldened by the scientific measurements that I had in my pocket and my knowledge that they are accurate  or whether it was just sheer stupidity  which is what the defense lawyers thought    Laughter    when they heard me say   Yes  Your Honor  I want you stand right there and I want the car to go around the block again and I want it to come and I want it to stop right in front of you  three to four feet away  and I want the passenger to extend his hand with a black object and point it right at you  and you can look at it as long as you want.  And that's what he saw.  Laughter  You'll notice  which was also in my test report  all the dominant lighting is coming from the north side  which means that the shooter's face would have been photo occluded. It would have been backlit. Furthermore  the roof of the car is causing what we call a shadow cloud inside the car which is making it darker. And this is three to four feet away. Why did I take the risk  I knew that the depth of field was    inches or less. Three to four feet  it might as well have been a football field away. This is what he saw. He went back  there was a few more days of evidence that was heard. At the end of it  he made the judgment that he was going to grant the petition for a retrial. And furthermore  he released Mr. Carrillo so that he could aid in the preparation of his own defense if the prosecution decided to retry him. Which they decided not to. He is now a freed man.  Applause  This is him embracing his grandmother in law. He    His girlfriend was pregnant when he went to trial  right  And she had a little baby boy. He and his son are both attending Cal State  Long Beach right now taking classes.  Applause  And what does this example    what's important to keep in mind for ourselves  First of all  there's a long history of antipathy between science and the law in American jurisprudence. I could regale you with horror stories of ignorance over decades of experience as a forensic expert of just trying to get science into the courtroom. The opposing council always fight it and oppose it. One suggestion is that all of us become much more attuned to the necessity  through policy  through procedures  to get more science in the courtroom  and I think one large step toward that is more requirements  with all due respect to the law schools  of science  technology  engineering  mathematics for anyone going into the law  because they become the judges. Think about how we select our judges in this country. It's very different than most other cultures. All right  The other one that I want to suggest  the caution that all of us have to have  I constantly have to remind myself  about just how accurate are the memories that we know are true  that we believe in  There is decades of research  examples and examples of cases like this  where individuals really  really believe. None of those teenagers who identified him thought that they were picking the wrong person. None of them thought they couldn't see the person's face. We all have to be very careful. All our memories are reconstructed memories. They are the product of what we originally experienced and everything that's happened afterwards. They're dynamic. They're malleable. They're volatile  and as a result  we all need to remember to be cautious  that the accuracy of our memories is not measured in how vivid they are nor how certain you are that they're correct. Thank you.  Applause  I want you to imagine this for a moment. Two men  Rahul and Rajiv  living in the same neighborhood  from the same educational background  similar occupation  and they both turn up at their local accident emergency complaining of acute chest pain. Rahul is offered a cardiac procedure  but Rajiv is sent home. What might explain the difference in the experience of these two nearly identical men  Rajiv suffers from a mental illness. The difference in the quality of medical care received by people with mental illness is one of the reasons why they live shorter lives than people without mental illness. Even in the best resourced countries in the world  this life expectancy gap is as much as    years. In the developing countries of the world  this gap is even larger. But of course  mental illnesses can kill in more direct ways as well. The most obvious example is suicide. It might surprise some of you here  as it did me  when I discovered that suicide is at the top of the list of the leading causes of death in young people in all countries in the world  including the poorest countries of the world. But beyond the impact of a health condition on life expectancy  we're also concerned about the quality of life lived. Now  in order for us to examine the overall impact of a health condition both on life expectancy as well as on the quality of life lived  we need to use a metric called the DALY  which stands for a Disability Adjusted Life Year. Now when we do that  we discover some startling things about mental illness from a global perspective. We discover that  for example  mental illnesses are amongst the leading causes of disability around the world. Depression  for example  is the third leading cause of disability  alongside conditions such as diarrhea and pneumonia in children. When you put all the mental illnesses together  they account for roughly    percent of the total global burden of disease. Indeed  mental illnesses are also very damaging to people's lives  but beyond just the burden of disease  let us consider the absolute numbers. The World Health Organization estimates that there are nearly four to five hundred million people living on our tiny planet who are affected by a mental illness. Now some of you here look a bit astonished by that number  but consider for a moment the incredible diversity of mental illnesses  from autism and intellectual disability in childhood  through to depression and anxiety  substance misuse and psychosis in adulthood  all the way through to dementia in old age  and I'm pretty sure that each and every one us present here today can think of at least one person  at least one person  who's affected by mental illness in our most intimate social networks. I see some nodding heads there. But beyond the staggering numbers  what's truly important from a global health point of view  what's truly worrying from a global health point of view  is that the vast majority of these affected individuals do not receive the care that we know can transform their lives  and remember  we do have robust evidence that a range of interventions  medicines  psychological interventions  and social interventions  can make a vast difference. And yet  even in the best resourced countries  for example here in Europe  roughly    percent of affected people don't receive these interventions. In the sorts of countries I work in  that so called treatment gap approaches an astonishing    percent. It isn't surprising  then  that if you should speak to anyone affected by a mental illness  the chances are that you will hear stories of hidden suffering  shame and discrimination in nearly every sector of their lives. But perhaps most heartbreaking of all are the stories of the abuse of even the most basic human rights  such as the young woman shown in this image here that are played out every day  sadly  even in the very institutions that were built to care for people with mental illnesses  the mental hospitals. It's this injustice that has really driven my mission to try to do a little bit to transform the lives of people affected by mental illness  and a particularly critical action that I focused on is to bridge the gulf between the knowledge we have that can transform lives  the knowledge of effective treatments  and how we actually use that knowledge in the everyday world. And an especially important challenge that I've had to face is the great shortage of mental health professionals  such as psychiatrists and psychologists  particularly in the developing world. Now I trained in medicine in India  and after that I chose psychiatry as my specialty  much to the dismay of my mother and all my family members who kind of thought neurosurgery would be a more respectable option for their brilliant son. Any case  I went on  I soldiered on with psychiatry  and found myself training in Britain in some of the best hospitals in this country. I was very privileged. I worked in a team of incredibly talented  compassionate  but most importantly  highly trained  specialized mental health professionals. Soon after my training  I found myself working first in Zimbabwe and then in India  and I was confronted by an altogether new reality. This was a reality of a world in which there were almost no mental health professionals at all. In Zimbabwe  for example  there were just about a dozen psychiatrists  most of whom lived and worked in Harare city  leaving only a couple to address the mental health care needs of nine million people living in the countryside. In India  I found the situation was not a lot better. To give you a perspective  if I had to translate the proportion of psychiatrists in the population that one might see in Britain to India  one might expect roughly         psychiatrists in India. In reality  take a guess. The actual number is about        about two percent of that number. It became quickly apparent to me that I couldn't follow the sorts of mental health care models that I had been trained in  one that relied heavily on specialized  expensive mental health professionals to provide mental health care in countries like India and Zimbabwe. I had to think out of the box about some other model of care. It was then that I came across these books  and in these books I discovered the idea of task shifting in global health. The idea is actually quite simple. The idea is  when you're short of specialized health care professionals  use whoever is available in the community  train them to provide a range of health care interventions  and in these books I read inspiring examples  for example of how ordinary people had been trained to deliver babies  diagnose and treat early pneumonia  to great effect. And it struck me that if you could train ordinary people to deliver such complex health care interventions  then perhaps they could also do the same with mental health care. Well today  I'm very pleased to report to you that there have been many experiments in task shifting in mental health care across the developing world over the past decade  and I want to share with you the findings of three particular such experiments  all three of which focused on depression  the most common of all mental illnesses. In rural Uganda  Paul Bolton and his colleagues  using villagers  demonstrated that they could deliver interpersonal psychotherapy for depression and  using a randomized control design  showed that    percent of the people receiving this intervention recovered as compared to roughly    percent in the comparison villages. Similarly  using a randomized control trial in rural Pakistan  Atif Rahman and his colleagues showed that lady health visitors  who are community maternal health workers in Pakistan's health care system  could deliver cognitive behavior therapy for mothers who were depressed  again showing dramatic differences in the recovery rates. Roughly    percent of mothers recovered as compared to about    percent in the comparison villages. And in my own trial in Goa  in India  we again showed that lay counselors drawn from local communities could be trained to deliver psychosocial interventions for depression  anxiety  leading to    percent recovery rates as compared to    percent in the comparison primary health centers. Now  if I had to draw together all these different experiments in task shifting  and there have of course been many other examples  and try and identify what are the key lessons we can learn that makes for a successful task shifting operation  I have coined this particular acronym  SUNDAR. What SUNDAR stands for  in Hindi  is  attractive.  It seems to me that there are five key lessons that I've shown on this slide that are critically important for effective task shifting. The first is that we need to simplify the message that we're using  stripping away all the jargon that medicine has invented around itself. We need to unpack complex health care interventions into smaller components that can be more easily transferred to less trained individuals. We need to deliver health care  not in large institutions  but close to people's homes  and we need to deliver health care using whoever is available and affordable in our local communities. And importantly  we need to reallocate the few specialists who are available to perform roles such as capacity building and supervision. Now for me  task shifting is an idea with truly global significance  because even though it has arisen out of the situation of the lack of resources that you find in developing countries  I think it has a lot of significance for better resourced countries as well. Why is that  Well  in part  because health care in the developed world  the health care costs in the  developed  world  are rapidly spiraling out of control  and a huge chunk of those costs are human resource costs. But equally important is because health care has become so incredibly professionalized that it's become very remote and removed from local communities. For me  what's truly sundar about the idea of task shifting  though  isn't that it simply makes health care more accessible and affordable but that it is also fundamentally empowering. It empowers ordinary people to be more effective in caring for the health of others in their community  and in doing so  to become better guardians of their own health. Indeed  for me  task shifting is the ultimate example of the democratization of medical knowledge  and therefore  medical power. Just over    years ago  the nations of the world assembled at Alma Ata and made this iconic declaration. Well  I think all of you can guess that    years on  we're still nowhere near that goal. Still  today  armed with that knowledge that ordinary people in the community can be trained and  with sufficient supervision and support  can deliver a range of health care interventions effectively  perhaps that promise is within reach now. Indeed  to implement the slogan of Health for All  we will need to involve all in that particular journey  and in the case of mental health  in particular we would need to involve people who are affected by mental illness and their caregivers. It is for this reason that  some years ago  the Movement for Global Mental Health was founded as a sort of a virtual platform upon which professionals like myself and people affected by mental illness could stand together  shoulder to shoulder  and advocate for the rights of people with mental illness to receive the care that we know can transform their lives  and to live a life with dignity. And in closing  when you have a moment of peace or quiet in these very busy few days or perhaps afterwards  spare a thought for that person you thought about who has a mental illness  or persons that you thought about who have mental illness  and dare to care for them. Thank you.  Applause  Hi. So I'd like to talk a little bit about the people who make the things we use every day  our shoes  our handbags  our computers and cell phones. Now  this is a conversation that often calls up a lot of guilt. Imagine the teenage farm girl who makes less than a dollar an hour stitching your running shoes  or the young Chinese man who jumps off a rooftop after working overtime assembling your iPad. We  the beneficiaries of globalization  seem to exploit these victims with every purchase we make  and the injustice feels embedded in the products themselves. After all  what's wrong with a world in which a worker on an iPhone assembly line can't even afford to buy one  It's taken for granted that Chinese factories are oppressive  and that it's our desire for cheap goods that makes them so. So  this simple narrative equating Western demand and Chinese suffering is appealing  especially at a time when many of us already feel guilty about our impact on the world  but it's also inaccurate and disrespectful. We must be peculiarly self obsessed to imagine that we have the power to drive tens of millions of people on the other side of the world to migrate and suffer in such terrible ways. In fact  China makes goods for markets all over the world  including its own  thanks to a combination of factors  its low costs  its large and educated workforce  and a flexible manufacturing system that responds quickly to market demands. By focusing so much on ourselves and our gadgets  we have rendered the individuals on the other end into invisibility  as tiny and interchangeable as the parts of a mobile phone. Chinese workers are not forced into factories because of our insatiable desire for iPods. They choose to leave their homes in order to earn money  to learn new skills  and to see the world. In the ongoing debate about globalization  what's been missing is the voices of the workers themselves. Here are a few. Bao Yongxiu   My mother tells me to come home and get married  but if I marry now  before I have fully developed myself  I can only marry an ordinary worker  so I'm not in a rush.  Chen Ying   When I went home for the new year  everyone said I had changed. They asked me  what did you do that you have changed so much  I told them that I studied and worked hard. If you tell them more  they won't understand anyway.  Wu Chunming   Even if I make a lot of money  it won't satisfy me. Just to make money is not enough meaning in life.  Xiao Jin   Now  after I get off work  I study English  because in the future  our customers won't be only Chinese  so we must learn more languages.  All of these speakers  by the way  are young women     or    years old. So I spent two years getting to know assembly line workers like these in the south China factory city called Dongguan. Certain subjects came up over and over  how much money they made  what kind of husband they hoped to marry  whether they should jump to another factory or stay where they were. Other subjects came up almost never  including living conditions that to me looked close to prison life     or    workers in one room     people sharing a single bathroom  days and nights ruled by the factory clock. Everyone they knew lived in similar circumstances  and it was still better than the dormitories and homes of rural China. The workers rarely spoke about the products they made  and they often had great difficulty explaining what exactly they did. When I asked Lu Qingmin  the young woman I got to know best  what exactly she did on the factory floor  she said something to me in Chinese that sounded like  qiu xi.  Only much later did I realize that she had been saying  QC   or quality control. She couldn't even tell me what she did on the factory floor. All she could do was parrot a garbled abbreviation in a language she didn't even understand. Karl Marx saw this as the tragedy of capitalism  the alienation of the worker from the product of his labor. Unlike  say  a traditional maker of shoes or cabinets  the worker in an industrial factory has no control  no pleasure  and no true satisfaction or understanding in her own work. But like so many theories that Marx arrived at sitting in the reading room of the British Museum  he got this one wrong. Just because a person spends her time making a piece of something does not mean that she becomes that  a piece of something. What she does with the money she earns  what she learns in that place  and how it changes her  these are the things that matter. What a factory makes is never the point  and the workers could not care less who buys their products. Journalistic coverage of Chinese factories  on the other hand  plays up this relationship between the workers and the products they make. Many articles calculate  How long would it take for this worker to work in order to earn enough money to buy what he's making  For example  an entry level line assembly line worker in China in an iPhone plant would have to shell out two and a half months' wages for an iPhone. But how meaningful is this calculation  really  For example  I recently wrote an article in The New Yorker magazine  but I can't afford to buy an ad in it. But  who cares  I don't want an ad in The New Yorker  and most of these workers don't really want iPhones. Their calculations are different. How long should I stay in this factory  How much money can I save  How much will it take to buy an apartment or a car  to get married  or to put my child through school  The workers I got to know had a curiously abstract relationship with the product of their labor. About a year after I met Lu Qingmin  or Min  she invited me home to her family village for the Chinese New Year. On the train home  she gave me a present  a Coach brand change purse with brown leather trim. I thanked her  assuming it was fake  like almost everything else for sale in Dongguan. After we got home  Min gave her mother another present  a pink Dooney   Bourke handbag  and a few nights later  her sister was showing off a maroon LeSportsac shoulder bag. Slowly it was dawning on me that these handbags were made by their factory  and every single one of them was authentic. Min's sister said to her parents   In America  this bag sells for     dollars.  Her parents  who are both farmers  looked on  speechless.  And that's not all    Coach is coming out with a new line         she said.  One bag will sell for      .  She paused and said   I don't know if that's       yuan or       American dollars  but anyway  it's      .   Laughter  Min's sister's boyfriend  who had traveled home with her for the new year  said   It doesn't look like it's worth that much.  Min's sister turned to him and said   Some people actually understand these things. You don't understand shit.  In Min's world  the Coach bags had a curious currency. They weren't exactly worthless  but they were nothing close to the actual value  because almost no one they knew wanted to buy one  or knew how much it was worth. Once  when Min's older sister's friend got married  she brought a handbag along as a wedding present. Another time  after Min had already left the handbag factory  her younger sister came to visit  bringing two Coach Signature handbags as gifts. I looked in the zippered pocket of one  and I found a printed card in English  which read   An American classic. In       the burnished patina of an all American baseball glove inspired the founder of Coach to create a new collection of handbags from the same luxuriously soft gloved hand leather. Six skilled leatherworkers crafted    Signature handbags with perfect proportions and a timeless flair. They were fresh  functional  and women everywhere adored them. A new American classic was born.  I wonder what Karl Marx would have made of Min and her sisters. Their relationship with the product of their labor was more complicated  surprising and funny than he could have imagined. And yet  his view of the world persists  and our tendency to see the workers as faceless masses  to imagine that we can know what they're really thinking. The first time I met Min  she had just turned    and quit her first job on the assembly line of an electronics factory. Over the next two years  I watched as she switched jobs five times  eventually landing a lucrative post in the purchasing department of a hardware factory. Later  she married a fellow migrant worker  moved with him to his village  gave birth to two daughters  and saved enough money to buy a secondhand Buick for herself and an apartment for her parents. She recently returned to Dongguan on her own to take a job in a factory that makes construction cranes  temporarily leaving her husband and children back in the village. In a recent email to me  she explained   A person should have some ambition while she is young so that in old age she can look back on her life and feel that it was not lived to no purpose.  Across China  there are     million workers like her  one third of them women  who have left their villages to work in the factories  the hotels  the restaurants and the construction sites of the big cities. Together  they make up the largest migration in history  and it is globalization  this chain that begins in a Chinese farming village and ends with iPhones in our pockets and Nikes on our feet and Coach handbags on our arms that has changed the way these millions of people work and marry and live and think. Very few of them would want to go back to the way things used to be. When I first went to Dongguan  I worried that it would be depressing to spend so much time with workers. I also worried that nothing would ever happen to them  or that they would have nothing to say to me. Instead  I found young women who were smart and funny and brave and generous. By opening up their lives to me  they taught me so much about factories and about China and about how to live in the world. This is the Coach purse that Min gave me on the train home to visit her family. I keep it with me to remind me of the ties that tie me to the young women I wrote about  ties that are not economic but personal in nature  measured not in money but in memories. This purse is also a reminder that the things that you imagine  sitting in your office or in the library  are not how you find them when you actually go out into the world. Thank you.  Applause  Chris Anderson  Thank you  Leslie  that was an insight that a lot of us haven't had before. But I'm curious. If you had a minute  say  with Apple's head of manufacturing  what would you say  Leslie Chang  One minute  CA  One minute.  Laughter  LC  You know  what really impressed me about the workers is how much they're self motivated  self driven  resourceful  and the thing that struck me  what they want most is education  to learn  because most of them come from very poor backgrounds. They usually left school when they were in  th or  th grade. Their parents are often illiterate  and then they come to the city  and they  on their own  at night  during the weekends  they'll take a computer class  they'll take an English class  and learn really  really rudimentary things  you know  like how to type a document in Word  or how to say really simple things in English. So  if you really want to help these workers  start these small  very focused  very pragmatic classes in these schools  and what's going to happen is  all your workers are going to move on  but hopefully they'll move on into higher jobs within Apple  and you can help their social mobility and their self improvement. When you talk to workers  that's what they want. They do not say   I want better hot water in the showers. I want a nicer room. I want a TV set.  I mean  it would be nice to have those things  but that's not why they're in the city  and that's not what they care about. CA  Was there a sense from them of a narrative that things were kind of tough and bad  or was there a narrative of some kind of level of growth  that things over time were getting better  LC  Oh definitely  definitely. I mean  you know  it was interesting  because I spent basically two years hanging out in this city  Dongguan  and over that time  you could see immense change in every person's life  upward  downward  sideways  but generally upward. If you spend enough time  it's upward  and I met people who had moved to the city    years ago  and who are now basically urban middle class people  so the trajectory is definitely upward. It's just hard to see when you're suddenly sucked into the city. It looks like everyone's poor and desperate  but that's not really how it is. Certainly  the factory conditions are really tough  and it's nothing you or I would want to do  but from their perspective  where they're coming from is much worse  and where they're going is hopefully much better  and I just wanted to give that context of what's going on in their minds  not what necessarily is going on in yours. CA  Thanks so much for your talk. Thank you very much.  Applause  So  embryonic stem cells are really incredible cells. They are our body's own repair kits  and they're pluripotent  which means they can morph into all of the cells in our bodies. Soon  we actually will be able to use stem cells to replace cells that are damaged or diseased. But that's not what I want to talk to you about  because right now there are some really extraordinary things that we are doing with stem cells that are completely changing the way we look and model disease  our ability to understand why we get sick  and even develop drugs. I truly believe that stem cell research is going to allow our children to look at Alzheimer's and diabetes and other major diseases the way we view polio today  which is as a preventable disease. So here we have this incredible field  which has enormous hope for humanity  but much like IVF over    years ago  until the birth of a healthy baby  Louise  this field has been under siege politically and financially. Critical research is being challenged instead of supported  and we saw that it was really essential to have private safe haven laboratories where this work could be advanced without interference. And so  in       we started the New York Stem Cell Foundation Laboratory so that we would have a small organization that could do this work and support it. What we saw very quickly is the world of both medical research  but also developing drugs and treatments  is dominated by  as you would expect  large organizations  but in a new field  sometimes large organizations really have trouble getting out of their own way  and sometimes they can't ask the right questions  and there is an enormous gap that's just gotten larger between academic research on the one hand and pharmaceutical companies and biotechs that are responsible for delivering all of our drugs and many of our treatments  and so we knew that to really accelerate cures and therapies  we were going to have to address this with two things  new technologies and also a new research model. Because if you don't close that gap  you really are exactly where we are today. And that's what I want to focus on. We've spent the last couple of years pondering this  making a list of the different things that we had to do  and so we developed a new technology  It's software and hardware  that actually can generate thousands and thousands of genetically diverse stem cell lines to create a global array  essentially avatars of ourselves. And we did this because we think that it's actually going to allow us to realize the potential  the promise  of all of the sequencing of the human genome  but it's going to allow us  in doing that  to actually do clinical trials in a dish with human cells  not animal cells  to generate drugs and treatments that are much more effective  much safer  much faster  and at a much lower cost. So let me put that in perspective for you and give you some context. This is an extremely new field. In       human embryonic stem cells were first identified  and just nine years later  a group of scientists in Japan were able to take skin cells and reprogram them with very powerful viruses to create a kind of pluripotent stem cell called an induced pluripotent stem cell  or what we refer to as an IPS cell. This was really an extraordinary advance  because although these cells are not human embryonic stem cells  which still remain the gold standard  they are terrific to use for modeling disease and potentially for drug discovery. So a few months later  in       one of our scientists built on that research. He took skin biopsies  this time from people who had a disease  ALS  or as you call it in the U.K.  motor neuron disease. He turned them into the IPS cells that I've just told you about  and then he turned those IPS cells into the motor neurons that actually were dying in the disease. So basically what he did was to take a healthy cell and turn it into a sick cell  and he recapitulated the disease over and over again in the dish  and this was extraordinary  because it was the first time that we had a model of a disease from a living patient in living human cells. And as he watched the disease unfold  he was able to discover that actually the motor neurons were dying in the disease in a different way than the field had previously thought. There was another kind of cell that actually was sending out a toxin and contributing to the death of these motor neurons  and you simply couldn't see it until you had the human model. So you could really say that researchers trying to understand the cause of disease without being able to have human stem cell models were much like investigators trying to figure out what had gone terribly wrong in a plane crash without having a black box  or a flight recorder. They could hypothesize about what had gone wrong  but they really had no way of knowing what led to the terrible events. And stem cells really have given us the black box for diseases  and it's an unprecedented window. It really is extraordinary  because you can recapitulate many  many diseases in a dish  you can see what begins to go wrong in the cellular conversation well before you would ever see symptoms appear in a patient. And this opens up the ability  which hopefully will become something that is routine in the near term  of using human cells to test for drugs. Right now  the way we test for drugs is pretty problematic. To bring a successful drug to market  it takes  on average     years   that's one drug   with a sunk cost of   billion dollars  and only one percent of the drugs that start down that road are actually going to get there. You can't imagine other businesses that you would think of going into that have these kind of numbers. It's a terrible business model. But it is really a worse social model because of what's involved and the cost to all of us. So the way we develop drugs now is by testing promising compounds on    We didn't have disease modeling with human cells  so we'd been testing them on cells of mice or other creatures or cells that we engineer  but they don't have the characteristics of the diseases that we're actually trying to cure. You know  we're not mice  and you can't go into a living person with an illness and just pull out a few brain cells or cardiac cells and then start fooling around in a lab to test for  you know  a promising drug. But what you can do with human stem cells  now  is actually create avatars  and you can create the cells  whether it's the live motor neurons or the beating cardiac cells or liver cells or other kinds of cells  and you can test for drugs  promising compounds  on the actual cells that you're trying to affect  and this is now  and it's absolutely extraordinary  and you're going to know at the beginning  the very early stages of doing your assay development and your testing  you're not going to have to wait    years until you've brought a drug to market  only to find out that actually it doesn't work  or even worse  harms people. But it isn't really enough just to look at the cells from a few people or a small group of people  because we have to step back. We've got to look at the big picture. Look around this room. We are all different  and a disease that I might have  if I had Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease  it probably would affect me differently than if one of you had that disease  and if we both had Parkinson's disease  and we took the same medication  but we had different genetic makeup  we probably would have a different result  and it could well be that a drug that worked wonderfully for me was actually ineffective for you  and similarly  it could be that a drug that is harmful for you is safe for me  and  you know  this seems totally obvious  but unfortunately it is not the way that the pharmaceutical industry has been developing drugs because  until now  it hasn't had the tools. And so we need to move away from this one size fits all model. The way we've been developing drugs is essentially like going into a shoe store  no one asks you what size you are  or if you're going dancing or hiking. They just say   Well  you have feet  here are your shoes.  It doesn't work with shoes  and our bodies are many times more complicated than just our feet. So we really have to change this. There was a very sad example of this in the last decade. There's a wonderful drug  and a class of drugs actually  but the particular drug was Vioxx  and for people who were suffering from severe arthritis pain  the drug was an absolute lifesaver  but unfortunately  for another subset of those people  they suffered pretty severe heart side effects  and for a subset of those people  the side effects were so severe  the cardiac side effects  that they were fatal. But imagine a different scenario  where we could have had an array  a genetically diverse array  of cardiac cells  and we could have actually tested that drug  Vioxx  in petri dishes  and figured out  well  okay  people with this genetic type are going to have cardiac side effects  people with these genetic subgroups or genetic shoes sizes  about        of them  are not going to have any problems. The people for whom it was a lifesaver could have still taken their medicine. The people for whom it was a disaster  or fatal  would never have been given it  and you can imagine a very different outcome for the company  who had to withdraw the drug. So that is terrific  and we thought  all right  as we're trying to solve this problem  clearly we have to think about genetics  we have to think about human testing  but there's a fundamental problem  because right now  stem cell lines  as extraordinary as they are  and lines are just groups of cells  they are made by hand  one at a time  and it takes a couple of months. This is not scalable  and also when you do things by hand  even in the best laboratories  you have variations in techniques  and you need to know  if you're making a drug  that the Aspirin you're going to take out of the bottle on Monday is the same as the Aspirin that's going to come out of the bottle on Wednesday. So we looked at this  and we thought  okay  artisanal is wonderful in  you know  your clothing and your bread and crafts  but artisanal really isn't going to work in stem cells  so we have to deal with this. But even with that  there still was another big hurdle  and that actually brings us back to the mapping of the human genome  because we're all different. We know from the sequencing of the human genome that it's shown us all of the A's  C's  G's and T's that make up our genetic code  but that code  by itself  our DNA  is like looking at the ones and zeroes of the computer code without having a computer that can read it. It's like having an app without having a smartphone. We needed to have a way of bringing the biology to that incredible data  and the way to do that was to find a stand in  a biological stand in  that could contain all of the genetic information  but have it be arrayed in such a way as it could be read together and actually create this incredible avatar. We need to have stem cells from all the genetic sub types that represent who we are. So this is what we've built. It's an automated robotic technology. It has the capacity to produce thousands and thousands of stem cell lines. It's genetically arrayed. It has massively parallel processing capability  and it's going to change the way drugs are discovered  we hope  and I think eventually what's going to happen is that we're going to want to re screen drugs  on arrays like this  that already exist  all of the drugs that currently exist  and in the future  you're going to be taking drugs and treatments that have been tested for side effects on all of the relevant cells  on brain cells and heart cells and liver cells. It really has brought us to the threshold of personalized medicine. It's here now  and in our family  my son has type   diabetes  which is still an incurable disease  and I lost my parents to heart disease and cancer  but I think that my story probably sounds familiar to you  because probably a version of it is your story. At some point in our lives  all of us  or people we care about  become patients  and that's why I think that stem cell research is incredibly important for all of us. Thank you.  Applause  As you might imagine  I'm absolutely passionate about dance. I'm passionate about making it  about watching it  about encouraging others to participate in it  and I'm also really passionate about creativity. Creativity for me is something that's absolutely critical  and I think it's something that you can teach. I think the technicities of creativity can be taught and shared  and I think you can find out things about your own personal physical signature  your own cognitive habits  and use that as a point of departure to misbehave beautifully. I was born in the     s  and John Travolta was big in those days   Grease    Saturday Night Fever   and he provided a fantastic kind of male role model for me to start dancing. My parents were very up for me going. They absolutely encouraged me to take risks  to go  to try  to try. I had an opportunity  an access to a local dance studio  and I had an enlightened teacher who allowed me to make up my own and invent my own dances  so what she did was let me make up my own ballroom and Latin American dances to teach to my peers. And that was the very first time that I found an opportunity to feel that I was able to express my own voice  and that's what's fueled me  then  to become a choreographer. I feel like I've got something to say and something to share. And I guess what's interesting is  is that I am now obsessed with the technology of the body. I think it's the most technologically literate thing that we have  and I'm absolutely obsessed with finding a way of communicating ideas through the body to audiences that might move them  touch them  help them think differently about things. So for me  choreography is very much a process of physical thinking. It's very much in mind  as well as in body  and it's a collaborative process. It's something that I have to do with other people. You know  it's a distributed cognitive process in a way. I work often with designers and visual artists  obviously dancers and other choreographers  but also  more and more  with economists  anthropologists  neuroscientists  cognitive scientists  people really who come from very different domains of expertise  where they bring their intelligence to bear on a different kind of creative process. What I thought we would do today a little bit is explore this idea of physical thinking  and we're all experts in physical thinking. Yeah  you all have a body  right  And we all know what that body is like in the real world  so one of the aspects of physical thinking that we think about a lot is this notion of proprioception  the sense of my own body in the space in the real world. So  we all understand what it feels like to know where the ends of your fingers are when you hold out your arms  yeah  You absolutely know that when you're going to grab a cup  or that cup moves and you have to renavigate it. So we're experts in physical thinking already. We just don't think about our bodies very much. We only think about them when they go wrong  so  when there's a broken arm  or when you have a heart attack  then you become really very aware of your bodies. But how is it that we can start to think about using choreographic thinking  kinesthetic intelligence  to arm the ways in which we think about things more generally  What I thought I'd do is  I'd make a TED premiere. I'm not sure if this is going to be good or not. I'll just be doing it. I thought what I'd do is  I'd use three versions of physical thinking to make something. I want to introduce you. This is Paolo. This is Catarina. They have no idea what we're going to do. So this is not the type of choreography where I already have in mind what I'm going to make  where I've fixed the routine in my head and I'm just going to teach it to them  and these so called empty vessels are just going to learn it. That's not the methodology at all that we work with. But what's important about it is how it is that they're grasping information  how they're taking information  how they're using it  and how they're thinking with it. I'm going to start really  really simply. Usually  dance has a stimulus or stimuli  and I thought I'd take something simple  TED logo  we can all see it  it's quite easy to work with  and I'm going to do something very simply  where you take one idea from a body  and it happens to be my body  and translate that into somebody else's body  so it's a direct transfer  transformation of energy. And I'm going to imagine this  you can do this too if you like  that I'm going to just take the letter  T  and I'm going to imagine it in mind  and I'm going to place that outside in the real world. So I absolutely see a letter  T  in front of me. Yeah  It's absolutely there. I can absolutely walk around it when I see it  yeah  It has a kind of a grammar. I know what I'm going to do with it  and I can start to describe it  so I can describe it very simply. I can describe it in my arms  right  So all I did was take my hand and then I move my hand. I can describe it  whoa  in my head  you know  Whoa. Okay. I can do also my shoulder. Yeah  It gives me something to do  something to work towards. If I were to take that letter  T  and flatten it down on the floor  here  maybe just off the floor  all of a sudden I could do maybe something with my knee  yeah  Whoa. So If I put the knee and the arms together  I've got something physical  yeah  And I can start to build something. So what I'm going to do just for one and a half minutes or so is I'm going to take that concept  I'm going to make something  and the dancers behind me are going to interpret it  they're going to snapshot it  they're going to take aspects of it  and it's almost like I'm offloading memory and they're holding onto memory  Yeah  And we'll see what we come up with. So just have a little watch about how they're  how they're accessing this and what they're doing  and I'm just going to take this letter  T   the letter  E   and the letter  D   to make something. Okay. Here goes. So I have to get myself in the zone. Right. It's a bit of a cross of my arm. So all I'm doing is exploring this space of  T  and flashing through it with some action. I'm not remembering what I'm doing. I'm just working on my task. My task is this  T.  Going to watch it from the side  whoa. Strike moment. That's it. So we're starting to build a phrase. So what they're doing  let's see  something like that  so what they're doing is grasping aspects of that movement and they're generating it into a phrase. You can see the speed is extremely quick  yeah  I'm not asking them to copy exactly. They're using the information that they receive to generate the beginnings of a phrase. I can watch that and that can tell me something about how it is that they're moving. Yeah  they're super quick  right  So I've taken this aspect of TED and translated it into something that's physical. Some dancers  when they're watching action  take the overall shape  the arc of the movement  the kinetic sense of the movement  and use that for memory. Some work very much in specific detail. They start with small little units and build it up. Okay  you've got something  One more thing. So they're solving this problem for me  having a little    They're constructing that phrase. They have something and they're going to hold on to it  yeah  One way of making. That's going to be my beginning in this world premiere. Okay. From there I'm going to do a very different thing. So basically I'm going to make a duet. I want you to think about them as architectural objects  so what they are  are just pure lines. They're no longer people  just pure lines  and I'm going to work with them almost as objects to think with  yeah  So what I'm thinking about is taking a few physical extensions from the body as I move  and I move them  and I do that by suggesting things to them  If  then  if  then. Okay  so here we go. Just grab this arm. Can you place that down into the floor  Yeah  down to the floor. Can you go underneath  Yeah. Cat  can you put leg over that side  Yeah. Can you rotate  Whoom  just go back to the beginning. Here we go  ready  And ... bam  bake ...  clicks metronome  Great. Okay  from there  you're both getting up. You're both getting up. Here we go. Good  now  Them. So from there  from there  we're both getting up  we're both getting up  going in this direction  going underneath. Whoa  whoa  underneath. Whoa  underneath  whoo um. Yeah  Underneath. Jump. Underneath. Jump. Paolo  kick. Don't care where. Kick. Kick  replace  change a leg. Kick  replace  change the leg. Yeah  Okay  Cat  almost get his head. Almost get his head. Whoaa. Just after it  maybe. Whoaa  whaaay  ooh. Grab her waist  come up back into her first  whoom  spin  turn her  whoo aa.  Snaps  Great. Okay  let's have a little go from the beginning of that. Just  let me slow down here. Fancy having eight     Laughter  Fancy having eight hours with me in a day. So  maybe too much. So  here we go  ready  and     Clicks metronome  Nice  good job. Yeah  Okay.  Applause  Okay  not bad.  Applause  A little bit more  Yeah. Just a little bit more  here we go  from that place. Separate. Face the front. Separate. Face the front. Imagine that there's a circle in front of you  yeah  Avoid it. Avoid it. Whoom. Kick it out of the way. Kick it out of the way. Throw it into the audience. Whoom. Throw it into the audience again. We've got mental architecture  we're sharing it  therefore solving a problem. They're enacting it. Let me just see that a little bit. Ready  and go. Okay  brilliant. Okay  here we go. From the beginning  can we do our phrases first  And then that. And we're going to build something now  organize it  the phrases. Here we go. Nice and slow  Ready and go ... um.  Clicks metronome  The duet starts.  Clicks metronome  So yeah  okay  good. Okay  nice  very nice.  Applause  So good. So     Applause  Okay. So that was     Applause  Well done.  Applause  That was the second way of working. The first one  body to body transfer  yeah  with an outside mental architecture that I work with that they hold memory with for me. The second one  which is using them as objects to think with their architectural objects  I do a series of provocations  I say   If this happens  then that. If this  if that happens      I've got lots of methods like that  but it's very  very quick  and this is a third method. They're starting it already  and this is a task based method  where they have the autonomy to make all of the decisions for themselves. So I'd like us just to do  we're going to do a little mental dance  a little  in this little one minute  so what I'd love you to do is imagine  you can do this with your eyes closed  or open  and if you don't want to do it you can watch them  it's up to you. Just for a second  think about that word  TED  in front of you  so it's in mind  and it's there right in front of your mind. What I'd like you to do is transplant that outside into the real world  so just imagine that word  TED  in the real world. What I'd like you to do what that is take an aspect of it. I'm going to zone in on the  E   and I'm going to scale that  E  so it's absolutely massive  so I'm scaling that  E  so it's absolutely massive  and then I'm going to give it dimensionality. I'm going to think about it in  D space. So now  instead of it just being a letter that's in front of me  it's a space that my body can go inside of. I now decide where I'm going to be in that space  so I'm down on this small part of the bottom rib of the letter  E   and I'm thinking about it  and I'm imagining this space that's really high and above. If I asked you to reach out   you don't have to literally do it  but in mind   reach out to the top of the  E   where would you reach  If you reach with your finger  where would it be  If you reach with your elbow  where would it be  If I already then said about that space that you're in  let's infuse it with the color red  what does that do to the body  If I then said to you  what happens if that whole wall on the side of  E  collapses and you have to use your weight to put it back up  what would you be able to do with it  So this is a mental picture  I'm describing a mental  vivid picture that enables dancers to make choices for themselves about what to make. Okay  you can open your eyes if you had them closed. So the dancers have been working on them. So just keep working on them for a little second. So they've been working on those mental architectures in the here. I know  I think we should keep them as a surprise. So here goes  world premiere dance. Yeah  Here we go. TED dance. Okay. Here it comes. I'm going to organize it quickly. So  you're going to do the first solo that we made  yeah blah blah blah blah  we go into the duet  yeah  blah blah blah blah. The next solo  blah blah blah blah  yeah  and both at the same time  you do the last solutions. Okay  Okay. Ladies and gentlemen  world premiere  TED dance  three versions of physical thinking.  Applause  Well  clap afterwards  let's see if it's any good  yeah   Laughter  So yeah  let's clap    yeah  let's clap afterwards. Here we go. Catarina  big moment  here we go  one. Here it comes  Cat.  Clicks metronome  Paolo  go.  Clicks metronome  Last you solo. The one you made.  Clicks metronome  Well done. Okay  good. Super. So    So     Applause  Thank you.  Applause  So    three versions.  Applause  Oh.  Laughs  Three versions of physical thinking. I'm hoping that today  what you're going to do is go away and make a dance for yourself  and if not that  at least misbehave more beautifully  more often. Thank you very much.  Applause  Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Here we go.  Applause  So when the White House was built in the early   th century  it was an open house. Neighbors came and went. Under President Adams  a local dentist happened by. He wanted to shake the President's hand. The President dismissed the Secretary of State  whom he was conferring with  and asked the dentist if he would remove a tooth. Later  in the     s  under President Pierce  he was known to have remarked   probably the only thing he's known for   when a neighbor passed by and said   I'd love to see the beautiful house   and Pierce said to him   Why my dear sir  of course you may come in. This isn't my house. It is the people's house.  Well  when I got to the White House in the beginning of       at the start of the Obama Administration  the White House was anything but open. Bomb blast curtains covered my windows. We were running Windows     . Social media were blocked at the firewall. We didn't have a blog  let alone a dozen twitter accounts like we have today. I came in to become the head of Open Government  to take the values and the practices of transparency  participation and collaboration  and instill them into the way that we work  to open up government  to work with people. Now one of the things that we know is that companies are very good at getting people to work together in teams and in networks to make very complex products  like cars and computers  and the more complex the products are a society creates  the more successful the society is over time. Companies make goods  but governments  they make public goods. They work on the cure for cancer and educating our children and making roads  but we don't have institutions that are particularly good at this kind of complexity. We don't have institutions that are good at bringing our talents to bear  at working with us in this kind of open and collaborative way. So when we wanted to create our Open Government policy  what did we do  We wanted  naturally  to ask public sector employees how we should open up government. Turns out that had never been done before. We wanted to ask members of the public to help us come up with a policy  not after the fact  commenting on a rule after it's written  the way is typically the case  but in advance. There was no legal precedent  no cultural precedent  no technical way of doing this. In fact  many people told us it was illegal. Here's the crux of the obstacle. Governments exist to channel the flow of two things  really  values and expertise to and from government and to and from citizens to the end of making decisions. But the way that our institutions are designed  in our rather   th century  centralized model  is to channel the flow of values through voting  once every four years  once every two years  at best  once a year. This is a rather anemic and thin way  in this era of social media  for us to actually express our values. Today we have technology that lets us express ourselves a great deal  perhaps a little too much. Then in the   th century  we layer on the concept of bureaucracy and the administrative state to help us govern complex and large societies. But we've centralized these bureaucracies. We've entrenched them. And we know that the smartest person always works for someone else. We need to only look around this room to know that expertise and intelligence is widely distributed in society  and not limited simply to our institutions. Scientists have been studying in recent years the phenomenon that they often describe as flow  that the design of our systems  whether natural or social  channel the flow of whatever runs through them. So a river is designed to channel the flow of water  and the lightning bolt that comes out of a cloud channels the flow of electricity  and a leaf is designed to channel the flow of nutrients to the tree  sometimes even having to route around an obstacle  but to get that nutrition flowing. The same can be said for our social systems  for our systems of government  where  at the very least  flow offers us a helpful metaphor for understanding what the problem is  what's really broken  and the urgent need that we have  that we all feel today  to redesign the flow of our institutions. We live in a Cambrian era of big data  of social networks  and we have this opportunity to redesign these institutions that are actually quite recent. Think about it  What other business do you know  what other sector of the economy  and especially one as big as the public sector  that doesn't seek to reinvent its business model on a regular basis  Sure  we invest plenty in innovation. We invest in broadband and science education and science grants  but we invest far too little in reinventing and redesigning the institutions that we have. Now  it's very easy to complain  of course  about partisan politics and entrenched bureaucracy  and we love to complain about government. It's a perennial pastime  especially around election time  but the world is complex. We soon will have    billion people  many of whom will lack basic resources. So complain as we might  what actually can replace what we have today  What comes the day after the Arab Spring  Well  one attractive alternative that obviously presents itself to us is that of networks. Right  Networks like Facebook and Twitter. They're lean. They're mean. You've got       employees at Facebook governing     million inhabitants. We might even call them citizens  because they've recently risen up to fight against legislative incursion  and the citizens of these networks work together to serve each other in great ways. But private communities  private  corporate  privatizing communities  are not bottom up democracies. They cannot replace government. Friending someone on Facebook is not complex enough to do the hard work of you and I collaborating with each other and doing the hard work of governance. But social media do teach us something. Why is Twitter so successful  Because it opens up its platform. It opens up the API to allow hundreds of thousands of new applications to be built on top of it  so that we can read and process information in new and exciting ways. We need to think about how to open up the API of government  and the way that we're going to do that  the next great superpower is going to be the one who can successfully combine the hierarchy of institution    because we have to maintain those public values  we have to coordinate the flow    but with the diversity and the pulsating life and the chaos and the excitement of networks  all of us working together to build these new innovations on top of our institutions  to engage in the practice of governance. We have a precedent for this. Good old Henry II here  in the   th century  invented the jury. Powerful  practical  palpable model for handing power from government to citizens. Today we have the opportunity  and we have the imperative  to create thousands of new ways of interconnecting between networks and institutions  thousands of new kinds of juries  the citizen jury  the Carrotmob  the hackathon  we are just beginning to invent the models by which we can cocreate the process of governance. Now  we don't fully have a picture of what this will look like yet  but we're seeing pockets of evolution emerging all around us    maybe not even evolution  I'd even start to call it a revolution    in the way that we govern. Some of it's very high tech  and some of it is extremely low tech  such as the project that MKSS is running in Rajasthan  India  where they take the spending data of the state and paint it on         village walls  and then invite the villagers to come and comment who is on the government payroll  who's actually died  what are the bridges that have been built to nowhere  and to work together through civic engagement to save real money and participate and have access to that budget. But it's not just about policing government. It's also about creating government. Spacehive in the U.K. is engaging in crowd funding  getting you and me to raise the money to build the goalposts and the park benches that will actually allow us to deliver better services in our communities. No one is better at this activity of actually getting us to engage in delivering services  sometimes where none exist  than Ushahidi. Created after the post election riots in Kenya in       this crisis mapping website and community is actually able to crowdsource and target the delivery of better rescue services to people trapped under the rubble  whether it's after the earthquakes in Haiti  or more recently in Italy. And the Red Cross too is training volunteers and Twitter is certifying them  not simply to supplement existing government institutions  but in many cases  to replace them. Now what we're seeing lots of examples of  obviously  is the opening up of government data  not enough examples of this yet  but we're starting to see this practice of people creating and generating innovative applications on top of government data. There's so many examples I could have picked  and I selected this one of Jon Bon Jovi. Some of you may or may not know that he runs a soup kitchen in New Jersey  where he caters to and serves the homeless and particularly homeless veterans. In February  he approached the White House  and said   I would like to fund a prize to create scalable national applications  apps  that will help not only the homeless but those who deliver services  to  them to do so better.  February      to June of       the finalists are announced in the competition. Can you imagine  in the bureaucratic world of yesteryear  getting anything done in a four month period of time  You can barely fill out the forms in that amount of time  let alone generate real  palpable innovations that improve people's lives. And I want to be clear to mention that this open government revolution is not about privatizing government  because in many cases what it can do when we have the will to do so is to deliver more progressive and better policy than the regulations and the legislative and litigation oriented strategies by which we make policy today. In the State of Texas  they regulate     professions  from well driller to florist. Now  you can carry a gun into a church in Dallas  but do not make a flower arrangement without a license  because that will land you in jail. So what is Texas doing  They're asking you and me  using online policy wikis  to help not simply get rid of burdensome regulations that impede entrepreneurship  but to replace those regulations with more innovative alternatives  sometimes using transparency in the creation of new iPhone apps that will allows us both to protect consumers and the public and to encourage economic development. That is a nice sideline of open government. It's not only the benefits that we've talked about with regard to development. It's the economic benefits and the job creation that's coming from this open innovation work. Sberbank  the largest and oldest bank in Russia  largely owned by the Russian government  has started practicing crowdsourcing  engaging its employees and citizens in the public in developing innovations. Last year they saved a billion dollars     billion rubles  from open innovation  and they're pushing radically the extension of crowdsourcing  not only from banking  but into the public sector. And we see lots of examples of these innovators using open government data  not simply to make apps  but then to make companies and to hire people to build them working with the government. So a lot of these innovations are local. In San Ramon  California  they published an iPhone app in which they allow you or me to say we are certified CPR trained  and then when someone has a heart attack  a notification goes out so that you can rush over to the person over here and deliver CPR. The victim who receives bystander CPR is more than twice as likely to survive.  There is a hero in all of us   is their slogan. But it's not limited to the local. British Columbia  Canada  is publishing a catalogue of all the ways that its residents and citizens can engage with the state in the cocreation of governance. Let me be very clear  and perhaps controversial  that open government is not about transparent government. Simply throwing data over the transom doesn't change how government works. It doesn't get anybody to do anything with that data to change lives  to solve problems  and it doesn't change government. What it does is it creates an adversarial relationship between civil society and government over the control and ownership of information. And transparency  by itself  is not reducing the flow of money into politics  and arguably  it's not even producing accountability as well as it might if we took the next step of combining participation and collaboration with transparency to transform how we work. We're going to see this evolution really in two phases  I think. The first phase of the open government revolution is delivering better information from the crowd into the center. Starting in       and this is how this open government work in the U.S. really got started  I was teaching a patent law class to my students and explaining to them how a single person in the bureaucracy has the power to make a decision about which patent application becomes the next patent  and therefore monopolizes for    years the rights over an entire field of inventive activity. Well  what did we do  We said  we can make a website  we can make an expert network  a social network  that would connect the network to the institution to allow scientists and technologists to get better information to the patent office to aid in making those decisions. We piloted the work in the U.S. and the U.K. and Japan and Australia  and now I'm pleased to report that the United States Patent Office will be rolling out universal  complete  and total openness  so that all patent applications will now be open for citizen participation  beginning this year. The second phase of this evolution   Yeah.  Applause  They deserve a hand.  Applause  The first phase is in getting better information in. The second phase is in getting decision making power out. Participatory budgeting has long been practiced in Porto Alegre  Brazil. They're just starting it in the   th Ward in Chicago. Russia is using wikis to get citizens writing law together  as is Lithuania. When we start to see power over the core functions of government   spending  legislation  decision making   then we're well on our way to an open government revolution. There are many things that we can do to get us there. Obviously opening up the data is one  but the important thing is to create lots more    create and curate    lots more participatory opportunities. Hackathons and mashathons and working with data to build apps is an intelligible way for people to engage and participate  like the jury is  but we're going to need lots more things like it. And that's why we need to start with our youngest people. We've heard talk here at TED about people biohacking and hacking their plants with Arduino  and Mozilla is doing work around the world in getting young people to build websites and make videos. When we start by teaching young people that we live  not in a passive society  a read only society  but in a writable society  where we have the power to change our communities  to change our institutions  that's when we begin to really put ourselves on the pathway towards this open government innovation  towards this open government movement  towards this open government revolution. So let me close by saying that I think the important thing for us to do is to talk about and demand this revolution. We don't have words  really  to describe it yet. Words like equality and fairness and the traditional elections  democracy  these are not really great terms yet. They're not fun enough. They're not exciting enough to get us engaged in this tremendous opportunity that awaits us. But I would argue that if we want to see the kinds of innovations  the hopeful and exciting innovations that we hear talked about here at TED  in clean energy  in clean education  in development  if we want to see those adopted and we want to see those scaled  we want to see them become the governance of tomorrow  then we must all participate  then we must get involved. We must open up our institutions  and like the leaf  we must let the nutrients flow throughout our body politic  throughout our culture  to create open institutions to create a stronger democracy  a better tomorrow. Thank you.  Applause  The job of uncovering the global food waste scandal started for me when I was    years old. I bought some pigs. I was living in Sussex. And I started to feed them in the most traditional and environmentally friendly way. I went to my school kitchen  and I said   Give me the scraps that my school friends have turned their noses up at.  I went to the local baker and took their stale bread. I went to the local greengrocer  and I went to a farmer who was throwing away potatoes because they were the wrong shape or size for supermarkets. This was great. My pigs turned that food waste into delicious pork. I sold that pork to my school friends' parents  and I made a good pocket money addition to my teenage allowance. But I noticed that most of the food that I was giving my pigs was in fact fit for human consumption  and that I was only scratching the surface  and that right the way up the food supply chain  in supermarkets  greengrocers  bakers  in our homes  in factories and farms  we were hemorrhaging out food. Supermarkets didn't even want to talk to me about how much food they were wasting. I'd been round the back. I'd seen bins full of food being locked and then trucked off to landfill sites  and I thought  surely there is something more sensible to do with food than waste it. One morning  when I was feeding my pigs  I noticed a particularly tasty looking sun dried tomato loaf that used to crop up from time to time. I grabbed hold of it  sat down  and ate my breakfast with my pigs.  Laughter  That was the first act of what I later learned to call freeganism  really an exhibition of the injustice of food waste  and the provision of the solution to food waste  which is simply to sit down and eat food  rather than throwing it away. That became  as it were  a way of confronting large businesses in the business of wasting food  and exposing  most importantly  to the public  that when we're talking about food being thrown away  we're not talking about rotten stuff  we're not talking about stuff that's beyond the pale. We're talking about good  fresh food that is being wasted on a colossal scale. Eventually  I set about writing my book  really to demonstrate the extent of this problem on a global scale. What this shows is a nation by nation breakdown of the likely level of food waste in each country in the world. Unfortunately  empirical data  good  hard stats  don't exist  and therefore to prove my point  I first of all had to find some proxy way of uncovering how much food was being wasted. So I took the food supply of every single country and I compared it to what was actually likely to be being consumed in each country. That's based on diet intake surveys  it's based on levels of obesity  it's based on a range of factors that gives you an approximate guess as to how much food is actually going into people's mouths. That black line in the middle of that table is the likely level of consumption with an allowance for certain levels of inevitable waste. There will always be waste. I'm not that unrealistic that I think we can live in a waste free world. But that black line shows what a food supply should be in a country if they allow for a good  stable  secure  nutritional diet for every person in that country. Any dot above that line  and you'll quickly notice that that includes most countries in the world  represents unnecessary surplus  and is likely to reflect levels of waste in each country. As a country gets richer  it invests more and more in getting more and more surplus into its shops and restaurants  and as you can see  most European and North American countries fall between     and     percent of the nutritional requirements of their populations. So a country like America has twice as much food on its shop shelves and in its restaurants than is actually required to feed the American people. But the thing that really struck me  when I plotted all this data  and it was a lot of numbers  was that you can see how it levels off. Countries rapidly shoot towards that     mark  and then they level off  and they don't really go on rising as you might expect. So I decided to unpack that data a little bit further to see if that was true or false. And that's what I came up with. If you include not just the food that ends up in shops and restaurants  but also the food that people feed to livestock  the maize  the soy  the wheat  that humans could eat but choose to fatten livestock instead to produce increasing amounts of meat and dairy products  what you find is that most rich countries have between three and four times the amount of food that their population needs to feed itself. A country like America has four times the amount of food that it needs. When people talk about the need to increase global food production to feed those nine billion people that are expected on the planet by       I always think of these graphs. The fact is  we have an enormous buffer in rich countries between ourselves and hunger. We've never had such gargantuan surpluses before. In many ways  this is a great success story of human civilization  of the agricultural surpluses that we set out to achieve        years ago. It is a success story. It has been a success story. But what we have to recognize now is that we are reaching the ecological limits that our planet can bear  and when we chop down forests  as we are every day  to grow more and more food  when we extract water from depleting water reserves  when we emit fossil fuel emissions in the quest to grow more and more food  and then we throw away so much of it  we have to think about what we can start saving. And yesterday  I went to one of the local supermarkets that I often visit to inspect  if you like  what they're throwing away. I found quite a few packets of biscuits amongst all the fruit and vegetables and everything else that was in there. And I thought  well this could serve as a symbol for today. So I want you to imagine that these nine biscuits that I found in the bin represent the global food supply  okay  We start out with nine. That's what's in fields around the world every single year. The first biscuit we're going to lose before we even leave the farm. That's a problem primarily associated with developing work agriculture  whether it's a lack of infrastructure  refrigeration  pasteurization  grain stores  even basic fruit crates  which means that food goes to waste before it even leaves the fields. The next three biscuits are the foods that we decide to feed to livestock  the maize  the wheat and the soya. Unfortunately  our beasts are inefficient animals  and they turn two thirds of that into feces and heat  so we've lost those two  and we've only kept this one in meat and dairy products. Two more we're going to throw away directly into bins. This is what most of us think of when we think of food waste  what ends up in the garbage  what ends up in supermarket bins  what ends up in restaurant bins. We've lost another two  and we've left ourselves with just four biscuits to feed on. That is not a superlatively efficient use of global resources  especially when you think of the billion hungry people that exist already in the world. Having gone through the data  I then needed to demonstrate where that food ends up. Where does it end up  We're used to seeing the stuff on our plates  but what about all the stuff that goes missing in between  Supermarkets are an easy place to start. This is the result of my hobby  which is unofficial bin inspections.  Laughter  Strange you might think  but if we could rely on corporations to tell us what they were doing in the back of their stores  we wouldn't need to go sneaking around the back  opening up bins and having a look at what's inside. But this is what you can see more or less on every street corner in Britain  in Europe  in North America. It represents a colossal waste of food  but what I discovered whilst I was writing my book was that this very evident abundance of waste was actually the tip of the iceberg. When you start going up the supply chain  you find where the real food waste is happening on a gargantuan scale. Can I have a show of hands if you have a loaf of sliced bread in your house  Who lives in a household where that crust    that slice at the first and last end of each loaf    who lives in a household where it does get eaten  Okay  most people  not everyone  but most people  and this is  I'm glad to say  what I see across the world  and yet has anyone seen a supermarket or sandwich shop anywhere in the world that serves sandwiches with crusts on it   Laughter  I certainly haven't. So I kept on thinking  where do those crusts go   Laughter  This is the answer  unfortunately         slices of fresh bread coming out of this one single factory every single day  day fresh bread. In the same year that I visited this factory  I went to Pakistan  where people in      were going hungry as a result of a squeeze on global food supplies. We contribute to that squeeze by depositing food in bins here in Britain and elsewhere in the world. We take food off the market shelves that hungry people depend on. Go one step up  and you get to farmers  who throw away sometimes a third or even more of their harvest because of cosmetic standards. This farmer  for example  has invested        pounds in growing spinach  not one leaf of which he harvested  because there was a little bit of grass growing in amongst it. Potatoes that are cosmetically imperfect  all going for pigs. Parsnips that are too small for supermarket specifications  tomatoes in Tenerife  oranges in Florida  bananas in Ecuador  where I visited last year  all being discarded. This is one day's waste from one banana plantation in Ecuador. All being discarded  perfectly edible  because they're the wrong shape or size. If we do that to fruit and vegetables  you bet we can do it to animals too. Liver  lungs  heads  tails  kidneys  testicles  all of these things which are traditional  delicious and nutritious parts of our gastronomy go to waste. Offal consumption has halved in Britain and America in the last    years. As a result  this stuff gets fed to dogs at best  or is incinerated. This man  in Kashgar  Xinjiang province  in Western China  is serving up his national dish. It's called sheep's organs. It's delicious  it's nutritious  and as I learned when I went to Kashgar  it symbolizes their taboo against food waste. I was sitting in a roadside cafe. A chef came to talk to me  I finished my bowl  and halfway through the conversation  he stopped talking and he started frowning into my bowl. I thought   My goodness  what taboo have I broken  How have I insulted my host   He pointed at three grains of rice at the bottom of my bowl  and he said   Clean.   Laughter  I thought   My God  you know  I go around the world telling people to stop wasting food. This guy has thrashed me at my own game.   Laughter  But it gave me faith. It gave me faith that we  the people  do have the power to stop this tragic waste of resources if we regard it as socially unacceptable to waste food on a colossal scale  if we make noise about it  tell corporations about it  tell governments we want to see an end to food waste  we do have the power to bring about that change. Fish     to    percent of European fish are discarded at sea  they don't even get landed. In our homes  we've lost touch with food. This is an experiment I did on three lettuces. Who keeps lettuces in their fridge  Most people. The one on the left was kept in a fridge for    days. The one in the middle  on my kitchen table. Not much difference. The one on the right I treated like cut flowers. It's a living organism  cut the slice off  stuck it in a vase of water  it was all right for another two weeks after this. Some food waste  as I said at the beginning  will inevitably arise  so the question is  what is the best thing to do with it  I answered that question when I was   . In fact  humans answered that question       years ago  We domesticated pigs to turn food waste back into food. And yet  in Europe  that practice has become illegal since      as a result of the foot and mouth outbreak. It's unscientific. It's unnecessary. If you cook food for pigs  just as if you cook food for humans  it is rendered safe. It's also a massive saving of resources. At the moment  Europe depends on importing millions of tons of soy from South America  where its production contributes to global warming  to deforestation  to biodiversity loss  to feed livestock here in Europe. At the same time we throw away millions of tons of food waste which we could and should be feeding them. If we did that  and fed it to pigs  we would save that amount of carbon. If we feed our food waste which is the current government favorite way of getting rid of food waste  to anaerobic digestion  which turns food waste into gas to produce electricity  you save a paltry     kilograms of carbon dioxide per ton of food waste. It's much better to feed it to pigs. We knew that during the war.  Laughter  A silver lining  It has kicked off globally  the quest to tackle food waste. Feeding the       is an event I first organized in     . We fed       people all on food that otherwise would have been wasted. Since then  it's happened again in London  it's happening internationally  and across the country. It's a way of organizations coming together to celebrate food  to say the best thing to do with food is to eat and enjoy it  and to stop wasting it. For the sake of the planet we live on  for the sake of our children  for the sake of all the other organisms that share our planet with us  we are a terrestrial animal  and we depend on our land for food. At the moment  we are trashing our land to grow food that no one eats. Stop wasting food. Thank you very much.  Applause  Fifteen years ago  it was widely assumed that the vast majority of brain development takes place in the first few years of life. Back then     years ago  we didn't have the ability to look inside the living human brain and track development across the lifespan. In the past decade or so  mainly due to advances in brain imaging technology such as magnetic resonance imaging  or MRI  neuroscientists have started to look inside the living human brain of all ages  and to track changes in brain structure and brain function  so we use structural MRI if you'd like to take a snapshot  a photograph  at really high resolution of the inside of the living human brain  and we can ask questions like  how much gray matter does the brain contain  and how does that change with age  And we also use functional MRI  called fMRI  to take a video  a movie  of brain activity when participants are taking part in some kind of task like thinking or feeling or perceiving something. So many labs around the world are involved in this kind of research  and we now have a really rich and detailed picture of how the living human brain develops  and this picture has radically changed the way we think about human brain development by revealing that it's not all over in early childhood  and instead  the brain continues to develop right throughout adolescence and into the '  s and '  s. So adolescence is defined as the period of life that starts with the biological  hormonal  physical changes of puberty and ends at the age at which an individual attains a stable  independent role in society. It can go on a long time.  Laughter  One of the brain regions that changes most dramatically during adolescence is called prefrontal cortex. So this is a model of the human brain  and this is prefrontal cortex  right at the front. Prefrontal cortex is an interesting brain area. It's proportionally much bigger in humans than in any other species  and it's involved in a whole range of high level cognitive functions  things like decision making  planning  planning what you're going to do tomorrow or next week or next year  inhibiting inappropriate behavior  so stopping yourself saying something really rude or doing something really stupid. It's also involved in social interaction  understanding other people  and self awareness. So MRI studies looking at the development of this region have shown that it really undergoes dramatic development during the period of adolescence. So if you look at gray matter volume  for example  gray matter volume across age from age four to    years increases during childhood  which is what you can see on this graph. It peaks in early adolescence. The arrows indicate peak gray matter volume in prefrontal cortex. You can see that that peak happens a couple of years later in boys relative to girls  and that's probably because boys go through puberty a couple of years later than girls on average  and then during adolescence  there's a significant decline in gray matter volume in prefrontal cortex. Now that might sound bad  but actually this is a really important developmental process  because gray matter contains cell bodies and connections between cells  the synapses  and this decline in gray matter volume during prefrontal cortex is thought to correspond to synaptic pruning  the elimination of unwanted synapses. This is a really important process. It's partly dependent on the environment that the animal or the human is in  and the synapses that are being used are strengthened  and synapses that aren't being used in that particular environment are pruned away. You can think of it a bit like pruning a rosebush. You prune away the weaker branches so that the remaining  important branches  can grow stronger  and this process  which effectively fine tunes brain tissue according to the species specific environment  is happening in prefrontal cortex and in other brain regions during the period of human adolescence. So a second line of inquiry that we use to track changes in the adolescent brain is using functional MRI to look at changes in brain activity across age. So I'll just give you an example from my lab. So in my lab  we're interested in the social brain  that is the network of brain regions that we use to understand other people and to interact with other people. So I like to show a photograph of a soccer game to illustrate two aspects of how your social brains work. So this is a soccer game.  Laughter  Michael Owen has just missed a goal  and he's lying on the ground  and the first aspect of the social brain that this picture really nicely illustrates is how automatic and instinctive social emotional responses are  so within a split second of Michael Owen missing this goal  everyone is doing the same thing with their arms and the same thing with their face  even Michael Owen as he slides along the grass  is doing the same thing with his arms  and presumably has a similar facial expression  and the only people who don't are the guys in yellow at the back    Laughs    and I think they're on the wrong end of the stadium  and they're doing another social emotional response that we all instantly recognize  and that's the second aspect of the social brain that this picture really nicely illustrates  how good we are at reading other people's behavior  their actions  their gestures  their facial expressions  in terms of their underlying emotions and mental states. So you don't have to ask any of these guys. You have a pretty good idea of what they're feeling and thinking at this precise moment in time. So that's what we're interested in looking at in my lab. So in my lab  we bring adolescents and adults into the lab to have a brain scan  we give them some kind of task that involves thinking about other people  their minds  their mental states  their emotions  and one of the findings that we've found several times now  as have other labs around the world  is part of the prefrontal cortex called medial prefrontal cortex  which is shown in blue on the slide  and it's right in the middle of prefrontal cortex in the midline of your head. This region is more active in adolescents when they make these social decisions and think about other people than it is in adults  and this is actually a meta analysis of nine different studies in this area from labs around the world  and they all show the same thing  that activity in this medial prefrontal cortex area decreases during the period of adolescence. And we think that might be because adolescents and adults use a different mental approach  a different cognitive strategy  to make social decisions  and one way of looking at that is to do behavioral studies whereby we bring people into the lab and we give them some kind of behavioral task  and I'll just give you another example of the kind of task that we use in my lab. So imagine that you're the participant in one of our experiments. You come into the lab  you see this computerized task. In this task  you see a set of shelves. Now  there are objects on these shelves  on some of them  and you'll notice there's a guy standing behind the set of shelves  and there are some objects that he can't see. They're occluded  from his point of view  with a kind of gray piece of wood. This is the same set of shelves from his point of view. Notice that there are only some objects that he can see  whereas there are many more objects that you can see. Now your task is to move objects around. The director  standing behind the set of shelves  is going to direct you to move objects around  but remember  he's not going to ask you to move objects that he can't see. This introduces a really interesting condition whereby there's a kind of conflict between your perspective and the director's perspective. So imagine he tells you to move the top truck left. There are three trucks there. You're going to instinctively go for the white truck  because that's the top truck from your perspective  but then you have to remember   Oh  he can't see that truck  so he must mean me to move the blue truck   which is the top truck from his perspective. Now believe it or not  normal  healthy  intelligent adults like you make errors about    percent of the time on that kind of trial. They move the white truck instead of the blue truck. So we give this kind of task to adolescents and adults  and we also have a control condition where there's no director and instead we give people a rule. We tell them  okay  we're going to do exactly the same thing but this time there's no director. Instead you've got to ignore objects with the dark gray background. You'll see that this is exactly the same condition  only in the no director condition they just have to remember to apply this somewhat arbitrary rule  whereas in the director condition  they have to remember to take into account the director's perspective in order to guide their ongoing behavior. Okay  so if I just show you the percentage errors in a large developmental study we did  this is in a study ranging from age seven to adulthood  and what you're going to see is the percentage errors in the adult group in both conditions  so the gray is the director condition  and you see that our intelligent adults are making errors about    percent of the time  whereas they make far fewer errors when there's no director present  when they just have to remember that rule of ignoring the gray background. Developmentally  these two conditions develop in exactly the same way. Between late childhood and mid adolescence  there's an improvement  in other words a reduction of errors  in both of these trials  in both of these conditions. But it's when you compare the last two groups  the mid adolescent group and the adult group where things get really interesting  because there  there is no continued improvement in the no director condition. In other words  everything you need to do in order to remember the rule and apply it seems to be fully developed by mid adolescence  whereas in contrast  if you look at the last two gray bars  there's still a significant improvement in the director condition between mid adolescence and adulthood  and what this means is that the ability to take into account someone else's perspective in order to guide ongoing behavior  which is something  by the way  that we do in everyday life all the time  is still developing in mid to late adolescence. So if you have a teenage son or a daughter and you sometimes think they have problems taking other people's perspectives  you're right. They do. And this is why. So we sometimes laugh about teenagers. They're parodied  sometimes even demonized in the media for their kind of typical teenage behavior. They take risks  they're sometimes moody  they're very self conscious. I have a really nice anecdote from a friend of mine who said that the thing he noticed most about his teenage daughters before and after puberty was their level of embarrassment in front of him. So  he said   Before puberty  if my two daughters were messing around in a shop  I'd say  'Hey  stop messing around and I'll sing your favorite song ' and instantly they'd stop messing around and he'd sing their favorite song. After puberty  that became the threat. The very notion of their dad singing in public was enough to make them behave. So people often ask   Well  is adolescence a kind of recent phenomenon  Is it something we've invented recently in the West   And actually  the answer is probably not. There are lots of descriptions of adolescence in history that sound very similar to the descriptions we use today. So there's a famous quote by Shakespeare from  The Winter's Tale  where he describes adolescence as follows   I would there were no age between ten and three and twenty  or that youth would sleep out the rest  for there is nothing in the between but getting wenches with child  wronging the ancientry  stealing  fighting.   Laughter  He then goes on to say   Having said that  would any but these boiled brains of nineteen and two and twenty hunt in this weather    Laughter  So almost     years ago  Shakespeare was portraying adolescents in a very similar light to the light that we portray them in today  but today we try to understand their behavior in terms of the underlying changes that are going on in their brain. So for example  take risk taking. We know that adolescents have a tendency to take risks. They do. They take more risks than children or adults  and they are particularly prone to taking risks when they're with their friends. There's an important drive to become independent from one's parents and to impress one's friends in adolescence. But now we try to understand that in terms of the development of a part of their brain called the limbic system  so I'm going to show you the limbic system in red in the slide behind me  and also on this brain. So the limbic system is right deep inside the brain  and it's involved in things like emotion processing and reward processing. It gives you the rewarding feeling out of doing fun things  including taking risks. It gives you the kick out of taking risks. And this region  the regions within the limbic system  have been found to be hypersensitive to the rewarding feeling of risk taking in adolescents compared with adults  and at the very same time  the prefrontal cortex  which you can see in blue in the slide here  which stops us taking excessive risks  is still very much in development in adolescents. So brain research has shown that the adolescent brain undergoes really quite profound development  and this has implications for education  for rehabilitation  and intervention. The environment  including teaching  can and does shape the developing adolescent brain  and yet it's only relatively recently that we have been routinely educating teenagers in the West. All four of my grandparents  for example  left school in their early adolescence. They had no choice. And that's still the case for many  many teenagers around the world today. Forty percent of teenagers don't have access to secondary school education. And yet  this is a period of life where the brain is particularly adaptable and malleable. It's a fantastic opportunity for learning and creativity. So what's sometimes seen as the problem with adolescents   heightened risk taking  poor impulse control  self consciousness   shouldn't be stigmatized. It actually reflects changes in the brain that provide an excellent opportunity for education and social development. Thank you.  Applause  It's time to start designing for our ears. Architects and designers tend to focus exclusively on these. They use these to design with and they design for them  which is why we end up sitting in restaurants that look like this    loud crowd noise    and sound like this  shouting from a foot away to try and be heard by our dinner companion  or why we get on airplanes     flight attendant announcements     which cost     million pounds  with somebody talking through an old fashioned telephone handset on a cheap stereo system  making us jump out of our skins. We're designing environments that make us crazy.  Laughter  And it's not just our quality of life which suffers. It's our health  our social behavior  and our productivity as well. How does this work  Well  two ways. First of all  ambience. I have a whole TEDTalk about this. Sound affects us physiologically  psychologically  cognitively and behaviorally all the time. The sound around us is affecting us even though we're not conscious of it. There's a second way though  as well. That's interference. Communication requires sending and receiving  and I have another whole TEDTalk about the importance of conscious listening  but I can send as well as I like  and you can be brilliant conscious listeners. If the space I'm sending it in is not effective  that communication can't happen. Spaces tend to include noise and acoustics. A room like this has acoustics  this one very good acoustics. Many rooms are not so good. Let me give you some examples from a couple of areas which I think we all care about  health and education. in a hospital  I was asking myself  how does anybody get well in a place that sounds like this  Hospital sound is getting worse all the time. Noise levels in hospitals have doubled in the last few years  and it affects not just the patients but also the people working there. I think we would like for dispensing errors to be zero  wouldn't we  And yet  as noise levels go up  so do the errors in dispensing made by the staff in hospitals. Most of all  though  it affects the patients  and that could be you  it could be me. Sleep is absolutely crucial for recovery. It's when we regenerate  when we rebuild ourselves  and with threatening noise like this going on  your body  even if you are able to sleep  your body is telling you   I'm under threat. This is dangerous.  And the quality of sleep is degraded  and so is our recovery. There are just huge benefits to come from designing for the ears in our health care. This is an area I intend to take on this year. Education. When I see a classroom that looks like this  can you imagine how this sounds  I am forced to ask myself a question. Now  that's a little unfair. Some of my best friends are architects.  Laughter  And they definitely do have ears. But I think sometimes they don't use them when they're designing buildings. Here's a case in point. This is a    million pound flagship academy school which was built quite recently in the U.K. and designed by one of Britain's top architects. Unfortunately  it was designed like a corporate headquarters  with a vast central atrium and classrooms leading off it with no back walls at all. The children couldn't hear their teachers. They had to go back in and spend         pounds putting the walls in. Let's stop this madness of open plan classrooms right now  please. It's not just these modern buildings which suffer. Old fashioned classrooms suffer too. A study in Florida just a few years ago found that if you're sitting where this photograph was taken in the classroom  row four  speech intelligibility is just    percent. Children are losing one word in two. Now that doesn't mean they only get half their education  but it does mean they have to work very hard to join the dots and understand what's going on. This is affected massively by reverberation time  how reverberant a room is. In a classroom with a reverberation time of  .  seconds  which is pretty common  this is what it sounds like. Not so good  is it  If you take that  .  seconds down to  .  seconds by installing acoustic treatments  sound absorbing materials and so forth  this is what you get. Voice  In language  infinitely many words can be written with a small set of letters. In arithmetic  infinitely many numbers can be composed from just a few digits with the help of the simple zero. Julian Treasure  What a difference. Now that education you would receive  and thanks to the British acoustician Adrian James for those simulations. The signal was the same  the background noise was the same. All that changed was the acoustics of the classroom in those two examples. If education can be likened to watering a garden  which is a fair metaphor  sadly  much of the water is evaporating before it reaches the flowers  especially for some groups  for example  those with hearing impairment. Now that's not just deaf children. That could be any child who's got a cold  glue ear  an ear infection  even hay fever. On a given day  one in eight children fall into that group  on any given day. Then you have children for whom English is a second language  or whatever they're being taught in is a second language. In the U.K.  that's more than    percent of the school population. And finally  after Susan Cain's wonderful TEDTalk in February  we know that introverts find it very difficult to relate when they're in a noisy environment doing group work. Add those up. That is a lot of children who are not receiving their education properly. It's not just the children who are affected  though. the average noise level in classrooms is    decibels. I have to really raise my voice to talk over    decibels of sound  and teachers are not just raising their voices. This chart maps the teacher's heart rate against the noise level. Noise goes up  heart rate goes up. That is not good for you. In fact     decibels is the very level at which this big survey of all the evidence on noise and health found that  that is the threshold for the danger of myocardial infarction. To you and me  that's a heart attack. It may not be pushing the boat out too far to suggest that many teachers are losing significant life expectancy by teaching in environments like that day after day. What does it cost to treat a classroom down to that  .  second reverberation time  Two and a half thousand pounds. And the Essex study which has just been done in the U.K.  which incidentally showed that when you do this  you do not just make a room that's suitable for hearing impaired children  you make a room where behavior improves  and results improve significantly  this found that sending a child out of area to a school that does have such a room  if you don't have one  costs        pounds a year. I think the economics are pretty clear on this. I'm glad that debate is happening on this. I just moderated a major conference in London a few weeks ago called Sound Education  which brought together top acousticians  government people  teachers  and so forth. We're at last starting to debate this issue  and the benefits that are available for designing for the ears in education  unbelievable. Out of that conference  incidentally  also came a free app which is designed to help children study if they're having to work at home  for example  in a noisy kitchen. And that's free out of that conference. Let's broaden the perspective a little bit and look at cities. We have urban planners. Where are the urban sound planners  I don't know of one in the world  and the opportunity is there to transform our experience in our cities. The World Health Organization estimates that a quarter of Europe's population is having its sleep degraded by noise in cities. We can do better than that. And in our offices  we spend a lot of time at work. Where are the office sound planners  People who say  don't sit that team next to this team  because they like noise and they need quiet. Or who say  don't spend all your budget on a huge screen in the conference room  and then place one tiny microphone in the middle of a table for    people.  Laughter  If you can hear me  you can understand me without seeing me. If you can see me without hearing me  that does not work. So office sound is a huge area  and incidentally  noise in offices has been shown to make people less helpful  less enjoy their teamwork  and less productive at work. Finally  we have homes. We use interior designers. Where are the interior sound designers  Hey  let's all be interior sound designers  take on listening to our rooms and designing sound that's effective and appropriate. My friend Richard Mazuch  an architect in London  coined the phrase  invisible architecture.  I love that phrase. It's about designing  not appearance  but experience  so that we have spaces that sound as good as they look  that are fit for purpose  that improve our quality of life  our health and well being  our social behavior and our productivity. It's time to start designing for the ears. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you.  Applause  I've always written primarily about architecture  about buildings  and writing about architecture is based on certain assumptions. An architect designs a building  and it becomes a place  or many architects design many buildings  and it becomes a city  and regardless of this complicated mix of forces of politics and culture and economics that shapes these places  at the end of the day  you can go and you can visit them. You can walk around them. You can smell them. You can get a feel for them. You can experience their sense of place. But what was striking to me over the last several years was that less and less was I going out into the world  and more and more  I was sitting in front of my computer screen. And especially since about       when I got an iPhone  I was not only sitting in front of my screen all day  but I was also getting up at the end of the day and looking at this little screen that I carried in my pocket. And what was surprising to me was how quickly my relationship to the physical world had changed. In this very short period of time  you know  whether you call it the last    years or so of being online  or the last  you know  four or five years of being online all the time  our relationship to our surroundings had changed in that our attention is constantly divided. You know  we're both looking inside the screens and we're looking out in the world around us. And what was even more striking to me  and what I really got hung up on  was that the world inside the screen seemed to have no physical reality of its own. If you went and looked for images of the Internet  this was all that you found  this famous image by Opte of the Internet as the kind of Milky Way  this infinite expanse where we don't seem to be anywhere on it. We can never seem to grasp it in its totality. It's always reminded me of the Apollo image of the Earth  the blue marble picture  and it's similarly meant to suggest  I think  that we can't really understand it as a whole. We're always sort of small in the face of its expanse. So if there was this world and this screen  and if there was the physical world around me  I couldn't ever get them together in the same place. And then this happened. My Internet broke one day  as it occasionally does  and the cable guy came to fix it  and he started with the dusty clump of cables behind the couch  and he followed it to the front of my building and into the basement and out to the back yard  and there was this big jumble of cables against the wall. And then he saw a squirrel running along the wire  and he said   There's your problem. A squirrel is chewing on your Internet.   Laughter  And this seemed astounding. The Internet is a transcendent idea. It's a set of protocols that has changed everything from shopping to dating to revolutions. It was unequivocally not something a squirrel could chew on.  Laughter  But that in fact seemed to be the case. A squirrel had in fact chewed on my Internet.  Laughter  And then I got this image in my head of what would happen if you yanked the wire from the wall and if you started to follow it. Where would it go  Was the Internet actually a place that you could visit  Could I go there  Who would I meet  You know  was there something actually out there  And the answer  by all accounts  was no. This was the Internet  this black box with a red light on it  as represented in the sitcom  The IT Crowd.  Normally it lives on the top of Big Ben  because that's where you get the best reception  but they had negotiated that their colleague could borrow it for the afternoon to use in an office presentation. The elders of the Internet were willing to part with it for a short while  and she looks at it and she says   This is the Internet  The whole Internet  Is it heavy   They say   Of course not  the Internet doesn't weigh anything.  And I was embarrassed. I was looking for this thing that only fools seem to look for. The Internet was that amorphous blob  or it was a silly black box with a blinking red light on it. It wasn't a real world out there. But  in fact  it is. There is a real world of the Internet out there  and that's what I spent about two years visiting  these places of the Internet. I was in large data centers that use as much power as the cities in which they sit  and I visited places like this     Hudson Street in New York  which is one of the buildings in the world  one of a very short list of buildings  about a dozen buildings  where more networks of the Internet connect to each other than anywhere else. And that connection is an unequivocally physical process. It's about the router of one network  a Facebook or a Google or a B.T. or a Comcast or a Time Warner  whatever it is  connecting with usually a yellow fiber optic cable up into the ceiling and down into the router of another network  and that's unequivocally physical  and it's surprisingly intimate. A building like    Hudson  and a dozen or so others  has    times more networks connecting within it than the next tier of buildings. There's a very short list of these places. And    Hudson in particular is interesting because it's home to about a half a dozen very important networks  which are the networks which serve the undersea cables that travel underneath the ocean that connect Europe and America and connect all of us. And it's those cables in particular that I want to focus on. If the Internet is a global phenomenon  if we live in a global village  it's because there are cables underneath the ocean  cables like this. And in this dimension  they are incredibly small. You can you hold them in your hand. They're like a garden hose. But in the other dimension they are incredibly expansive  as expansive as you can imagine. They stretch across the ocean. They're three or five or eight thousand miles in length  and if the material science and the computational technology is incredibly complicated  the basic physical process is shockingly simple. Light goes in on one end of the ocean and comes out on the other  and it usually comes from a building called a landing station that's often tucked away inconspicuously in a little seaside neighborhood  and there are amplifiers that sit on the ocean floor that look kind of like bluefin tuna  and every    miles they amplify the signal  and since the rate of transmission is incredibly fast  the basic unit is a    gigabit per second wavelength of light  maybe a thousand times your own connection  or capable of carrying        video streams  but not only that  but you'll put not just one wavelength of light through one of the fibers  but you'll put maybe    or    or    different wavelengths or colors of light through a single fiber  and then you'll have maybe eight fibers in a cable  four going in each direction. And they're tiny. They're the thickness of a hair. And then they connect to the continent somewhere. They connect in a manhole like this. Literally  this is where the       mile cable plugs in. This is in Halifax  a cable that stretches from Halifax to Ireland. And the landscape is changing. Three years ago  when I started thinking about this  there was one cable down the Western coast of Africa  represented in this map by Steve Song as that thin black line. Now there are six cables and more coming  three down each coast. Because once a country gets plugged in by one cable  they realize that it's not enough. If they're going to build an industry around it  they need to know that their connection isn't tenuous but permanent  because if a cable breaks  you have to send a ship out into the water  throw a grappling hook over the side  pick it up  find the other end  and then fuse the two ends back together and then dump it over. It's an intensely  intensely physical process. So this is my friend Simon Cooper  who until very recently worked for Tata Communications  the communications wing of Tata  the big Indian industrial conglomerate. And I've never met him. We've only communicated via this telepresence system  which always makes me think of him as the man inside the Internet.  Laughter  And he is English. The undersea cable industry is dominated by Englishmen  and they all seem to be   . with the boom about    years ago. And Tata had gotten its start as a communications business when they bought two cables  one across the Atlantic and one across the Pacific  and proceeded to add pieces onto them  until they had built a belt around the world  which means they will send your bits to the East or the West. They have    this is literally a beam of light around the world  and if a cable breaks in the Pacific  it'll send it around the other direction. And then having done that  they started to look for places to wire next. They looked for the unwired places  and that's meant North and South  primarily these cables to Africa. But what amazes me is Simon's incredible geographic imagination. He thinks about the world with this incredible expansiveness. And I was particularly interested because I wanted to see one of these cables being built. See  you know  all the time online we experience these fleeting moments of connection  these sort of brief adjacencies  a tweet or a Facebook post or an email  and it seemed like there was a physical corollary to that. It seemed like there was a moment when the continent was being plugged in  and I wanted to see that. And Simon was working on a new cable  WACS  the West Africa Cable System  that stretched from Lisbon down the west coast of Africa  to Cote d'Ivoire  to Ghana  to Nigeria  to Cameroon. And he said there was coming soon  depending on the weather  but he'd let me know when  and so with about four days notice  he said to go to this beach south of Lisbon  and a little after    this guy will walk out of the water.  Laughter  And he'll be carrying a green nylon line  a lightweight line  called a messenger line  and that was the first link between sea and land  this link that would then be leveraged into this       mile path of light. Then a bulldozer began to pull the cable in from this specialized cable landing ship  and it was floated on these buoys until it was in the right place. Then you can see the English engineers looking on. And then  once it was in the right place  he got back in the water holding a big knife  and he cut each buoy off  and the buoy popped up into the air  and the cable dropped to the sea floor  and he did that all the way out to the ship  and when he got there  they gave him a glass of juice and a cookie  and then he jumped back in  and he swam back to shore  and then he lit a cigarette.  Laughter  And then once that cable was on shore  they began to prepare to connect it to the other side  for the cable that had been brought down from the landing station. And first they got it with a hacksaw  and then they start sort of shaving away at this plastic interior with a    sort of working like chefs  and then finally they're working like jewelers to get these hair thin fibers to line up with the cable that had come down  and with this hole punch machine they fuse it together. And when you see these guys going at this cable with a hacksaw  you stop thinking about the Internet as a cloud. It starts to seem like an incredibly physical thing. And what surprised me as well was that as much as this is based on the most sophisticated technology  as much as this is an incredibly new thing  the physical process itself has been around for a long time  and the culture is the same. You see the local laborers. You see the English engineer giving directions in the background. And more importantly  the places are the same. These cables still connect these classic port cities  places like Lisbon  Mombasa  Mumbai  Singapore  New York. And then the process on shore takes around three or four days  and then  when it's done  they put the manhole cover back on top  and they push the sand over that  and we all forget about it. And it seems to me that we talk a lot about the cloud  but every time we put something on the cloud  we give up some responsibility for it. We are less connected to it. We let other people worry about it. And that doesn't seem right. There's a great Neal Stephenson line where he says that wired people should know something about wires. And we should know  I think  we should know where our Internet comes from  and we should know what it is that physically  physically connects us all. Thank you.  Applause  Thanks.  Applause  I want to talk to you today about a difficult topic that is close to me  and closer than you might realize to you. I came to the UK    years ago  as an asylum seeker. I was   . I was forced to leave the Democratic Republic of the Congo  my home  where I was a student activist. I would love my children to be able to meet my family in the Congo. But I want to tell you what the Congo has got to do with you. But first of all  I want you to do me a favor. Can you all please reach into your pockets and take out your mobile phone  Feel that familiar weight ... how naturally your finger slides towards the buttons. Can you imagine your world without it  It connects us to our loved ones  our family  friends and colleagues  at home and overseas. It is a symbol of an interconnected world. But what you hold in your hand leaves a bloody trail  and it all boils down to a mineral  tantalum  mined in the Congo as coltan. It is an anticorrosive heat conductor. It stores energy in our mobile phones  PlayStations and laptops. It is used in aerospace and medical equipment as an alloy. It is so powerful that we only need tiny amounts. It would be great if the story ended there. Unfortunately  what you hold in your hand has not only enabled incredible technological development and industrial expansion  but it has also contributed to unimaginable human suffering. Since       over five million people have died in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Countless women  men and children have been raped  tortured or enslaved. Rape is used as a weapon of war  instilling fear and depopulating whole areas. The quest for extracting this mineral has not only aided  but it has fueled the ongoing war in the Congo. But don't throw away your phones yet. Thirty thousand children are enlisted and are made to fight in armed groups. The Congo consistently scores dreadfully in global health and poverty rankings. But remarkably  the UN Environmental Programme has estimated the wealth of the country to be over    trillion dollars. The state regulated mining industry has collapsed  and control over mines has splintered. Coltan is easily controlled by armed groups. One well known illicit trade route is that across the border to Rwanda  where Congolese tantalum is disguised as Rwandan. But don't throw away your phones yet  because the incredible irony is that the technology that has placed such unsustainable  devastating demands on the Congo is the same technology that has brought this situation to our attention. We only know so much about the situation in the Congo and in the mines because of the kind of communication the mobile phone allows. As with the Arab Spring  during the recent elections in the Congo  voters were able to send text messages of local polling stations to the headquarters in the capital  Kinshasa. And in the wake of the result  the diaspora has joined with the Carter Center  the Catholic Church and other observers  to draw attention to the undemocratic result. The mobile phone has given people around the world an important tool towards gaining their political freedom. It has truly revolutionized the way we communicate on the planet. It has allowed momentous political change to take place. So  we are faced with a paradox. The mobile phone is an instrument of freedom and an instrument of oppression. TED has always celebrated what technology can do for us  technology in its finished form. It is time to be asking questions about technology. Where does it come from  Who makes it  And for what  Here  I am speaking directly to you  the TED community  and to all those who might be watching on a screen  on your phone  across the world  in the Congo. All the technology is in place for us to communicate  and all the technology is in place to communicate this. At the moment  there is no clear fair trade solution. But there has been a huge amount of progress. The US has recently passed legislation to target bribery and misconduct in the Congo. Recent UK legislation could be used in the same way. In February  Nokia unveiled its new policy on sourcing minerals in the Congo  and there is a petition to Apple to make a conflict free iPhone. There are campaigns spreading across university campuses to make their colleges conflict free. But we're not there yet. We need to continue mounting pressure on phone companies to change their sourcing processes. When I first came to the UK     years ago  I was homesick. I missed my family and the friends I left behind. Communication was extremely difficult. Sending and receiving letters took months    if you were lucky. Often  they never arrived. Even if I could have afforded the phone bills home  like most people in the Congo  my parents did not own a phone line. Today  my two sons    David and Daniel  can talk to my parents and get to know them. Why should we allow such a wonderful  brilliant and necessary product to be the cause of unnecessary suffering for human beings  We demand fair trade food and fair trade clothes. It is time to demand fair trade phones. This is an idea worth spreading. Thank you. You know  we wake up in the morning  you get dressed  put on your shoes  you head out into the world. You plan on coming back  getting undressed  going to bed  waking up  doing it again  and that anticipation  that rhythm  helps give us a structure to how we organize ourselves and our lives  and gives it a measure of predictability. Living in New York City  as I do  it's almost as if  with so many people doing so many things at the same time in such close quarters  it's almost like life is dealing you extra hands out of that deck. You're never  there's just  juxtapositions are possible that just aren't  you don't think they're going to happen. And you never think you're going to be the guy who's walking down the street and  because you choose to go down one side or the other  the rest of your life is changed forever. And one night  I'm riding the uptown local train. I get on. I tend to be a little bit vigilant when I get on the subway. I'm not one of the people zoning out with headphones or a book. And I get on the car  and I look  and I notice this couple  college aged  student looking kids  a guy and a girl  and they're sitting next to each other  and she's got her leg draped over his knee  and they're doing    they have this little contraption  and they're tying these knots  and they're doing it with one hand  they're doing it left handed and right handed very quickly  and then she'll hand the thing to him and he'll do it. I've never seen anything like this. It's almost like they're practicing magic tricks. And at the next stop  a guy gets on the car  and he has this sort of visiting professor look to him. He's got the overstuffed leather satchel and the rectangular file case and a laptop bag and the tweed jacket with the leather patches  and    Laughter    he looks at them  and then in a blink of an eye  he kneels down in front of them  and he starts to say   You know  listen  here's how you can do it. Look  if you do this      and he takes the laces out of their hand  and instantly  he starts tying these knots  and even better than they were doing it  remarkably. And it turns out they are medical students on their way to a lecture about the latest suturing techniques  and he's the guy giving the lecture. So he starts to tell them  and he's like   No  this is very important here. You know  when you're needing these knots  it's going to be  you know  everything's going to be happening at the same time  it's going to be    you're going to have all this information coming at you  there's going to be organs getting in the way  it's going to be slippery  and it's just very important that you be able to do these beyond second nature  each hand  left hand  right hand  you have to be able to do them without seeing your fingers.  And at that moment  when I heard that  I just got catapulted out of the subway car into a night when I had been getting a ride in an ambulance from the sidewalk where I had been stabbed to the trauma room of St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan  and what had happened was a gang had come in from Brooklyn. As part of an initiation for three of their members  they had to kill somebody  and I happened to be the guy walking down Bleecker Street that night  and they jumped on me without a word. One of the very lucky things  when I was at Notre Dame  I was on the boxing team  so I put my hands up right away  instinctively. The guy on the right had a knife with a    inch blade  and he went in under my elbow  and it went up and cut my inferior vena cava. If you know anything about anatomy  that's not a good thing to get cut  and everything  of course  on the way up  and then   I still had my hands up   he pulled it out and went for my neck  and sunk it in up to the hilt in my neck  and I got one straight right punch and knocked the middle guy out. The other guy was still working on me  collapsing my other lung  and I managed to  by hitting that guy  to get a minute. I ran down the street and collapsed  and the ambulance guys intubated me on the sidewalk and let the trauma room know they had an incoming. And one of the side effects of having major massive blood loss is you get tunnel vision  so I remember being on the stretcher and having a little nickel sized cone of vision  and I was moving my head around and we got to St. Vincent's  and we're racing down this hallway  and I see the lights going  and it's a peculiar effect of memories like that. They don't really go to the usual place that memories go. They kind of have this vault where they're stored in high def  and George Lucas did all the sound effects.  Laughter  So sometimes  remembering them  it's like  it's not like any other kind of memories. And I get into the trauma room  and they're waiting for me  and the lights are there  and I'd been able to breathe a little more now  because the blood has left  had been filling up my lungs and I was having a very hard time breathing  but now it's kind of gone into the stretcher. And I said   Is there anything I can do to help   and    Laughter    the nurse kind of had a hysterical laugh  and I'm turning my head trying to see everybody  and I had this weird memory of being in college and raising  raising money for the flood victims of Bangladesh  and then I look over and my anesthesiologist is clamping the mask on me  and I think   He looks Bangladeshi      Laughter    and I just have those two facts  and I just think   This could work somehow.   Laughter  And then I go out  and they work on me for the rest of the night  and I needed about    units of blood to keep me there while they did their work  and the surgeon took out about a third of my intestines  my cecum  organs I didn't know that I had  and he later told me one of the last things he did while he was in there was to remove my appendix for me  which I thought was great  you know  just a little tidy thing there at the end.  Laughter  And I came to in the morning. Out of anesthetic  he had let them know that he wanted to be there  and he had given me about a two percent chance of living. So he was there when I woke up  and it was  waking up was like breaking through the ice into a frozen lake of pain. It was that enveloping  and there was only one spot that didn't hurt worse than anything I'd ever felt  and it was my instep  and he was holding the arch of my foot and rubbing the instep with his thumb. And I looked up  and he's like   Good to see you   and I was trying to remember what had happened and trying to get my head around everything  and the pain was just overwhelming  and he said   You know  we didn't cut your hair. I thought you might have gotten strength from your hair like Samson  and you're going to need all the strength you can get.  And in those days  my hair was down to my waist  I drove a motorcycle  I was unmarried  I owned a bar  so those were different times.  Laughter  But I had three days of life support  and everybody was expecting  due to just the massive amount of what they had had to do that I wasn't going to make it  so it was three days of everybody was either waiting for me to die or poop  and    Laughter    when I finally pooped  then that somehow  surgically speaking  that's like you crossed some good line  and  um    Laughter    on that day  the surgeon came in and whipped the sheet off of me. He had three or four friends with him  and he does that  and they all look  and there was no infection  and they bend over me and they're poking and prodding  and they're like   There's no hematomas  blah blah  look at the color   and they're talking amongst themselves and I'm  like  this restored automobile that he's just going   Yeah  I did that.   Laughter  And it was just  it was amazing  because these guys are high fiving him over how good I turned out  you know   Laughter  And it's my zipper  and I've still got the staples in and everything. And later on  when I got out and the flashbacks and the nightmares were giving me a hard time  I went back to him and I was sort of asking him  you know  what am I gonna do  And I think  kind of  as a surgeon  he basically said   Kid  I saved your life. Like  now you can do whatever you want  like  you gotta get on with that. It's like I gave you a new car and you're complaining about not finding parking. Like  just  go out  and  you know  do your best. But you're alive. That's what it's about.  And then I hear   Bing bong   and the subway doors are closing  and my stop is next  and I look at these kids  and I go  I think to myself   I'm going to lift my shirt up and show them      Laughter    and then I think   No  this is the New York City subway  that's going to lead to other things.   Laughter  And so I just think  they got their lecture to go to. I step off  I'm standing on the platform  and I feel my index finger in the first scar that I ever got  from my umbilical cord  and then around that  is traced the last scar that I got from my surgeon  and I think that  that chance encounter with those kids on the street with their knives led me to my surgical team  and their training and their skill and  always  a little bit of luck pushed back against chaos.

I'd like to start by introducing you to someone whose life has been changed by a marketplace fueled by reputation. Sebastian Sandys has been a bed and breakfast host on Airbnb since     . I caught up with him recently  where  over the course of several cups of tea  he told me how hosting guests from all over the world has enriched his life. More than    people have come to stay in the   th century watchhouse he lives in with his cat  Squeak. Now  I mention Squeak because Sebastian's first guest happened to see a rather large mouse run across the kitchen  and she promised that she would refrain from leaving a bad review on one condition  he got a cat. And so Sebastian bought Squeak to protect his reputation. Now  as many of you know  Airbnb is a peer to peer marketplace that matches people who have space to rent with people who are looking for a place to stay in over     countries. The places being rented out are things that you might expect  like spare rooms and holiday homes  but part of the magic is the unique places that you can now access  treehouses  teepees  airplane hangars  igloos. If you don't like the hotel  there's a castle down the road that you can rent for       dollars a night. It's a fantastic example of how technology is creating a market for things that never had a marketplace before. Now let me show you these heat maps of Paris to see how insanely fast it's growing. This image here is from     . The pink dots represent host properties. Even four years ago  letting strangers stay in your home seemed like a crazy idea. Now the same view in     . And now      . There is an Airbnb host on almost every main street in Paris. Now  what's happening here is people are realizing the power of technology to unlock the idling capacity and value of all kinds of assets  from skills to spaces to material possessions  in ways and on a scale never possible before. It's an economy and culture called collaborative consumption  and  through it  people like Sebastian are becoming micro entrepreneurs. They're empowered to make money and save money from their existing assets. But the real magic and the secret source behind collaborative consumption marketplaces like Airbnb isn't the inventory or the money. It's using the power of technology to build trust between strangers. This side of Airbnb really hit home to Sebastian last summer during the London riots. He woke up around    and he checked his email and he saw a bunch of messages all asking him if he was okay. Former guests from around the world had seen that the riots were happening just down the street  and wanted to check if he needed anything. Sebastian actually said to me  he said   Thirteen former guests contacted me before my own mother rang.   Laughter  Now  this little anecdote gets to the heart of why I'm really passionate about collaborative consumption  and why  after I finished my book  I decided I'm going to try and spread this into a global movement. Because at its core  it's about empowerment. It's about empowering people to make meaningful connections  connections that are enabling us to rediscover a humanness that we've lost somewhere along the way  by engaging in marketplaces like Airbnb  like Kickstarter  like Etsy  that are built on personal relationships versus empty transactions. Now the irony is that these ideas are actually taking us back to old market principles and collaborative behaviors that are hard wired in all of us. They're just being reinvented in ways that are relevant for the Facebook age. We're literally beginning to realize that we have wired our world to share  swap  rent  barter or trade just about anything. We're sharing our cars on WhipCar  our bikes on Spinlister  our offices on Loosecubes  our gardens on Landshare. We're lending and borrowing money from strangers on Zopa and Lending Club. We are trading lessons on everything from sushi making to coding on Skillshare  and we're even sharing our pets on DogVacay. Now welcome to the wonderful world of collaborative consumption that's enabling us to match wants with haves in more democratic ways. Now  collaborative consumption is creating the start of a transformation in the way we think about supply and demand  but it's also a part of a massive value shift underway  where instead of consuming to keep up with the Joneses  people are consuming to get to know the Joneses. But the key reason why it's taking off now so fast is because every new advancement of technology increases the efficiency and the social glue of trust to make sharing easier and easier. Now  I've looked at thousands of these marketplaces  and trust and efficiency are always the critical ingredients. Let me give you an example. Meet    year old Chris Mok  who has  I bet  the best job title here of SuperRabbit. Now  four years ago  Chris lost his job  unfortunately  as an art buyer at Macy's  and like so many people  he struggled to find a new one during the recession. And then he happened to stumble across a post about TaskRabbit. Now  the story behind TaskRabbit starts like so many great stories with a very cute dog by the name of Kobe. Now what happened was  in February       Leah and her husband were waiting for a cab to take them out for dinner  when Kobe came trotting up to them and he was salivating with saliva. They realized they'd run out of dog food. Kevin had to cancel the cab and trudge out in the snow. Now  later that evening  the two self confessed tech geeks starting talking about how cool it would be if some kind of eBay for errands existed. Six months later  Leah quit her job  and TaskRabbit was born. At the time  she didn't realize that she was actually hitting on a bigger idea she later called service networking. It's essentially about how we use our online relationships to get things done in the real world. Now the way TaskRabbit works is  people outsource the tasks that they want doing  name the price they're willing to pay  and then vetted Rabbits bid to run the errand. Yes  there's actually a four stage  rigorous interview process that's designed to find the people that would make great personal assistants and weed out the dodgy Rabbits. Now  there's over       Rabbits across the United States and       more on the waiting list. Now the tasks being posted are things that you might expect  like help with household chores or doing some supermarket runs. I actually learned the other day that    and a half thousand loads of laundry have been cleaned and folded through TaskRabbit. But I love that the number one task posted  over a hundred times a day  is something that many of us have felt the pain of doing  yes  assembling Ikea furniture.  Laughter   Applause  It's brilliant. Now  we may laugh  but Chris here is actually making up to       dollars a month running errands around his life. And    percent of this new labor force were previously unemployed or underemployed. I think TaskRabbit and other examples of collaborative consumption are like lemonade stands on steroids. They're just brilliant. Now  when you think about it  it's amazing  right  that over the past    years  we've evolved from trusting people online to share information to trusting to handing over our credit card information  and now we're entering the third trust wave  connecting trustworthy strangers to create all kinds of people powered marketplaces. I actually came across this fascinating study by the Pew Center this week that revealed that an active Facebook user is three times as likely as a non Internet user to believe that most people are trustworthy. Virtual trust will transform the way we trust one another face to face. Now  with all of my optimism  and I am an optimist  comes a healthy dose of caution  or rather  an urgent need to address some pressing  complex questions. How to ensure our digital identities reflect our real world identities  Do we want them to be the same  How do we mimic the way trust is built face to face online  How do we stop people who've behaved badly in one community doing so under a different guise  In a similar way that companies often use some kind of credit rating to decide whether to give you a mobile plan  or the rate of a mortgage  marketplaces that depend on transactions between relative strangers need some kind of device to let you know that Sebastian and Chris are good eggs  and that device is reputation. Reputation is the measurement of how much a community trusts you. Let's just take a look at Chris. You can see that over     people have given him an average rating over  .   out of  . There are over    pages of reviews of his work describing him as super friendly and fast  and he's reached level     the highest level  making him a SuperRabbit. Now    Laughter     I love that word  SuperRabbit. And interestingly  what Chris has noted is that as his reputation has gone up  so has his chances of winning a bid and how much he can charge. In other words  for SuperRabbits  reputation has a real world value. Now  I know what you might be thinking. Well  this isn't anything new. Just think of power sellers on eBay or star ratings on Amazon. The difference today is that  with every trade we make  comment we leave  person we flag  badge we earn  we leave a reputation trail of how well we can and can't be trusted. And it's not just the breadth but the volume of reputation data out there that is staggering. Just consider this  Five million nights have been booked on Airbnb in the past six months alone.    million rides have been shared on Carpooling.com. This year  two billion dollars worth of loans will go through peer to peer lending platforms. This adds up to millions of pieces of reputation data on how well we behave or misbehave. Now  capturing and correlating the trails of information that we leave in different places is a massive challenge  but one we're being asked to figure out. What the likes of Sebastian are starting to rightfully ask is  shouldn't they own their reputation data  Shouldn't the reputation that he's personally invested on building on Airbnb mean that it should travel with him from one community to another  What I mean by this is  say he started selling second hand books on Amazon. Why should he have to start from scratch  It's a bit like when I moved from New York to Sydney. It was ridiculous. I couldn't get a mobile phone plan because my credit history didn't travel with me. I was essentially a ghost in the system. Now I'm not suggesting that the next stage of the reputation economy is about adding up multiple ratings into some kind of empty score. People's lives are too complex  and who wants to do that  I also want to be clear that this isn't about adding up tweets and likes and friends in a clout like fashion. Those guys are measuring influence  not behaviors that indicate our trustworthiness. But the most important thing that we have to keep in mind is that reputation is largely contextual. Just because Sebastian is a wonderful host does not mean that he can assemble Ikea furniture. The big challenge is figuring out what data makes sense to pull  because the future's going to be driven by a smart aggregation of reputation  not a single algorithm. It's only a matter of time before we'll be able to perform a Facebook  or Google like search and see a complete picture of someone's behaviors in different contexts over time. I envision a realtime stream of who has trusted you  when  where and why  your reliability on TaskRabbit  your cleanliness as a guest on Airbnb  the knowledge that you display on Quora or  unclear   they'll all live together in one place  and this will live in some kind of reputation dashboard that will paint a picture of your reputation capital. Now this is a concept that I'm currently researching and writing my next book on  and currently define as the worth of your reputation  your intentions  capabilities and values across communities and marketplaces. This isn't some far off frontier. There are actually a wave of startups like Connect.Me and Legit and TrustCloud that are figuring out how you can aggregate  monitor and use your online reputation. Now  I realize that this concept may sound a little Big Brother to some of you  and yes  there are some enormous transparency and privacy issues to solve  but ultimately  if we can collect our personal reputation  we can actually control it more  and extract the immense value that will flow from it. Also  more so than our credit history  we can actually shape our reputation. Just think of Sebastian and how he bought the cat to influence his. Now privacy issues aside  the other really interesting issue I'm looking at is how do we empower digital ghosts  people  who  for whatever reason  are not active online  but are some of the most trustworthy people in the world  How do we take their contributions to their jobs  their communities and their families  and convert that value into reputation capital  Ultimately  when we get it right  reputation capital could create a massive positive disruption in who has power  trust and influence. A three digit score  your traditional credit history  that only    percent of us actually know what it is  will no longer be the determining factor in how much things cost  what we can access  and  in many instances  limit what we can do in the world. Indeed  reputation is a currency that I believe will become more powerful than our credit history in the   st century. Reputation will be the currency that says that you can trust me. Now the interesting thing is  reputation is the socioeconomic lubricant that makes collaborative consumption work and scale  but the sources it will be generated from  and its applications  are far bigger than this space alone. Let me give you one example from the world of recruiting  where reputation data will make the r sum  seem like an archaic relic of the past. Four years ago  tech bloggers and entrepreneurs Joel Spolsky and Jeff Atwood  decided to start something called Stack Overflow. Now  Stack Overflow is basically a platform where experienced programmers can ask other good programmers highly detailed technical questions on things like tiny pixels and chrome extensions. This site receives five and a half thousand questions a day  and    percent of these receive accurate answers. Now users earn reputation in a whole range of ways  but it's basically by convincing their peers they know what they're talking about. Now a few months after this site launched  the founders heard about something interesting  and it actually didn't surprise them. What they heard was that users were putting their reputation scores on the top of their r sum s  and that recruiters were searching the platform to find people with unique talents. Now thousands of programmers today are finding better jobs this way  because Stack Overflow and the reputation dashboards provide a priceless window into how someone really behaves  and what their peers think of them. But the bigger principle of what's happening behind Stack Overflow  I think  is incredibly exciting. People are starting to realize that the reputation they generate in one place has value beyond the environments from which it was built. You know  it's very interesting. When you talk to super users  whether that's SuperRabbits or super people on Stack Overflow  or Uberhosts  they all talk about how having a high reputation unlocks a sense of their own power. On Stack Overflow  it creates a level playing field  enabling the people with the real talent to rise to the top. On Airbnb  the people often become more important than the spaces. On TaskRabbit  it gives people control of their economic activity. Now at the end of my tea with Sebastian  he told me how  on a bad  rainy day  when he hasn't had a customer in his bookstore  he thinks of all the people around the world who've said something wonderful about him  and what that says about him as a person. He's turning    this year  and he's convinced that the rich tapestry of reputation he's built on Airbnb will lead him to doing something interesting with the rest of his life. You know  there are only a few windows in history where the opportunity exists to reinvent part of how our socioeconomic system works. We're living through one of those moments. I believe that we are at the start of a collaborative revolution that will be as significant as the Industrial Revolution. In the   th century  the invention of traditional credit transformed our consumer system  and in many ways controlled who had access to what. In the   st century  new trust networks  and the reputation capital they generate  will reinvent the way we think about wealth  markets  power and personal identity  in ways we can't yet even imagine. Thank you very much.  Applause  As it turns out  when tens of millions of people are unemployed or underemployed  there's a fair amount of interest in what technology might be doing to the labor force. And as I look at the conversation  it strikes me that it's focused on exactly the right topic  and at the same time  it's missing the point entirely. The topic that it's focused on  the question is whether or not all these digital technologies are affecting people's ability to earn a living  or  to say it a little bit different way  are the droids taking our jobs  And there's some evidence that they are. The Great Recession ended when American GDP resumed its kind of slow  steady march upward  and some other economic indicators also started to rebound  and they got kind of healthy kind of quickly. Corporate profits are quite high  in fact  if you include bank profits  they're higher than they've ever been. And business investment in gear    in equipment and hardware and software    is at an all time high. So the businesses are getting out their checkbooks. What they're not really doing is hiring. So this red line is the employment to population ratio  in other words  the percentage of working age people in America who have work. And we see that it cratered during the Great Recession  and it hasn't started to bounce back at all. But the story is not just a recession story. The decade that we've just been through had relatively anemic job growth all throughout  especially when we compare it to other decades  and the     s are the only time we have on record where there were fewer people working at the end of the decade than at the beginning. This is not what you want to see. When you graph the number of potential employees versus the number of jobs in the country  you see the gap gets bigger and bigger over time  and then  during the Great Recession  it opened up in a huge way. I did some quick calculations. I took the last    years of GDP growth and the last    years of labor productivity growth and used those in a fairly straightforward way to try to project how many jobs the economy was going to need to keep growing  and this is the line that I came up with. Is that good or bad  This is the government's projection for the working age population going forward. So if these predictions are accurate  that gap is not going to close. The problem is  I don't think these projections are accurate. In particular  I think my projection is way too optimistic  because when I did it  I was assuming that the future was kind of going to look like the past  with labor productivity growth  and that's actually not what I believe. Because when I look around  I think that we ain't seen nothing yet when it comes to technology's impact on the labor force. Just in the past couple years  we've seen digital tools display skills and abilities that they never  ever had before  and that kind of eat deeply into what we human beings do for a living. Let me give you a couple examples. Throughout all of history  if you wanted something translated from one language into another  you had to involve a human being. Now we have multi language  instantaneous  automatic translation services available for free via many of our devices  all the way down to smartphones. And if any of us have used these  we know that they're not perfect  but they're decent. Throughout all of history  if you wanted something written  a report or an article  you had to involve a person. Not anymore. This is an article that appeared in Forbes online a while back  about Apple's earnings. It was written by an algorithm. And it's not decent    it's perfect. A lot of people look at this and they say   OK  but those are very specific  narrow tasks  and most knowledge workers are actually generalists. And what they do is sit on top of a very large body of expertise and knowledge and they use that to react on the fly to kind of unpredictable demands  and that's very  very hard to automate.  One of the most impressive knowledge workers in recent memory is a guy named Ken Jennings. He won the quiz show  Jeopardy      times in a row. Took home three million dollars. That's Ken on the right  getting beat three to one by Watson  the Jeopardy playing supercomputer from IBM. So when we look at what technology can do to general knowledge workers  I start to think there might not be something so special about this idea of a generalist  particularly when we start doing things like hooking Siri up to Watson  and having technologies that can understand what we're saying and repeat speech back to us. Now  Siri is far from perfect  and we can make fun of her flaws  but we should also keep in mind that if technologies like Siri and Watson improve along a Moore's law trajectory  which they will  in six years  they're not going to be two times better or four times better  they'll be    times better than they are right now. So I start to think a lot of knowledge work is going to be affected by this. And digital technologies are not just impacting knowledge work  they're starting to flex their muscles in the physical world as well. I had the chance a little while back to ride in the Google autonomous car  which is as cool as it sounds. And I will vouch that it handled the stop and go traffic on US     very smoothly. There are about three and a half million people who drive trucks for a living in the United States  I think some of them are going to be affected by this technology. And right now  humanoid robots are still incredibly primitive. They can't do very much. But they're getting better quite quickly and DARPA  which is the investment arm of the Defense Department  is trying to accelerate their trajectory. So  in short  yeah  the droids are coming for our jobs. In the short term  we can stimulate job growth by encouraging entrepreneurship and by investing in infrastructure  because the robots today still aren't very good at fixing bridges. But in the not too long term  I think within the lifetimes of most of the people in this room  we're going to transition into an economy that is very productive  but that just doesn't need a lot of human workers. And managing that transition is going to be the greatest challenge that our society faces. Voltaire summarized why  he said   Work saves us from three great evils  boredom  vice and need.  But despite this challenge    personally  I'm still a huge digital optimist  and I am supremely confident that the digital technologies that we're developing now are going to take us into a Utopian future  not a dystopian future. And to explain why  I want to pose a ridiculously broad question. I want to ask  what have been the most important developments in human history  Now  I want to share some of the answers that I've gotten in response to this question. It's a wonderful question to ask and start an endless debate about  because some people are going to bring up systems of philosophy in both the West and the East that have changed how a lot of people think about the world. And then other people will say   No  actually  the big stories  the big developments are the founding of the world's major religions  which have changed civilizations and have changed and influenced how countless people are living their lives.  And then some other folk will say   Actually  what changes civilizations  what modifies them and what changes people's lives are empires  so the great developments in human history are stories of conquest and of war.  And then some cheery soul usually always pipes up and says   Hey  don't forget about plagues   There are some optimistic answers to this question  so some people will bring up the Age of Exploration and the opening up of the world. Others will talk about intellectual achievements in disciplines like math that have helped us get a better handle on the world  and other folk will talk about periods when there was a deep flourishing of the arts and sciences. So this debate will go on and on. It's an endless debate and there's no conclusive  single answer to it. But if you're a geek like me  you say   Well  what do the data say   And you start to do things like graph things that we might be interested in    the total worldwide population  for example  or some measure of social development or the state of advancement of a society. And you start to plot the data  because  by this approach  the big stories  the big developments in human history  are the ones that will bend these curves a lot. So when you do this and when you plot the data  you pretty quickly come to some weird conclusions. You conclude  actually  that none of these things have mattered very much. They haven't done a darn thing to the curves. There has been one story  one development in human history that bent the curve  bent it just about    degrees  and it is a technology story. The steam engine and the other associated technologies of the Industrial Revolution changed the world and influenced human history so much  that in the words of the historian Ian Morris   ... they made mockery out of all that had come before.  And they did this by infinitely multiplying the power of our muscles  overcoming the limitations of our muscles. Now  what we're in the middle of now is overcoming the limitations of our individual brains and infinitely multiplying our mental power. How can this not be as big a deal as overcoming the limitations of our muscles  So at the risk of repeating myself a little bit  when I look at what's going on with digital technology these days  we are not anywhere near through with this journey. And when I look at what is happening to our economies and our societies  my single conclusion is that we ain't seen nothing yet. The best days are really ahead. Let me give you a couple examples. Economies don't run on energy. They don't run on capital  they don't run on labor. Economies run on ideas. So the work of innovation  the work of coming up with new ideas  is some of the most powerful  most fundamental work that we can do in an economy. And this is kind of how we used to do innovation. We'd find a bunch of fairly similar looking people ... We'd take them out of elite institutions  we'd put them into other elite institutions and we'd wait for the innovation. Now    as a white guy who spent his whole career at MIT and Harvard  I've got no problem with this. But some other people do  and they've kind of crashed the party and loosened up the dress code of innovation. So here are the winners of a Topcoder programming challenge  and I assure you that nobody cares where these kids grew up  where they went to school  or what they look like. All anyone cares about is the quality of the work  the quality of the ideas. And over and over again  we see this happening in the technology facilitated world. The work of innovation is becoming more open  more inclusive  more transparent and more merit based  and that's going to continue no matter what MIT and Harvard think of it  and I couldn't be happier about that development. I hear once in a while   OK  I'll grant you that  but technology is still a tool for the rich world  and what's not happening  these digital tools are not improving the lives of people at the bottom of the pyramid.  And I want to say to that very clearly  nonsense. The bottom of the pyramid is benefiting hugely from technology. The economist Robert Jensen did this wonderful study a while back where he watched  in great detail  what happened to the fishing villages of Kerala  India  when they got mobile phones for the very first time. And when you write for the Quarterly Journal of Economics  you have to use very dry and very circumspect language. But when I read his paper  I kind of feel Jensen is trying to scream at us and say   Look  this was a big deal. Prices stabilized  so people could plan their economic lives. Waste was not reduced    it was eliminated. And the lives of both the buyers and the sellers in these villages measurably improved.  Now  what I don't think is that Jensen got extremely lucky and happened to land in the one set of villages where technology made things better. What happened instead is he very carefully documented what happens over and over again when technology comes for the first time to an environment and a community  the lives of people  the welfares of people  improve dramatically. So as I look around at all the evidence and I think about the room that we have ahead of us  I become a huge digital optimist and I start to think that this wonderful statement from the physicist Freeman Dyson is actually not hyperbole. This is an accurate assessment of what's going on. Our technologies are great gifts  and we  right now  have the great good fortune to be living at a time when digital technology is flourishing  when it is broadening and deepening and becoming more profound all around the world. So  yeah  the droids are taking our jobs  but focusing on that fact misses the point entirely. The point is that then we are freed up to do other things  and what we're going to do  I am very confident  what we're going to do is reduce poverty and drudgery and misery around the world. I'm very confident we're going to learn to live more lightly on the planet  and I am extremely confident that what we're going to do with our new digital tools is going to be so profound and so beneficial that it's going to make a mockery out of everything that came before. I'm going to leave the last word to a guy who had a front row seat for digital progress  our old friend Ken Jennings. I'm with him  I'm going to echo his words   I  for one  welcome our new computer overlords.  Thanks very much. Other people. Everyone is interested in other people. Everyone has relationships with other people  and they're interested in these relationships for a variety of reasons. Good relationships  bad relationships  annoying relationships  agnostic relationships  and what I'm going to do is focus on the central piece of an interaction that goes on in a relationship. So I'm going to take as inspiration the fact that we're all interested in interacting with other people  I'm going to completely strip it of all its complicating features  and I'm going to turn that object  that simplified object  into a scientific probe  and provide the early stages  embryonic stages of new insights into what happens in two brains while they simultaneously interact. But before I do that  let me tell you a couple of things that made this possible. The first is we can now eavesdrop safely on healthy brain activity. Without needles and radioactivity  without any kind of clinical reason  we can go down the street and record from your friends' and neighbors' brains while they do a variety of cognitive tasks  and we use a method called functional magnetic resonance imaging. You've probably all read about it or heard about in some incarnation. Let me give you a two sentence version of it. So we've all heard of MRIs. MRIs use magnetic fields and radio waves and they take snapshots of your brain or your knee or your stomach  grayscale images that are frozen in time. In the     s  it was discovered you could use the same machines in a different mode  and in that mode  you could make microscopic blood flow movies from hundreds of thousands of sites independently in the brain. Okay  so what  In fact  the so what is  in the brain  changes in neural activity  the things that make your brain work  the things that make your software work in your brain  are tightly correlated with changes in blood flow. You make a blood flow movie  you have an independent proxy of brain activity. This has literally revolutionized cognitive science. Take any cognitive domain you want  memory  motor planning  thinking about your mother in law  getting angry at people  emotional response  it goes on and on  put people into functional MRI devices  and image how these kinds of variables map onto brain activity. It's in its early stages  and it's crude by some measures  but in fact     years ago  we were at nothing. You couldn't do people like this. You couldn't do healthy people. That's caused a literal revolution  and it's opened us up to a new experimental preparation. Neurobiologists  as you well know  have lots of experimental preps  worms and rodents and fruit flies and things like this. And now  we have a new experimental prep  human beings. We can now use human beings to study and model the software in human beings  and we have a few burgeoning biological measures. Okay  let me give you one example of the kinds of experiments that people do  and it's in the area of what you'd call valuation. Valuation is just what you think it is  you know  If you went and you were valuing two companies against one another  you'd want to know which was more valuable. Cultures discovered the key feature of valuation thousands of years ago. If you want to compare oranges to windshields  what do you do  Well  you can't compare oranges to windshields. They're immiscible. They don't mix with one another. So instead  you convert them to a common currency scale  put them on that scale  and value them accordingly. Well  your brain has to do something just like that as well  and we're now beginning to understand and identify brain systems involved in valuation  and one of them includes a neurotransmitter system whose cells are located in your brainstem and deliver the chemical dopamine to the rest of your brain. I won't go through the details of it  but that's an important discovery  and we know a good bit about that now  and it's just a small piece of it  but it's important because those are the neurons that you would lose if you had Parkinson's disease  and they're also the neurons that are hijacked by literally every drug of abuse  and that makes sense. Drugs of abuse would come in  and they would change the way you value the world. They change the way you value the symbols associated with your drug of choice  and they make you value that over everything else. Here's the key feature though. These neurons are also involved in the way you can assign value to literally abstract ideas  and I put some symbols up here that we assign value to for various reasons. We have a behavioral superpower in our brain  and it at least in part involves dopamine. We can deny every instinct we have for survival for an idea  for a mere idea. No other species can do that. In       the cult Heaven's Gate committed mass suicide predicated on the idea that there was a spaceship hiding in the tail of the then visible comet Hale Bopp waiting to take them to the next level. It was an incredibly tragic event. More than two thirds of them had college degrees. But the point here is they were able to deny their instincts for survival using exactly the same systems that were put there to make them survive. That's a lot of control  okay  One thing that I've left out of this narrative is the obvious thing  which is the focus of the rest of my little talk  and that is other people. These same valuation systems are redeployed when we're valuing interactions with other people. So this same dopamine system that gets addicted to drugs  that makes you freeze when you get Parkinson's disease  that contributes to various forms of psychosis  is also redeployed to value interactions with other people and to assign value to gestures that you do when you're interacting with somebody else. Let me give you an example of this. You bring to the table such enormous processing power in this domain that you hardly even notice it. Let me just give you a few examples. So here's a baby. She's three months old. She still poops in her diapers and she can't do calculus. She's related to me. Somebody will be very glad that she's up here on the screen. You can cover up one of her eyes  and you can still read something in the other eye  and I see sort of curiosity in one eye  I see maybe a little bit of surprise in the other. Here's a couple. They're sharing a moment together  and we've even done an experiment where you can cut out different pieces of this frame and you can still see that they're sharing it. They're sharing it sort of in parallel. Now  the elements of the scene also communicate this to us  but you can read it straight off their faces  and if you compare their faces to normal faces  it would be a very subtle cue. Here's another couple. He's projecting out at us  and she's clearly projecting  you know  love and admiration at him. Here's another couple.  Laughter  And I'm thinking I'm not seeing love and admiration on the left.  Laughter  In fact  I know this is his sister  and you can just see him saying   Okay  we're doing this for the camera  and then afterwards you steal my candy and you punch me in the face.   Laughter  He'll kill me for showing that. All right  so what does this mean  It means we bring an enormous amount of processing power to the problem. It engages deep systems in our brain  in dopaminergic systems that are there to make you chase sex  food and salt. They keep you alive. It gives them the pie  it gives that kind of a behavioral punch which we've called a superpower. So how can we take that and arrange a kind of staged social interaction and turn that into a scientific probe  And the short answer is games. Economic games. So what we do is we go into two areas. One area is called experimental economics. The other area is called behavioral economics. And we steal their games. And we contrive them to our own purposes. So this shows you one particular game called an ultimatum game. Red person is given a hundred dollars and can offer a split to blue. Let's say red wants to keep     and offers blue   . So he offers a       split with blue. Control passes to blue  and blue says   I accept it   in which case he'd get the money  or blue says   I reject it   in which case no one gets anything. Okay  So a rational choice economist would say  well  you should take all non zero offers. What do people do  People are indifferent at an       split. At        it's a coin flip whether you accept that or not. Why is that  You know  because you're pissed off. You're mad. That's an unfair offer  and you know what an unfair offer is. This is the kind of game done by my lab and many around the world. That just gives you an example of the kind of thing that these games probe. The interesting thing is  these games require that you have a lot of cognitive apparatus on line. You have to be able to come to the table with a proper model of another person. You have to be able to remember what you've done. You have to stand up in the moment to do that. Then you have to update your model based on the signals coming back  and you have to do something that is interesting  which is you have to do a kind of depth of thought assay. That is  you have to decide what that other person expects of you. You have to send signals to manage your image in their mind. Like a job interview. You sit across the desk from somebody  they have some prior image of you  you send signals across the desk to move their image of you from one place to a place where you want it to be. We're so good at this we don't really even notice it. These kinds of probes exploit it. Okay  In doing this  what we've discovered is that humans are literal canaries in social exchanges. Canaries used to be used as kind of biosensors in mines. When methane built up  or carbon dioxide built up  or oxygen was diminished  the birds would swoon before people would    so it acted as an early warning system  Hey  get out of the mine. Things aren't going so well. People come to the table  and even these very blunt  staged social interactions  and they  and there's just numbers going back and forth between the people  and they bring enormous sensitivities to it. So we realized we could exploit this  and in fact  as we've done that  and we've done this now in many thousands of people  I think on the order of five or six thousand. We actually  to make this a biological probe  need bigger numbers than that  remarkably so. But anyway  patterns have emerged  and we've been able to take those patterns  convert them into mathematical models  and use those mathematical models to gain new insights into these exchanges. Okay  so what  Well  the so what is  that's a really nice behavioral measure  the economic games bring to us notions of optimal play. We can compute that during the game. And we can use that to sort of carve up the behavior. Here's the cool thing. Six or seven years ago  we developed a team. It was at the time in Houston  Texas. It's now in Virginia and London. And we built software that'll link functional magnetic resonance imaging devices up over the Internet. I guess we've done up to six machines at a time  but let's just focus on two. So it synchronizes machines anywhere in the world. We synchronize the machines  set them into these staged social interactions  and we eavesdrop on both of the interacting brains. So for the first time  we don't have to look at just averages over single individuals  or have individuals playing computers  or try to make inferences that way. We can study individual dyads. We can study the way that one person interacts with another person  turn the numbers up  and start to gain new insights into the boundaries of normal cognition  but more importantly  we can put people with classically defined mental illnesses  or brain damage  into these social interactions  and use these as probes of that. So we've started this effort. We've made a few hits  a few  I think  embryonic discoveries. We think there's a future to this. But it's our way of going in and redefining  with a new lexicon  a mathematical one actually  as opposed to the standard ways that we think about mental illness  characterizing these diseases  by using the people as birds in the exchanges. That is  we exploit the fact that the healthy partner  playing somebody with major depression  or playing somebody with autism spectrum disorder  or playing somebody with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  we use that as a kind of biosensor  and then we use computer programs to model that person  and it gives us a kind of assay of this. Early days  and we're just beginning  we're setting up sites around the world. Here are a few of our collaborating sites. The hub  ironically enough  is centered in little Roanoke  Virginia. There's another hub in London  now  and the rest are getting set up. We hope to give the data away at some stage. That's a complicated issue about making it available to the rest of the world. But we're also studying just a small part of what makes us interesting as human beings  and so I would invite other people who are interested in this to ask us for the software  or even for guidance on how to move forward with that. Let me leave you with one thought in closing. The interesting thing about studying cognition has been that we've been limited  in a way. We just haven't had the tools to look at interacting brains simultaneously. The fact is  though  that even when we're alone  we're a profoundly social creature. We're not a solitary mind built out of properties that kept it alive in the world independent of other people. In fact  our minds depend on other people. They depend on other people  and they're expressed in other people  so the notion of who you are  you often don't know who you are until you see yourself in interaction with people that are close to you  people that are enemies of you  people that are agnostic to you. So this is the first sort of step into using that insight into what makes us human beings  turning it into a tool  and trying to gain new insights into mental illness. Thanks for having me.  Applause  I want to talk to you today about something the open source programming world can teach democracy  but before that  a little preamble. Let's start here. This is Martha Payne. Martha's a   year old Scot who lives in the Council of Argyll and Bute. A couple months ago  Payne started a food blog called NeverSeconds  and she would take her camera with her every day to school to document her school lunches. Can you spot the vegetable   Laughter  And  as sometimes happens  this blog acquired first dozens of readers  and then hundreds of readers  and then thousands of readers  as people tuned in to watch her rate her school lunches  including on my favorite category   Pieces of hair found in food.   Laughter  This was a zero day. That's good. And then two weeks ago yesterday  she posted this. A post that read   Goodbye.  And she said   I'm very sorry to tell you this  but my head teacher pulled me out of class today and told me I'm not allowed to take pictures in the lunch room anymore. I really enjoyed doing this. Thank you for reading. Goodbye.  You can guess what happened next  right   Laughter  The outrage was so swift  so voluminous  so unanimous  that the Council of Argyll and Bute reversed themselves the same day and said   We would  we would never censor a nine year old.   Laughter  Except  of course  this morning.  Laughter  And this brings up the question  what made them think they could get away with something like that   Laughter  And the answer is  all of human history prior to now. what happens when a medium suddenly puts a lot of new ideas into circulation  Now  this isn't just a contemporaneous question. This is something we've faced several times over the last few centuries. When the telegraph came along  it was clear that it was going to globalize the news industry. What would this lead to  Well  obviously  it would lead to world peace. The television  a medium that allowed us not just to hear but see  literally see  what was going on elsewhere in the world  what would this lead to  World peace.  Laughter  The telephone  You guessed it  world peace. Sorry for the spoiler alert  but no world peace. Not yet. Even the printing press  even the printing press was assumed to be a tool that was going to enforce Catholic intellectual hegemony across Europe. Instead  what we got was Martin Luther's    Theses  the Protestant Reformation  and  you know  the Thirty Years' War. All right  so what all of these predictions of world peace got right is that when a lot of new ideas suddenly come into circulation  it changes society. What they got exactly wrong was what happens next. The more ideas there are in circulation  the more ideas there are for any individual to disagree with. More media always means more arguing. That's what happens when the media's space expands. And yet  when we look back on the printing press in the early years  we like what happened. We are a pro printing press society. So how do we square those two things  that it leads to more arguing  but we think it was good  And the answer  I think  can be found in things like this. This is the cover of  Philosophical Transactions   the first scientific journal ever published in English in the middle of the     s  and it was created by a group of people who had been calling themselves  The Invisible College   a group of natural philosophers who only later would call themselves scientists  and they wanted to improve the way natural philosophers argued with each other  and they needed to do two things for this. They needed openness. They needed to create a norm which said  when you do an experiment  you have to publish not just your claims  but how you did the experiment. If you don't tell us how you did it  we won't trust you. But the other thing they needed was speed. They had to quickly synchronize what other natural philosophers knew. Otherwise  you couldn't get the right kind of argument going. The printing press was clearly the right medium for this  but the book was the wrong tool. It was too slow. And so they invented the scientific journal as a way of synchronizing the argument across the community of natural scientists. The scientific revolution wasn't created by the printing press. It was created by scientists  but it couldn't have been created if they didn't have a printing press as a tool. So what about us  What about our generation  and our media revolution  the Internet  Well  predictions of world peace  Check.  Laughter  More arguing  Gold star on that one.  Laughter  I mean  YouTube is just a gold mine.  Laughter  Better arguing  That's the question. So I study social media  which means  to a first approximation  I watch people argue. And if I had to pick a group that I think is our Invisible College  is our generation's collection of people trying to take these tools and to press it into service  not for more arguments  but for better arguments  I'd pick the open source programmers. Programming is a three way relationship between a programmer  some source code  and the computer it's meant to run on  but computers are such famously inflexible interpreters of instructions that it's extraordinarily difficult to write out a set of instructions that the computer knows how to execute  and that's if one person is writing it. Once you get more than one person writing it  it's very easy for any two programmers to overwrite each other's work if they're working on the same file  or to send incompatible instructions that simply causes the computer to choke  and this problem grows larger the more programmers are involved. To a first approximation  the problem of managing a large software project is the problem of keeping this social chaos at bay. Now  for decades there has been a canonical solution to this problem  which is to use something called a  version control system   and a version control system does what is says on the tin. It provides a canonical copy of the software on a server somewhere. The only programmers who can change it are people who've specifically been given permission to access it  and they're only allowed to access the sub section of it that they have permission to change. And when people draw diagrams of version control systems  the diagrams always look something like this. All right. They look like org charts. And you don't have to squint very hard to see the political ramifications of a system like this. This is feudalism  one owner  many workers. Now  that's fine for the commercial software industry. It really is Microsoft's Office. It's Adobe's Photoshop. The corporation owns the software. The programmers come and go. But there was one programmer who decided that this wasn't the way to work. This is Linus Torvalds. Torvalds is the most famous open source programmer  created Linux  obviously  and Torvalds looked at the way the open source movement had been dealing with this problem. Open source software  the core promise of the open source license  is that everybody should have access to all the source code all the time  but of course  this creates the very threat of chaos you have to forestall in order to get anything working. So most open source projects just held their noses and adopted the feudal management systems. But Torvalds said   No  I'm not going to do that.  His point of view on this was very clear. When you adopt a tool  you also adopt the management philosophy embedded in that tool  and he wasn't going to adopt anything that didn't work the way the Linux community worked. And to give you a sense of how enormous a decision like this was  this is a map of the internal dependencies within Linux  within the Linux operating system  which sub parts of the program rely on which other sub parts to get going. This is a tremendously complicated process. This is a tremendously complicated program  and yet  for years  Torvalds ran this not with automated tools but out of his email box. People would literally mail him changes that they'd agreed on  and he would merge them by hand. And then     years after looking at Linux and figuring out how the community worked  he said   I think I know how to write a version control system for free people.  And he called it  Git.  Git is distributed version control. It has two big differences with traditional version control systems. The first is that it lives up to the philosophical promise of open source. Everybody who works on a project has access to all of the source code all of the time. And when people draw diagrams of Git workflow  they use drawings that look like this. And you don't have to understand what the circles and boxes and arrows mean to see that this is a far more complicated way of working than is supported by ordinary version control systems. But this is also the thing that brings the chaos back  and this is Git's second big innovation. This is a screenshot from GitHub  the premier Git hosting service  and every time a programmer uses Git to make any important change at all  creating a new file  modifying an existing one  merging two files  Git creates this kind of signature. This long string of numbers and letters here is a unique identifier tied to every single change  but without any central coordination. Every Git system generates this number the same way  which means this is a signature tied directly and unforgeably to a particular change. This has the following effect  A programmer in Edinburgh and a programmer in Entebbe can both get the same    a copy of the same piece of software. Each of them can make changes and they can merge them after the fact even if they didn't know of each other's existence beforehand. This is cooperation without coordination. This is the big change. Now  I tell you all of this not to convince you that it's great that open source programmers now have a tool that supports their philosophical way of working  although I think that is great. I tell you all of this because of what I think it means for the way communities come together. Once Git allowed for cooperation without coordination  you start to see communities form that are enormously large and complex. This is a graph of the Ruby community. It's an open source programming language  and all of the interconnections between the people    this is now not a software graph  but a people graph  all of the interconnections among the people working on that project   and this doesn't look like an org chart. This looks like a dis org chart  and yet  out of this community  but using these tools  they can now create something together. So there are two good reasons to think that this kind of technique can be applied to democracies in general and in particular to the law. When you make the claim  in fact  that something on the Internet is going to be good for democracy  you often get this reaction. Which is  are you talking about the thing with the singing cats  Like  is that the thing you think is going to be good for society  To which I have to say  here's the thing with the singing cats. That always happens. And I don't just mean that always happens with the Internet  I mean that always happens with media  full stop. It did not take long after the rise of the commercial printing press before someone figured out that erotic novels were a good idea.  Laughter  You don't have to have an economic incentive to sell books very long before someone says   Hey  you know what I bet people would pay for    Laughter  It took people another     years to even think of the scientific journal  right  So     Laughter   Applause  So the harnessing by the Invisible College of the printing press to create the scientific journal was phenomenally important  but it didn't happen big  and it didn't happen quick  and it didn't happen fast  so if you're going to look for where the change is happening  you have to look on the margins. So  the law is also dependency related. This is a graph of the U.S. Tax Code  and the dependencies of one law on other laws for the overall effect. So there's that as a site for source code management. But there's also the fact that law is another place where there are many opinions in circulation  but they need to be resolved to one canonical copy  and when you go onto GitHub  and you look around  there are millions and millions of projects  almost all of which are source code  but if you look around the edges  you can see people experimenting with the political ramifications of a system like that. Someone put up all the Wikileaked cables from the State Department  along with software used to interpret them  including my favorite use ever of the Cablegate cables  which is a tool for detecting naturally occurring haiku in State Department prose. Right.  Laughter  The New York Senate has put up something called Open Legislation  also hosting it on GitHub  again for all of the reasons of updating and fluidity. You can go and pick your Senator and then you can see a list of bills they have sponsored. Someone going by Divegeek has put up the Utah code  the laws of the state of Utah  and they've put it up there not just to distribute the code  but with the very interesting possibility that this could be used to further the development of legislation. Somebody put up a tool during the copyright debate last year in the Senate  saying   It's strange that Hollywood has more access to Canadian legislators than Canadian citizens do. Why don't we use GitHub to show them what a citizen developed bill might look like   And it includes this very evocative screenshot. This is a called a  diff   this thing on the right here. This shows you  for text that many people are editing  when a change was made  who made it  and what the change is. The stuff in red is the stuff that got deleted. The stuff in green is the stuff that got added. Programmers take this capability for granted. No democracy anywhere in the world offers this feature to its citizens for either legislation or for budgets  even though those are the things done with our consent and with our money. Now  I would love to tell you that the fact that the open source programmers have worked out a collaborative method that is large scale  distributed  cheap  and in sync with the ideals of democracy  I would love to tell you that because those tools are in place  the innovation is inevitable. But it's not. Part of the problem  of course  is just a lack of information. Somebody put a question up on Quora saying   Why is it that lawmakers don't use distributed version control   This  graphically  was the answer.  Laughter  And that is indeed part of the problem  but only part. The bigger problem  of course  is power. The people experimenting with participation don't have legislative power  and the people who have legislative power are not experimenting with participation. They are experimenting with openness. There's no democracy worth the name that doesn't have a transparency move  but transparency is openness in only one direction  and being given a dashboard without a steering wheel has never been the core promise a democracy makes to its citizens. So consider this. The thing that got Martha Payne's opinions out into the public was a piece of technology  but the thing that kept them there was political will. It was the expectation of the citizens that she would not be censored. That's now the state we're in with these collaboration tools. We have them. We've seen them. They work. Can we use them  Can we apply the techniques that worked here to this  T.S. Eliot once said   One of the most momentous things that can happen to a culture is that they acquire a new form of prose.  I think that's wrong  but     Laughter  I think it's right for argumentation. Right  A momentous thing that can happen to a culture is they can acquire a new style of arguing  trial by jury  voting  peer review  now this. Right  A new form of arguing has been invented in our lifetimes  in the last decade  in fact. It's large  it's distributed  it's low cost  and it's compatible with the ideals of democracy. The question for us now is  are we going to let the programmers keep it to themselves  Or are we going to try and take it and press it into service for society at large  Thank you for listening.  Applause  Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Hi. So  this chap here  he thinks he can tell you the future. His name is Nostradamus  although here the Sun have made him look a little bit like Sean Connery.  Laughter  And like most of you  I suspect  I don't really believe that people can see into the future. I don't believe in precognition  and every now and then  you hear that somebody has been able to predict something that happened in the future  and that's probably because it was a fluke  and we only hear about the flukes and about the freaks. We don't hear about all the times that people got stuff wrong. Now we expect that to happen with silly stories about precognition  but the problem is  we have exactly the same problem in academia and in medicine  and in this environment  it costs lives. So firstly  thinking just about precognition  as it turns out  just last year a researcher called Daryl Bem conducted a piece of research where he found evidence of precognitive powers in undergraduate students  and this was published in a peer reviewed academic journal and most of the people who read this just said   Okay  well  fair enough  but I think that's a fluke  that's a freak  because I know that if I did a study where I found no evidence that undergraduate students had precognitive powers  it probably wouldn't get published in a journal. And in fact  we know that that's true  because several different groups of research scientists tried to replicate the findings of this precognition study  and when they submitted it to the exact same journal  the journal said   No  we're not interested in publishing replication. We're not interested in your negative data.  So this is already evidence of how  in the academic literature  we will see a biased sample of the true picture of all of the scientific studies that have been conducted. But it doesn't just happen in the dry academic field of psychology. It also happens in  for example  cancer research. So in March        just one month ago  some researchers reported in the journal Nature how they had tried to replicate    different basic science studies looking at potential treatment targets in cancer  and out of those    studies  they were only able to successfully replicate six. Forty seven out of those    were unreplicable. And they say in their discussion that this is very likely because freaks get published. People will do lots and lots and lots of different studies  and the occasions when it works they will publish  and the ones where it doesn't work they won't. And their first recommendation of how to fix this problem  because it is a problem  because it sends us all down blind alleys  their first recommendation of how to fix this problem is to make it easier to publish negative results in science  and to change the incentives so that scientists are encouraged to post more of their negative results in public. But it doesn't just happen in the very dry world of preclinical basic science cancer research. It also happens in the very real  flesh and blood of academic medicine. So in       some researchers did a study on a drug called lorcainide  and this was an anti arrhythmic drug  a drug that suppresses abnormal heart rhythms  and the idea was  after people have had a heart attack  they're quite likely to have abnormal heart rhythms  so if we give them a drug that suppresses abnormal heart rhythms  this will increase the chances of them surviving. Early on its development  they did a very small trial  just under a hundred patients. Fifty patients got lorcainide  and of those patients     died. Another    patients got a dummy placebo sugar pill with no active ingredient  and only one of them died. So they rightly regarded this drug as a failure  and its commercial development was stopped  and because its commercial development was stopped  this trial was never published. Unfortunately  over the course of the next five     years  other companies had the same idea about drugs that would prevent arrhythmias in people who have had heart attacks. These drugs were brought to market. They were prescribed very widely because heart attacks are a very common thing  and it took so long for us to find out that these drugs also caused an increased rate of death that before we detected that safety signal  over         people died unnecessarily in America from the prescription of anti arrhythmic drugs. Now actually  in       the researchers who did that      study  that early study  published a mea culpa  an apology to the scientific community  in which they said   When we carried out our study in       we thought that the increased death rate that occurred in the lorcainide group was an effect of chance.  The development of lorcainide was abandoned for commercial reasons  and this study was never published  it's now a good example of publication bias. That's the technical term for the phenomenon where unflattering data gets lost  gets unpublished  is left missing in action  and they say the results described here  might have provided an early warning of trouble ahead.  Now these are stories from basic science. These are stories from        years ago. The academic publishing environment is very different now. There are academic journals like  Trials   the open access journal  which will publish any trial conducted in humans regardless of whether it has a positive or a negative result. But this problem of negative results that go missing in action is still very prevalent. In fact it's so prevalent that it cuts to the core of evidence based medicine. So this is a drug called reboxetine  and this is a drug that I myself have prescribed. It's an antidepressant. And I'm a very nerdy doctor  so I read all of the studies that I could on this drug. I read the one study that was published that showed that reboxetine was better than placebo  and I read the other three studies that were published that showed that reboxetine was just as good as any other antidepressant  and because this patient hadn't done well on those other antidepressants  I thought  well  reboxetine is just as good. It's one to try. But it turned out that I was misled. In fact  seven trials were conducted comparing reboxetine against a dummy placebo sugar pill. One of them was positive and that was published  but six of them were negative and they were left unpublished. Three trials were published comparing reboxetine against other antidepressants in which reboxetine was just as good  and they were published  but three times as many patients' worth of data was collected which showed that reboxetine was worse than those other treatments  and those trials were not published. I felt misled. Now you might say  well  that's an extremely unusual example  and I wouldn't want to be guilty of the same kind of cherry picking and selective referencing that I'm accusing other people of. But it turns out that this phenomenon of publication bias has actually been very  very well studied. So here is one example of how you approach it. The classic model is  you get a bunch of studies where you know that they've been conducted and completed  and then you go and see if they've been published anywhere in the academic literature. So this took all of the trials that had ever been conducted on antidepressants that were approved over a    year period by the FDA. They took all of the trials which were submitted to the FDA as part of the approval package. So that's not all of the trials that were ever conducted on these drugs  because we can never know if we have those  but it is the ones that were conducted in order to get the marketing authorization. And then they went to see if these trials had been published in the peer reviewed academic literature. And this is what they found. It was pretty much a       split. Half of these trials were positive  half of them were negative  in reality. But when they went to look for these trials in the peer reviewed academic literature  what they found was a very different picture. Only three of the negative trials were published  but all but one of the positive trials were published. Now if we just flick back and forth between those two  you can see what a staggering difference there was between reality and what doctors  patients  commissioners of health services  and academics were able to see in the peer reviewed academic literature. We were misled  and this is a systematic flaw in the core of medicine. In fact  there have been so many studies conducted on publication bias now  over a hundred  that they've been collected in a systematic review  published in       that took every single study on publication bias that they could find. Publication bias affects every field of medicine. About half of all trials  on average  go missing in action  and we know that positive findings are around twice as likely to be published as negative findings. This is a cancer at the core of evidence based medicine. If I flipped a coin     times but then withheld the results from you from half of those tosses  I could make it look as if I had a coin that always came up heads. But that wouldn't mean that I had a two headed coin. That would mean that I was a chancer and you were an idiot for letting me get away with it.  Laughter  But this is exactly what we blindly tolerate in the whole of evidence based medicine. And to me  this is research misconduct. If I conducted one study and I withheld half of the data points from that one study  you would rightly accuse me  essentially  of research fraud. And yet  for some reason  if somebody conducts    studies but only publishes the five that give the result that they want  we don't consider that to be research misconduct. And when that responsibility is diffused between a whole network of researchers  academics  industry sponsors  journal editors  for some reason we find it more acceptable  but the effect on patients is damning. And this is happening right now  today. This is a drug called Tamiflu. Tamiflu is a drug which governments around the world have spent billions and billions of dollars on stockpiling  and we've stockpiled Tamiflu in panic  in the belief that it will reduce the rate of complications of influenza. Complications is a medical euphemism for pneumonia and death.  Laughter  Now when the Cochrane systematic reviewers were trying to collect together all of the data from all of the trials that had ever been conducted on whether Tamiflu actually did this or not  they found that several of those trials were unpublished. The results were unavailable to them. And when they started obtaining the writeups of those trials through various different means  through Freedom of Information Act requests  through harassing various different organizations  what they found was inconsistent. And when they tried to get a hold of the clinical study reports  the        page long documents that have the best possible rendition of the information  they were told they weren't allowed to have them. And if you want to read the full correspondence and the excuses and the explanations given by the drug company  you can see that written up in this week's edition of PLOS Medicine. And the most staggering thing of all of this  to me  is that not only is this a problem  not only do we recognize that this is a problem  but we've had to suffer fake fixes. We've had people pretend that this is a problem that's been fixed. First of all  we had trials registers  and everybody said  oh  it's okay. We'll get everyone to register their trials  they'll post the protocol  they'll say what they're going to do before they do it  and then afterwards we'll be able to check and see if all the trials which have been conducted and completed have been published. But people didn't bother to use those registers. And so then the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors came along  and they said  oh  well  we will hold the line. We won't publish any journals  we won't publish any trials  unless they've been registered before they began. But they didn't hold the line. In       a study was conducted which showed that half of all of trials published by journals edited by members of the ICMJE weren't properly registered  and a quarter of them weren't registered at all. And then finally  the FDA Amendment Act was passed a couple of years ago saying that everybody who conducts a trial must post the results of that trial within one year. And in the BMJ  in the first edition of January        you can see a study which looks to see if people kept to that ruling  and it turns out that only one in five have done so. This is a disaster. We cannot know the true effects of the medicines that we prescribe if we do not have access to all of the information. And this is not a difficult problem to fix. We need to force people to publish all trials conducted in humans  including the older trials  because the FDA Amendment Act only asks that you publish the trials conducted after       and I don't know what world it is in which we're only practicing medicine on the basis of trials that completed in the past two years. We need to publish all trials in humans  including the older trials  for all drugs in current use  and you need to tell everyone you know that this is a problem and that it has not been fixed. Thank you very much.  Applause  Two years ago  I was invited as an artist to participate in an exhibition commemorating     years of Islamic art in Europe. The curator had only one condition  I had to use the Arabic script for my artwork. Now  as an artist  a woman  an Arab  or a human being living in the world in       I only had one thing to say  I wanted to say no. And in Arabic  to say  no   we say  no  and a thousand times no.  So I decided to look for a thousand different noes. on everything ever produced under Islamic or Arab patronage in the past       years  from Spain to the borders of China. I collected my findings in a book  placed them chronologically  stating the name  the patron  the medium and the date. Now  the book sat on a small shelf next to the installation  which stood three by seven meters  in Munich  Germany  in September of     . Now  in January        the revolution started  and life stopped for    days  and on the   th of February  we naively celebrated on the streets of Cairo  believing that the revolution had succeeded. Nine months later I found myself spraying messages in Tahrir Square. The reason for this act was this image that I saw in my newsfeed. I did not feel that I could live in a city where people were being killed and thrown like garbage on the street. So I took one  no  off a tombstone from the Islamic Museum in Cairo  and I added a message to it   no to military rule.  And I started spraying that on the streets in Cairo. But that led to a series of no  coming out of the book like ammunition  and adding messages to them  and I started spraying them on the walls. So I'll be sharing some of these noes with you. No to a new Pharaoh  because whoever comes next should understand that we will never be ruled by another dictator. No to violence  Ramy Essam came to Tahrir on the second day of the revolution  and he sat there with this guitar  singing. One month after Mubarak stepped down  this was his reward. No to blinding heroes. Ahmed Harara lost his right eye on the   th of January  and he lost his left eye on the   th of November  by two different snipers. No to killing  in this case no to killing men of religion  because Sheikh Ahmed Adina Refaat was shot on December   th  during a demonstration  leaving behind three orphans and a widow. No to burning books. The Institute of Egypt was burned on December   th  a huge cultural loss. No to stripping the people  and the blue bra is to remind us of our shame as a nation when we allow a veiled woman to be stripped and beaten on the street  and the footprint reads   Long live a peaceful revolution   because we will never retaliate with violence. No to barrier walls. On February  th  concrete roadblocks were set up in Cairo to protect the Ministry of Defense from protesters. Now  speaking of walls  I want to share with you the story of one wall in Cairo. A group of artists decided to paint a life size tank on a wall. It's one to one. In front of this tank there's a man on a bicycle with a breadbasket on his head. To any passerby  there's no problem with this visual. After acts of violence  another artist came  painted blood  protesters being run over by the tank  demonstrators  and a message that read   Starting tomorrow  I wear the new face  the face of every martyr. I exist.  Authority comes  paints the wall white  leaves the tank and adds a message   Army and people  one hand. Egypt for Egyptians.  Another artist comes  paints the head of the military as a monster eating a maiden in a river of blood in front of the tank. Authority comes  paints the wall white  leaves the tank  leaves the suit  and throws a bucket of black paint just to hide the face of the monster. So I come with my stencils  and I spray them on the suit  on the tank  and on the whole wall  and this is how it stands today until further notice.  Laughter  Now  I want to leave you with a final no. I found Neruda scribbled on a piece of paper in a field hospital in Tahrir  and I decided to take a no of Mamluk Mausoleum in Cairo. The message reads   Arabic   You can crush the flowers  but you can't delay spring.  Thank you.  Applause  Thank you. Shukran.  Applause  What I do is I organize information. I'm a graphic designer. Professionally  I try to make sense often of things that don't make much sense themselves. So my father might not understand what it is that I do for a living. His part of my ancestry has been farmers. He's part of this ethnic minority called the Pontic Greeks. They lived in Asia Minor and fled to Greece after a genocide about a hundred years ago. And ever since that  migration has somewhat been a theme in my family. My father moved to Germany  studied there and married  and as a result  I now have this half German brain  with all the analytical thinking and that slightly dorky demeanor that come with that. And of course it meant that I was a foreigner in both countries  and that of course made it pretty easy for me to migrate as well  in good family tradition  if you like. But of course  most journeys that we undertake from day to day are within a city. And  especially if you know the city  getting from A to B may seem pretty obvious  right  But the question is  why is it obvious  How do we know where we're going  So I washed up on a Dublin ferry port about    years ago  a professional foreigner  if you like  and I'm sure you've all had this experience before  yeah  You arrive in a new city  and your brain is trying to make sense of this new place. Once you find your base  your home  you start to build this cognitive map of your environment. It's essentially this virtual map that only exists in your brain. All animal species do it  even though we all use slightly different tools. Us humans  of course  we don't move around marking our territory by scent  like dogs. We don't run around emitting ultrasonic squeaks  like bats. We just don't do that  although a night in the Temple Bar district can get pretty wild. No  we do two important things to make a place our own. First  we move along linear routes. Typically  we find a main street  and this main street becomes a linear strip map in our minds. But our mind keeps it pretty simple  yeah  Every street is generally perceived as a straight line  and we kind of ignore the little twists and turns that the streets make. When we do  however  make a turn into a side street  our mind tends to adjust that turn to a    degree angle. This of course makes for some funny moments when you're in some old city layout that follows some sort of circular city logic  yeah  Maybe you've had that experience as well. Let's say you're on some spot on a side street that projects from a main cathedral square  and you want to get to another point on a side street just like that. The cognitive map in your mind may tell you   Aris  go back to the main cathedral square  take a    degree turn and walk down that other side street.  But somehow you feel adventurous that day  and you suddenly discover that the two spots were actually only a single building apart. Now  I don't know about you  but I always feel like I find this wormhole or this inter dimensional portal. So we move along linear routes and our mind straightens streets and perceives turns as    degree angles. The second thing that we do to make a place our own is we attach meaning and emotions to the things that we see along those lines. If you go to the Irish countryside and you ask an old lady for directions  brace yourself for some elaborate Irish storytelling about all the landmarks  yeah  She'll tell you the pub where her sister used to work  and  ... go past that church where I got married   that kind of thing. So we fill our cognitive maps with these markers of meaning. What's more  we abstract repeat patterns and recognize them. We recognize them by the experiences and we abstract them into symbols. And of course  we're all capable of understanding these symbols. What's more  we're all capable of understanding the cognitive maps  and you are all capable of creating these cognitive maps yourselves. So next time  when you want to tell your friend how to get to your place  you grab a beermat  grab a napkin  and you just observe yourself create this awesome piece of communication design. It's got straight lines. It's got    degree corners. You might add little symbols along the way. And when you look at what you've just drawn  you realize it does not resemble a street map. If you were to put an actual street map on top of what you've just drawn  you'd realize your streets and the distances    they'd be way off. No  what you've just drawn is more like a diagram or a schematic. It's a visual construct of lines  dots  letters  designed in the language of our brains. So it's no big surprise that the big information design icon of the last century    the pinnacle of showing everybody how to get from A to B  the London Underground map    was not designed by a cartographer or a city planner  it was designed by an engineering draftsman. In the     s  Harry Beck applied the principles of schematic diagram design and changed the way public transport maps are designed forever. Now the very key to the success of this map is in the omission of less important information and in the extreme simplification. So  straightened streets  corners of    and    degrees  but also the extreme geographic distortion in that map. If you were to look at the actual locations of these stations  you'd see they're very different. But this is all for the clarity of the public Tube map. If you  say  wanted to get from Regent's Park station to Great Portland Street  the Tube map would tell you  take the Tube  go to Baker Street  change over  take another Tube. Of course  what you don't know is that the two stations are only about a hundred meters apart. Now we've reached the subject of public transport  and public transport here in Dublin is a somewhat touchy subject. For everybody who does not know the public transport here in Dublin  essentially  we have this system of local buses that grew with the city. For every outskirt that was added  there was another bus route added  running from the outskirt all the way to the city center. And as these local buses approach the city center  they all run side by side and converge in pretty much one main street. So when I stepped off the boat    years ago  I tried to make sense of that. Because exploring a city on foot only gets you so far. But when you explore a foreign and new public transport system  you will build a cognitive map in your mind in pretty much the same way. Typically  you choose yourself a rapid transport route  and in your mind  this route is perceived as a straight line. And like a pearl necklace  all the stations and stops are nicely and neatly aligned along the line. And only then you start to discover some local bus routes that would fill in the gaps  and that allow for those wormhole  inter dimensional portal shortcuts. So I tried to make sense  and when I arrived  I was looking for some information leaflets that would help me crack this system and understand it  and I found those brochures. They were not geographically distorted. They had a lot of omission of information  but unfortunately  the wrong information. Say  in the city center    there were never actually any lines that showed the routes. There are actually not even any stations with names. Now  the maps of Dublin transport have gotten better  and after I finished the project  they got a good bit better  but still no station names  still no routes. So  being naive  and being half German  I decided   Aris  why don't you build your own map   So that's what I did. I researched how each and every bus route moved through the city  nice and logical  every bus route a separate line. I plotted it into my own map of Dublin  and in the city center ... I got a nice spaghetti plate. Now  this is a bit of a mess  so I decided  of course   You're going to apply the rules of schematic design   cleaning up the corridors  widening the streets where there were loads of buses and making the streets at straight     degree corners     degree corners or fractions of that  and filled it in with the bus routes. And I built this city center bus map of the system  how it was five years ago. I'll zoom in again so that you get the full impact of the quays and Westmoreland Street. Now I can proudly say    I can proudly say  as a public transport map  this diagram is an utter failure. Except  probably  in one aspect  I now had a great visual representation of just how clogged up and overrun the city center really was. Now  call me old fashioned  but I think a public transport route map should have lines  because that's what they are  yeah  They're little pieces of string that wrap their way through the city center or through the city. If you will  the Greek guy inside of me feels if I don't get a line  it's like entering the labyrinth of the Minotaur without having Ariadne giving you the string to find your way. So the outcome of my academic research  loads of questionnaires  case studies and looking at a lot of maps  was that a lot of the problems and shortcomings of the public transport system here in Dublin was the lack of a coherent public transport map    a simplified  coherent public transport map    because I think this is the crucial step to understanding a public transport network on a physical level  but it's also the crucial step to make a public transport network mappable on a visual level. So I teamed up with a gentleman called James Leahy  a civil engineer and a recent master's graduate of the Sustainable Development program at DIT  and together we drafted the simplified model network  which I could then go ahead and visualize. So here's what we did. We distributed these rapid transport corridors throughout the city center  and extended them into the outskirts. Rapid  because we wanted them to be served by rapid transport vehicles. They would get exclusive road use  where possible  and it would be high quantity  high quality transport. James wanted to use bus rapid transport for that  rather than light rail. For me  it was important that the vehicles that would run on those rapid transport corridors would be visibly distinguishable from local buses on the street. Now we could take out all the local buses that ran alongside those rapid transport means. Any gaps that appeared in the outskirts were filled again. So  in other words  if there was a street in an outskirt where there had been a bus  we put a bus back in  only now these buses wouldn't run all the way to the city center  but connect to the nearest rapid transport mode  one of these thick lines over there. So the rest was merely a couple of months of work  and a couple of fights with my girlfriend  of our place constantly being clogged up with maps  and the outcome  one of the outcomes  was this map of the Greater Dublin area. I'll zoom in a little bit. This map only shows the rapid transport connections  no local bus  very much in the  metro map  style that was so successful in London  and that since has been exported to so many other major cities  and therefore is the language that we should use for public transport maps. What's also important is  with a simplified network like this  it now would become possible for me to tackle the ultimate challenge and make a public transport map for the city center  one where I wouldn't just show rapid transport connections  but also all the local bus routes  streets and the likes  and this is what a map like this could look like. I'll zoom in a little bit. In this map  I'm including each transport mode  so rapid transport  bus  DART  tram and the likes. Each individual route is represented by a separate line. The map shows each and every station  each and every station name  and I'm also displaying side streets. In fact  most of the side streets even with their name  and for good measure  also a couple of landmarks  some of them signified by little symbols  others by these isometric three dimensional bird's eye view drawings. The map is relatively small in overall size  so something that you could still hold as a fold out map or display in a reasonably sized display box on a bus shelter. I think it tries to be the best balance between actual representation and simplification    the language of way finding in our brain. So  straightened lines  cleaned up corners  and of course  that very  very important geographic distortion that makes public transport maps possible. If you  for example  have a look at the two main corridors that run through the city    the yellow and orange one over here    this is how they look in an actual  accurate street map  and this is how they would look in my distorted  simplified public transport map. So for a successful public transport map  we should not stick to accurate representation  but design them in the way our brains work. The reactions I got were tremendous  it was really good to see. And of course  for my own self  I was very happy to see that my folks in Germany and Greece finally have an idea what I do for a living. Thank you. This is the skyline of my hometown  New Orleans. It was a great place to grow up  but it's one of the most vulnerable spots in the world. Half the city is already below sea level. In       the world watched as New Orleans and the Gulf Coast were devastated by Hurricane Katrina. One thousand  eight hundred and thirty six people died. Nearly         homes were lost. These are my mother's  at the top    although that's not her car  it was carried there by floodwaters up to the roof    and that's my sister's  below. Fortunately  they and other family members got out in time  but they lost their homes  and as you can see  just about everything in them. Other parts of the world have been hit by storms in even more devastating ways. In       Cyclone Nargis and its aftermath killed         in Myanmar. Climate change is affecting our homes  our communities  our way of life. We should be preparing at every scale and at every opportunity. This talk is about being prepared for  and resilient to the changes that are coming and that will affect our homes and our collective home  the Earth. The changes in these times won't affect us all equally. There are important distributional consequences  and they're not what you always might think. In New Orleans  the elderly and female headed households were among the most vulnerable. For those in vulnerable  low lying nations  how do you put a dollar value on losing your country where you ancestors are buried  And where will your people go  And how will they cope in a foreign land  Will there be tensions over immigration  or conflicts over competition for limited resources  It's already fueled conflicts in Chad and Darfur. Like it or not  ready or not  this is our future. Sure  some are looking for opportunities in this new world. That's the Russians planting a flag on the ocean bottom to stake a claim for minerals under the receding Arctic sea ice. But while there might be some short term individual winners  our collective losses will far outweigh them. Look no further than the insurance industry as they struggle to cope with mounting catastrophic losses from extreme weather events. The military gets it. They call climate change a threat multiplier that could harm stability and security  while governments around the world are evaluating how to respond. So what can we do  How can we prepare and adapt  I'd like to share three sets of examples  starting with adapting to violent storms and floods. In New Orleans  the I    Twin Spans  with sections knocked out in Katrina  have been rebuilt    feet higher to allow for greater storm surge. And these raised and energy efficient homes were developed by Brad Pitt and Make It Right for the hard hit Ninth Ward. The devastated church my mom attends has been not only rebuilt higher  it's poised to become the first Energy Star church in the country. They're selling electricity back to the grid thanks to solar panels  reflective paint and more. Their March electricity bill was only    dollars. Now these are examples of New Orleans rebuilding in this way  but better if others act proactively with these changes in mind. For example  in Galveston  here's a resilient home that survived Hurricane Ike  when others on neighboring lots clearly did not. And around the world  satellites and warning systems are saving lives in flood prone areas such as Bangladesh. But as important as technology and infrastructure are  perhaps the human element is even more critical. We need better planning and systems for evacuation. We need to better understand how people make decisions in times of crisis  and why. While it's true that many who died in Katrina did not have access to transportation  others who did refused to leave as the storm approached  often because available transportation and shelters refused to allow them to take their pets. Imagine leaving behind your own pet in an evacuation or a rescue. Fortunately in       Congress passed the Pet Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act  Laughter    it spells  PETS    to change that. Second  preparing for heat and drought. Farmers are facing challenges of drought from Asia to Africa  from Australia to Oklahoma  while heat waves linked with climate change have killed tens of thousands of people in Western Europe in       and again in Russia in     . In Ethiopia     percent  that's     percent of the population  depends on rainfall for its livelihood. Oxfam and Swiss Re  together with Rockefeller Foundation  are helping farmers like this one build hillside terraces and find other ways to conserve water  but they're also providing for insurance when the droughts do come. The stability this provides is giving the farmers the confidence to invest. It's giving them access to affordable credit. It's allowing them to become more productive so that they can afford their own insurance over time  without assistance. It's a virtuous cycle  and one that could be replicated throughout the developing world. After a lethal      heat wave turned refrigerator trucks from the popular Taste of Chicago festival into makeshift morgues  Chicago became a recognized leader  tamping down on the urban heat island impact through opening cooling centers  outreach to vulnerable neighborhoods  planting trees  creating cool white or vegetated green roofs. This is City Hall's green roof  next to Cook County's  portion of the  roof  which is    degrees Fahrenheit hotter at the surface. Washington  D.C.  last year  actually led the nation in new green roofs installed  and they're funding this in part thanks to a five cent tax on plastic bags. They're splitting the cost of installing these green roofs with home and building owners. The roofs not only temper urban heat island impact but they save energy  and therefore money  the emissions that cause climate change  and they also reduce stormwater runoff. So some solutions to heat can provide for win win wins. Third  adapting to rising seas. Sea level rise threatens coastal ecosystems  agriculture  even major cities. This is what one to two meters of sea level rise looks like in the Mekong Delta. That's where half of Vietnam's rice is grown. Infrastructure is going to be affected. Airports around the world are located on the coast. It makes sense  right  There's open space  the planes can take off and land without worrying about creating noise or avoiding tall buildings. Here's just one example  San Francisco Airport  with    inches or more of flooding. Imagine the staggering cost of protecting this vital infrastructure with levees. But there might be some changes in store that you might not imagine. For example  planes require more runway for takeoff because the heated  less dense air  provides for less lift. San Francisco is also spending    million dollars to rethink and redesign its water and sewage treatment  as water outfall pipes like this one can be flooded with seawater  causing backups at the plant  harming the bacteria that are needed to treat the waste. So these outfall pipes have been retrofitted to shut seawater off from entering the system. Beyond these technical solutions  our work at the Georgetown Climate Center with communities encourages them to look at what existing legal and policy tools are available and to consider how they can accommodate change. For example  in land use  which areas do you want to protect  through adding a seawall  for example  alter  by raising buildings  or retreat from  to allow the migration of important natural systems  such as wetlands or beaches  Other examples to consider. In the U.K.  the Thames Barrier protects London from storm surge. The Asian Cities Climate  Change  Resilience Network is restoring vital ecosystems like forest mangroves. These are not only important ecosystems in their own right  but they also serve as a buffer to protect inland communities. New York City is incredibly vulnerable to storms  as you can see from this clever sign  and to sea level rise  and to storm surge  as you can see from the subway flooding. But back above ground  these raised ventilation grates for the subway system show that solutions can be both functional and attractive. In fact  in New York  San Francisco and London  designers have envisioned ways to better integrate the natural and built environments with climate change in mind. I think these are inspiring examples of what's possible when we feel empowered to plan for a world that will be different. But now  a word of caution. Adaptation's too important to be left to the experts. Why  Well  there are no experts. We're entering uncharted territory  and yet our expertise and our systems are based on the past.  Stationarity  is the notion that we can anticipate the future based on the past  and plan accordingly  and this principle governs much of our engineering  our design of critical infrastructure  city water systems  building codes  even water rights and other legal precedents. But we can simply no longer rely on established norms. We're operating outside the bounds of CO  concentrations that the planet has seen for hundreds of thousands of years. The larger point I'm trying to make is this. It's up to us to look at our homes and our communities  our vulnerabilities and our exposures to risk  and to find ways to not just survive  but to thrive  and it's up to us to plan and to prepare and to call on our government leaders and require them to do the same  even while they address the underlying causes of climate change. There are no quick fixes. There are no one size fits all solutions. We're all learning by doing. But the operative word is doing. Thank you.  Applause
