Good morning. Let's look for a minute at the greatest icon of all  Leonardo da Vinci. We're all familiar with his fantastic work    his drawings  his paintings  his inventions  his writings. But we do not know his face. Thousands of books have been written about him  but there's controversy  and it remains  about his looks. Even this well known portrait is not accepted by many art historians. So  what do you think  Is this the face of Leonardo da Vinci or isn't it  Let's find out. Leonardo was a man that drew everything around him. He drew people  anatomy  plants  animals  landscapes  buildings  water  everything. But no faces  I find that hard to believe. His contemporaries made faces  like the ones you see here    en face or three quarters. So  surely a passionate drawer like Leonardo must have made self portraits from time to time. So let's try to find them. I think that if we were to scan all of his work and look for self portraits  we would find his face looking at us. So I looked at all of his drawings  more than      and looked for male portraits. There are about      you see them here. Which ones of these could be self portraits  Well  for that they have to be done as we just saw  en face or three quarters. So we can eliminate all the profiles. It also has to be sufficiently detailed. So we can also eliminate the ones that are very vague or very stylized. And we know from his contemporaries that Leonardo was a very handsome  even beautiful man. So we can also eliminate the ugly ones or the caricatures. And look what happens    only three candidates remain that fit the bill. And here they are. Yes  indeed  the old man is there  as is this famous pen drawing of the Homo Vitruvianus. And lastly  the only portrait of a male that Leonardo painted   The Musician.  Before we go into these faces  I should explain why I have some right to talk about them. I've made more than       portraits myself for newspapers  over the course of           years  sorry     years only. But there are        and very few artists have drawn so many faces. So I know a little about drawing and analyzing faces. OK  now let's look at these three portraits. And hold onto your seats  because if we zoom in on those faces  remark how they have the same broad forehead  the horizontal eyebrows  the long nose  the curved lips and the small  well developed chin. I couldn't believe my eyes when I first saw that. There is no reason why these portraits should look alike. All we did was look for portraits that had the characteristics of a self portrait  and look  they are very similar. Now  are they made in the right order  The young man should be made first. And as you see here from the years that they were created  it is indeed the case. They are made in the right order. What was the age of Leonardo at the time  Does that fit  Yes  it does. He was        and    when these were made. So we have three pictures  potentially of the same person of the same age as Leonardo at the time. But how do we know it's him  and not someone else  Well  we need a reference. And here's the only picture of Leonardo that's widely accepted. It's a statue made by Verrocchio  of David  for which Leonardo posed as a boy of   . And if we now compare the face of the statue  with the face of the musician  you see the very same features again. The statue is the reference  and it connects the identity of Leonardo to those three faces. Ladies and gentlemen  this story has not yet been published. It's only proper that you here at TED hear and see it first. The icon of icons finally has a face. Here he is  Leonardo da Vinci. Fifty years ago in the old Soviet Union  a team of engineers was secretly moving a large object through a desolate countryside. With it  they were hoping to capture the minds of people everywhere by being the first to conquer outer space. The rocket was huge. And packed in its nose was a silver ball with two radios inside. On October          they launched their rocket. One of the Russian scientists wrote at the time   We are about to create a new planet that we will call Sputnik. In the olden days  explorers like Vasco da Gama and Columbus had the good fortune to open up the terrestrial globe. Now we have the good fortune to open up space. And it is for those in the future to envy us our joy.  You're watching snippets from  Sputnik   my fifth documentary feature  which is just about completed. It tells the story of Sputnik  and the story of what happened to America as a result. For days after the launch  Sputnik was a wonderful curiosity. A man made moon visible by ordinary citizens  it inspired awe and pride that humans had finally launched an object into space. But just three days later  on a day they called Red Monday  the media and the politicians told us  and we believed  that Sputnik was proof that our enemy had beaten us in science and technology  and that they could now attack us with hydrogen bombs  using their Sputnik rocket as an IBM missile. All hell broke loose. Sputnik quickly became one of the three great shocks to hit America    historians say the equal of Pearl Harbor or     . It provoked the missile gap. It exploded an arms race. It began the space race. Within a year  Congress funded huge weapons increases  and we went from       nuclear weapons to       . And the reactions to Sputnik went far beyond weapons increases. For example  some here will remember this day  June       the National Civil Defense Drill  where tens of millions of people in    cities went underground. Or the Gallup Poll that showed that seven in    Americans believed that a nuclear war would happen  and that at least    percent of our population was going to be killed. But Sputnik provoked wonderful changes as well. For example  some in this room went to school on scholarship because of Sputnik. Support for engineering  math and science    education in general    boomed. And Vint Cerf points out that Sputnik led directly to ARPA  and the Internet  and  of course  NASA. My feature documentary shows how a free society can be stampeded by those who know how to use media. But it also shows how we can turn what appears at first to be a bad situation  into something that was overall very good for America.  Sputnik  will soon be released. In closing  I would like to take a moment to thank one of my investors  longtime TEDster  Jay Walker. And I'd like to thank you all. Thank you  Chris. There is nothing bigger or older than the universe. The questions I would like to talk about are  one  where did we come from  How did the universe come into being  Are we alone in the universe  Is there alien life out there  What is the future of the human race  Up until the     s  everyone thought the universe was essentially static and unchanging in time. Then it was discovered that the universe was expanding. Distant galaxies were moving away from us. This meant they must have been closer together in the past. If we extrapolate back  we find we must have all been on top of each other about    billion years ago. This was the Big Bang  the beginning of the universe. But was there anything before the Big Bang  If not  what created the universe  Why did the universe emerge from the Big Bang the way it did  We used to think that the theory of the universe could be divided into two parts. First  there were the laws like Maxwell's equations and general relativity that determined the evolution of the universe  given its state over all of space at one time. And second  there was no question of the initial state of the universe. We have made good progress on the first part  and now have the knowledge of the laws of evolution in all but the most extreme conditions. But until recently  we have had little idea about the initial conditions for the universe. However  this division into laws of evolution and initial conditions depends on time and space being separate and distinct. Under extreme conditions  general relativity and quantum theory allow time to behave like another dimension of space. This removes the distinction between time and space  and means the laws of evolution can also determine the initial state. The universe can spontaneously create itself out of nothing. Moreover  we can calculate a probability that the universe was created in different states. These predictions are in excellent agreement with observations by the WMAP satellite of the cosmic microwave background  which is an imprint of the very early universe. We think we have solved the mystery of creation. Maybe we should patent the universe and charge everyone royalties for their existence. I now turn to the second big question  are we alone  or is there other life in the universe  We believe that life arose spontaneously on the Earth  so it must be possible for life to appear on other suitable planets  of which there seem to be a large number in the galaxy. But we don't know how life first appeared. We have two pieces of observational evidence on the probability of life appearing. The first is that we have fossils of algae from  .  billion years ago. The Earth was formed  .  billion years ago and was probably too hot for about the first half billion years. So life appeared on Earth within half a billion years of it being possible  which is short compared to the    billion year lifetime of a planet of Earth type. This suggests that the probability of life appearing is reasonably high. If it was very low  one would have expected it to take most of the ten billion years available. On the other hand  we don't seem to have been visited by aliens. I am discounting the reports of UFOs. Why would they appear only to cranks and weirdos  If there is a government conspiracy to suppress the reports and keep for itself the scientific knowledge the aliens bring  it seems to have been a singularly ineffective policy so far. Furthermore  despite an extensive search by the SETI project  we haven't heard any alien television quiz shows. This probably indicates that there are no alien civilizations at our stage of development within a radius of a few hundred light years. Issuing an insurance policy against abduction by aliens seems a pretty safe bet. This brings me to the last of the big questions  the future of the human race. If we are the only intelligent beings in the galaxy  we should make sure we survive and continue. But we are entering an increasingly dangerous period of our history. Our population and our use of the finite resources of planet Earth are growing exponentially  along with our technical ability to change the environment for good or ill. But our genetic code still carries the selfish and aggressive instincts that were of survival advantage in the past. It will be difficult enough to avoid disaster in the next hundred years  let alone the next thousand or million. Our only chance of long term survival is not to remain inward looking on planet Earth  but to spread out into space. The answers to these big questions show that we have made remarkable progress in the last hundred years. But if we want to continue beyond the next hundred years  our future is in space. That is why I am in favor of manned    or should I say   personned    space flight. All of my life I have sought to understand the universe and find answers to these questions. I have been very lucky that my disability has not been a serious handicap. Indeed  it has probably given me more time than most people to pursue the quest for knowledge. The ultimate goal is a complete theory of the universe  and we are making good progress. Thank you for listening. Chris Anderson  Professor  if you had to guess either way  do you now believe that it is more likely than not that we are alone in the Milky Way  as a civilization of our level of intelligence or higher  This answer took seven minutes  and really gave me an insight into the incredible act of generosity this whole talk was for TED. Stephen Hawking  I think it quite likely that we are the only civilization within several hundred light years  otherwise we would have heard radio waves. The alternative is that civilizations don't last very long  but destroy themselves. CA  Professor Hawking  thank you for that answer. We will take it as a salutary warning  I think  for the rest of our conference this week. Professor  we really thank you for the extraordinary effort you made to share your questions with us today. Thank you very much indeed. I have given the slide show that I gave here two years ago about       times. I'm giving a short slide show this morning that I'm giving for the very first time  so    well it's    I don't want or need to raise the bar  I'm actually trying to lower the bar. Because I've cobbled this together to try to meet the challenge of this session. And I was reminded by Karen Armstrong's fantastic presentation that religion really properly understood is not about belief  but about behavior. Perhaps we should say the same thing about optimism. How dare we be optimistic  Optimism is sometimes characterized as a belief  an intellectual posture. As Mahatma Gandhi famously said   You must become the change you wish to see in the world.  And the outcome about which we wish to be optimistic is not going to be created by the belief alone  except to the extent that the belief brings about new behavior. But the word  behavior  is also  I think  sometimes misunderstood in this context. I'm a big advocate of changing the lightbulbs and buying hybrids  and Tipper and I put    solar panels on our house  and dug the geothermal wells  and did all of that other stuff. But  as important as it is to change the lightbulbs  it is more important to change the laws. And when we change our behavior in our daily lives  we sometimes leave out the citizenship part and the democracy part. In order to be optimistic about this  we have to become incredibly active as citizens in our democracy. In order to solve the climate crisis  we have to solve the democracy crisis. And we have one. I have been trying to tell this story for a long time. I was reminded of that recently  by a woman who walked past the table I was sitting at  just staring at me as she walked past. She was in her   s  looked like she had a kind face. I thought nothing of it until I saw from the corner of my eye she was walking from the opposite direction  also just staring at me. And so I said   How do you do   And she said   You know  if you dyed your hair black  you would look just like Al Gore.   Laughter  Many years ago  when I was a young congressman  I spent an awful lot of time dealing with the challenge of nuclear arms control    the nuclear arms race. And the military historians taught me  during that quest  that military conflicts are typically put into three categories  local battles  regional or theater wars  and the rare but all important global  world war    strategic conflicts. And each level of conflict requires a different allocation of resources  a different approach  a different organizational model. Environmental challenges fall into the same three categories  and most of what we think about are local environmental problems  air pollution  water pollution  hazardous waste dumps. But there are also regional environmental problems  like acid rain from the Midwest to the Northeast  and from Western Europe to the Arctic  and from the Midwest out the Mississippi into the dead zone of the Gulf of Mexico. And there are lots of those. But the climate crisis is the rare but all important global  or strategic  conflict. Everything is affected. And we have to organize our response appropriately. We need a worldwide  global mobilization for renewable energy  conservation  efficiency and a global transition to a low carbon economy. We have work to do. And we can mobilize resources and political will. But the political will has to be mobilized  in order to mobilize the resources. Let me show you these slides here. I thought I would start with the logo. What's missing here  of course  is the North Polar ice cap. Greenland remains. Twenty eight years ago  this is what the polar ice cap    the North Polar ice cap    looked like at the end of the summer  at the fall equinox. This last fall  I went to the Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder  Colorado  and talked to the researchers here in Monterey at the Naval Postgraduate Laboratory. This is what's happened in the last    years. To put it in perspective       was the previous record. Here's what happened last fall that has really unnerved the researchers. The North Polar ice cap is the same size geographically    doesn't look quite the same size    but it is exactly the same size as the United States  minus an area roughly equal to the state of Arizona. The amount that disappeared in      was equivalent to everything east of the Mississippi. The extra amount that disappeared last fall was equivalent to this much. It comes back in the winter  but not as permanent ice  as thin ice    vulnerable. The amount remaining could be completely gone in summer in as little as five years. That puts a lot of pressure on Greenland. Already  around the Arctic Circle    this is a famous village in Alaska. This is a town in Newfoundland. Antarctica. Latest studies from NASA. The amount of a moderate to severe snow melting of an area equivalent to the size of California.  They were the best of times  they were the worst of times   the most famous opening sentence in English literature. I want to share briefly a tale of two planets. Earth and Venus are exactly the same size. Earth's diameter is about     kilometers larger  but essentially the same size. They have exactly the same amount of carbon. But the difference is  on Earth  most of the carbon has been leeched over time out of the atmosphere  deposited in the ground as coal  oil  natural gas  etc. On Venus  most of it is in the atmosphere. The difference is that our temperature is    degrees on average. On Venus  it's    . This is relevant to our current strategy of taking as much carbon out of the ground as quickly as possible  and putting it into the atmosphere. It's not because Venus is slightly closer to the Sun. It's three times hotter than Mercury  which is right next to the Sun. Now  briefly  here's an image you've seen  as one of the only old images  but I show it because I want to briefly give you CSI  Climate. The global scientific community says  man made global warming pollution  put into the atmosphere  thickening this  is trapping more of the outgoing infrared. You all know that. At the last IPCC summary  the scientists wanted to say   How certain are you   They wanted to answer that     percent.  The Chinese objected  and so the compromise was  more than    percent.  Now  the skeptics say   Oh  wait a minute  this could be variations in this energy coming in from the sun.  If that were true  the stratosphere would be heated as well as the lower atmosphere  if it's more coming in. If it's more being trapped on the way out  then you would expect it to be warmer here and cooler here. Here is the lower atmosphere. Here's the stratosphere  cooler. CSI  Climate. Now  here's the good news. Sixty eight percent of Americans now believe that human activity is responsible for global warming. Sixty nine percent believe that the Earth is heating up in a significant way. There has been progress  but here is the key  when given a list of challenges to confront  global warming is still listed at near the bottom. What is missing is a sense of urgency. If you agree with the factual analysis  but you don't feel the sense of urgency  where does that leave you  Well  the Alliance for Climate Protection  which I head in conjunction with Current TV    who did this pro bono    did a worldwide contest to do commercials on how to communicate this. This is the winner. NBC    I'll show all of the networks here    the top journalists for NBC asked     questions in      of the presidential candidates  two of them were about the climate crisis. ABC      questions  two about the climate crisis. Fox  two. CNN  two. CBS  zero. From laughs to tears    this is one of the older tobacco commercials. So here's what we're doing. This is gasoline consumption in all of these countries. And us. But it's not just the developed nations. The developing countries are now following us and accelerating their pace. And actually  their cumulative emissions this year are the equivalent to where we were in     . And they're catching up very dramatically. The total concentrations  by       they will be essentially where we were in     . If the wealthy countries were completely missing from the picture  we would still have this crisis. But we have given to the developing countries the technologies and the ways of thinking that are creating the crisis. This is in Bolivia    over thirty years. This is peak fishing in a few seconds. The '  s. '  s. '  s. '  s. We have to stop this. And the good news is that we can. We have the technologies. We have to have a unified view of how to go about this  the struggle against poverty in the world and the challenge of cutting wealthy country emissions  all has a single  very simple solution. People say   What's the solution   Here it is. Put a price on carbon. We need a CO  tax  revenue neutral  to replace taxation on employment  which was invented by Bismarck    and some things have changed since the   th century. In the poor world  we have to integrate the responses to poverty with the solutions to the climate crisis. Plans to fight poverty in Uganda are mooted  if we do not solve the climate crisis. But responses can actually make a huge difference in the poor countries. This is a proposal that has been talked about a lot in Europe. This was from Nature magazine. These are concentrating solar  renewable energy plants  linked in a so called  supergrid  to supply all of the electrical power to Europe  largely from developing countries    high voltage DC currents. This is not pie in the sky  this can be done. We need to do it for our own economy. The latest figures show that the old model is not working. There are a lot of great investments that you can make. If you are investing in tar sands or shale oil  then you have a portfolio that is crammed with sub prime carbon assets. And it is based on an old model. Junkies find veins in their toes when the ones in their arms and their legs collapse. Developing tar sands and coal shale is the equivalent. Here are just a few of the investments that I personally think make sense. I have a stake in these  so I'll have a disclaimer there. But geothermal  concentrating solar  advanced photovoltaics  efficiency and conservation. You've seen this slide before  but there's a change. The only two countries that didn't ratify    and now there's only one. Australia had an election. And there was a campaign in Australia that involved television and Internet and radio commercials to lift the sense of urgency for the people there. And we trained     people to give the slide show in every town and village and city in Australia. Lot of other things contributed to it  but the new Prime Minister announced that his very first priority would be to change Australia's position on Kyoto  and he has. Now  they came to an awareness partly because of the horrible drought that they have had. This is Lake Lanier. My friend Heidi Cullen said that if we gave droughts names the way we give hurricanes names  we'd call the one in the southeast now Katrina  and we would say it's headed toward Atlanta. We can't wait for the kind of drought Australia had to change our political culture. Here's more good news. The cities supporting Kyoto in the U.S. are up to        and I thought I saw one go by there  just to localize this    which is good news. Now  to close  we heard a couple of days ago about the value of making individual heroism so commonplace that it becomes banal or routine. What we need is another hero generation. Those of us who are alive in the United States of America today especially  but also the rest of the world  have to somehow understand that history has presented us with a choice    just as Jill  Bolte  Taylor was figuring out how to save her life while she was distracted by the amazing experience that she was going through. We now have a culture of distraction. But we have a planetary emergency. And we have to find a way to create  in the generation of those alive today  a sense of generational mission. I wish I could find the words to convey this. This was another hero generation that brought democracy to the planet. Another that ended slavery. And that gave women the right to vote. We can do this. Don't tell me that we don't have the capacity to do it. If we had just one week's worth of what we spend on the Iraq War  we could be well on the way to solving this challenge. We have the capacity to do it. One final point  I'm optimistic  because I believe we have the capacity  at moments of great challenge  to set aside the causes of distraction and rise to the challenge that history is presenting to us. Sometimes I hear people respond to the disturbing facts of the climate crisis by saying   Oh  this is so terrible. What a burden we have.  I would like to ask you to reframe that. How many generations in all of human history have had the opportunity to rise to a challenge that is worthy of our best efforts  A challenge that can pull from us more than we knew we could do  I think we ought to approach this challenge with a sense of profound joy and gratitude that we are the generation about which  a thousand years from now  philharmonic orchestras and poets and singers will celebrate by saying  they were the ones that found it within themselves to solve this crisis and lay the basis for a bright and optimistic human future. Let's do that. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  For so many people at TED  there is deep pain that basically a design issue on a voting form    one bad design issue meant that your voice wasn't being heard like that in the last eight years in a position where you could make these things come true. That hurts. Al Gore  You have no idea.  Laughter  CA  When you look at what the leading candidates in your own party are doing now    I mean  there's    are you excited by their plans on global warming  AG  The answer to the question is hard for me because  on the one hand  I think that we should feel really great about the fact that the Republican nominee    certain nominee    John McCain  and both of the finalists for the Democratic nomination    all three have a very different and forward leaning position on the climate crisis. All three have offered leadership  and all three are very different from the approach taken by the current administration. And I think that all three have also been responsible in putting forward plans and proposals. But the campaign dialogue that    as illustrated by the questions    that was put together by the League of Conservation Voters  by the way  the analysis of all the questions    and  by the way  the debates have all been sponsored by something that goes by the Orwellian label   Clean Coal.  Has anybody noticed that  Every single debate has been sponsored by  Clean Coal.   Now  even lower emissions   The richness and fullness of the dialogue in our democracy has not laid the basis for the kind of bold initiative that is really needed. So they're saying the right things and they may    whichever of them is elected    may do the right thing  but let me tell you  when I came back from Kyoto in       with a feeling of great happiness that we'd gotten that breakthrough there  and then confronted the United States Senate  only one out of     senators was willing to vote to confirm  to ratify that treaty. Whatever the candidates say has to be laid alongside what the people say. This challenge is part of the fabric of our whole civilization. CO  is the exhaling breath of our civilization  literally. And now we mechanized that process. Changing that pattern requires a scope  a scale  a speed of change that is beyond what we have done in the past. So that's why I began by saying  be optimistic in what you do  but be an active citizen. Demand    change the light bulbs  but change the laws. Change the global treaties. We have to speak up. We have to solve this democracy    this    We have sclerosis in our democracy. And we have to change that. Use the Internet. Go on the Internet. Connect with people. Become very active as citizens. Have a moratorium    we shouldn't have any new coal fired generating plants that aren't able to capture and store CO   which means we have to quickly build these renewable sources. Now  nobody is talking on that scale. But I do believe that between now and November  it is possible. This Alliance for Climate Protection is going to launch a nationwide campaign    grassroots mobilization  television ads  Internet ads  radio  newspaper    with partnerships with everybody from the Girl Scouts to the hunters and fishermen. We need help. We need help. CA  In terms of your own personal role going forward  Al  is there something more than that you would like to be doing  AG  I have prayed that I would be able to find the answer to that question. What can I do  Buckminster Fuller once wrote   If the future of all human civilization depended on me  what would I do  How would I be   It does depend on all of us  but again  not just with the light bulbs. We  most of us here  are Americans. We have a democracy. We can change things  but we have to actively change. What's needed really is a higher level of consciousness. And that's hard to    that's hard to create    but it is coming. There's an old African proverb that some of you know that says   If you want to go quickly  go alone  if you want to go far  go together.  We have to go far  quickly. So we have to have a change in consciousness. A change in commitment. A new sense of urgency. A new appreciation for the privilege that we have of undertaking this challenge. CA  Al Gore  thank you so much for coming to TED. AG  Thank you. Thank you very much. So  as researchers  something that we often do is use immense resources to achieve certain capabilities  or achieve certain goals. And this is essential to the progress of science  or exploration of what is possible. But it creates this unfortunate situation where a tiny  tiny fraction of the world can actually participate in this exploration or can benefit from that technology. Something that motivates me  and gets me really excited about my research  is when I see simple opportunities to drastically change that distribution and make the technology accessible to a much wider percentage of the population. I'm going to show you two videos that have gotten a lot of attention that I think embody this philosophy. And they actually use the Nintendo Wii Remote. For those of you who aren't familiar with this device  it's a     video game controller. And it's mostly advertised for its motion sensing capabilities  so you can swing a tennis racket  or hit a baseball bat. But what actually interests me a lot more is the fact that in the tip of each controller is a relatively high performing infrared camera. And I'm going to show you two demos of why this is useful. So here  I have my computer set up with the projector  and I have a Wii Remote sitting on top of it. And  for example  if you're in a school that doesn't have a lot money  probably a lot of schools  or if you're in an office environment  and you want an interactive whiteboard  normally these cost about two to three thousand dollars. So I'm going to show you how to create one with a Wii Remote. Now  this requires another piece of hardware  which is this infrared pen. You can probably make this yourself for about five dollars with a quick trip to the Radio Shack. It's got a battery  a button and an infrared LED    you guys can't see it    but it turns on whenever I push the button. Now  what this means is that if I run this piece of software  the camera sees the infrared dot  and I can register the location of the camera pixels to the projector pixels. And now this is like an interactive whiteboard surface. So for about     of hardware  you can have your own whiteboard. This is Adobe Photoshop. Thank you. The software for this I've actually put on my website and have let people download it for free. In the three months this project has been public  it's been downloaded over half a million times. So teachers and students all around the world are already using this. Although it does do it for    dollars  there are some limitations of this approach. You get about    percent of the way there  for one percent of the cost. Another nice thing is that a camera can see multiple dots  so this is actually a multi touch  interactive whiteboard system as well. For the second demo  I have this Wii Remote that's actually next to the TV. So it's pointing away from the display  rather than pointing at the display. And why this is interesting is that if you put on  say  a pair of safety glasses  that have two infrared dots in them  they are going to give the computer an approximation of your head location. And why this is interesting is I have this sort of application running on the computer monitor  which has a  D room  with some targets floating in it. And you can see that it looks like a  D room. kind of like a video game  it sort of looks  D  but for the most part  the image looks pretty flat  and bound to the surface of the screen. But if we turn on head tracking    the computer can change the image that's on the screen and make it respond to the head movements. So let's switch back to that. So this has actually been a little bit startling to the game development community. Because this is about    dollars of additional hardware if you already have a Nintendo Wii. So I'm looking forward to seeing some games  and actually Louis Castle  that's him down there  last week announced that Electronic Arts  one of the largest game publishers  is releasing a game in May that has a little Easter egg feature for supporting this type of head tracking. And that's from less than five months from a prototype in my lab to a major commercial product. Thank you. But actually  to me  what's almost more interesting than either of these two projects is how people actually found out about them. YouTube has really changed the way  or changed the speed  in which a single individual can actually spread an idea around the world. I'm doing some research in my lab with a video camera  and within the first week  a million people had seen this work  and literally within days  engineers  teachers and students from around the world were already posting their own YouTube videos of them using my system or derivatives of this work. So I hope to see more of that in the future  and hope online video distribution to be embraced by the research community. So thank you very much. The first idea I'd like to suggest is that we all love music a great deal. It means a lot to us. But music is even more powerful if you don't just listen to it  but you make it yourself. So  that's my first idea. And we all know about the Mozart effect    the idea that's been around for the last five to    years    that just by listening to music or by playing music to your baby  in utero   that it'll raise our IQ points            percent. Great idea  but it doesn't work at all. So  you can't just listen to music  you have to make it somehow. And I'd add to that  that it's not just making it  but everybody  each of us  everybody in the world has the power to create and be part of music in a very dynamic way  and that's one of the main parts of my work. So  with the MIT Media Lab  for quite a while now  we've been engaged in a field called active music. What are all the possible ways that we can think of to get everybody in the middle of a musical experience  not just listening  but making music  And we started by making instruments for some of the world's greatest performers    we call these hyperinstruments    for Yo Yo Ma  Peter Gabriel  Prince  orchestras  rock bands. Instruments where they're all kinds of sensors built right into the instrument  so the instrument knows how it's being played. And just by changing the interpretation and the feeling  I can turn my cello into a voice  or into a whole orchestra  or into something that nobody has ever heard before. When we started making these  I started thinking  why can't we make wonderful instruments like that for everybody  people who aren't fantastic Yo Yo Mas or Princes  So  we've made a whole series of instruments. One of the largest collections is called the Brain Opera. It's a whole orchestra of about     instruments  all designed for anybody to play using natural skill. So  you can play a video game  drive through a piece of music  use your body gesture to control huge masses of sound  touch a special surface to make melodies  use your voice to make a whole aura. And when we make the Brain Opera  we invite the public to come in  to try these instruments and then collaborate with us to help make each performance of the Brain Opera. We toured that for a long time. It is now permanently in Vienna  where we built a museum around it. And that led to something which you probably do know. Guitar Hero came out of our lab  and my two teenage daughters and most of the students at the MIT Media Lab are proof that if you make the right kind of interface  people are really interested in being in the middle of a piece of music  and playing it over and over and over again. So  the model works  but it's only the tip of the iceberg  because my second idea is that it's not enough just to want to make music in something like Guitar Hero. And music is very fun  but it's also transformative. It's very  very important. Music can change your life  more than almost anything. It can change the way you communicate with others  it can change your body  it can change your mind. So  we're trying to go to the next step of how you build on top of something like Guitar Hero. We are very involved in education. We have a long term project called Toy Symphony  where we make all kinds of instruments that are also addictive  but for little kids  so the kids will fall in love with making music  want to spend their time doing it  and then will demand to know how it works  how to make more  how to create. So  we make squeezy instruments  like these Music Shapers that measure the electricity in your fingers  Beatbugs that let you tap in rhythms    they gather your rhythm  and like hot potato  you send your rhythm to your friends  who then have to imitate or respond to what your doing    and a software package called Hyperscore  which lets anybody use lines and color to make quite sophisticated music. Extremely easy to use  but once you use it  you can go quite deep    music in any style. And then  by pressing a button  it turns into music notation so that live musicians can play your pieces. We've had good enough  really  very powerful effects with kids around the world  and now people of all ages  using Hyperscore. So  we've gotten more and more interested in using these kinds of creative activities in a much broader context  for all kinds of people who don't usually have the opportunity to make music. So  one of the growing fields that we're working on at the Media Lab right now is music  mind and health. A lot of you have probably seen Oliver Sacks' wonderful new book called  Musicophilia . It's on sale in the bookstore. It's a great book. If you haven't seen it  it's worth reading. He's a pianist himself  and he details his whole career of looking at and observing incredibly powerful effects that music has had on peoples' lives in unusual situations. So we know  for instance  that music is almost always the last thing that people with advanced Alzheimer's can still respond to. Maybe many of you have noticed this with loved ones  you can find somebody who can't recognize their face in the mirror  or can't tell anyone in their family  but you can still find a shard of music that that person will jump out of the chair and start singing. And with that you can bring back parts of people's memories and personalities. Music is the best way to restore speech to people who have lost it through strokes  movement to people with Parkinson's disease. It's very powerful for depression  schizophrenia  many  many things. So  we're working on understanding those underlying principles and then building activities which will let music really improve people's health. And we do this in many ways. We work with many different hospitals. One of them is right near Boston  called Tewksbury Hospital. It's a long term state hospital  where several years ago we started working with Hyperscore and patients with physical and mental disabilities. This has become a central part of the treatment at Tewksbury hospital  so everybody there clamors to work on musical activities. It's the activity that seems to accelerate people's treatment the most and it also brings the entire hospital together as a kind of musical community. I wanted to show you a quick video of some of this work before I go on. Video  They're manipulating each other's rhythms. It's a real experience  not only to learn how to play and listen to rhythms  but to train your musical memory and playing music in a group. To get their hands on music  to shape it themselves  change it  to experiment with it  to make their own music. So Hyperscore lets you start from scratch very quickly. Everybody can experience music in a profound way  we just have to make different tools. The third idea I want to share with you is that music  paradoxically  I think even more than words  is one of the very best ways we have of showing who we really are. I love giving talks  although strangely I feel more nervous giving talks than playing music. If I were here playing cello  or playing on a synth  or sharing my music with you  I'd be able to show things about myself that I can't tell you in words  more personal things  perhaps deeper things. I think that's true for many of us  and I want to give you two examples of how music is one of the most powerful interfaces we have  from ourselves to the outside world. The first is a really crazy project that we're building right now  called Death and the Powers. And it's a big opera  one of the larger opera projects going on in the world right now. And it's about a man  rich  successful  powerful  who wants to live forever. So  he figures out a way to download himself into his environment  actually into a series of books. So this guy wants to live forever  he downloads himself into his environment. The main singer disappears at the beginning of the opera and the entire stage becomes the main character. It becomes his legacy. And the opera is about what we can share  what we can pass on to others  to the people we love  and what we can't. Every object in the opera comes alive and is a gigantic music instrument  like this chandelier. It takes up the whole stage. It looks like a chandelier  but it's actually a robotic music instrument. So  as you can see in this prototype  gigantic piano strings  each string is controlled with a little robotic element    either little bows that stroke the strings  propellers that tickle the strings  acoustic signals that vibrate the strings. We also have an army of robots on stage. These robots are the kind of the intermediary between the main character  Simon Powers  and his family. There are a whole series of them  kind of like a Greek chorus. They observe the action. We've designed these square robots that we're testing right now at MIT called OperaBots. These OperaBots follow my music. They follow the characters. They're smart enough  we hope  not to bump into each other. They go off on their own. And then they can also  when you snap  line up exactly the way you'd like to. Even though they're cubes  they actually have a lot of personality. The largest set piece in the opera is called The System. It's a series of books. Every single book is robotic  so they all move  they all make sound  and when you put them all together  they turn into these walls  which have the gesture and the personality of Simon Powers. So he's disappeared  but the whole physical environment becomes this person. This is how he's chosen to represent himself. The books also have high packed LEDs on the spines. So it's all display. And here's the great baritone James Maddalena as he enters The System. This is a sneak preview. This premieres in Monaco    it's in September     . If by any chance you can't make it  another idea with this project    here's this guy building his legacy through this very unusual form  through music and through the environment. But we're also making this available both online and in public spaces  as a way of each of us to use music and images from our lives to make our own legacy or to make a legacy of someone we love. So instead of being grand opera  this opera will turn into what we're thinking of as personal opera. And  if you're going to make a personal opera  what about a personal instrument  Everything I've shown you so far    whether it's a hyper cello for Yo Yo Ma or squeezy toy for a child    the instruments stayed the same and are valuable for a certain class of person  a virtuoso  a child. But what if I could make an instrument that could be adapted to the way I personally behave  to the way my hands work  to what I do very skillfully  perhaps  to what I don't do so skillfully  I think that this is the future of interface  it's the future of music  the future of instruments. And I'd like now to invite two very special people on the stage  so that I can give you an example of what personal instruments might be like. So  can you give a hand to Adam Boulanger  Ph.D. student from the MIT Media Lab  and Dan Ellsey. Dan  thanks to TED and to Bombardier Flexjet  Dan is here with us today all the way from Tewksbury. He's a resident at Tewksbury Hospital. This is by far the farthest he's strayed from Tewksbury Hospital  I can tell you that  because he's motivated to meet with you today and show you his own music. So  first of all  Dan  do you want to say hi to everyone and tell everyone who you are  Dan Ellsey  Hello. My name is Dan Ellsey. I am    years old and I have cerebral palsy. I have always loved music and I am excited to be able to conduct my own music with this new software. Tod Machover  And we're really excited to have you here  really Dan.  Applause  So we met Dan about three years ago  three and a half years ago  when we started working at Tewksbury. Everybody we met there was fantastic  did fantastic music. Dan had never made music before  and it turned out he was really fantastic at it. He's a born composer. He's very shy  too. So  turned out he's a fantastic composer  and over the last few years has been a constant collaborator of ours. He has made many  many pieces. He makes his own CDs. Actually  he is quite well known in the Boston area    mentors people at the hospital and children  locally  in how to make their own music. And I'll let Adam tell you. So  Adam is a Ph.D. student at MIT  an expert in music technology and medicine. And Adam and Dan have become close collaborators. What Adam's been working on for this last period is not only how to have Dan be able easily to make his own pieces  but how he can perform his piece using this kind of personal instrument. So  you want to say a little bit about how you guys work  Adam Boulanger  Yes. So  Tod and I entered into a discussion following the Tewksbury work and it was really about how Dan is an expressive person  and he's an intelligent and creative person. And it's in his face  it's in his breathing  it's in his eyes. How come he can't perform one of his pieces of music  That's our responsibility  and it doesn't make sense. So we started developing a technology that will allow him with nuance  with precision  with control  and despite his physical disability  to be able to do that  to be able to perform his piece of music. So  the process and the technology    basically  first we needed an engineering solution. So  you know  we have a FireWire camera  it looked at an infrared pointer. We went with the type of gesture metaphor that Dan was already used to with his speaking controller. And this was actually the least interesting part of the work  you know  the design process. We needed an input  we needed continuous tracking  in the software  we look at the types of shapes he's making. But  then was the really interesting aspect of the work  following the engineering part  where  basically  we're coding over Dan's shoulder at the hospital extensively to figure out  you know  how does Dan move  What's useful to him as an expressive motion  You know  what's his metaphor for performance  What types of things does he find important to control and convey in a piece of music  So all the parameter fitting  and really the technology was stretched at that point to fit just Dan. And  you know  I think this is a perspective shift. It's not that our technologies    they provide access  they allow us to create pieces of creative work. But what about expression  What about that moment when an artist delivers that piece of work  You know  do our technologies allow us to express  Do they provide structure for us to do that  And  you know  that's a personal relationship to expression that is lacking in the technological sphere. So  you know  with Dan  we needed a new design process  a new engineering process to sort of discover his movement and his path to expression that allow him to perform. And so that's what we'll do today. TM  So let's do it. So Dan do you want to tell everyone about what you're going to play now  DE  This is  My Eagle Song.  TM  So Dan is going to play a piece of his  called  My Eagle Song . In fact  this is the score for Dan's piece  completely composed by Dan in Hyperscore. So he can use his infrared tracker to go directly into Hyperscore. He's incredibly fast at it  too  faster than I am  in fact. TM  He's really modest  too. So he can go in Hyperscore. You start out by making melodies and rhythms. He can place those exactly where he wants. Each one gets a color. He goes back into the composition window  draws the lines  places everything the way he wants to. Looking at the Hyperscore  you can see it also  you can see where the sections are  something might continue for a while  change  get really crazy and then end up with a big bang at the end. So that's the way he made his piece  and as Adam says  we then figured out the best way to have him perform his piece. It's going to be looked at by this camera  analyze his movements  it's going to let Dan bring out all the different aspects of his music that he wants to. And you're also going to notice a visual on the screen. We asked one of our students to look at what the camera is measuring. But instead of making it very literal  showing you exactly the camera tracing  we turned it into a graphic that shows you the basic movement  and shows the way it's being analyzed. I think it gives an understanding of how we're picking out movement from what Dan's doing  but I think it will also show you  if you look at that movement  that when Dan makes music  his motions are very purposeful  very precise  very disciplined and they're also very beautiful. So  in hearing this piece  as I mentioned before  the most important thing is the music's great  and it'll show you who Dan is. So  are we ready Adam  AB  Yeah. TM  OK  now Dan will play his piece  My Eagle Song  for you. TM  Bravo. One of the problems of writing  and working  and looking at the Internet is that it's very hard to separate fashion from deep change. And so  to start helping that  I want to take us back to     . In       James Gordon Bennett founded the first mass circulation newspaper in New York City. And it cost about     dollars to start it  which was about the equivalent of        dollars of today. By    years later  by       doing the same thing    starting what was experienced as a mass  circulation daily paper    would come to cost two and a half million dollars.         two and a half million     years. That's the critical change that is being inverted by the Net. And that's what I want to talk about today  and how that relates to the emergence of social production. Starting with newspapers  what we saw was high cost as an initial requirement for making information  knowledge and culture  which led to a stark bifurcation between producers    who had to be able to raise financial capital  just like any other industrial organization    and passive consumers that could choose from a certain set of things that this industrial model could produce. Now  the term  information society    information economy   for a very long time has been used as the thing that comes after the industrial revolution. But in fact  for purposes of understanding what's happening today  that's wrong. Because for     years  we've had an information economy. It's just been industrial  which means those who were producing had to have a way of raising money to pay those two and a half million dollars  and later  more for the telegraph  and the radio transmitter  and the television  and eventually the mainframe. And that meant they were market based  or they were government owned  depending on what kind of system they were in. And this characterized and anchored the way information and knowledge were produced for the next     years. Now  let me tell you a different story. Around June       the world of supercomputers had a bombshell. The Japanese had  for the first time  created the fastest supercomputer    the NEC Earth Simulator    taking the primary from the U.S.  and about two years later    this  by the way  is measuring the trillion floating point operations per second that the computer's capable of running    sigh of relief  IBM  Blue Gene  has just edged ahead of the NEC Earth Simulator. All of this completely ignores the fact that throughout this period  there's another supercomputer running in the world    SETI home. Four and a half million users around the world  contributing their leftover computer cycles  whenever their computer isn't working  by running a screen saver  and together sharing their resources to create a massive supercomputer that NASA harnesses to analyze the data coming from radio telescopes. What this picture suggests to us is that we've got a radical change in the way information production and exchange is capitalized. Not that it's become less capital intensive    that there's less money that's required    but that the ownership of this capital  the way the capitalization happens  is radically distributed. Each of us  in these advanced economies  has one of these  or something rather like it    a computer. They're not radically different from routers inside the middle of the network. And computation  storage and communications capacity are in the hands of practically every connected person    and these are the basic physical capital means necessary for producing information  knowledge and culture  in the hands of something like     million to a billion people around the planet. What this means is that for the first time since the industrial revolution  the most important means  the most important components of the core economic activities    remember  we are in an information economy    of the most advanced economies  and there more than anywhere else  are in the hands of the population at large. This is completely different than what we've seen since the industrial revolution. So we've got communications and computation capacity in the hands of the entire population  and we've got human creativity  human wisdom  human experience    the other major experience  the other major input    which unlike simple labor    stand here turning this lever all day long    is not something that's the same or fungible among people. Any one of you who has taken someone else's job  or tried to give yours to someone else  no matter how detailed the manual  you cannot transmit what you know  what you will intuit under a certain set of circumstances. In that we're unique  and each of us holds this critical input into production as we hold this machine. What's the effect of this  So  the story that most people know is the story of free or open source software. This is market share of Apache Web server    one of the critical applications in Web based communications. In       two groups of people said   Wow  this is really important  the Web  We need a much better Web server   One was a motley collection of volunteers who just decided  you know  we really need this  we should write one  and what are we going to do with what    well  we're gonna share it  And other people will be able to develop it. The other was Microsoft. Now  if I told you that    years later  the motley crew of people  who didn't control anything that they produced  acquired    percent of the market and was the red line  it would be amazing  Right  Think of it in minivans. A group of automobile engineers on their weekends are competing with Toyota. Right  But  in fact  of course  the story is it's the    percent  including the major e commerce site       percent of a critical application on which Web based communications and applications work is produced in this form  in direct competition with Microsoft. Not in a side issue    in a central strategic decision to try to capture a component of the Net. Software has done this in a way that's been very visible  because it's measurable. But the thing to see is that this actually happens throughout the Web. So  NASA  at some point  did an experiment where they took images of Mars that they were mapping  and they said  instead of having three or four fully trained Ph.D.s doing this all the time  let's break it up into small components  put it up on the Web  and see if people  using a very simple interface  will actually spend five minutes here     minutes there  clicking. After six months         people used this to generate mapping at a faster rate than the images were coming in  which was  quote   practically indistinguishable from the markings of a fully trained Ph.D.   once you showed it to a number of people and computed the average. Now  if you have a little girl  and she goes and writes to    well  not so little  medium little    tries to do research on Barbie. And she'll come to Encarta  one of the main online encyclopedias. This is what you'll find out about Barbie. This is it  there's nothing more to the definition  including   manufacturers     plural     now more commonly produce ethnically diverse dolls  like this black Barbie.  Which is vastly better than what you'll find in the encyclopedia.com  which is Barbie  Klaus.  Laughter  On the other hand  if they go to Wikipedia  they'll find a genuine article    and I won't talk a lot about Wikipedia  because Jimmy Wales is here    but roughly equivalent to what you would find in the Britannica  differently written  including the controversies over body image and commercialization  the claims about the way in which she's a good role model  etc. Another portion is not only how content is produced  but how relevance is produced. The claim to fame of Yahoo  was  we hire people to look    originally  not anymore    we hire people to look at websites and tell you    if they're in the index  they're good. This  on the other hand  is what        passionate volunteers produce in the Open Directory Project  each one willing to spend an hour or two on something they really care about  to say  this is good. So  this is the Open Directory Project  with        volunteers  each one spending a little bit of time  as opposed to a few hundred fully paid employees. No one owns it  no one owns the output  it's free for anyone to use and it's the output of people acting out of social and psychological motivations to do something interesting. This is not only outside of businesses. When you think of what is the critical innovation of Google  the critical innovation is outsourcing the one most important thing    the decision about what's relevant    to the community of the Web as a whole  doing whatever they want to do  so  page rank. The critical innovation here is instead of our engineers  or our people saying which is the most relevant  we're going to go out and count what you  people out there on the Web  for whatever reason    vanity  pleasure    produced links  and tied to each other. We're going to count those  and count them up. And again  here  you see Barbie.com  but also  very quickly  Adiosbarbie.com  the body image for every size. A contested cultural object  which you won't find anywhere soon on Overture  which is the classic market based mechanism  whoever pays the most is highest on the list. So  all of that is in the creation of content  of relevance  basic human expression. But remember  the computers were also physical. Just physical materials    our PCs    we share them together. We also see this in wireless. It used to be wireless was one person owned the license  they transmitted in an area  and it had to be decided whether they would be licensed or based on property. What we're seeing now is that computers and radios are becoming so sophisticated that we're developing algorithms to let people own machines  like Wi Fi devices  and overlay them with a sharing protocol that would allow a community like this to build its own wireless broadband network simply from the simple principle  When I'm listening  when I'm not using  I can help you transfer your messages  and when you're not using  you'll help me transfer yours. And this is not an idealized version. These are working models that at least in some places in the United States are being implemented  at least for public security. If in      I told you  let's build a data storage and retrieval system. It's got to store terabytes. It's got to be available    hours a day  seven days a week. It's got to be available from anywhere in the world. It has to support over     million users at any given moment. It's got to be robust to attack  including closing the main index  injecting malicious files  armed seizure of some major nodes. You'd say that would take years. It would take millions. But of course  what I'm describing is P P file sharing. Right  We always think of it as stealing music  but fundamentally  it's a distributed data storage and retrieval system  where people  for very obvious reasons  are willing to share their bandwidth and their storage to create something. So  essentially what we're seeing is the emergence of a fourth transactional framework. It used to be that there were two primary dimensions along which you could divide things. They could be market based  or non market based  they could be decentralized  or centralized. The price system was a market based and decentralized system. If things worked better because you actually had somebody organizing them  you had firms  if you wanted to be in the market    or you had governments or sometimes larger non profits in the non market. It was too expensive to have decentralized social production  to have decentralized action in society. That was not about society itself. That was  in fact  economic. But what we're seeing now is the emergence of this fourth system of social sharing and exchange. Not that it's the first time that we do nice things to each other  or for each other  as social beings. We do it all the time. It's that it's the first time that it's having major economic impact. What characterizes them is decentralized authority. You don't have to ask permission  as you do in a property based system. May I do this  It's open for anyone to create and innovate and share  if they want to  by themselves or with others  because property is one mechanism of coordination. But it's not the only one. Instead  what we see are social frameworks for all of the critical things that we use property and contract in the market  information flows to decide what are interesting problems  who's available and good for something  motivation structures    remember  money isn't always the best motivator. If you leave a     check after dinner with friends  you don't increase the probability of being invited back. And if dinner isn't entirely obvious  think of sex.  Laughter  It also requires certain new organizational approaches. And in particular  what we've seen is task organization. You have to hire people who know what they're doing. You have to hire them to spend a lot of time. Now  take the same problem  chunk it into little modules  and motivations become trivial. Five minutes  instead of watching TV  Five minutes I'll spend just because it's interesting. Just because it's fun. Just because it gives me a certain sense of meaning  or  in places that are more involved  like Wikipedia  gives me a certain set of social relations. So  a new social phenomenon is emerging. It's creating  and it's most visible when we see it as a new form of competition. Peer to peer networks assaulting the recording industry  free and open source software taking market share from Microsoft  Skype potentially threatening traditional telecoms  Wikipedia competing with online encyclopedias. But it's also a new source of opportunities for businesses. As you see a new set of social relations and behaviors emerging  you have new opportunities. Some of them are toolmakers. Instead of building well behaved appliances    things that you know what they'll do in advance    you begin to build more open tools. There's a new set of values  a new set of things people value. You build platforms for self expression and collaboration. Like Wikipedia  like the Open Directory Project  you're beginning to build platforms  and you see that as a model. And you see surfers  people who see this happening  and in some sense build it into a supply chain  which is a very curious one. Right  You have a belief  stuff will flow out of connected human beings. That'll give me something I can use  and I'm going to contract with someone. I will deliver something based on what happens. It's very scary    that's what Google does  essentially. That's what IBM does in software services  and they've done reasonably well. So  social production is a real fact  not a fad. It is the critical long term shift caused by the Internet. Social relations and exchange become significantly more important than they ever were as an economic phenomenon. In some contexts  it's even more efficient because of the quality of the information  the ability to find the best person  the lower transaction costs. It's sustainable and growing fast. But    and this is the dark lining    it is threatened by    in the same way that it threatens    the incumbent industrial systems. So next time you open the paper  and you see an intellectual property decision  a telecoms decision  it's not about something small and technical. It is about the future of the freedom to be as social beings with each other  and the way information  knowledge and culture will be produced. Because it is in this context that we see a battle over how easy or hard it will be for the industrial information economy to simply go on as it goes  or for the new model of production to begin to develop alongside that industrial model  and change the way we begin to see the world and report what it is that we see. Thank you. It is interesting that in the United States  the most significant health care budget goes to cardiovascular disease care  whether it's private or public. There's no comparison at all. In Africa    where it is a major killer    it is totally ignored. And that situation cannot be right. We must do something about it. A health status of a nation parallels development of that nation.    million people die every year from heart disease.    million heart attacks and strokes occur. Most of this is in developing countries  and the majority is in Africa.    percent of global disease burden for cardiovascular disease is in developing countries    not in the West    and yet    percent of the resources are in the West. Who is at risk  People like you. It's not just the Africans that should be concerned about that. All friends of Africa  that will have reason to be in Africa at some point in time  should be very concerned about this deplorable situation. Has anyone here wondered what will happen if you go back to your room at night  and you start getting chest pains  shortness of breath  sweating  You're having a heart attack. What are you going to do  Will you fly back to the U.S.  Germany  Europe  No  you will die.    percent will die within    hours  if not treated. This is what's going on. In a look at the map of the U.S.    the graph here     million people here     million here. By the time you get to     it's almost no one left in Nigeria    life expectancy is   . It's not because some people don't survive childhood illnesses    they do    but they do not survive after the time that they reach about    years old and    years old. And those are the times they're most productive. Those are the times that they should be contributing to Africa's development. But they're not there. The best way to spiral into a cycle of poverty is to kill the parents. If you cannot secure the parents  you cannot guarantee the security of the African child. What are the risk factors  It's very well known. I'm not going to spend a lot of time on those. These are just for information  hypertension  diabetes  obesity  lack of exercise. The usual suspects. Right here in Tanzania     percent of individuals have hypertension.    percent are getting treated. Only less than one percent are adequately treated. If we can treat hypertension alone in Africa  we'll save         lives a year. That's quite significant  Easy to treat. Look at the situation in Mauritius. In eight short years    we're here talking about HIV  malaria  which is all good. We cannot make the mistakes we've made with malaria and HIV. In eight short years  non communicable diseases will become the leading causes of death in Africa. That is something to keep in mind. We can't deal with it with situations like this. This is a typical African hospital. We can't depend on the elites    they go to USA  Germany  U.K. for treatment. Unbelievable. You can't depend on foreign aid alone. Here is the situation  countries are turning inwards. Post        the  United States has had a lot of trouble to deal with  their own internal issues. So  they spend their money trying to fix those problems. You can't rightly    it's not their responsibility  it is my responsibility. I have to take care of my own problems. If they help  that's good  But that is not my expectation. These worsening indices of health care or health studies in Africa demand a new look. We cannot keep on doing things the way we've always done them. If they have not worked  we have to look for alternative solutions. I'm here to talk to you about solutions. This has been    what has been a difficult sign to some of us. Several years ago  we started thinking about it. Everyone knows the problem. No one knows what the solutions are. We decided that we needed to put our money where our mouth is. Everyone is ready to throw in money  in terms of free money aid to developing countries. Talk about sustainable investment  no one is interested. You can't raise money. I have done businesses in healthcare in the United States    I live in Nashville  Tennessee  health care capital of America.  It's  very easy to raise money for health care ventures. But start telling them  you know  we're going to try to do it in Nigeria    everyone runs away. That is totally wrong. Those of you in the audience here  if you want to help Africa  invest money in sustainable development. Let me lead you through a day in the life of the Heart Institute  so you get a glimpse of what we do  and I'll talk a little bit more about it. What we have done is to show that high quality health care  comparable to the best anywhere in the world  can be done in a developing country environment. We have    positions right now    all of them trained  board certified in the USA  Canada or Britain. We have every modality that can be done in Vanderbilt  Cleveland Clinic    everywhere in the U.S.    and we do it for about    percent of the cost that you will need to do those things in the United States. Additionally  we have a policy that no one is ever turned away because of ability to pay. We take care of everyone. Whether you have one dollar  two dollars    it doesn't matter. And I will tell you how we're able to do it. We make sure that we select our equipment properly. We go for modular units. Units that have multi modality functions have modular components. Easy to repair  and because of that  we do not take things that are not durable and cannot last. We emphasize training  and we make sure that this process is regenerative. Very soon we will all be dead and gone  but the problems will stay  unless we have people taking over from where we stopped. We made sure that we produced some things ourselves. We do not buy unit doses of radiopharmaceuticals. We get the generators from the companies. We manufacture them in house  ourselves. That keeps the costs down. So  for a radiopharmaceutical in the U.S.    that you'll get a unit dose for     dollars    when we're finished manufacturing it in house  we come at a price of about two dollars. We recognize that the only way to bridge the gap between the rich and poor countries is through education and technology. All these problems we're talking about    if we bring development  they will all disappear. Technology is a great equalizer. How do we make it work  It's been proved  self care is cost effective. It extends opportunity to the rural centers  and we can use expertise in a very smart way. This is the way our centers are set up. We currently have three locations in the Caribbean  and we're planning a fourth one. And we have now decided to go into Africa. We will be doing the West African Heart Institute in Port Harcourt  Nigeria. That project will be starting within the next few months. We hope to open in        . And we will do other centers. This model can be adapted to every disease process. All the units  all the centers  are linked through a switched hub to a central server  and all the images are populated to review stations. And we designed this telemedicine solution. It's proprietary to us  and we are happy to share what we have learned with anyone who is interested in doing it. You can still be profitable. We make sure that the telemedicine platform gives access to expert medical specialists anywhere in the world  just by a click of the button. I'll lead you through  to see how this happens. This is at the Heart Institute. The doctors from anywhere can log in. I can call you in Switzerland and say   Listen  go into our system. Look at Mrs. Jones. Look at the study  tell me what you think.  They'll give me that information  and we'll make the care of the patient better. The patient doesn't have to travel. He doesn't have to experience the anxiety of not knowing because of limited expertise. We also use  an  electronic medical record system. I'm happy to say that the things we have implemented       percent of U.S. practices do not have them  and yet the technology is there. But you know  they have that luxury. Because if you can't get it in Nashville  you can travel to Birmingham  two hours away  and you'll get it. If you can't get it in Cleveland  you can go to Cincinnati. We don't have that luxury  so we have to make it happen. When we do it  we will put the cost of care down. And we'll extend it to the rural centers and make it affordable. And everyone will get the care they deserve. It cannot just be technology  we recognize that. Prevention must be part of the solution    we emphasize that. But  you know  you have to tell people what can be done. It's not possible to tell people to do what is going to be expensive  and they go home and can't do it. They need to be alive  they need to feed. We recommend exercise as the most effective  simple  easy thing to do. We have had walks every year    every March  April. We form people into groups and make them go into challenges. Which group loses the most weight  we give them prizes. Which groups record more walking distance by pedometer  we give them prizes. We do this constantly. We encourage them to bring children. That way we start exposing the children from very early on  on what these issues are. Because once they learn it  they will stay with it. In doing this we have created at least     skilled jobs in Jamaica alone  and these are physicians with expertise and special training. We have taken care of over       indigent patients that could have died  including four free pacemakers in patients with complete heart block. For those that understand cardiology  complete heart block means certain death. If you don't get this pacemaker  you will be dead. So we are pleased with that. Indirectly  we have saved the government of Jamaica five million dollars from people that would have gone to Miami or Atlanta for care. And we've hopefully saved a lot of lives. By the end of this year  we would have contributed over one million dollars in indigent care. In the first four months  it's been         dollars  averaging        dollars a month. The government will not do that  because they have competing needs. They need to put resources elsewhere. But we can still do it. People say   How can you do that   This is how we can do that. At least       rich Jamaicans that were heading to Miami for treatment have self confessed that they did not go to Miami because of the Heart Institute of the Caribbean. And  if they went to Miami  they will spend significantly more    eight to    times more. And they feel happy spending it at home  getting the same quality of care. And for that money    for every one patient that has the money to pay  it gives us an opportunity to take care of at least four people that do not have the resources to pay. For this to work  this progress must be sustainable. So  we emphasize training. Training is critical. We have gone further  we have formed a relationship with the University of Technology  Jamaica  where I now have an appointment. And we are starting a biomedical engineering program  so that we will train people locally  who can repair that equipment. That way we're not going to deal with obsolescence and all those kinds of issues. We're also starting ancillary health care technology training programs    training people in echocardiography  cardiac ultrasound  those kinds of things. Now  with that kind of training  it gives people motivation. Because now they will get a bachelors degree in medical imaging and all that kind of stuff. In the process  I want you to just hear from the trainees themselves what it has meant for them. I'm a senior resident in anesthesia in intensive care at the University Hospital of the West Indies. I came to the Heart Institute in       as part of my elective in my anesthesia and intensive care program. I spent three months at the Heart Institute. There's been no doubt around my colleagues about the utility of the training I received here  and I think there's been an increased interest now in    particularly in echocardiography and its use in our setting. Sharon Lazarus  I am an echocardiographer at the Heart Institute of the Caribbean  since the past two years. I received training at this institution. I think this aspect of training in cardiology that the Heart Institute of the Caribbean has introduced in Jamaica is very important in terms of diagnosing cardiac diseases. Ernest Madu  The lesson in this is that it can be done  and it can be sustained  and you can make it possible for everyone. Who are we to decide that poor people cannot get the best care  When have you been appointed to play God  It is not my decision. My job is to make sure that every person  no matter what fate has assigned to you  will have the opportunity to get the best quality health care in life. Next stop is West African Heart Institute  that we are going to be doing in Port Harcourt  Nigeria  as I said before. We will do other centers across West Africa. We will extend the same system into other areas  like dialysis treatment. And anyone who is interested in doing it in any health care situation  we will be happy to assist you and tell you how we've done it  and how you can do it. If we do this  we can change the face of health care in Africa. Africa has been good to us  it is time for us to give back to Africa. I am going. Those who want to come  I welcome you to come along with me. Thank you. The Value of Nothing  Out of Nothing Comes Something. That was an essay I wrote when I was    years old and I got a B .  Laughter  What I'm going to talk about  nothing out of something  and how we create. And I'm gonna try and do that within the    minute time span that we were told to stay within  and to follow the TED commandments  that is  actually  something that creates a near death experience  but near death is good for creativity. So  I also want to explain  because Dave Eggers said he was going to heckle me if I said anything that was a lie  or not true to universal creativity. And I've done it this way for half the audience  who is scientific. When I say we  I don't mean you  necessarily  I mean me  and my right brain  my left brain and the one that's in between that is the censor and tells me what I'm saying is wrong. And I'm going do that also by looking at what I think is part of my creative process  which includes a number of things that happened  actually    the nothing started even earlier than the moment in which I'm creating something new. And that includes nature  and nurture  and what I refer to as nightmares. Now in the nature area  we look at whether or not we are innately equipped with something  perhaps in our brains  some abnormal chromosome that causes this muse like effect. And some people would say that we're born with it in some other means. And others  like my mother  would say that I get my material from past lives. Some people would also say that creativity may be a function of some other neurological quirk    van Gogh syndrome    that you have a little bit of  you know  psychosis  or depression. I do have to say  somebody    I read recently that van Gogh wasn't really necessarily psychotic  that he might have had temporal lobe seizures  and that might have caused his spurt of creativity  and I don't    I suppose it does something in some part of your brain. And I will mention that I actually developed temporal lobe seizures a number of years ago  but it was during the time I was writing my last book  and some people say that book is quite different. I think that part of it also begins with a sense of identity crisis  you know  who am I  why am I this particular person  why am I not black like everybody else  And sometimes you're equipped with skills  but they may not be the kind of skills that enable creativity. I used to draw. I thought I would be an artist. And I had a miniature poodle. And it wasn't bad  but it wasn't really creative. Because all I could really do was represent in a very one on one way. And I have a sense that I probably copied this from a book. And then  I also wasn't really shining in a certain area that I wanted to be  and you know  you look at those scores  and it wasn't bad  but it was not certainly predictive that I would one day make my living out of the artful arrangement of words. Also  one of the principles of creativity is to have a little childhood trauma. And I had the usual kind that I think a lot of people had  and that is that  you know  I had expectations placed on me. That figure right there  by the way  figure right there was a toy given to me when I was but nine years old  and it was to help me become a doctor from a very early age. I have some ones that were long lasting  from the age of five to     this was supposed to be my side occupation  and it led to a sense of failure. But actually  there was something quite real in my life that happened when I was about   . And it was discovered that my brother  in       and then my father  six months later  had brain tumors. And my mother believed that something had gone wrong  and she was gonna find out what it was  and she was gonna fix it. My father was a Baptist minister  and he believed in miracles  and that God's will would take care of that. But  of course  they ended up dying  six months apart. And after that  my mother believed that it was fate  or curses    she went looking through all the reasons in the universe why this would have happened. Everything except randomness. She did not believe in randomness. There was a reason for everything. And one of the reasons  she thought  was that her mother  who had died when she was very young  was angry at her. And so  I had this notion of death all around me  because my mother also believed that I would be next  and she would be next. And when you are faced with the prospect of death very soon  you begin to think very much about everything. You become very creative  in a survival sense. And this  then  led to my big questions. And they're the same ones that I have today. And they are  why do things happen  and how do things happen  And the one my mother asked  how do I make things happen  It's a wonderful way to look at these questions  when you write a story. Because  after all  in that framework  between page one and      you have to answer this question of why things happen  how things happen  in what order they happen. What are the influences  How do I  as the narrator  as the writer  also influence that  And it's also one that  I think  many of our scientists have been asking. It's a kind of cosmology  and I have to develop a cosmology of my own universe  as the creator of that universe. And you see  there's a lot of back and forth in trying to make that happen  trying to figure it out    years and years  oftentimes. So  when I look at creativity  I also think that it is this sense or this inability to repress  my looking at associations in practically anything in life. And I got a lot of them during what's been going on throughout this conference  almost everything that's been going on. And so I'm going to use  as the metaphor  this association  quantum mechanics  which I really don't understand  but I'm still gonna use it as the process for explaining how it is the metaphor. So  in quantum mechanics  of course  you have dark energy and dark matter. And it's the same thing in looking at these questions of how things happen. There's a lot of unknown  and you often don't know what it is except by its absence. But when you make those associations  you want them to come together in a kind of synergy in the story  and what you're finding is what matters. The meaning. And that's what I look for in my work  a personal meaning. There is also the uncertainty principle  which is part of quantum mechanics  as I understand it.  Laughter  And this happens constantly in the writing. And there's the terrible and dreaded observer effect  in which you're looking for something  and you know  things are happening simultaneously  and you're looking at it in a different way  and you're trying to really look for the about ness  or what is this story about. And if you try too hard  then you will only write the about. You won't discover anything. And what you were supposed to find  what you hoped to find in some serendipitous way  is no longer there. Now  I don't want to ignore the other side of what happens in our universe  like many of our scientists have. And so  I am going to just throw in string theory here  and just say that creative people are multidimensional  and there are    levels  I think  of anxiety. There is also a big question of ambiguity. And I would link that to something called the cosmological constant. And you don't know what is operating  but something is operating there. And ambiguity  to me  is very uncomfortable in my life  and I have it. Moral ambiguity. It is constantly there. And  just as an example  this is one that recently came to me. It was something I read in an editorial by a woman who was talking about the war in Iraq. And she said   Save a man from drowning  you are responsible to him for life.  A very famous Chinese saying  she said. And that means because we went into Iraq  we should stay there until things were solved. You know  maybe even     years. So  there was another one that I came across  and it's  saving fish from drowning.  And it's what Buddhist fishermen say  because they're not supposed to kill anything. And they also have to make a living  and people need to be fed. So their way of rationalizing that is they are saving the fish from drowning  and unfortunately  in the process the fish die. Now  what's encapsulated in both these drowning metaphors    actually  one of them is my mother's interpretation  and it is a famous Chinese saying  because she said it to me   save a man from drowning  you are responsible to him for life.  And it was a warning    don't get involved in other people's business  or you're going to get stuck. OK. I think if somebody really was drowning  she'd save them. But  both of these sayings    saving a fish from drowning  or saving a man from drowning    to me they had to do with intentions. And all of us in life  when we see a situation  we have a response. And then we have intentions. There's an ambiguity of what that should be that we should do  and then we do something. And the results of that may not match what our intentions had been. Maybe things go wrong. And so  after that  what are our responsibilities  What are we supposed to do  Do we stay in for life  or do we do something else and justify and say  well  my intentions were good  and therefore I cannot be held responsible for all of it  That is the ambiguity in my life that really disturbed me  and led me to write a book called  Saving Fish From Drowning.  I saw examples of that. Once I identified this question  it was all over the place. I got these hints everywhere. And then  in a way  I knew that they had always been there. And then writing  that's what happens. I get these hints  these clues  and I realize that they've been obvious  and yet they have not been. And what I need  in effect  is a focus. And when I have the question  it is a focus. And all these things that seem to be flotsam and jetsam in life actually go through that question  and what happens is those particular things become relevant. And it seems like it's happening all the time. You think there's a sort of coincidence going on  a serendipity  in which you're getting all this help from the universe. And it may also be explained that now you have a focus. And you are noticing it more often. But you apply this. You begin to look at things having to do with your tensions. Your brother  who's fallen in trouble  do you take care of him  Why or why not  It may be something that is perhaps more serious    as I said  human rights in Burma. I was thinking that I shouldn't go because somebody said  if I did  it would show that I approved of the military regime there. And then  after a while  I had to ask myself   Why do we take on knowledge  why do we take on assumptions that other people have given us   And it was the same thing that I felt when I was growing up  and was hearing these rules of moral conduct from my father  who was a Baptist minister. So I decided that I would go to Burma for my own intentions  and still didn't know that if I went there  what the result of that would be  if I wrote a book    and I just would have to face that later  when the time came. We are all concerned with things that we see in the world that we are aware of. We come to this point and say  what do I as an individual do  Not all of us can go to Africa  or work at hospitals  so what do we do  if we have this moral response  this feeling  Also  I think one of the biggest things we are all looking at  and we talked about today  is genocide. This leads to this question. When I look at all these things that are morally ambiguous and uncomfortable  and I consider what my intentions should be  I realize it goes back to this identity question that I had when I was a child    and why am I here  and what is the meaning of my life  and what is my place in the universe  It seems so obvious  and yet it is not. We all hate moral ambiguity in some sense  and yet it is also absolutely necessary. In writing a story  it is the place where I begin. Sometimes I get help from the universe  it seems. My mother would say it was the ghost of my grandmother from the very first book  because it seemed I knew things I was not supposed to know. Instead of writing that the grandmother died accidentally  from an overdose of opium  while having too much of a good time  I actually put down in the story that the woman killed herself  and that actually was the way it happened. And my mother decided that that information must have come from my grandmother. There are also things  quite uncanny  which bring me information that will help me in the writing of the book. In this case  I was writing a story that included some kind of detail  period of history  a certain location. And I needed to find something historically that would match that. And I took down this book  and I    first page that I flipped it to was exactly the setting  and the time period  and the kind of character I needed    was the Taiping rebellion  happening in the area near Guilin  outside of that  and a character who thought he was the son of God. You wonder  are these things random chance  Well  what is random  What is chance  What is luck  What are things that you get from the universe that you can't really explain  And that goes into the story  too. These are the things I constantly think about from day to day. Especially when good things happen  and  in particular  when bad things happen. But I do think there's a kind of serendipity  and I do want to know what those elements are  so I can thank them  and also try to find them in my life. Because  again  I think that when I am aware of them  more of them happen. Another chance encounter is when I went to a place    I just was with some friends  and we drove randomly to a different place  and we ended up in this non tourist location  a beautiful village  pristine. And we walked three valleys beyond  and the third valley  there was something quite mysterious and ominous  a discomfort I felt. And then I knew that had to be  the  setting of my book. And in writing one of the scenes  it happened in that third valley. For some reason I wrote about cairns    stacks of rocks    that a man was building. And I didn't know exactly why I had it  but it was so vivid. I got stuck  and a friend  when she asked if I would go for a walk with her dogs  that I said  sure. And about    minutes later  walking along the beach  I came across this. And it was a man  a Chinese man  and he was stacking these things  not with glue  not with anything. And I asked him   How is it possible to do this   And he said   Well  I guess with everything in life  there's a place of balance.  And this was exactly the meaning of my story at that point. I had so many examples    I have so many instances like this  when I'm writing a story  and I cannot explain it. Is it because I had the filter that I have such a strong coincidence in writing about these things  Or is it a kind of serendipity that we cannot explain  like the cosmological constant  A big thing that I also think about is accidents. And as I said  my mother did not believe in randomness. What is the nature of accidents  And how are we going to assign what the responsibility and the causes are  outside of a court of law  I was able to see that in a firsthand way  when I went to beautiful Dong village  in Guizhou  the poorest province of China. And I saw this beautiful place. I knew I wanted to come back. And I had a chance to do that  when National Geographic asked me if I wanted to write anything about China. And I said yes  about this village of singing people  singing minority. And they agreed  and between the time I saw this place and the next time I went  there was a terrible accident. A man  an old man  fell asleep  and his quilt dropped in a pan of fire that kept him warm.    homes were destroyed  and    were damaged. Responsibility was assigned to the family. The man's sons were banished to live three kilometers away  in a cowshed. And  of course  as Westerners  we say   Well  it was an accident. That's not fair. It's the son  not the father.  When I go on a story  I have to let go of those kinds of beliefs. It takes a while  but I have to let go of them and just go there  and be there. And so I was there on three occasions  different seasons. And I began to sense something different about the history  and what had happened before  and the nature of life in a very poor village  and what you find as your joys  and your rituals  your traditions  your links with other families. And I saw how this had a kind of justice  in its responsibility. I was able to find out also about the ceremony that they were using  a ceremony they hadn't used in about    years. And it was to send some men    a Feng Shui master sent men down to the underworld on ghost horses. Now you  as Westerners  and I  as Westerners  would say well  that's superstition. But after being there for a while  and seeing the amazing things that happened  you begin to wonder whose beliefs are those that are in operation in the world  determining how things happen. So I remained with them  and the more I wrote that story  the more I got into those beliefs  and I think that's important for me    to take on the beliefs  because that is where the story is real  and that is where I'm gonna find the answers to how I feel about certain questions that I have in life. Years go by  of course  and the writing  it doesn't happen instantly  as I'm trying to convey it to you here at TED. The book comes and it goes. When it arrives  it is no longer my book. It is in the hands of readers  and they interpret it differently. But I go back to this question of  how do I create something out of nothing  And how do I create my own life  And I think it is by questioning  and saying to myself that there are no absolute truths. I believe in specifics  the specifics of story  and the past  the specifics of that past  and what is happening in the story at that point. I also believe that in thinking about things    my thinking about luck  and fate  and coincidences and accidents  God's will  and the synchrony of mysterious forces    I will come to some notion of what that is  how we create. I have to think of my role. Where I am in the universe  and did somebody intend for me to be that way  or is it just something I came up with  And I also can find that by imagining fully  and becoming what is imagined    and yet is in that real world  the fictional world. And that is how I find particles of truth  not the absolute truth  or the whole truth. And they have to be in all possibilities  including those I never considered before. So  there are never complete answers. Or rather  if there is an answer  it is to remind myself that there is uncertainty in everything  and that is good  because then I will discover something new. And if there is a partial answer  a more complete answer from me  it is to simply imagine. And to imagine is to put myself in that story  until there was only    there is a transparency between me and the story that I am creating. And that's how I've discovered that if I feel what is in the story    in one story    then I come the closest  I think  to knowing what compassion is  to feeling that compassion. Because for everything  in that question of how things happen  it has to do with the feeling. I have to become the story in order to understand a lot of that. We've come to the end of the talk  and I will reveal what is in the bag  and it is the muse  and it is the things that transform in our lives  that are wonderful and stay with us. There she is. Thank you very much  In the year       a virtually unknown German mathematician  named Theodor Kaluza suggested a very bold and  in some ways  a very bizarre idea. He proposed that our universe might actually have more than the three dimensions that we are all aware of. That is in addition to left  right  back  forth and up  down  Kaluza proposed that there might be additional dimensions of space that for some reason we don't yet see. Now  when someone makes a bold and bizarre idea  sometimes that's all it is    bold and bizarre  but it has nothing to do with the world around us. This particular idea  however    although we don't yet know whether it's right or wrong  and at the end I'll discuss experiments which  in the next few years  may tell us whether it's right or wrong    this idea has had a major impact on physics in the last century and continues to inform a lot of cutting edge research. So  I'd like to tell you something about the story of these extra dimensions. So where do we go  To begin we need a little bit of back story. Go to     . This is a year when Einstein is basking in the glow of having discovered the special theory of relativity and decides to take on a new project  to try to understand fully the grand  pervasive force of gravity. And in that moment  there are many people around who thought that that project had already been resolved. Newton had given the world a theory of gravity in the late     s that works well  describes the motion of planets  the motion of the moon and so forth  the motion of apocryphal of apples falling from trees  hitting people on the head. All of that could be described using Newton's work. But Einstein realized that Newton had left something out of the story  because even Newton had written that although he understood how to calculate the effect of gravity  he'd been unable to figure out how it really works. How is it that the Sun     million miles away   that  somehow it affects the motion of the Earth  How does the Sun reach out across empty inert space and exert influence  And that is a task to which Einstein set himself    to figure out how gravity works. And let me show you what it is that he found. So Einstein found that the medium that transmits gravity is space itself. The idea goes like this  imagine space is a substrate of all there is. Einstein said space is nice and flat  if there's no matter present. But if there is matter in the environment  such as the Sun  it causes the fabric of space to warp  to curve. And that communicates the force of gravity. Even the Earth warps space around it. Now look at the Moon. The Moon is kept in orbit  according to these ideas  because it rolls along a valley in the curved environment that the Sun and the Moon and the Earth can all create by virtue of their presence. We go to a full frame view of this. The Earth itself is kept in orbit because it rolls along a valley in the environment that's curved because of the Sun's presence. That is this new idea about how gravity actually works. Now  this idea was tested in      through astronomical observations. It really works. It describes the data. And this gained Einstein prominence around the world. And that is what got Kaluza thinking. He  like Einstein  was in search of what we call a unified theory. That's one theory that might be able to describe all of nature's forces from one set of ideas  one set of principles  one master equation  if you will. So Kaluza said to himself  Einstein has been able to describe gravity in terms of warps and curves in space    in fact  space and time  to be more precise. Maybe I can play the same game with the other known force  which was  at that time  known as the electromagnetic force    we know of others today  but at that time that was the only other one people were thinking about. You know  the force responsible for electricity and magnetic attraction and so forth. So Kaluza says  maybe I can play the same game and describe electromagnetic force in terms of warps and curves. That raised a question  warps and curves in what  Einstein had already used up space and time  warps and curves  to describe gravity. There didn't seem to be anything else to warp or curve. So Kaluza said  well  maybe there are more dimensions of space. He said  if I want to describe one more force  maybe I need one more dimension. So he imagined that the world had four dimensions of space  not three  and imagined that electromagnetism was warps and curves in that fourth dimension. Now here's the thing  when he wrote down the equations describing warps and curves in a universe with four space dimensions  not three  he found the old equations that Einstein had already derived in three dimensions    those were for gravity    but he found one more equation because of the one more dimension. And when he looked at that equation  it was none other than the equation that scientists had long known to describe the electromagnetic force. Amazing    it just popped out. He was so excited by this realization that he ran around his house screaming   Victory      that he had found the unified theory. Now clearly  Kaluza was a man who took theory very seriously. He  in fact    there is a story that when he wanted to learn how to swim  he read a book  a treatise on swimming       then dove into the ocean. This is a man who would risk his life on theory. Now  but for those of us who are a little bit more practically minded  two questions immediately arise from his observation. Number one  if there are more dimensions in space  where are they  We don't seem to see them. And number two  does this theory really work in detail  when you try to apply it to the world around us  Now  the first question was answered in      by a fellow named Oskar Klein. He suggested that dimensions might come in two varieties    there might be big  easy to see dimensions  but there might also be tiny  curled up dimensions  curled up so small  even though they're all around us  that we don't see them. Let me show you that one visually. So  imagine you're looking at something like a cable supporting a traffic light. It's in Manhattan. You're in Central Park    it's kind of irrelevant    but the cable looks one dimensional from a distant viewpoint  but you and I all know that it does have some thickness. It's very hard to see it  though  from far away. But if we zoom in and take the perspective of  say  a little ant walking around    little ants are so small that they can access all of the dimensions    the long dimension  but also this clockwise  counter clockwise direction. And I hope you appreciate this. It took so long to get these ants to do this. But this illustrates the fact that dimensions can be of two sorts  big and small. And the idea that maybe the big dimensions around us are the ones that we can easily see  but there might be additional dimensions curled up  sort of like the circular part of that cable  so small that they have so far remained invisible. Let me show you what that would look like. So  if we take a look  say  at space itself    I can only show  of course  two dimensions on a screen. Some of you guys will fix that one day  but anything that's not flat on a screen is a new dimension  goes smaller  smaller  smaller  and way down in the microscopic depths of space itself  this is the idea  you could have additional curled up dimensions    here is a little shape of a circle    so small that we don't see them. But if you were a little ultra microscopic ant walking around  you could walk in the big dimensions that we all know about    that's like the grid part    but you could also access the tiny curled up dimension that's so small that we can't see it with the naked eye or even with any of our most refined equipment. But deeply tucked into the fabric of space itself  the idea is there could be more dimensions  as we see there. Now that's an explanation about how the universe could have more dimensions than the ones that we see. But what about the second question that I asked  does the theory actually work when you try to apply it to the real world  Well  it turns out that Einstein and Kaluza and many others worked on trying to refine this framework and apply it to the physics of the universe as was understood at the time  and  in detail  it didn't work. In detail  for instance  they couldn't get the mass of the electron to work out correctly in this theory. So many people worked on it  but by the '  s  certainly by the '  s  this strange but very compelling idea of how to unify the laws of physics had gone away. Until something wonderful happened in our age. In our era  a new approach to unify the laws of physics is being pursued by physicists such as myself  many others around the world  it's called superstring theory  as you were indicating. And the wonderful thing is that superstring theory has nothing to do at first sight with this idea of extra dimensions  but when we study superstring theory  we find that it resurrects the idea in a sparkling  new form. So  let me just tell you how that goes. Superstring theory    what is it  Well  it's a theory that tries to answer the question  what are the basic  fundamental  indivisible  uncuttable constituents making up everything in the world around us  The idea is like this. So  imagine we look at a familiar object  just a candle in a holder  and imagine that we want to figure out what it is made of. So we go on a journey deep inside the object and examine the constituents. So deep inside    we all know  you go sufficiently far down  you have atoms. We also all know that atoms are not the end of the story. They have little electrons that swarm around a central nucleus with neutrons and protons. Even the neutrons and protons have smaller particles inside of them known as quarks. That is where conventional ideas stop. Here is the new idea of string theory. Deep inside any of these particles  there is something else. This something else is this dancing filament of energy. It looks like a vibrating string    that's where the idea  string theory comes from. And just like the vibrating strings that you just saw in a cello can vibrate in different patterns  these can also vibrate in different patterns. They don't produce different musical notes. Rather  they produce the different particles making up the world around us. So if these ideas are correct  this is what the ultra microscopic landscape of the universe looks like. It's built up of a huge number of these little tiny filaments of vibrating energy  vibrating in different frequencies. The different frequencies produce the different particles. The different particles are responsible for all the richness in the world around us. And there you see unification  because matter particles  electrons and quarks  radiation particles  photons  gravitons  are all built up from one entity. So matter and the forces of nature all are put together under the rubric of vibrating strings. And that's what we mean by a unified theory. Now here is the catch. When you study the mathematics of string theory  you find that it doesn't work in a universe that just has three dimensions of space. It doesn't work in a universe with four dimensions of space  nor five  nor six. Finally  you can study the equations  and show that it works only in a universe that has    dimensions of space and one dimension of time. It leads us right back to this idea of Kaluza and Klein    that our world  when appropriately described  has more dimensions than the ones that we see. Now you might think about that and say  well  OK  you know  if you have extra dimensions  and they're really tightly curled up  yeah  perhaps we won't see them  if they're small enough. But if there's a little tiny civilization of green people walking around down there  and you make them small enough  and we won't see them either. That is true. One of the other predictions of string theory    no  that's not one of the other predictions of string theory. But it raises the question  are we just trying to hide away these extra dimensions  or do they tell us something about the world  In the remaining time  I'd like to tell you two features of them. First is  many of us believe that these extra dimensions hold the answer to what perhaps is the deepest question in theoretical physics  theoretical science. And that question is this  when we look around the world  as scientists have done for the last hundred years  there appear to be about    numbers that really describe our universe. These are numbers like the mass of the particles  like electrons and quarks  the strength of gravity  the strength of the electromagnetic force    a list of about    numbers that have been measured with incredible precision  but nobody has an explanation for why the numbers have the particular values that they do. Now  does string theory offer an answer  Not yet. But we believe the answer for why those numbers have the values they do may rely on the form of the extra dimensions. And the wonderful thing is  if those numbers had any other values than the known ones  the universe  as we know it  wouldn't exist. This is a deep question. Why are those numbers so finely tuned to allow stars to shine and planets to form  when we recognize that if you fiddle with those numbers    if I had    dials up here and I let you come up and fiddle with those numbers  almost any fiddling makes the universe disappear. So can we explain those    numbers  And string theory suggests that those    numbers have to do with the extra dimensions. Let me show you how. So when we talk about the extra dimensions in string theory  it's not one extra dimension  as in the older ideas of Kaluza and Klein. This is what string theory says about the extra dimensions. They have a very rich  intertwined geometry. This is an example of something known as a Calabi Yau shape    name isn't all that important. But  as you can see  the extra dimensions fold in on themselves and intertwine in a very interesting shape  interesting structure. And the idea is that if this is what the extra dimensions look like  then the microscopic landscape of our universe all around us would look like this on the tiniest of scales. When you swing your hand  you'd be moving around these extra dimensions over and over again  but they're so small that we wouldn't know it. So what is the physical implication  though  relevant to those    numbers  Consider this. If you look at the instrument  a French horn  notice that the vibrations of the airstreams are affected by the shape of the instrument. Now in string theory  all the numbers are reflections of the way strings can vibrate. So just as those airstreams are affected by the twists and turns in the instrument  strings themselves will be affected by the vibrational patterns in the geometry within which they are moving. So let me bring some strings into the story. And if you watch these little fellows vibrating around    they'll be there in a second    right there  notice that they way they vibrate is affected by the geometry of the extra dimensions. So  if we knew exactly what the extra dimensions look like    we don't yet  but if we did    we should be able to calculate the allowed notes  the allowed vibrational patterns. And if we could calculate the allowed vibrational patterns  we should be able to calculate those    numbers. And if the answer that we get from our calculations agrees with the values of those numbers that have been determined through detailed and precise experimentation  this in many ways would be the first fundamental explanation for why the structure of the universe is the way it is. Now  the second issue that I want to finish up with is  how might we test for these extra dimensions more directly  Is this just an interesting mathematical structure that might be able to explain some previously unexplained features of the world  or can we actually test for these extra dimensions  And we think    and this is  I think  very exciting    that in the next five years or so we may be able to test for the existence of these extra dimensions. Here's how it goes. In CERN  Geneva  Switzerland  a machine is being built called the Large Hadron Collider. It's a machine that will send particles around a tunnel  opposite directions  near the speed of light. Every so often those particles will be aimed at each other  so there's a head on collision. The hope is that if the collision has enough energy  it may eject some of the debris from the collision from our dimensions  forcing it to enter into the other dimensions. How would we know it  Well  we'll measure the amount of energy after the collision  compare it to the amount of energy before  and if there's less energy after the collision than before  this will be evidence that the energy has drifted away. And if it drifts away in the right pattern that we can calculate  this will be evidence that the extra dimensions are there. Let me show you that idea visually. So  imagine we have a certain kind of particle called a graviton    that's the kind of debris we expect to be ejected out  if the extra dimensions are real. But here's how the experiment will go. You take these particles. You slam them together. You slam them together  and if we are right  some of the energy of that collision will go into debris that flies off into these extra dimensions. So this is the kind of experiment that we'll be looking at in the next five  seven to    years or so. And if this experiment bears fruit  if we see that kind of particle ejected by noticing that there's less energy in our dimensions than when we began  this will show that the extra dimensions are real. And to me this is a really remarkable story  and a remarkable opportunity. Going back to Newton with absolute space    didn't provide anything but an arena  a stage in which the events of the universe take place. Einstein comes along and says  well  space and time can warp and curve    that's what gravity is. And now string theory comes along and says  yes  gravity  quantum mechanics  electromagnetism  all together in one package  but only if the universe has more dimensions than the ones that we see. And this is an experiment that may test for them in our lifetime. Amazing possibility. Thank you very much. This is the Large Hadron Collider. It's    kilometers in circumference. It's the biggest scientific experiment ever attempted. Over        physicists and engineers from    countries around the world have come together over several decades to build this machine. What we do is we accelerate protons    so  hydrogen nuclei    around   .       percent the speed of light. Right  At that speed  they go around that    kilometers        times a second. And we collide them with another beam of protons going in the opposite direction. We collide them inside giant detectors. They're essentially digital cameras. And this is the one that I work on  ATLAS. You get some sense of the size    you can just see these EU standard size people underneath. You get some sense of the size     meters wide     meters in diameter        tons. And we re create the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began up to     million times a second inside that detector    immense numbers. And if you see those metal bits there    those are huge magnets that bend electrically charged particles  so it can measure how fast they're traveling. This is a picture about a year ago. Those magnets are in there. And  again  a EU standard size  real person  so you get some sense of the scale. And it's in there that those mini Big Bangs will be created  sometime in the summer this year. And actually  this morning  I got an email saying that we've just finished  today  building the last piece of ATLAS. So as of today  it's finished. I'd like to say that I planned that for TED  but I didn't. So it's been completed as of today. Yeah  it's a wonderful achievement. So  you might be asking   Why  Why create the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began   Well  particle physicists are nothing if not ambitious. And the aim of particle physics is to understand what everything's made of  and how everything sticks together. And by everything I mean  of course  me and you  the Earth  the Sun  the     billion suns in our galaxy and the     billion galaxies in the observable universe. Absolutely everything. Now you might say   Well  OK  but why not just look at it  You know  If you want to know what I'm made of  let's look at me.  Well  we found that as you look back in time  the universe gets hotter and hotter  denser and denser  and simpler and simpler. Now  there's no real reason I'm aware of for that  but that seems to be the case. So  way back in the early times of the universe  we believe it was very simple and understandable. All this complexity  all the way to these wonderful things    human brains    are a property of an old and cold and complicated universe. Back at the start  in the first billionth of a second  we believe  or we've observed  it was very simple. It's almost like ... imagine a snowflake in your hand  and you look at it  and it's an incredibly complicated  beautiful object. But as you heat it up  it'll melt into a pool of water  and you would be able to see that  actually  it was just made of H    water. So it's in that same sense that we look back in time to understand what the universe is made of. And  as of today  it's made of these things. Just    particles of matter  stuck together by four forces of nature. The quarks  these pink things  are the things that make up protons and neutrons that make up the atomic nuclei in your body. The electron    the thing that goes around the atomic nucleus    held around in orbit  by the way  by the electromagnetic force that's carried by this thing  the photon. The quarks are stuck together by other things called gluons. And these guys  here  they're the weak nuclear force  probably the least familiar. But  without it  the sun wouldn't shine. And when the sun shines  you get copious quantities of these things  called neutrinos  pouring out. Actually  if you just look at your thumbnail    about a square centimeter    there are something like    billion neutrinos per second from the sun  passing through every square centimeter of your body. But you don't feel them  because the weak force is correctly named    very short range and very weak  so they just fly through you. And these particles have been discovered over the last century  pretty much. The first one  the electron  was discovered in       and the last one  this thing called the tau neutrino  in the year     . Actually just    I was going to say  just up the road in Chicago. I know it's a big country  America  isn't it  Just up the road. Relative to the universe  it's just up the road. So  this thing was discovered in the year       so it's a relatively recent picture. One of the wonderful things  actually  I find  is that we've discovered any of them  when you realize how tiny they are. You know  they're a step in size from the entire observable universe. So      billion galaxies    .  billion light years away    a step in size from that to Monterey  actually  is about the same as from Monterey to these things. Absolutely  exquisitely minute  and yet we've discovered pretty much the full set. So  one of my most illustrious forebears at Manchester University  Ernest Rutherford  discoverer of the atomic nucleus  once said   All science is either physics or stamp collecting.  Now  I don't think he meant to insult the rest of science  although he was from New Zealand  so it's possible. But what he meant was that what we've done  really  is stamp collect there. OK  we've discovered the particles  but unless you understand the underlying reason for that pattern    you know  why it's built the way it is    really you've done stamp collecting. You haven't done science. Fortunately  we have probably one of the greatest scientific achievements of the twentieth century that underpins that pattern. It's the Newton's laws  if you want  of particle physics. It's called the standard model    beautifully simple mathematical equation. You could stick it on the front of a T shirt  which is always the sign of elegance. This is it. I've been a little disingenuous  because I've expanded it out in all its gory detail. This equation  though  allows you to calculate everything    other than gravity    that happens in the universe. So  you want to know why the sky is blue  why atomic nuclei stick together    in principle  you've got a big enough computer    why DNA is the shape it is. In principle  you should be able to calculate it from that equation. But there's a problem. Can anyone see what it is  A bottle of champagne for anyone that tells me. I'll make it easier  actually  by blowing one of the lines up. Basically  each of these terms refers to some of the particles. So those Ws there refer to the Ws  and how they stick together. These carriers of the weak force  the Zs  the same. But there's an extra symbol in this equation  H. Right  H. H stands for Higgs particle. Higgs particles have not been discovered. But they're necessary  they're necessary to make that mathematics work. So all the exquisitely detailed calculations we can do with that wonderful equation wouldn't be possible without an extra bit. So it's a prediction  a prediction of a new particle. What does it do  Well  we had a long time to come up with good analogies. And back in the     s  when we wanted the money for the LHC from the U.K. government  Margaret Thatcher  at the time  said   If you guys can explain  in language a politician can understand  what the hell it is that you're doing  you can have the money. I want to know what this Higgs particle does.  And we came up with this analogy  and it seemed to work. Well  what the Higgs does is  it gives mass to the fundamental particles. And the picture is that the whole universe    and that doesn't mean just space  it means me as well  and inside you    the whole universe is full of something called a Higgs field. Higgs particles  if you will. The analogy is that these people in a room are the Higgs particles. Now when a particle moves through the universe  it can interact with these Higgs particles. But imagine someone who's not very popular moves through the room. Then everyone ignores them. They can just pass through the room very quickly  essentially at the speed of light. They're massless. And imagine someone incredibly important and popular and intelligent walks into the room. They're surrounded by people  and their passage through the room is impeded. It's almost like they get heavy. They get massive. And that's exactly the way the Higgs mechanism works. The picture is that the electrons and the quarks in your body and in the universe that we see around us are heavy  in a sense  and massive  because they're surrounded by Higgs particles. They're interacting with the Higgs field. If that picture's true  then we have to discover those Higgs particles at the LHC. If it's not true    because it's quite a convoluted mechanism  although it's the simplest we've been able to think of    then whatever does the job of the Higgs particles we know have to turn up at the LHC. So  that's one of the prime reasons we built this giant machine. I'm glad you recognize Margaret Thatcher. Actually  I thought about making it more culturally relevant  but    anyway. So that's one thing. That's essentially a guarantee of what the LHC will find. There are many other things. You've heard many of the big problems in particle physics. One of them you heard about  dark matter  dark energy. There's another issue  which is that the forces in nature    it's quite beautiful  actually    seem  as you go back in time  they seem to change in strength. Well  they do change in strength. So  the electromagnetic force  the force that holds us together  gets stronger as you go to higher temperatures. The strong force  the strong nuclear force  which sticks nuclei together  gets weaker. And what you see is the standard model    you can calculate how these change    is the forces  the three forces  other than gravity  almost seem to come together at one point. It's almost as if there was one beautiful kind of super force  back at the beginning of time. But they just miss. Now there's a theory called super symmetry  which doubles the number of particles in the standard model  which  at first sight  doesn't sound like a simplification. But actually  with this theory  we find that the forces of nature do seem to unify together  back at the Big Bang    absolutely beautiful prophecy. The model wasn't built to do that  but it seems to do it. Also  those super symmetric particles are very strong candidates for the dark matter. So a very compelling theory that's really mainstream physics. And if I was to put money on it  I would put money on    in a very unscientific way    that that these things would also crop up at the LHC. Many other things that the LHC could discover. But in the last few minutes  I just want to give you a different perspective of what I think    what particle physics really means to me    particle physics and cosmology. And that's that I think it's given us a wonderful narrative    almost a creation story  if you'd like    about the universe  from modern science over the last few decades. And I'd say that it deserves  in the spirit of Wade Davis' talk  to be at least put up there with these wonderful creation stories of the peoples of the high Andes and the frozen north. This is a creation story  I think  equally as wonderful. The story goes like this  we know that the universe began   .  billion years ago  in an immensely hot  dense state  much smaller than a single atom. It began to expand about a million  billion  billion  billion billionth of a second    I think I got that right    after the Big Bang. Gravity separated away from the other forces. The universe then underwent an exponential expansion called inflation. In about the first billionth of a second or so  the Higgs field kicked in  and the quarks and the gluons and the electrons that make us up got mass. The universe continued to expand and cool. After about a few minutes  there was hydrogen and helium in the universe. That's all. The universe was about    percent hydrogen     percent helium. It still is today. It continued to expand about     million years. Then light began to travel through the universe. It was big enough to be transparent to light  and that's what we see in the cosmic microwave background that George Smoot described as looking at the face of God. After about     million years  the first stars formed  and that hydrogen  that helium  then began to cook into the heavier elements. So the elements of life    carbon  and oxygen and iron  all the elements that we need to make us up    were cooked in those first generations of stars  which then ran out of fuel  exploded  threw those elements back into the universe. They then re collapsed into another generation of stars and planets. And on some of those planets  the oxygen  which had been created in that first generation of stars  could fuse with hydrogen to form water  liquid water on the surface. On at least one  and maybe only one of those planets  primitive life evolved  which evolved over millions of years into things that walked upright and left footprints about three and a half million years ago in the mud flats of Tanzania  and eventually left a footprint on another world. And built this civilization  this wonderful picture  that turned the darkness into light  and you can see the civilization from space. As one of my great heroes  Carl Sagan  said  these are the things    and actually  not only these  but I was looking around    these are the things  like Saturn V rockets  and Sputnik  and DNA  and literature and science    these are the things that hydrogen atoms do when given   .  billion years. Absolutely remarkable. And  the laws of physics. Right  So  the right laws of physics    they're beautifully balanced. If the weak force had been a little bit different  then carbon and oxygen wouldn't be stable inside the hearts of stars  and there would be none of that in the universe. And I think that's a wonderful and significant story.    years ago  I couldn't have told that story  because we didn't know it. It makes me really feel that that civilization    which  as I say  if you believe the scientific creation story  has emerged purely as a result of the laws of physics  and a few hydrogen atoms    then I think  to me anyway  it makes me feel incredibly valuable. So that's the LHC. The LHC is certainly  when it turns on in summer  going to write the next chapter of that book. And I'm certainly looking forward with immense excitement to it being turned on.

I am wearing the Al Gore in ear monitors he wore on the Larry King show and I'm hearing that transmission and not mine. But I guess that's in keeping  so now we'll just move to the PowerPoint presentation  ladies and gentlemen. This is a brand new song. In the spirit of TED  we're bringing you something that has not been released. John  do you want to introduce the song  This is a song about a creature called a hummingbird moth which imitates another creature which imitates yet another creature. It's completely fucked up and can only be explained in song.   Everyone is crying at the dread hypnotic flying     of the bee of the bird of the moth.     You can't walk  you can't ramble     'cause you're gonna have to scramble     from the bee of the bird of the moth.     Catbird is a cat     but he's got bugness in his veins.     Manhouse lives within himself     with thoughtful human brains.     Neither one is equal      to the challenge of the freak we'll call     the bee of the bird of the moth.     Now the moth     defeats the mouse and man.     It's messing with the plan.     It can't be believed     'cause it's just a hummingbird moth     who's acting like the bird     that thinks it's a bee.     Got a brand new shipment     of electrical equipment     it's addressed to the bottom of the sea.     Send a tangerine colored     nuclear submarine     with a sticker that says STP.     Windshield wiper washer fluid     spraying in the air ...     headlights under head lice     under hats lie everywhere.     Subatomic waves     to the underwater caves     of the bee of the bird of the moth.     Now the moth defeats the mouse and man.     It's messing with the plan.     It can't be believed     'cause it's just a hummingbird moth     who's acting like a bird     that thinks it's a bee.     Is it us or is this messed up      Everyone's deforming     in the presence of the swarming     of the bee of the bird of the moth.     Protozoa  snakes and horses     have enlisted in the forces     of the bee of bird of the moth.     Catbug is a cat     but he's got bugness in his veins.     Manhouse lives within himself     with thoughtful human brains.     Neither one is equal     to the challenge of the freak we'll call     the bee of the bird of the moth.   Thanks a lot. Thank you very much. So we are past our      th show. Probably somewhere around      . It's hard to know. We've only done two shows in      so far  but our first show was actually the coldest performance we've ever had. It was    degrees in St. Louis about a month ago and I'm happy to report that this performance you are seeing today is the earliest we have ever performed. So thank you. We are cultural test pilots  ladies and gentlemen. How early can a rock performance begin  Not all the facts are in about performing at  .   in the morning. I can tell you the    degree thing was fantastic. All right. So we don't know that much about the history of violinists but we do know that when we entered the state of New Jersey there is an uptick in violence. This song is called  Asbury Park.  It's based on a real life experience.   I     I got     I got kicked     I got kicked in the head     backstage at the Stone.     Stone Pone.     Stone Pony.     I got kicked in the head     backstage at the Stone Pony     where I swore to the guy     that the guy who took his beer wasn't me.     Me got     Me got kicked     Me got kicked in the head     backstage at the Stone.     Stone Pone.     Stone Pony.     Me got kicked in the head     backstage at the Stone Pony     where I swore to the guy     that the guy who took his beer     was a guy dressed like me.     Not me      Not me      Not me    Thank you. Marty Beller on the drums over there. We want to get in as many songs as possible during our brief time here so this is the one to play. This song is called  Fingertips.    Everything is catching on fire     Yes  everything is catching on fire     Yes  everything is catching on fire.     Fingertips     Fingertips     Fingertips     I hear the wind blow     I hear the wind blow     It seems to say     Hello     Hello     I'm the one who loves you so.     Hey  now everybody  now.

We're taking calls    from the dead.     We're taking phone calls from the dead.     They're calling from beyond the grave.     Beyond the grave.     They have some questions     And things to share     From underneath the cold  cold ground.   We're soliciting phone calls from dead people as a special TED presentation. We're taking calls live on stage here at TED in Monterey. And I think we have a caller coming in here. Hello there. You're live. Hello. Who's there  please  Am I on the air  Hi there. You're on with They Might Be Giants. This is Eleanor Roosevelt. Hello  Eleanor  please ... I want to talk to ... Please turn off your radio  Eleanor. I wanna talk to Randi. I've got a question for Randi. What's your question  please  I want to talk to the Amazing Randi. Do you have a laminated badge  Eleanor  I want my million dollars. Eleanor  I'm sorry  do you have a laminated badge  No  I don't have a badge. Well  I think we're going to stop that part of the show. Here's a song we like to think of as the future anthem of TED. It's actually a children's song but like so many projects for children it's really just a Trojan horse for adult work. This song is called  The Alphabet ...

Have a great session. Thank you all. You know  one of the things that I'd like to say upfront is that I'm really here by accident. And what I mean    not at TED    that I'm    at this point in my life  truly my set of circumstances I would truly consider an accident. But what I'd like to talk to you about today is perhaps a way in which we could use technology to make those accidents happen often. Because I really think  when I look back at how I actually ended up in this accident  technology played a big role in that. So  what I'd like to do today is tell you a little bit about myself  because I'd like to put in context what I'm going to tell you. And I think you will see why the two greatest passions in my life today are children and education. And once I put that in context  I'd like to tell you a little bit about technology  why I believe technology is a tremendous enabler  a very powerful tool to help address some of these challenges. Then  about the initiative that Chris mentioned  that we decided to launch at AMD that we call   x  . And then I'll come back to the beginning  and tell you a little bit more    hopefully convince you    that I believe that in today's world  it is really important for business leaders not only to have an idea of what their business is all about  but to have a passion for something that is meaningful. So  with that in mind  first of all let me tell you  I'm one of five children. I'm the oldest  the other four are women. So I grew up in a family of women. I learned a lot about how to deal with that part of the world. And  as you can imagine  if you can picture this  I was born in a very small village in Mexico  in  unfortunately  very poor surroundings  and my parents did not have a college education. But I was fortunate to be able to have one  and so were my four sisters. That kind of tells you a little bit of an idea of the emphasis that my parents placed on education. My parents were fanatics about learning  and I'll come back to that a little bit later. But one of the things that exposed me early to learning  and a tremendous curiosity that was instilled in me as a child  was through a technology which is on the screen    is a Victrola. My father found that in a junkyard  and was able to repair it and make it work. And somehow    to this day  I frankly don't know how he was so aware of what was going on in the world    but  by inviting me to sit down with him when I was only a few years old  and playing records in this Victrola by Mozart  and he would tell me how Mozart was the most romantic of all the classic composers ever  and how Claire de Lune  which was one of his favorites  was a real exposure to me to classical music. He explained to me about Johann Strauss  and how he created the waltzes that became so famous in the world. And would tell me a little bit about history too  when he'd play the      Overture by Tchaikovsky on this little Victrola  and he would tell me about Russia and all the things that were happening in Russia at those times and why this music  in some way  represented a little bit of that history. And even as a child  he was able to instill in me a lot of curiosity. And perhaps to you this product may not look like high tech  but if you can imagine the time when this occurred    it was in the mid '  s    this was really  in his view  a pretty piece of high tech. Well  one of the things that is really critical to try to distill from that experience is that in addition to that  people ask me and say   Well  how did your parents treat you when you were a child   And I always said that they were really tough on me. And not tough in the sense that most people think of  where your parents yell at you or hit you or whatever. They were tough in the sense that  as I grew up  both my mother and father would always say to me  it's really important that you always remember two things. First of all  when you go to bed at night  you've got to look back on the day and make sure that you felt the day was a day which you contributed something  and that you did everything you could to do it the best way you could. And the second thing they said  and we trust you  that no matter where you are or where you go  you will always do the right thing. Now  I don't know how many of you have ever done that with your kids  but if you do  please trust me  it's the most pressure you can put on a child  to say       we trust you that you will always do the right thing. When I was out with my friends drinking beer  I always was very aware of those words       and very careful. One of the things that has happened with technology is that it can only be helpful if it is useful  of course  but it can only be helpful too if it's accessible  and it can only be helpful if it's affordable. And in today's world  being useful  affordable and accessible is not necessarily what happens in a lot of the technology that is done today. So  one of our passions in our company  and now one of my personal passions  is to be able to really work hard at making the technology useful  accessible and affordable. And to me  that is very  very critical. Now  technology has changed a lot since the Victrola days. You know  we now have  of course  incredibly powerful computers. A tremendous thing that people refer to as a killer app is called the Internet. Although frankly speaking  we don't believe the Internet is the killer app. What we believe is that the Internet  frankly  is a connection of people and ideas. The Internet happens to be just the medium in which those people and ideas get connected. And the power of connecting people and ideas can be pretty awesome. And so  we believe that through all the changes that have occurred  that we're faced today with a tremendous opportunity. If we can connect people and ideas more intensely    and although you've seen a plethora and a myriad of products that have come to the market today  the key to me is how many of these products are able to provide people connectivity  in a useful way  accessibility  in an easy manner  and also affordability  that regardless of the economic status that a person could have  that they could have the opportunity to afford this technology. So  when you look at that  we said  well  we would like to  then  enable that a little bit. We would like to create an initiative. And a couple of years ago at AMD  we came up with this idea of saying  what if we create this initiative we call   x    where we are going to aim  that by the year       half of the world will be connected to the Internet so that people and ideas can get connected. We knew we couldn't do it by ourselves  and by no means did we ever intend to imply that we at AMD could do it alone. We always felt that this was something that could be done through partnerships with governments  industry  educational institutions  a myriad of other companies and  frankly  even competitors. So  it is really a rather lofty initiative  if you want to think that way  but we felt that we had to put a real stake up in the years ahead  that was bold enough and courageous enough that it would force us all to think of ways to do things differently. And I'll come back to that in a minute  because I think the results so far have been remarkable  and I can only anticipate and get real excited about what I think is going to happen in the next eight years  while we get to the      initiative. Where are we today  That's year by year. This comes from our friends at Gapminder.com. Those of you who've never looked at their website  you should look at it. It's really impressive. And you can see how the Internet penetration has changed over the years. And so when we gave ourselves this scorecard to say well  where are we related to our goal towards       the thing that becomes apparent is three pieces. One is the Western world  defined mostly by Western Europe and the United States  has made an awful lot of progress. The connectivity in these parts of the world are really truly phenomenal and continue to increase. As a matter of fact  we think reaching     percent is very doable  even before the      timeframe. In other parts of emerging countries  such as India and China  the progress has been good    has been solid  has been good. But in places that are not as developed  places like Africa  Latin America and other places in the world  the progress has been rather slow. As a matter of fact  I was just recently visiting South Africa. I had the opportunity to have a discussion with President Mbeki  and one of the things that we talked about is  what is it that's keeping this connectivity goal from moving ahead faster  And one of the reasons is  in South Africa  it costs     dollars a month to have a broadband connectivity. It is impossible  even in the United States  for that cost  to be able to enable the connectivity that we're all trying to reach. So  we talked about ways in which perhaps one could partner to be able to bring the cost of this technology down. So  when you look at this chart  you look at the very last    it's a logarithmic chart on a horizontal scale    you look at the very end  we've got quite a long way to go to get to the      goal of    percent. But we're excited in our company  we're motivated. We really think it's a phenomenal driver of things  to force us to do things differently  and we look forward to being able to actually  working with so many partners around the world  to be able to reach that goal. Now  one of the things I'd like to explain  about    x    which I think is really critical  is that it is not a charity. It is actually a business venture. Let's take a small segment of this  of this unconnected world  and call it the education market. When you look at elementary school children  we have hundreds and hundreds of millions of children around the world that could benefit tremendously from being able to be connected to the Internet. Therefore  when we see that  we see an opportunity to have a business that addresses the need of that segment. And when we embarked in this initiative  from the very beginning we said it very clearly  this is not a charity. This is really a business venture  one that addresses a very challenging segment of the market. Because what we have learned in the last three years is that this segment of the market  whether it's education or under developed nations  either way  it's a segment that demands incredibly high quality  incredibly high reliability  tremendous low cost and access  and a lot of challenges that frankly  without actually doing it  it would be very difficult to understand  and I'll explain that in just a minute. It is an initiative that is focused on simple  accessible and human centric solutions. What we mean by that is  you know  frankly  the PC was invented in       roughly speaking more or less  and for    odd years  it hasn't changed. It is still  in most places  a gray or black box  and it looks the same. And frankly    and I know that sometimes I offend some of my customers when I say this  but I truly mean it    if you could take the name of the computer off the top of it  it would be very difficult to judge who made it  because they're all highly commoditized but they're all different. So  there has not been a human centric approach to addressing this segment of the market  so we really believe it is critical to think of it. It reminded me a lot of the talk we heard this morning  about this operating room machinery that was designed specifically for Africa. We're talking about something very similar here. And it has to be based on a geo sensitive approach. What I mean by that is that in some parts of the world  the government plays a key role in the development of technology. In other parts  it doesn't. In other parts of the world  you have an infrastructure that allows for manufacturing to take place. In other parts  it doesn't. And then we have to be sensitive about how this technology can be developed and put into action in those regions. And the last piece  which is really important    and this is an opinion that we have  not shared by many  this is one where we seem to stand alone  on this one    is that we really believe that the greatest success of this initiative can come by fostering local  integrated  end to end ecosystems. What I mean by that  and let me use this example  the country of South Africa  because I was just there  therefore I'm a little bit familiar with some of the challenges they have. It's a country of    million people. It's an economy that's emerging. It's beginning to grow tremendously. They have an objective to lowering the cost of connectivity. They have a computer company that makes computers in South Africa. They're developing a software training environment in their universities. What a place  what an ideal place to create an ecosystem that could build the hardware and the software needed for their schools. And to my surprise  I learned in South Africa they have    dialects  I always thought they only had two    English and Afrikaans    but it turns out they have    dialects. And to be able to meet the needs of this rather complex educational system  it could only be done from inside. I don't think this segment of the market can be addressed by companies parachuting from another place of the world  and just dumping product and selling into the markets. So  we believe that in those regions of the world where the population is large  and there's an infrastructure that can provide it  that a local  integrated  end to end system is really critical for its success. This is a picture of a classroom that we outfitted with computers in Mexico  in my home country. This particular classroom happens to be in the state of Michoacan. Those of you that might be familiar with Mexico    Michoacan is a very colorful state. Children dress with very colorful  colorful clothes  and it is incredible to see the power that this has in the hands of kids  in a computer. And I have to tell you that it's so easy to appreciate the impact that access to technology and connectivity can have in the lives and education of these kids. We just recently opened a learning laboratory in a school in the West Cape in South Africa  in a school that's called Nelson Mandela School  and when you see the faces and activities of these children being able to access computers  it's just phenomenal. And recently  they've written us letters  telling us how excited they are about the impact that this has had on their lives  on their educational dreams  on their capabilities  and it's just phenomenal. We have now deployed    different technologists in    different countries  and we have been able to connect millions of people in an effort to continue to learn what this particular segment of the market needs and demands. And I have to tell you that although millions doesn't sound like a lot in terms of the billions that need to be connected  it's a start. And we are learning a lot. And we're learning a tremendous amount about what we believe this segment needs to be able to be effective. One example of this has been the One Laptop per Child. Some of you are familiar with this. This is a partnership between MIT and a group of companies    Google is involved  Red Hat    and AMD is a key player. The electronics behind the One Laptop per Child are based on AMD technology  it's a microprocessor. But to give you an idea how creative this group of people can be  one of the objectives of the One Laptop per Child is to be able to achieve a    hour battery life. Because it was felt that a school day would last at least eight hours  and you wanted the child to have the ability to use the laptop for at least one full day without having to recharge it. The engineers have done a phenomenal amount of innovation on this part  and battery life on this product is now    hours    just through a lot of innovative work people have done because they're passionate and motivated to be able to do this. We expect this to be deployed towards the end of this year  and we're very excited at the opportunities that this is going to offer in the field of education. It's a highly focused product aimed at strictly the education market  not only in the developing countries  but actually in the developed regions as well  because there are parts of the United States where this can have also a huge impact on the ability to make education more fun and more efficient. We also have partnered with TED in this project  with Architecture for Humanity  and along with the TED Prize winner Cameron Sinclair  we're having a contest that we have issued to the architectural community to come up with the best design for a computer lab for an emerging region. And we're really thrilled about the opportunity to be part of this  and can't wait to see what comes out of this exciting  exciting activity. Let me come back to the beginning  to end this presentation. I'll tell you that one of the things that I feel is really critical for us in industry  in business  is to be able to be passionate about solving these problems. I don't think it's enough to be able to put them on a spreadsheet  and look at numbers and say  yes  that's a good business. I really believe that you have to have a passion for it. And one of the things that I learned  too  from my parents    and I'll give you a little anecdote    especially from my father. And it took me a while to understand it  but he said to me  when I went to college  he said   You're the first person in the family to go to college. And it's really important you understand that for civilization to make progress  each generation has to do better than the last one. And therefore  this is your opportunity to do better than my generation.  Frankly  I don't know that I really understood what he told me at the time. I was eager to go off to college  and go find girls  and study  and girls  and study  but then I finished college and I fell in love. I graduated. I decided to get married. And on my wedding day  my father came to me again and said   You know  I'm going to remind you again  that each generation has to do better than the last one. You have to be a better husband than I was  because that's how you make progress.  And now he began to make sense. Because I knew what a great husband he was  and now he was once again beginning to put pressure on me  like he did when I was a little kid. And then a few years later  I had a child  my first child  and again  my father comes to the hospital  and we're looking at the glass  and see all the children on the other side  and he said   I've got to remind you again  that for each generation to do better  you're going to have to be a better father than I was.  That's when it dawned on me the tremendous challenge that he was placing on me  because he was a great father. But the key is that he instilled in me a passion to really get up every day in the morning and want to do better  to really get up and think that my role in life is not just to be the CEO of a Fortune     company. It's got to be that someday I can look back  and this place is truly better through some small contribution that perhaps each of us could make. Thank you very much. I love a challenge  and saving the Earth is probably a good one. We all know the Earth is in trouble. We have now entered in the  X  the sixth major extinction on this planet. I often wondered  if there was a United Organization of Organisms    otherwise known as  Uh Oh     would we be voted on the planet  or off the planet  I think that vote is occurring right now. I want to present to you a suite of six mycological solutions  using fungi  and these solutions are based on mycelium. The mycelium infuses all landscapes  it holds soils together  it's extremely tenacious. This holds up to        times its mass. They're the grand molecular disassemblers of nature    the soil magicians. They generate the humus soils across the landmasses of Earth. We have now discovered that there is a multi directional transfer of nutrients between plants  mitigated by the mcyelium    so the mycelium is the mother that is giving nutrients from alder and birch trees to hemlocks  cedars and Douglas firs. Dusty and I  we like to say  on Sunday  this is where we go to church. I'm in love with the old growth forest  and I'm a patriotic American because we have those. Most of you are familiar with Portobello mushrooms. And frankly  I face a big obstacle. When I mention mushrooms to somebody  they immediately think Portobellos or magic mushrooms  their eyes glaze over  and they think I'm a little crazy. So  I hope to pierce that prejudice forever with this group. We call it mycophobia  the irrational fear of the unknown  when it comes to fungi. Mushrooms are very fast in their growth. Day     day     day   . Mushrooms produce strong antibiotics. In fact  we're more closely related to fungi than we are to any other kingdom. A group of    eukaryotic microbiologists published a paper two years ago erecting opisthokonta    a super kingdom that joins animalia and fungi together. We share in common the same pathogens. Fungi don't like to rot from bacteria  and so our best antibiotics come from fungi. But here is a mushroom that's past its prime. After they sporulate  they do rot. But I propose to you that the sequence of microbes that occur on rotting mushrooms are essential for the health of the forest. They give rise to the trees  they create the debris fields that feed the mycelium. And so we see a mushroom here sporulating. And the spores are germinating  and the mycelium forms and goes underground. In a single cubic inch of soil  there can be more than eight miles of these cells. My foot is covering approximately     miles of mycelium. This is photomicrographs from Nick Read and Patrick Hickey. And notice that as the mycelium grows  it conquers territory and then it begins the net. I've been a scanning electron microscopist for many years  I have thousands of electron micrographs  and when I'm staring at the mycelium  I realize that they are microfiltration membranes. We exhale carbon dioxide  so does mycelium. It inhales oxygen  just like we do. But these are essentially externalized stomachs and lungs. And I present to you a concept that these are extended neurological membranes. And in these cavities  these micro cavities form  and as they fuse soils  they absorb water. These are little wells. And inside these wells  then microbial communities begin to form. And so the spongy soil not only resists erosion  but sets up a microbial universe that gives rise to a plurality of other organisms. I first proposed  in the early     s  that mycelium is Earth's natural Internet. When you look at the mycelium  they're highly branched. And if there's one branch that is broken  then very quickly  because of the nodes of crossing    Internet engineers maybe call them hot points    there are alternative pathways for channeling nutrients and information. The mycelium is sentient. It knows that you are there. When you walk across landscapes  it leaps up in the aftermath of your footsteps trying to grab debris. So  I believe the invention of the computer Internet is an inevitable consequence of a previously proven  biologically successful model. The Earth invented the computer Internet for its own benefit  and we now  being the top organism on this planet  are trying to allocate resources in order to protect the biosphere. Going way out  dark matter conforms to the same mycelial archetype. I believe matter begets life  life becomes single cells  single cells become strings  strings become chains  chains network. And this is the paradigm that we see throughout the universe. Most of you may not know that fungi were the first organisms to come to land. They came to land  .  billion years ago  and plants followed several hundred million years later. How is that possible  It's possible because the mycelium produces oxalic acids  and many other acids and enzymes  pockmarking rock and grabbing calcium and other minerals and forming calcium oxalates. Makes the rocks crumble  and the first step in the generation of soil. Oxalic acid is two carbon dioxide molecules joined together. So  fungi and mycelium sequester carbon dioxide in the form of calcium oxalates. And all sorts of other oxalates are also sequestering carbon dioxide through the minerals that are being formed and taken out of the rock matrix. This was first discovered in     . This is a photograph by Franz Hueber. This photograph's taken     s in Saudi Arabia.     million years ago  this organism existed. It was called Prototaxites. Prototaxites  laying down  was about three feet tall. The tallest plants on Earth at that time were less than two feet. Dr. Boyce  at the University of Chicago  published an article in the Journal of Geology this past year determining that Prototaxites was a giant fungus  a giant mushroom. Across the landscapes of Earth were dotted these giant mushrooms. All across most land masses. And these existed for tens of millions of years. Now  we've had several extinction events  and as we march forward       million years ago    most of you know about it    we had an asteroid impact. The Earth was struck by an asteroid  a huge amount of debris was jettisoned into the atmosphere. Sunlight was cut off  and fungi inherited the Earth. Those organisms that paired with fungi were rewarded  because fungi do not need light. More recently  at Einstein University  they just determined that fungi use radiation as a source of energy  much like plants use light. So  the prospect of fungi existing on other planets elsewhere  I think  is a forgone conclusion  at least in my own mind. The largest organism in the world is in Eastern Oregon. I couldn't miss it. It was       acres in size        acres in size        years old. The largest organism on the planet is a mycelial mat  one cell wall thick. How is it that this organism can be so large  and yet be one cell wall thick  whereas we have five or six skin layers that protect us  The mycelium  in the right conditions  produces a mushroom    it bursts through with such ferocity that it can break asphalt. We were involved with several experiments. I'm going to show you six  if I can  solutions for helping to save the world. Battelle Laboratories and I joined up in Bellingham  Washington. There were four piles saturated with diesel and other petroleum waste  one was a control pile  one pile was treated with enzymes  one pile was treated with bacteria  and our pile we inoculated with mushroom mycelium. The mycelium absorbs the oil. The mycelium is producing enzymes    peroxidases    that break carbon hydrogen bonds. These are the same bonds that hold hydrocarbons together. So  the mycelium becomes saturated with the oil  and then  when we returned six weeks later  all the tarps were removed  all the other piles were dead  dark and stinky. We came back to our pile  it was covered with hundreds of pounds of oyster mushrooms  and the color changed to a light form. The enzymes remanufactured the hydrocarbons into carbohydrates    fungal sugars. Some of these mushrooms are very happy mushrooms. They're very large. They're showing how much nutrition that they could've obtained. But something else happened  which was an epiphany in my life. They sporulated  the spores attract insects  the insects laid eggs  eggs became larvae. Birds then came  bringing in seeds  and our pile became an oasis of life. Whereas the other three piles were dead  dark and stinky  and the PAH's    the aromatic hydrocarbons    went from        parts per million to less than     in eight weeks. The last image we don't have. The entire pile was a green berm of life. These are gateway species  vanguard species that open the door for other biological communities. So I invented burlap sacks  bunker spawn    and putting the mycelium    using storm blown debris  you can take these burlap sacks and put them downstream from a farm that's producing E. coli  or other wastes  or a factory with chemical toxins  and it leads to habitat restoration. So  we set up a site in Mason County  Washington  and we've seen a dramatic decrease in the amount of coliforms. And I'll show you a graph here. This is a logarithmic scale     to the eighth power. There's more than a     million colonies per gram  and    to the third power is around      . In    hours to    hours  these three mushroom species reduced the amount of coliform bacteria        times. Think of the implications. This is a space conservative method that uses storm debris    and we can guarantee that we will have storms every year. So  this one mushroom  in particular  has drawn our interest over time. This is my wife Dusty  with a mushroom called Fomitopsis officinalis    Agarikon. It's a mushroom exclusive to the old growth forest that Dioscorides first described in    A.D. as a treatment against consumption. This mushroom grows in Washington State  Oregon  northern California  British Columbia  now thought to be extinct in Europe. May not seem that large    let's get closer. This is extremely rare fungus. Our team    and we have a team of experts that go out    we went out    times in the old growth forest last year. We found one sample to be able to get into culture. Preserving the genome of these fungi in the old growth forest I think is absolutely critical for human health. I've been involved with the U.S. Defense Department BioShield program. We submitted over     samples of mushrooms that were boiled in hot water  and mycelium harvesting these extracellular metabolites. And a few years ago  we received these results. We have three different strains of Agarikon mushrooms that were highly active against poxviruses. Dr. Earl Kern  who's a smallpox expert of the U.S. Defense Department  states that any compounds that have a selectivity index of two or more are active.    or greater are considered to be very active. Our mushroom strains were in the highly active range. There's a vetted press release that you can read    it's vetted by DOD    if you Google  Stamets  and  smallpox.  Or you can go to NPR.org and listen to a live interview. So  encouraged by this  naturally we went to flu viruses. And so  for the first time  I am showing this. We have three different strains of Agarikon mushrooms highly active against flu viruses. Here's the selectivity index numbers    against pox  you saw   s and   s    now against flu viruses  compared to the ribavirin controls  we have an extraordinarily high activity. And we're using a natural extract within the same dosage window as a pure pharmaceutical. We tried it against flu A viruses    H N   H N     as well as flu B viruses. So then we tried a blend  and in a blend combination we tried it against H N   and we got greater than       selectivity index. I then think that we can make the argument that we should save the old growth forest as a matter of national defense. I became interested in entomopathogenic fungi    fungi that kill insects. Our house was being destroyed by carpenter ants. So  I went to the EPA homepage  and they were recommending studies with metarhizium species of a group of fungi that kill carpenter ants  as well as termites. I did something that nobody else had done. I actually chased the mycelium  when it stopped producing spores. These are spores    this is in their spores. I was able to morph the culture into a non sporulating form. And so the industry has spent over     million dollars specifically on bait stations to prevent termites from eating your house. But the insects aren't stupid  and they would avoid the spores when they came close  and so I morphed the cultures into a non sporulating form. And I got my daughter's Barbie doll dish  I put it right where a bunch of carpenter ants were making debris fields  every day  in my house  and the ants were attracted to the mycelium  because there's no spores. They gave it to the queen. One week later  I had no sawdust piles whatsoever. And then    a delicate dance between dinner and death    the mycelium is consumed by the ants  they become mummified  and  boing  a mushroom pops out of their head. Now after sporulation  the spores repel. So  the house is no longer suitable for invasion. So  you have a near permanent solution for reinvasion of termites. And so my house came down  I received my first patent against carpenter ants  termites and fire ants. Then we tried extracts  and lo and behold  we can steer insects to different directions. This has huge implications. I then received my second patent    and this is a big one. It's been called an Alexander Graham Bell patent. It covers over         species. This is the most disruptive technology    I've been told by executives of the pesticide industry    that they have ever witnessed. This could totally revamp the pesticide industries throughout the world. You could fly     Ph.D. students under the umbrella of this concept  because my supposition is that entomopathogenic fungi  prior to sporulation  attract the very insects that are otherwise repelled by those spores. And so I came up with a Life Box  because I needed a delivery system. The Life Box    you're gonna be getting a DVD of the TED conference    you add soil  you add water  you have mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi as well as spores  like of the Agarikon mushroom. The seeds then are mothered by this mycelium. And then you put tree seeds in here  and then you end up growing    potentially    an old growth forest from a cardboard box. I want to reinvent the delivery system  and the use of cardboard around the world  so they become ecological footprints. If there's a YouTube like site that you could put up  you could make it interactive  zip code specific    where people could join together  and through satellite imaging systems  through Virtual Earth or Google Earth  you could confirm carbon credits are being sequestered by the trees that are coming through Life Boxes. You could take a cardboard box delivering shoes  you could add water    I developed this for the refugee community    corns  beans and squash and onions. I took several containers    my wife said  if I could do this  anybody could    and I ended up growing a seed garden. Then you harvest the seeds    and thank you  Eric Rasmussen  for your help on this    and then you're harvesting the seed garden. Then you can harvest the kernels  and then you just need a few kernels. I add mycelium to it  and then I inoculate the corncobs. Now  three corncobs  no other grain    lots of mushrooms begin to form. Too many withdrawals from the carbon bank  and so this population will be shut down. But watch what happens here. The mushrooms then are harvested  but very importantly  the mycelium has converted the cellulose into fungal sugars. And so I thought  how could we address the energy crisis in this country  And we came up with Econol. Generating ethanol from cellulose using mycelium as an intermediary    and you gain all the benefits that I've described to you already. But to go from cellulose to ethanol is ecologically unintelligent  and I think that we need to be econologically intelligent about the generation of fuels. So  we build the carbon banks on the planet  renew the soils. These are a species that we need to join with. I think engaging mycelium can help save the world. Thank you very much. What I'd like to do is just drag us all down into the gutter  and actually all the way down into the sewer because I want to talk about diarrhea. And in particular  I want to talk about the design of diarrhea. And when evolutionary biologists talk about design  they really mean design by natural selection. And that brings me to the title of the talk   Using Evolution to Design Disease Organisms Intelligently.  And I also have a little bit of a sort of smartass subtitle to this. But I'm not just doing this to be cute. I really think that this subtitle explains what somebody like me  who's sort of a Darwin wannabe  how they actually look at one's role in sort of coming into this field of health sciences and medicine. It's really not a very friendly field for evolutionary biologists. You actually see a great potential  but you see a lot of people who are sort of defending their turf  and may actually be very resistant  when one tries to introduce ideas. So  all of the talk today is going to deal with two general questions. One is that  why are some disease organisms more harmful  And a very closely related question  which is  how can we take control of this situation once we understand the answer to the first question  How can we make the harmful organisms more mild  And I'm going to be talking  to begin with  as I said  about diarrheal disease organisms. And the focus when I'm talking about the diarrheal organisms  as well as the focus when I'm talking about any organisms that cause acute infectious disease  is to think about the problem from a germ's point of view  germ's eye view. And in particular  to think about a fundamental idea which I think makes sense out of a tremendous amount of variation in the harmfulness of disease organisms. And that idea is that from the germ's eye point of view  disease organisms have to get from one host to another  and often they have to rely on the well being of the host to move them to another host. But not always. Sometimes  you get disease organisms that don't rely on host mobility at all for transmission. And when you have that  then evolutionary theory tells us that natural selection will favor the more exploitative  more predator like organisms. So  natural selection will favor organisms that are more likely to cause damage. If instead transmission to another host requires host mobility  then we expect that the winners of the competition will be the milder organisms. So  if the pathogen doesn't need the host to be healthy and active  and actual selection favors pathogens that take advantage of those hosts  the winners in the competition are those that exploit the hosts for their own reproductive success. But if the host needs to be mobile in order to transmit the pathogen  then it's the benign ones that tend to be the winners. So  I'm going to begin by applying this idea to diarrheal diseases. Diarrheal disease organisms get transmitted in basically three ways. They can be transmitted from person to person contact  person to food then to person contact  when somebody eats contaminated food  or they can be transmitted through the water. And when they're transmitted through the water  unlike the first two modes of transmission  these pathogens don't rely on a healthy host for transmission. A person can be sick in bed and still infect tens  even hundreds of other individuals. To sort of illustrate that  this diagram emphasizes that if you've got a sick person in bed  somebody's going to be taking out the contaminated materials. They're going to wash those contaminated materials  and then the water may move into sources of drinking water. People will come in to those places where you've got contaminated drinking water  bring things back to the family  may drink right at that point. The whole point is that a person who can't move can still infect many other individuals. And so  the theory tells us that when diarrheal disease organisms are transported by water  we expect them to be more predator like  more harmful. And you can test these ideas. So  one way you can test is just look at all diarrheal bacteria  and see whether or not the ones that tend to be more transmitted by water  tend to be more harmful. And the answer is    yep  they are. Now I put those names in there just for the bacteria buffs  but the main point here is that    there's a lot of them here  I can tell    the main point here is that those data points all show a very strong  positive association between the degree to which a disease organism is transmitted by water  and how harmful they are  how much death they cause per untreated infection. So this suggests we're on the right track. But this  to me  suggests that we really need to ask some additional questions. Remember the second question that I raised at the outset was  how can we use this knowledge to make disease organisms evolve to be mild  Now  this suggests that if you could just block waterborne transmission  you could cause disease organisms to shift from the right hand side of that graph to the left hand side of the graph. But it doesn't tell you how long. I mean  if this would require thousands of years  then it's worthless in terms of controlling of these pathogens. But if it could occur in just a few years  then it might be a very important way to control some of the nasty problems that we haven't been able to control. In other words  this suggests that we could domesticate these organisms. We could make them evolve to be not so harmful to us. And so  as I was thinking about this  I focused on this organism  which is the El Tor biotype of the organism called Vibrio cholerae. And that is the species of organism that is responsible for causing cholera. And the reason I thought this is a really great organism to look at is that we understand why it's so harmful. It's harmful because it produces a toxin  and that toxin is released when the organism gets into our intestinal tract. It causes fluid to flow from the cells that line our intestine into the lumen  the internal chamber of our intestine  and then that fluid goes the only way it can  which is out the other end. And it flushes out thousands of different other competitors that would otherwise make life difficult for the Vibrios. So what happens  if you've got an organism  it produces a lot of toxin. After a few days of infection you end up having    the fecal material really isn't so disgusting as we might imagine. It's sort of cloudy water. And if you took a drop of that water  you might find a million diarrheal organisms. If the organism produced a lot of toxin  you might find    million  or     million. If it didn't produce a lot of this toxin  then you might find a smaller number. So the task is to try to figure out how to determine whether or not you could get an organism like this to evolve towards mildness by blocking waterborne transmission  thereby allowing the organism only to be transmitted by person to person contact  or person food person contact    both of which would really require that people be mobile and fairly healthy for transmission. Now  I can think of some possible experiments. One would be to take a lot of different strains of this organism    some that produce a lot of toxins  some that produce a little    and take those strains and spew them out in different countries. Some countries that might have clean water supplies  so that you can't get waterborne transmission  you expect the organism to evolve to mildness there. Other countries  in which you've got a lot of waterborne transmission  there you expect these organisms to evolve towards a high level of harmfulness  right  There's a little ethical problem in this experiment. I was hoping to hear a few gasps at least. That makes me worry a little bit. But anyhow  the laughter makes me feel a little bit better. And this ethical problem's a big problem. Just to emphasize this  this is what we're really talking about. Here's a girl who's almost dead. She got rehydration therapy  she perked up  within a few days she was looking like a completely different person. So  we don't want to run an experiment like that. But interestingly  just that thing happened in     . In       this cholera organism got into Lima  Peru  and within two months it had spread to the neighboring areas. Now  I don't know how that happened  and I didn't have anything to do with it  I promise you. I don't think anybody knows  but I'm not averse to  once that's happened  to see whether or not the prediction that we would make  that I did make before  actually holds up. Did the organism evolve to mildness in a place like Chile  which has some of the most well protected water supplies in Latin America  And did it evolve to be more harmful in a place like Ecuador  which has some of the least well protected  And Peru's got something sort of in between. And so  with funding from the Bosack Kruger Foundation  I got a lot of strains from these different countries and we measured their toxin production in the lab. And we found that in Chile    within two months of the invasion of Peru you had strains entering Chile    and when you look at those strains  in the very far left hand side of this graph  you see a lot of variation in the toxin production. Each dot corresponds to an islet from a different person    a lot of variation on which natural selection can act. But the interesting point is  if you look over the     s  within a few years the organisms evolved to be more mild. They evolved to produce less toxin. And to just give you a sense of how important this might be  if we look in       we find that there's only one case of cholera  on average  reported from Chile every two years. So  it's controlled. That's how much we have in America  cholera that's acquired endemically  and we don't think we've got a problem here. They didn't    they solved the problem in Chile. But  before we get too confident  we'd better look at some of those other countries  and make sure that this organism doesn't just always evolve toward mildness. Well  in Peru it didn't. And in Ecuador    remember  this is the place where it has the highest potential waterborne transmission    it looked like it got more harmful. In every case there's a lot of variation  but something about the environment the people are living in  and I think the only realistic explanation is that it's the degree of waterborne transmission  favored the harmful strains in one place  and mild strains in another. So  this is very encouraging  it suggests that something that we might want to do anyhow  if we had enough money  could actually give us a much bigger bang for the buck. It would make these organisms evolve to mildness  so that even though people might be getting infected  they'd be infected with mild strains. It wouldn't be causing severe disease. But there's another really interesting aspect of this  and this is that if you could control the evolution of virulence  evolution of harmfulness  then you should be able to control antibiotic resistance. And the idea is very simple. If you've got a harmful organism  a high proportion of the people are going to be symptomatic  a high proportion of the people are going to be going to get antibiotics. You've got a lot of pressure favoring antibiotic resistance  so you get increased virulence leading to the evolution of increased antibiotic resistance. And once you get increased antibiotic resistance  the antibiotics aren't knocking out the harmful strains anymore. So  you've got a higher level of virulence. So  you get this vicious cycle. The goal is to turn this around. If you could cause an evolutionary decrease in virulence by cleaning up the water supply  you should be able to get an evolutionary decrease in antibiotic resistance. So  we can go to the same countries and look and see. Did Chile avoid the problem of antibiotic resistance  whereas did Ecuador actually have the beginnings of the problem  If we look in the beginning of the     s  we see  again  a lot of variation. In this case  on the Y axis  we've just got a measure of antibiotic sensitivity    and I won't go into that. But we've got a lot of variation in antibiotic sensitivity in Chile  Peru and Ecuador  and no trend across the years. But if we look at the end of the     s  just half a decade later  we see that in Ecuador they started having a resistance problem. Antibiotic sensitivity was going down. And in Chile  you still had antibiotic sensitivity. So  it looks like Chile dodged two bullets. They got the organism to evolve to mildness  and they got no development of antibiotic resistance. Now  these ideas should apply across the board  as long as you can figure out why some organisms evolved to virulence. And I want to give you just one more example  because we've talked a little bit about malaria. And the example I want to deal with is  or the idea I want to deal with  the question is  what can we do to try to get the malarial organism to evolve to mildness  Now  malaria's transmitted by a mosquito  and normally if you're infected with malaria  and you're feeling sick  it makes it even easier for the mosquito to bite you. And you can show  just by looking at data from literature  that vector borne diseases are more harmful than non vector borne diseases. But I think there's a really fascinating example of what one can do experimentally to try to actually demonstrate this. In the case of waterborne transmission  we'd like to clean up the water supplies  see whether or not we can get those organisms to evolve towards mildness. In the case of malaria  what we'd like to do is mosquito proof houses. And the logic's a little more subtle here. If you mosquito proof houses  when people get sick  they're sitting in bed    or in mosquito proof hospitals  they're sitting in a hospital bed    and the mosquitoes can't get to them. So  if you're a harmful variant in a place where you've got mosquito proof housing  then you're a loser. The only pathogens that get transmitted are the ones that are infecting people that feel healthy enough to walk outside and get mosquito bites. So  if you were to mosquito proof houses  you should be able to get these organisms to evolve to mildness. And there's a really wonderful experiment that was done that suggests that we really should go ahead and do this. And that experiment was done in Northern Alabama. Just to give you a little perspective on this  I've given you a star at the intellectual center of the United States  which is right there in Louisville  Kentucky. And this really cool experiment was done about     miles south of there  in Northern Alabama  by the Tennessee Valley Authority. They had dammed up the Tennessee River. They'd caused the water to back up  they needed electric  hydroelectric power. And when you get stagnant water  you get mosquitoes. They found in the late '  s       years after they'd made these dams    that the people in Northern Alabama were infected with malaria  about a third to half of them were infected with malaria. This shows you the positions of some of these dams. OK  so the Tennessee Valley Authority was in a little bit of a bind. There wasn't DDT  there wasn't chloroquines  what do they do  Well  they decided to mosquito proof every house in Northern Alabama. So they did. They divided Northern Alabama into    zones  and within three years  about     dollars per house  they mosquito proofed every house. And these are the data. Every row across here represents one of those    zones. And the asterisks represent the time at which the mosquito proofing was complete. And so what you can see is that just the mosquito proofed housing  and nothing else  caused the eradication of malaria. And this was  incidentally  published in       in the leading textbook of malaria  called  Boyd's Malariology.  But almost no malaria experts even know it exists. This is important  because it tells us that if you have moderate biting densities  you can eradicate malaria by mosquito proofing houses. Now  I would suggest that you could do this in a lot of places. Like  you know  just as you get into the malaria zone  sub Saharan Africa. But as you move to really intense biting rate areas  like Nigeria  you're certainly not going to eradicate. But that's when you should be favoring evolution towards mildness. So to me  it's an experiment that's waiting to happen  and if it confirms the prediction  then we should have a very powerful tool. In a way  much more powerful than the kind of tools we're looking at  because most of what's being done today is to rely on things like anti malarial drugs. And we know that  although it's great to make those anti malarial drugs available at really low cost and high frequency  we know that when you make them highly available you're going to get resistance to those drugs. And so it's a short term solution. This is a long term solution. What I'm suggesting here is that we could get evolution working in the direction we want it to go  rather than always having to battle evolution as a problem that stymies our efforts to control the pathogen  for example with anti malarial drugs. So  this table I've given just to emphasize that I've only talked about two examples. But as I said earlier  this kind of logic applies across the board for infectious diseases  and it ought to. Because when we're dealing with infectious diseases  we're dealing with living systems. We're dealing with living systems  we're dealing with systems that evolve. And so if you do something with those systems  they're going to evolve one way or another. And all I'm saying is that we need to figure out how they'll evolve  so that    we need to adjust our interventions to get the most bang for the intervention buck  so that we can get these organisms to evolve in the direction we want them to go. So  I don't really have time to talk about those things  but I did want to put them up there  just to give you a sense that there really are solutions to controlling the evolution of harmfulness of some of the nasty pathogens that we're confronted with. And this links up with a lot of the other ideas that have been talked about. So  for example  earlier today there was discussion of  how do you really lower sexual transmission of HIV  What this emphasizes is that we need to figure out how it will work. Will it maybe get lowered if we alter the economy of the area  It may get lowered if we intervene in ways that encourage people to stay more faithful to partners  and so on. But the key thing is to figure out how to lower it  because if we lower it  we'll get an evolutionary change in the virus. And the data really do support this  that you actually do get the virus evolving towards mildness. And that will just add to the effectiveness of our control efforts. So the other thing I really like about this  besides the fact that it brings a whole new dimension into the study of control of disease  is that often the kinds of interventions that you want  that it indicates should be done  are the kinds of interventions that people want anyhow. But people just haven't been able to justify the cost. So  this is the kind of thing I'm talking about. If we know that we're going to get extra bang for the buck from providing clean water  then I think that we can say  let's push the effort into that aspect of the control  so that we can actually solve the problem  even though  if you just look at the frequency of infection  you would suggest that you can't solve the problem well enough just by cleaning up water supply. Anyhow  I'll end that there  and thank you very much. I started juggling a long time ago  but long before that  I was a golfer  and that's what I was  a golfer. And as a golfer and as a kid  one of the things that really sort of seeped into my pores  that I sort of lived my whole life  is process. And it's the process of learning things. One of the great things was that my father was an avid golfer  but he was lefty. And he had a real passion for golf  and he also created this whole mythology about Ben Hogan and various things. Well  I learned a lot about interesting things that I knew nothing about at the time  but grew to know stuff about. And that was the mythology of skill. So  one of the things that I love to do is to explore skill. And since Richard put me on this whole thing with music    I'm supposed to actually be doing a project with Tod Machover with the MIT Media Lab    it relates a lot to music. But Tod couldn't come and the project is sort of somewhere  I'm not sure whether it's happening the way we thought  or not. But I'm going to explore skill  and juggling  and basically visual music  I guess. OK  you can start the music  thanks. Thanks. Thank you. Now  juggling can be a lot of fun  play with skill and play with space  play with rhythm. And you can turn the mike on now. I'm going to do a couple of pieces. I do a big piece in a triangle and these are three sections from it. Part of the challenge was to try to understand rhythm and space using not just my hands    because a lot of juggling is hand oriented    but using the rhythm of my body and feet  and controlling the balls with my feet. Thanks. Now  this next section was an attempt to explore space. You see  I think Richard said something about people that are against something. Well  a lot of people think jugglers defy gravity or do stuff. Well  I kind of  from my childhood and golf and all that  it's a process of joining with forces. And so what I'd like to do is try to figure out how to join with the space through the technique. So juggling gravity    up  down. If you figure out what up and down really are  it's a complex physical set of skills to be able to throw a ball down and up and everything  but then you add in sideways. Now  I look at it somewhat as a way    when you learn juggling what you learn is how to feel with your eyes  and see with your hands because you're not looking at your hands  you're looking at where the balls are or you're looking at the audience. So this next part is really a way of understanding space and rhythm  with the obvious reference to the feet  but it's also time    where the feet were  where the balls were. Thanks. So  visual music  rhythm and complexity. I'm going to build towards complexity now. Juggling three balls is simple and normal. Excuse me. We're jugglers  OK. And remember  you're transposing  you're getting into a subculture here. And juggling    the balls cross and all that. OK  if you keep them in their assigned paths you get parallel lines of different heights  but then hopefully even rhythm. And you can change the rhythm    good  Michael. You can change the rhythm  if you get out of the lights. OK  Change the rhythm  so it's even. Or you can go back and change the height. Now  skill. But you're boxed in  if you can only do it up and down that way. So  you've got to go after the space down there. OK  then you've got to combine them  because then you have the whole spatial palette in front of you. And then you get crazy. Now  I'm actually going to ask you to try something  so you've got to pay attention. Complexity  if you spend enough time doing something  time slows down or your skill increases  so your perceptions change. It's learning skills    like being in a high speed car crash. Things slow down as you learn  as you learn  as you learn. You may not be able to affect it  it almost drifts on you. It goes. But that's the closest approximation I can have to it. So  complexity. Now  how many here are jugglers  OK  so most of you are going to have a similar reaction to this. OK  And whoever laughed there    you understood it completely  right  No  it looks like a mess. It looks like a mess with a guy there  who's got his hands around that mess  OK. Well  that's what juggling is about  right  It's being able to do something that other people can't do or can't understand. All right. So  that's one way of doing it  which is five balls down. OK  Another way is the outside. And you could play with the rhythm. Same pattern. Make it faster and smaller. Make it wider. Make it narrower. Bring it back up. OK. It's done. Thanks. Now  what I wanted to get to is that you're all very bright  very tactile. I have no idea how computer oriented or three dimensionally oriented you are  but let's try something. OK  so since you all don't understand what the five ball pattern is  I'm going to give you a little clue. Enough of a clue  So  you get the pattern  right  OK. You're not getting off that easy. All right  Now  do me a favor  follow the ball that I ask you to follow. Green. Yellow. Pink. White. OK  you can do that  Yeah  OK. Now  let's actually learn something. Actually  let me put you in that area of learning  which is very insecure. You want to do it  Yeah  OK. Hands out in front of you. Palms up  together. What you're going to learn is this. OK  So what I want you to do is just listen to me and do it. Index finger  middle finger  ring  little. Little  ring  middle  index. And then open. Finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger. A little bit faster. Finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger. Finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger. All right. A lot of different learning processes going on in here. One learning process that I see is this    OK. Another learning process that I see is this    OK. So  everybody take a deep breath in  breath out. OK. Now  one more time  and    finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger. Open. Finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger. OK. Shake your hands out. Now  I assume a lot of you spend a lot of time at a computer. OK  So  what you're doing is  you're going la  la  la  and you're getting this. OK  So that's exactly what I'm going to ask you to do  but in a slightly different way. You're going to combine it. So what I want you to do is    fingers. I'll tell you what to do with your fingers  same thing. But I want you to do is also  with your eyes  is follow the colored ball that I ask you to follow. OK  Here we go. So  we're going to start off looking at the white ball    and I'm going to tell you which color  and I'm also going to tell you to go with your fingers. OK  So white ball and    finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger. Pink. Finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger. Green. Finger  finger  finger  finger. Yellow. Finger  finger  finger  pink or finger. Pink  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger. All right. How did you do  Well  OK. The reason I wanted you to do this is because that's actually what most people face throughout their lives  a moment of learning  a moment of challenge. It's a moment that you can't make sense of. Why the hell should I learn this  OK  Does it really have anything to do with anything in my life  You know  I can't decipher    is it fun  Is it challenging  Am I supposed to cheat  You know  what are you supposed to do  You've got somebody up here who is the operative principle of doing that for his whole life. OK  Trying to figure that stuff out. But is it going to get you anywhere  It's just a moment. That's all it is  a moment. OK  I'm going to change the script for one second. Just let me do this. I don't need music for it. Talking about time in a moment. There's a piece that I recently developed which was all about that  a moment. And what I do as a creative artist is I develop vocabularies or languages of moving objects. What I've done for you here  I developed a lot of those tricks and I put the choreography together  but they're not original techniques. Now  I'm going to start showing you some original techniques that come from the work that I've developed. OK  So  a moment  how would you define a moment  Well  as a juggler  what I wanted to do was create something that was representational of a moment. Ahhh. All right  I'm going to get on my knees and do it. So  a moment. OK  And then  what I did as a juggler was say  OK  what can I do to make that something that is dependent on something else  another dynamic. So  a moment. Another moment. Excuse me  still getting there. A moment that travels. A moment    no  we'll try that again. It separates  and comes back together. Time. How can you look at time  And what do you dedicate it to  in exploring a particular thing  Well  obviously  there's something in here  and you can all have a guess as to what it is. There's a mystery. There's a mystery in the moment. And it has to settle. And then it's dependent on something else. And then it comes to rest. Just a little thing about time. Now  this has expanded into a much bigger piece  because I use ramps of different parabolas that I roll the balls on while I'm keeping time with this. But I just thought I'd talk about a moment. All right. OK. Can we show the video of the triangle  Are we ready to do that  Yes  This is the piece that I told you about. It's a much bigger piece that I do exploring the space of a geometric triangle. Thanks. The only thing I'll say about the last session is  you ever try juggling and driving the car with your knees at     miles an hour  The only other thing is  it was a real shock. I always drove motorcycles. And when I bought my first car  it shocked me that it cost three times more than my parents' house. Interesting. Anyway  balance  constant movement to find an approach to stillness. Cheating. Balance  making up the rules so you can't cheat  so you learn to approach stillness with different parts of your body. To have a conversation with it. To speak. To listen. Hup. Now  it's dependent on rhythm  and keeping a center of balance. When it falls  going underneath. So  there's a rhythm to it. The rhythm can get much smaller. As your skill increases  you learn to find those tinier spaces  those tinier movements. Thanks. Now  I'm going to show you the beginnings of a piece that is about balance in some ways  and also    oh  actually  if you're bored  not here  here's one use for it. You can go with the  Sticks One  music. Thanks. That has a certain kind of balance to it  which is all about plumb. I apprenticed with a carpenter and learned about plumb  square and level. And they influenced that  and this next piece  which I'll do a little segment of.  Two Sticks   you can go with it. Thanks. Which is again exploring space  or the lines in space. Working with space and the lines in space in a different way. Oh  let's see here. So  I'll come back to that in a second. But working with one ball  now  what if you attach something to it  or change it. This is a little thing that I made because I really like the idea of curves and balls together. And then creating space and the rhythm of space  using the surface of the balls  the surface of the arms. Just a little toy. Which leads me to the next thing  which is    what have I got here  OK. All right. I'm actually leading up to something  the newest thing that I'm working on. This is not it. This is exploring geometry and the rhythm of shape. Now  what I just did was I worked with the mathematics    the diameter and the circumference. Sometimes these pieces are mathematical  in that way that I look at a shape and say  what about if I use this and this and this. Sometimes what happens in life affects my choice of objects that I try to work with. The next piece that I'm going to do    which is the cylinders piece  if you want to get that up    it has to do with cylinder seals from about       years ago  which were stones with designs that were used to roll over wet clay with all sorts of great designs. I love ceramics and all of that. It's a combination of that  the beauty of that  the shape  and the stories that were involved in it  as well as the fact that they protected the contents. The second influence on this piece came from recycling and looking into a tin can recycling bin and seeing all that beautiful emptiness. So  if you want to go with the music for cylinders. Talking about geometry and everything  if you take the circle and you split it in half    can you run  S Curve music   I'm going to do just a short version of it. Circles split in half and rotated  and mythology. Anyway  that piece also has a kinetic sculpture in the middle of it  and I dance around a small stage so    two minutes  just to end  The latest piece that I'm working on    what I love is that I never know what I'm working on  why I'm working on it. They're not ideas  they're instincts. And the latest thing that I'm working on    is something really    I don't know what it is yet. And that's good. I like not to know for as long as possible. Well  because then it tells me the truth  instead of me imposing the truth. And what it is  is working with both positive and negative space but also with these curves. And what it involves  and I don't know if my hands are too beaten up to do it or not  but I'll do a little bit of it. It initially started off with me stacking these things  bunches of them  and then playing with the sense of space  of filling in the space. And then it started changing  and become folding on themselves. And then changing levels. Because my attempt is to make visual instruments  not to just make    I'll try one other thing. For work in three dimensions  with your perceptions of space and time. Now  I don't know exactly where it's going  but I've got a bit of effort involved in this thing. And it's going to change as I go through it. But I really like it  it feels right. This may not be the right shape  and    look at this shape  and then I'll show you the first design I ever put to it  just to see  just to play  because I love all different kinds of things to play with. Let's see here. To work with the positive and negative in a different way. And to change  and to change. So  I'm off in my new direction with this to explore rhythm and space. We'll see what I come up with. Thanks for having me. How many of you have seen the Alfred Hitchcock film  The Birds   Any of you get really freaked out by that  You might want to leave now. So  this is a vending machine for crows. And over the past few days  many of you have been asking me   How did you come to this  How did you get started doing this   And it started  as with many great ideas  or many ideas you can't get rid of anyway  at a cocktail party. About    years ago  I was at a cocktail party with a friend of mine  and we're sitting there  and he was complaining about the crows that he had seen that were all over his yard and making a big mess. And he was telling me that really  we ought to try and eradicate these things. We gotta kill them because they're making a mess. I said that was stupid  you know  maybe we should just train them to do something useful. And he said that was impossible. And I'm sure I'm in good company in finding that tremendously annoying    when someone tells you it's impossible. So  I spent the next    years reading about crows in my spare time. And after    years of this  my wife eventually said   Look  you know  you gotta do this thing you've been talking about  and build the vending machine.  So I did. But part of the reason that I found this interesting is that I started noticing that we are very aware of all the species that are going extinct on the planet as a result of human habitation expansion  and no one seems to be paying attention to all the species that are actually living    that are surviving. And I'm talking specifically about synanthropic species  which are species that have adapted specifically for human ecologies  species like rats and cockroaches and crows. And as I started looking at them  I was finding that they had hyper adapted. They'd become extremely adept at living with us. And in return  we just tried to kill them all the time. And in doing so  we were breeding them for parasitism. We were giving them all sorts of reasons to adapt new ways. So  for example  rats are incredibly responsive breeders. And cockroaches  as anyone who's tried to get rid of them knows  have become really immune to the poisons that we're using. So  I thought  let's build something that's mutually beneficial. Well  then let's build something that we can both benefit from  and find some way to make a new relationship with these species. And so I built the vending machine. But the story of the vending machine is a little more interesting if you know more about crows. It turns out that crows aren't just surviving with human beings    they're actually really thriving. They're found everywhere on the planet except for the Arctic and the southern tip of South America. And in all that area  they're only rarely found breeding more than five kilometers away from human beings. So we may not think about them  but they're always around. And not surprisingly  given the human population growth  more than half of the human population is living in cities now. And out of those  nine tenths of the human growth population is occurring in cities. We're seeing a population boom with crows. So bird counts are indicating that we might be seeing up to exponential growth in their numbers. So that's no great surprise. But what was really interesting to me was to find out that the birds were adapting in a pretty unusual way. And I'll give you an example of that. So this is Betty. She's a New Caledonian crow. And these crows use sticks in the wild to get insects and whatnot out of pieces of wood. Here  she's trying to get a piece of meat out of a tube. But the researchers had a problem. They messed up and left just a stick of wire in there. And she hadn't had the opportunity to do this before. You see  it wasn't working very well. So she adapted. Now this is completely unprompted. She had never seen this done before. No one taught her to bend this into a hook  had shown her how it could happen. But she did it all on her own. So keep in mind that she's never seen this done. Right. Yeah. All right. That's the part where the researchers freak out. So  it turns out we've been finding more and more that crows are really  really intelligent. Their brains are proportionate  in the same proportion as chimpanzee brains are. There are all kinds of anecdotes for different kinds of intelligence they have. For example  in Sweden  crows will wait for fishermen to drop lines through holes in the ice. And when the fishermen move off  the crows fly down  reel up the lines  and eat the fish or the bait. It's pretty annoying for the fishermen. On an entirely different tack  at University of Washington  they  a few years ago  were doing an experiment where they captured some crows on campus. Some students went out and netted some crows  brought them in  and were    weighed them  and measured them and whatnot  and then let them back out again. And were entertained to discover that for the rest of the week  these crows  whenever these particular students walked around campus  these crows would caw at them  and run around and make their life kind of miserable. They were significantly less entertained when this went on for the next week. And the next month. And after summer break. Until they finally graduated and left campus  and    glad to get away  I'm sure    came back sometime later  and found the crows still remembered them. So    the moral being  don't piss off crows. So now  students at the University of Washington that are studying these crows do so with a giant wig and a big mask. It's fairly interesting. So we know that these crows are really smart  but the more I dug into this  the more I found that they actually have an even more significant adaptation. Video  Crows have become highly skilled at making a living in these new urban environments. In this Japanese city  they have devised a way of eating a food that normally they can't manage  drop it among the traffic. The problem now is collecting the bits  without getting run over. Wait for the light to stop the traffic. Then  collect your cracked nut in safety. Joshua Klein  Yeah  yeah. Pretty interesting. So what's significant about this isn't that crows are using cars to crack nuts. In fact  that's old hat for crows. This happened about    years ago in a place called Sendai City  at a driving school in the suburbs of Tokyo. And since that time  all of the crows in the neighborhood are picking up this behavior. And now  every crow within five kilometers is standing by a sidewalk  waiting to collect its lunch. So  they're learning from each other. And research bears this out. Parents seem to be teaching their young. They've learned from their peers. They've learned from their enemies. If I have a little extra time  I'll tell you about a case of crow infidelity that illustrates that nicely. The point being that they've developed cultural adaptation. And as we heard yesterday  that's the Pandora's box that's getting human beings in trouble  and we're starting to see it with them. They're able to very quickly and very flexibly adapt to new challenges and new resources in their environment  which is really useful if you live in a city. So we know that there's lots of crows. We found out they're really smart  and we found out that they can teach each other. And when all this became clear to me  I realized the only obvious thing to do is build a vending machine. So that's what we did. This is a vending machine for crows. And it uses Skinnerian training to shape their behavior over four stages. It's pretty simple. Basically  what happens is that we put this out in a field  or someplace where there's lots of crows  and we put coins and peanuts all around the base of the machine. And crows eventually come by  and eat the peanuts and get used to the machine being there. And eventually  they eat up all the peanuts. And then they see that there are peanuts here on the feeder tray  and they hop up and help themselves. And then they leave  and the machine spits up more coins and peanuts  and life is really dandy  if you're a crow. Then you can come back anytime and get yourself a peanut. So  when they get really used to that  we move on to the crows coming back. Now  they're used to the sound of the machine  and they keep coming back  and digging out these peanuts from amongst the pile of coins that's there. And when they get really happy about this  we go ahead and stymie them. And we move to the third stage  where we only give them a coin. Now  like most of us who have gotten used to a good thing  this really pisses them off. So  they do what they do in nature when they're looking for something    they sweep things out of the way with their beak. And they do that here  and that knocks the coins down the slot  and when that happens  they get a peanut. And so this goes on for some time. The crows learn that all they have to do is show up  wait for the coin to come out  put the coin in the slot  and then they get their peanut. And when they're really good and comfortable with that  we move to the final stage  in which they show up and nothing happens. And this is where we see the difference between crows and other animals. Squirrels  for example  would show up  look for the peanut  go away. Come back  look for the peanut  go away. They do this maybe half a dozen times before they get bored  and then they go off and play in traffic. Crows  on the other hand  show up  and they try and figure it out. They know that this machine's been messing with them  through three different stages of behavior. They figure it's gotta have more to it. So  they poke at it and peck at it and whatnot. And eventually some crow gets a bright idea that   Hey  there's lots of coins lying around from the first stage  lying around on the ground   hops down  picks it up  drops it in the slot. And then  we're off to the races. That crow enjoys a temporary monopoly on peanuts  until his friends figure out how to do it  and then there we go. So  what's significant about this to me isn't that we can train crows to pick up peanuts. Mind you  there's     million dollars' worth of change lost every year  but I'm not sure I can depend on that ROI from crows. Instead  I think we should look a little bit larger. I think that crows can be trained to do other things. For example  why not train them to pick up garbage after stadium events  Or find expensive components from discarded electronics  Or maybe do search and rescue  The main thing  the main point of all this for me is that we can find mutually beneficial systems for these species. We can find ways to interact with these other species that doesn't involve exterminating them  but involves finding an equilibrium with them that's a useful balance. Thanks very much. How does the news shape the way we see the world  Here's the world based on the way it looks    based on landmass. And here's how news shapes what Americans see. This map     Applause     this map shows the number of seconds that American network and cable news organizations dedicated to news stories  by country  in February of         just one year ago. Now  this was a month when North Korea agreed to dismantle its nuclear facilities. There was massive flooding in Indonesia. And in Paris  the IPCC released its study confirming man's impact on global warming. The U.S. accounted for    percent of total news coverage. And when we take out the U.S. and look at the remaining    percent  we see a lot of Iraq    that's that big green thing there    and little else. The combined coverage of Russia  China and India  for example  reached just one percent. When we analyzed all the news stories and removed just one story  here's how the world looked. What was that story  The death of Anna Nicole Smith. This story eclipsed every country except Iraq  and received    times the coverage of the IPCC report. And the cycle continues  as we all know  Britney has loomed pretty large lately. So  why don't we hear more about the world  One reason is that news networks have reduced the number of their foreign bureaus by half. Aside from one person ABC mini bureaus in Nairobi  New Delhi and Mumbai  there are no network news bureaus in all of Africa  India or South America    places that are home to more than two billion people. The reality is that covering Britney is cheaper. And this lack of global coverage is all the more disturbing when we see where people go for news. Local TV news looms large  and unfortunately only dedicates    percent of its coverage to international news. And what about the web  The most popular news sites don't do much better. Last year  Pew and the Colombia J School analyzed the        stories that appeared on Google News' front page. And they  in fact  covered the same    news events. Similarly  a study in e content showed that much of global news from U.S. news creators is recycled stories from the AP wire services and Reuters  and don't put things into a context that people can understand their connection to it. So  if you put it all together  this could help explain why today's college graduates  as well as less educated Americans  know less about the world than their counterparts did    years ago. And if you think it's simply because we are not interested  you would be wrong. In recent years  Americans who say they closely follow global news most of the time grew to over    percent. The real question  is this distorted worldview what we want for Americans in our increasingly interconnected world  I know we can do better. And can we afford not to  Thank you. I write about food. I write about cooking. I take it quite seriously  but I'm here to talk about something that's become very important to me in the last year or two. It is about food  but it's not about cooking  per se. I'm going to start with this picture of a beautiful cow. I'm not a vegetarian    this is the old Nixon line  right  But I still think that this       may be this year's version of this. Now  that is only a little bit hyperbolic. And why do I say it  Because only once before has the fate of individual people and the fate of all of humanity been so intertwined. There was the bomb  and there's now. And where we go from here is going to determine not only the quality and the length of our individual lives  but whether  if we could see the Earth a century from now  we'd recognize it. It's a holocaust of a different kind  and hiding under our desks isn't going to help. Start with the notion that global warming is not only real  but dangerous. Since every scientist in the world now believes this  and even President Bush has seen the light  or pretends to  we can take this is a given. Then hear this  please. After energy production  livestock is the second highest contributor to atmosphere altering gases. Nearly one fifth of all greenhouse gas is generated by livestock production    more than transportation. Now  you can make all the jokes you want about cow farts  but methane is    times more poisonous than CO   and it's not just methane. Livestock is also one of the biggest culprits in land degradation  air and water pollution  water shortages and loss of biodiversity. There's more. Like half the antibiotics in this country are not administered to people  but to animals. But lists like this become kind of numbing  so let me just say this  if you're a progressive  if you're driving a Prius  or you're shopping green  or you're looking for organic  you should probably be a semi vegetarian. Now  I'm no more anti cattle than I am anti atom  but it's all in the way we use these things. There's another piece of the puzzle  which Ann Cooper talked about beautifully yesterday  and one you already know. There's no question  none  that so called lifestyle diseases    diabetes  heart disease  stroke  some cancers    are diseases that are far more prevalent here than anywhere in the rest of the world. And that's the direct result of eating a Western diet. Our demand for meat  dairy and refined carbohydrates    the world consumes one billion cans or bottles of Coke a day    our demand for these things  not our need  our want  drives us to consume way more calories than are good for us. And those calories are in foods that cause  not prevent  disease. Now global warming was unforeseen. We didn't know that pollution did more than cause bad visibility. Maybe a few lung diseases here and there  but  you know  that's not such a big deal. The current health crisis  however  is a little more the work of the evil empire. We were told  we were assured  that the more meat and dairy and poultry we ate  the healthier we'd be. No. Overconsumption of animals  and of course  junk food  is the problem  along with our paltry consumption of plants. Now  there's no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here  but the evidence is that plants    and I want to make this clear    it's not the ingredients in plants  it's the plants. It's not the beta carotene  it's the carrot. The evidence is very clear that plants promote health. This evidence is overwhelming at this point. You eat more plants  you eat less other stuff  you live longer. Not bad. But back to animals and junk food. What do they have in common  One  we don't need either of them for health. We don't need animal products  and we certainly don't need white bread or Coke. Two  both have been marketed heavily  creating unnatural demand. We're not born craving Whoppers or Skittles. Three  their production has been supported by government agencies at the expense of a more health  and Earth friendly diet. Now  let's imagine a parallel. Let's pretend that our government supported an oil based economy  while discouraging more sustainable forms of energy  knowing all the while that the result would be pollution  war and rising costs. Incredible  isn't it  Yet they do that. And they do this here. It's the same deal. The sad thing is  when it comes to diet  is that even when well intentioned Feds try to do right by us  they fail. Either they're outvoted by puppets of agribusiness  or they are puppets of agribusiness. So  when the USDA finally acknowledged that it was plants  rather than animals  that made people healthy  they encouraged us  via their overly simplistic food pyramid  to eat five servings of fruits and vegetables a day  along with more carbs. What they didn't tell us is that some carbs are better than others  and that plants and whole grains should be supplanting eating junk food. But industry lobbyists would never let that happen. And guess what  Half the people who developed the food pyramid have ties to agribusiness. So  instead of substituting plants for animals  our swollen appetites simply became larger  and the most dangerous aspects of them remained unchanged. So called low fat diets  so called low carb diets    these are not solutions. But with lots of intelligent people focusing on whether food is organic or local  or whether we're being nice to animals  the most important issues just aren't being addressed. Now  don't get me wrong. I like animals  and I don't think it's just fine to industrialize their production and to churn them out like they were wrenches. But there's no way to treat animals well  when you're killing    billion of them a year. That's our number.    billion. If you strung all of them    chickens  cows  pigs and lambs    to the moon  they'd go there and back five times  there and back. Now  my math's a little shaky  but this is pretty good  and it depends whether a pig is four feet long or five feet long  but you get the idea. That's just the United States. And with our hyper consumption of those animals producing greenhouse gases and heart disease  kindness might just be a bit of a red herring. Let's get the numbers of the animals we're killing for eating down  and then we'll worry about being nice to the ones that are left. Another red herring might be exemplified by the word  locavore   which was just named word of the year by the New Oxford American Dictionary. Seriously. And locavore  for those of you who don't know  is someone who eats only locally grown food    which is fine if you live in California  but for the rest of us it's a bit of a sad joke. Between the official story    the food pyramid    and the hip locavore vision  you have two versions of how to improve our eating. They both get it wrong  though. The first at least is populist  and the second is elitist. How we got to this place is the history of food in the United States. And I'm going to go through that  at least the last hundred years or so  very quickly right now. A hundred years ago  guess what  Everyone was a locavore  even New York had pig farms nearby  and shipping food all over the place was a ridiculous notion. Every family had a cook  usually a mom. And those moms bought and prepared food. It was like your romantic vision of Europe. Margarine didn't exist. In fact  when margarine was invented  several states passed laws declaring that it had to be dyed pink  so we'd all know that it was a fake. There was no snack food  and until the '  s  until Clarence Birdseye came along  there was no frozen food. There were no restaurant chains. There were neighborhood restaurants run by local people  but none of them would think to open another one. Eating ethnic was unheard of unless you were ethnic. And fancy food was entirely French. As an aside  those of you who remember Dan Aykroyd in the     s doing Julia Child imitations can see where he got the idea of stabbing himself from this fabulous slide. Back in those days  before even Julia  back in those days  there was no philosophy of food. You just ate. You didn't claim to be anything. There was no marketing. There were no national brands. Vitamins had not been invented. There were no health claims  at least not federally sanctioned ones. Fats  carbs  proteins    they weren't bad or good  they were food. You ate food. Hardly anything contained more than one ingredient  because it was an ingredient. The cornflake hadn't been invented. The Pop Tart  the Pringle  Cheez Whiz  none of that stuff. Goldfish swam. It's hard to imagine. People grew food  and they ate food. And again  everyone ate local. In New York  an orange was a common Christmas present  because it came all the way from Florida. From the '  s on  road systems expanded  trucks took the place of railroads  fresh food began to travel more. Oranges became common in New York. The South and West became agricultural hubs  and in other parts of the country  suburbs took over farmland. The effects of this are well known. They are everywhere. And the death of family farms is part of this puzzle  as is almost everything from the demise of the real community to the challenge of finding a good tomato  even in summer. Eventually  California produced too much food to ship fresh  so it became critical to market canned and frozen foods. Thus arrived convenience. It was sold to proto feminist housewives as a way to cut down on housework. Now  I know everybody over the age of  like       their mouths are watering at this point. If we had a slide of Salisbury steak  even more so  right  But this may have cut down on housework  but it cut down on the variety of food we ate as well. Many of us grew up never eating a fresh vegetable except the occasional raw carrot or maybe an odd lettuce salad. I  for one    and I'm not kidding    didn't eat real spinach or broccoli till I was   . Who needed it though  Meat was everywhere. What could be easier  more filling or healthier for your family than broiling a steak  But by then cattle were already raised unnaturally. Rather than spending their lives eating grass  for which their stomachs were designed  they were forced to eat soy and corn. They have trouble digesting those grains  of course  but that wasn't a problem for producers. New drugs kept them healthy. Well  they kept them alive. Healthy was another story. Thanks to farm subsidies  the fine collaboration between agribusiness and Congress  soy  corn and cattle became king. And chicken soon joined them on the throne. It was during this period that the cycle of dietary and planetary destruction began  the thing we're only realizing just now. Listen to this  between      and       the world's population doubled. Meat consumption increased five fold. Now  someone had to eat all that stuff  so we got fast food. And this took care of the situation resoundingly. Home cooking remained the norm  but its quality was down the tubes. There were fewer meals with home cooked breads  desserts and soups  because all of them could be bought at any store. Not that they were any good  but they were there. Most moms cooked like mine  a piece of broiled meat  a quickly made salad with bottled dressing  canned soup  canned fruit salad. Maybe baked or mashed potatoes  or perhaps the stupidest food ever  Minute Rice. For dessert  store bought ice cream or cookies. My mom is not here  so I can say this now. This kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself. It wasn't all bad. By the '  s  forward thinking people began to recognize the value of local ingredients. We tended gardens  we became interested in organic food  we knew or we were vegetarians. We weren't all hippies  either. Some of us were eating in good restaurants and learning how to cook well. Meanwhile  food production had become industrial. Industrial. Perhaps because it was being produced rationally  as if it were plastic  food gained magical or poisonous powers  or both. Many people became fat phobic. Others worshiped broccoli  as if it were God like. But mostly they didn't eat broccoli. Instead they were sold on yogurt  yogurt being almost as good as broccoli. Except  in reality  the way the industry sold yogurt was to convert it to something much more akin to ice cream. Similarly  let's look at a granola bar. You think that that might be healthy food  but in fact  if you look at the ingredient list  it's closer in form to a Snickers than it is to oatmeal. Sadly  it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma  if not actually killed    the beginning of the heyday of value added food  which contained as many soy and corn products as could be crammed into it. Think of the frozen chicken nugget. The chicken is fed corn  and then its meat is ground up  and mixed with more corn products to add bulk and binder  and then it's fried in corn oil. All you do is nuke it. What could be better  And zapped horribly  pathetically. By the '  s  home cooking was in such a sad state that the high fat and spice contents of foods like McNuggets and Hot Pockets    and we all have our favorites  actually    made this stuff more appealing than the bland things that people were serving at home. At the same time  masses of women were entering the workforce  and cooking simply wasn't important enough for men to share the burden. So now  you've got your pizza nights  you've got your microwave nights  you've got your grazing nights  you've got your fend for yourself nights and so on. Leading the way    what's leading the way  Meat  junk food  cheese  the very stuff that will kill you. So  now we clamor for organic food. That's good. And as evidence that things can actually change  you can now find organic food in supermarkets  and even in fast food outlets. But organic food isn't the answer either  at least not the way it's currently defined. Let me pose you a question. Can farm raised salmon be organic  when its feed has nothing to do with its natural diet  even if the feed itself is supposedly organic  and the fish themselves are packed tightly in pens  swimming in their own filth  And if that salmon's from Chile  and it's killed down there and then flown       miles  whatever  dumping how much carbon into the atmosphere  I don't know. Packed in Styrofoam  of course  before landing somewhere in the United States  and then being trucked a few hundred more miles. This may be organic in letter  but it's surely not organic in spirit. Now here is where we all meet. The locavores  the organivores  the vegetarians  the vegans  the gourmets and those of us who are just plain interested in good food. Even though we've come to this from different points  we all have to act on our knowledge to change the way that everyone thinks about food. We need to start acting. And this is not only an issue of social justice  as Ann Cooper said    and  of course  she's completely right    but it's also one of global survival. Which bring me full circle and points directly to the core issue  the overproduction and overconsumption of meat and junk food. As I said     percent of greenhouse gases are attributed to livestock production. How much livestock do you need to produce this     percent of the agricultural land on Earth     percent of the Earth's land surface is directly or indirectly devoted to raising the animals we'll eat. And this amount is predicted to double in the next    years or so. And if the numbers coming in from China are anything like what they look like now  it's not going to be    years. There is no good reason for eating as much meat as we do. And I say this as a man who has eaten a fair share of corned beef in his life. The most common argument is that we need nutrients    even though we eat  on average  twice as much protein as even the industry obsessed USDA recommends. But listen  experts who are serious about disease reduction recommend that adults eat just over half a pound of meat per week. What do you think we eat per day  Half a pound. But don't we need meat to be big and strong  Isn't meat eating essential to health  Won't a diet heavy in fruit and vegetables turn us into godless  sissy  liberals  Some of us might think that would be a good thing. But  no  even if we were all steroid filled football players  the answer is no. In fact  there's no diet on Earth that meets basic nutritional needs that won't promote growth  and many will make you much healthier than ours does. We don't eat animal products for sufficient nutrition  we eat them to have an odd form of malnutrition  and it's killing us. To suggest that in the interests of personal and human health Americans eat    percent less meat    it's not enough of a cut  but it's a start. It would seem absurd  but that's exactly what should happen  and what progressive people  forward thinking people should be doing and advocating  along with the corresponding increase in the consumption of plants. I've been writing about food more or less omnivorously    one might say indiscriminately    for about    years. During that time  I've eaten and recommended eating just about everything. I'll never stop eating animals  I'm sure  but I do think that for the benefit of everyone  the time has come to stop raising them industrially and stop eating them thoughtlessly. Ann Cooper's right. The USDA is not our ally here. We have to take matters into our own hands  not only by advocating for a better diet for everyone    and that's the hard part    but by improving our own. And that happens to be quite easy. Less meat  less junk  more plants. It's a simple formula  eat food. Eat real food. We can continue to enjoy our food  and we continue to eat well  and we can eat even better. We can continue the search for the ingredients we love  and we can continue to spin yarns about our favorite meals. We'll reduce not only calories  but our carbon footprint. We can make food more important  not less  and save ourselves by doing so. We have to choose that path. Thank you. The first question is this. Our country has two exploration programs. One is NASA  with a mission to explore the great beyond  to explore the heavens  which we all want to go to if we're lucky. And you can see we have Sputnik  and we have Saturn  and we have other manifestations of space exploration. Well  there's also another program  in another agency within our government  in ocean exploration. It's in NOAA  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. And my question is this   why are we ignoring the oceans   Here's the reason  or not the reason  but here's why I ask that question. If you compare NASA's annual budget to explore the heavens  that one year budget would fund NOAA's budget to explore the oceans for       years. Why  Why are we looking up  Is it because it's heaven  And hell is down here  Is it a cultural issue  Why are people afraid of the ocean  Or do they just assume the ocean is just a dark  gloomy place that has nothing to offer  I'm going to take you on a    minute trip on    percent of the planet  so buckle up. OK. And what we're going to do is we're going to immerse ourselves in my world. And what I'm going to try    I hope I make the following points. I'm going to make it right now in case I forget. Everything I'm going to present to you was not in my textbooks when I went to school. And most of all  it was not even in my college textbooks. I'm a geophysicist  and all my Earth science books when I was a student    I had to give the wrong answer to get an A. We used to ridicule continental drift. It was something we laughed at. We learned of Marshall Kay's geosynclinal cycle  which is a bunch of crap. In today's context  it was a bunch of crap  but it was the law of geology  vertical tectonics. All the things we're going to walk through in our explorations and discoveries of the oceans were mostly discoveries made by accident. Mostly discoveries made by accident. We were looking for something and found something else. And everything we're going to talk about represents a one tenth of one percent glimpse  because that's all we've seen. I have a characterization. This is a characterization of what it would look like if you could remove the water. It gives you the false impression it's a map. It is not a map. In fact  I have another version at my office and I ask people   Why are there mountains here  on this area here  but there are none over here   And they go   Well  gee  I don't know   saying   Is it a fracture zone  Is it a hot spot   No  no  that's the only place a ship's been. Most of the southern hemisphere is unexplored. We had more exploration ships down there during Captain Cook's time than now. It's amazing. All right. So we're going to immerse ourselves in the    percent of the planet because  you know  it's really naive to think that the Easter Bunny put all the resources on the continents. You know  it's just ludicrous. We are always  constantly playing the zero sum game. You know  we're going to do this  we're going to take it away from something else. I believe in just enriching the economy. And we're leaving so much on the table     percent of the planet. And as I will point out later in the presentation     percent of the United States of America lies beneath the sea.    percent of our country that we own  have all legal jurisdiction  have all rights to do whatever we want  lies beneath the sea and we have better maps of Mars than that    percent. Why  OK. Now  I began my explorations the hard way. Back then    actually my first expedition was when I was    years old. It was    years ago. Do the math  I'm   . And I went out to sea on a Scripps ship and we almost got sunk by a giant rogue wave  and I was too young to be    you know  I thought it was great  I was a body surfer and I thought   Wow  that was an incredible wave   And we almost sank the ship  but I became enraptured with mounting expeditions. And over the last    years  I've done about             I keep doing them    expeditions. But in the early days  the only way I could get to the bottom was to crawl into a submarine  a very small submarine  and go down to the bottom. I dove in a whole series of different deep diving submersibles. Alvin and Sea Cliff and Cyana  and all the major deep submersibles we have  which are about eight. In fact  on a good day  we might have four or five human beings at the average depth of the Earth    maybe four or five human beings out of whatever billions we've got going. And so it's very difficult to get there  if you do it physically. But I was enraptured  and in my graduate years was the dawn of plate tectonics. And we realized that the greatest mountain range on Earth lies beneath the sea. The mid ocean ridge runs around like the seam on a baseball. This is on a Mercator projection. But if you were to put it on an equal area projection  you'd see that the mid ocean ridge covers    percent of the Earth's total surface area. Almost a quarter of our planet is a single mountain range and we didn't enter it until after Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin went to the moon. So we went to the moon  played golf up there  before we went to the largest feature on our own planet. And our interest in this mountain range  as Earth scientists in those days  was not only because of its tremendous size  dominating the planet  but the role it plays in the genesis of the Earth's outer skin. Because it's along the axis of the mid ocean ridge where the great crustal plates are separating. And like a living organism  you tear it open  it bleeds its molten blood  rises up to heal that wound from the asthenosphere  hardens  forms new tissue and moves laterally. But no one had actually gone down into the actual site of the boundary of creation as we call it    into the Rift Valley    until a group of seven of us crawled in our little submarines in the summer of            and were the first human beings to enter the Great Rift Valley. We went down into the Rift Valley. This is all accurate except for one thing    it's pitch black. It's absolutely pitch black  because photons cannot reach the average depth of the ocean  which is        feet. In the Rift Valley  it's       feet. Most of our planet does not feel the warmth of the sun. Most of our planet is in eternal darkness. And for that reason  you do not have photosynthesis in the deep sea. And with the absence of photosynthesis you have no plant life  and as a result  you have very little animal life living in this underworld. Or so we thought. And so in our initial explorations  we were totally focused on exploring the boundary of creation  looking at the volcanic features running along that entire        miles. Running along this entire        miles are tens of thousands of active volcanoes. Tens of thousands of active volcanoes. There are more active volcanoes beneath the sea than on land by two orders of magnitude. So  it's a phenomenally active region  it's not just a dark  boring place. It's a very alive place. And it's then being ripped open. But we were dealing with a particular scientific issue back then. We couldn't understand why you had a mountain under tension. In plate tectonic theory  we knew that if you had plates collide  it made sense  they would crush into one another  you would thicken the crust  you'd uplift it. That's why you get  you know  you get seashells up on Mount Everest. It's not a flood  it was pushed up there. We understood mountains under compression  but we could not understand why we had a mountain under tension. It should not be. Until one of my colleagues said   It looks to me like a thermal blister  and the mid ocean ridge must be a cooling curve.  We said   Let's go find out.  We punched a bunch of heat probes. Everything made sense  except  at the axis  there was missing heat. It was missing heat. It was hot. It wasn't hot enough. So  we came up with multiple hypotheses  there's little green people down there taking it  there's all sorts of things going on. But the only logical  explanation  was that there were hot springs. So  there must be underwater hot springs. We mounted an expedition to look for the missing heat. And so we went along this mountain range  in an area along Galapagos Rift  and did we find the missing heat. It was amazing. These giant chimneys  huge giant chimneys. We went up to them with our submersible. We wanted to get a temperature probe  we stuck it in there  looked at it    it pegged off scale. The pilot made this great observation   That's hot.  And then we realized our probe was made out of the same stuff    it could have melted. But it turns out the exiting temperature was     degrees F  hot enough to melt lead. This is what a real one looks like  on the Juan de Fuca Ridge. What you're looking at is an incredible pipe organ of chemicals coming out of the ocean. Everything you see in this picture is commercial grade  copper  lead  silver  zinc and gold. So the Easter Bunny has put things in the ocean floor  and you have massive heavy metal deposits that we're making in this mountain range. We're making huge discoveries of large commercial grade ore along this mountain range  but it was dwarfed by what we discovered. We discovered a profusion of life  in a world that it should not exist  in . Giant tube worms     feet tall. I remember having to use vodka    my own vodka    to pickle it because we don't carry formaldehyde. We went and found these incredible clam beds sitting on the barren rock. Large clams  and when we opened them  they didn't look like a clam. And when we cut them open  they didn't have the anatomy of a clam. No mouth  no gut  no digestive system. Their bodies had been totally taken over by another organism  a bacterium  that had figured out how to replicate photosynthesis in the dark  through a process we now call chemosynthesis. None of it in our textbooks. None of this in our textbooks. We did not know about this life system. We were not predicting it. We stumbled on it  looking for some missing heat. So  we wanted to accelerate this process. We wanted to get away from this silly trip  up and down on a submarine  average depth of the ocean         feet  two and half hours to get to work in the morning  two and half hours to get to home. Five hour commute to work. Three hours of bottom time  average distance traveled    one mile. On a        mile mountain range. Great job security  but not the way to go. So  I began designing a new technology of telepresence  using robotic systems to replicate myself  so I wouldn't have to cycle my vehicle system. We began to introduce that in our explorations  and we continued to make phenomenal discoveries with our new robotic technologies. Again  looking for something else  moving from one part of the mid ocean ridge to another. The scientists were off watch and they came across incredible life forms. They came across new creatures they had not seen before. But more importantly  they discovered edifices down there that they did not understand. That did not make sense. They were not above a magma chamber. They shouldn't be there. And we called it Lost City. And Lost City was characterized by these incredible limestone formations and upside down pools. Look at that. How do you do that  That's water upside down. We went in underneath and tapped it  and we found that it had the pH of Drano. The pH of     and yet it had chemosynthetic bacteria living in it and at this extreme environment. And the hydrothermal vents were in an acidic environment. All the way at the other end  in an alkaline environment  at a pH of     life existed. So life was much more creative than we had ever thought. Again  discovered by accident. Just two years ago working off Santorini  where people are sunning themselves on the beach  unbeknownst to them in the caldera nearby  we found phenomenal hydrothermal vent systems and more life systems. This was two miles from where people go to sunbathe  and they were oblivious to the existence of this system. Again  you know  we stop at the water's edge. Recently  diving off    in the Gulf of Mexico  finding pools of water  this time not upside down  right side up. Bingo. You'd think you're in air  until a fish swims by. You're looking at brine pools formed by salt diapirs. Near that was methane. I've never seen volcanoes of methane. Instead of belching out lava  they were belching out big  big bubbles of methane. And they were creating these volcanoes  and there were flows  not of lava  but of the mud coming out of the Earth but driven by    I've never seen this before. Moving on  there's more than just natural history beneath the sea    human history. Our discoveries of the Titanic. The realization that the deep sea is the largest museum on Earth. It contains more history than all of the museums on land combined. And yet we're only now penetrating it. Finding the state of preservation. We found the Bismarck in        feet. We then found the Yorktown. People always ask   Did you find the right ship   It said Yorktown on the stern. More recently  finding ancient history. How many ancient mariners have had a bad day  The number's a million. We've been discovering these along ancient trade routes  where they're not supposed to be. This shipwreck sank     years before the birth of Christ. This one sank carrying a prefabricated  Home Depot Roman temple. And then here's one that sank at the time of Homer  at     B.C. More recently  into the Black Sea  where we're exploring. Because there's no oxygen there  it's the largest reservoir of hydrogen sulfide on Earth. Shipwrecks are perfectly preserved. All their organics are perfectly preserved. We begin to excavate them. We expect to start hauling out the bodies in perfect condition with their DNA. Look at the state of preservation    still the ad mark of a carpenter. Look at the state of those artifacts. You still see the beeswax dripping. When they dropped  they sealed it. This ship sank       years ago. Fortunately  we've been able to convince Congress. We begin to go on the Hill and lobby. And we stole recently a ship from the United States Navy. The Okeanos Explorer on its mission. Its mission is as good as you could get. Its mission is to go where no one has gone before on planet Earth. And I was looking at it yesterday  it's up in Seattle. OK. It comes online this summer  and it begins its journey of exploration. But we have no idea what we're going find when we go out there with our technology. But certainly  it's going to be going to the unknown America. This is that part of the United States that lies beneath the sea. We own all of that blue and yet  like I say  particularly the western territorial trust  we don't have maps of them. We don't have maps of them. We have maps of Venus  but not of the western territorial trust. The way we're going to run this    we have no idea what we're going to discover. We have no idea what we're going to discover. We're going to discover an ancient shipwreck  a Phoenician off Brazil  or a new rock formation  a new life. So  we're going to run it like an emergency hospital. We're going to connect our command center  via a high bandwidth satellite link to a building we're building at the University of Rhode Island  called the Interspace Center. And within that  we're going to run it just like you run a nuclear submarine  blue gold team  switching them off and on  running    hours a day. A discovery is made  that discovery is instantly seen in the command center a second later. But then it's connected through Internet too    the new Internet highway that makes Internet one look like a dirt road on the information highway    with    gigabits of bandwidth. We'll go into areas we have no knowledge of. It's a big blank sheet on our planet. We'll map it within hours  have the maps disseminated out to the major universities. It turns out that    percent of all the oceanographic intellect in this country are at    universities. They're all on I  . We can then build a command center. This is a remote center at the University of Washington. She's talking to the pilot. She's       miles away  but she's assumed command. But the beauty of this  too  is we can then disseminate it to children. We can disseminate. They can follow this expedition. I've started a program    where are you Jim  Jim Young who helped me start a program called the Jason Project. More recently  we've started a program with the Boys and Girls Clubs of America  so that we can use exploration  and the excitement of live exploration  to motivate them and excite them and then give them what they're already ready for. I would not let an adult drive my robot. You don't have enough gaming experience. But I will let a kid with no license take over control of my vehicle system. Because we want to create    we want to create the classroom of tomorrow. We have stiff competition and we need to motivate and it's all being done. You win or lose an engineer or a scientist by eighth grade. The game is not over    it's over by the eighth grade  it's not beginning. We need to be not only proud of our universities. We need to be proud of our middle schools. And when we have the best middle schools in the world  we'll have the best kids pumped out of that system  let me tell you. Because this is what we want. This is what we want. This is a young lady  not watching a football game  not watching a basketball game. Watching exploration live from thousands of miles away  and it's just dawning on her what she's seeing. And when you get a jaw drop  you can inform. You can put so much information into that mind  it's in full  receiving  mode. This  I hope  will be a future engineer or a future scientist in the battle for truth. And my final question  my final question    why are we not looking at moving out onto the sea  Why do we have programs to build habitation on Mars  and we have programs to look at colonizing the moon  but we do not have a program looking at how we colonize our own planet  And the technology is at hand. Thank you very much. Being a child  and sort of crawling around the house  I remember these Turkish carpets  and there were these scenes  these battle scenes  these love scenes. I mean  look  this animal is trying to fight back this spear from this soldier. And my mom took these pictures actually  last week  of our carpets  and I remember this to this day. There was another object  this sort of towering piece of furniture with creatures and gargoyles and nudity    pretty scary stuff  when you're a little kid. What I remember today from this is that objects tell stories  so storytelling has been a really strong influence in my work. And then there was another influence. I was a teenager  and at    or     I guess like all teenagers  we want to just do what we love and what we believe in. And so  I fused together the two things I loved the most  which was skiing and windsurfing. Those are pretty good escapes from the drab weather in Switzerland. So  I created this compilation of the two  I took my skis and I took a board and I put a mast foot in there  and some foot straps  and some metal fins  and here I was  going really fast on frozen lakes. It was really a death trap. I mean  it was incredible  it worked incredibly well  but it was really dangerous. And I realized then I had to go to design school. I mean  look at those graphics there. So  I went to design school  and it was the early '  s when I finished. And I saw something extraordinary happening in Silicon Valley  so I wanted to be there  and I saw that the computer was coming into our homes  that it had to change in order to be with us in our homes. And so I got myself a job and I was working for a consultancy  and we would get in to these meetings  and these managers would come in  and they would say   Well  what we're going to do here is really important  you know.  And they would give the projects code names  you know  mostly from  Star Wars   actually  things like C PO  Yoda  Luke. So  in anticipation  I would be this young designer in the back of the room  and I would raise my hand  and I would ask questions. I mean  in retrospect  probably stupid questions  but things like   What's this Caps Lock key for   or  What's this Num Lock key for   You know  that thing   You know  do people really use it  Do they need it  Do they want it in their homes   What I realized then is  they didn't really want to change the legacy stuff  they didn't want to change the insides. They were really looking for us  the designers  to create the skins  to put some pretty stuff outside of the box. And I didn't want to be a colorist. It wasn't what I wanted to do. I didn't want to be a stylist in this way. And then I saw this quote   advertising is the price companies pay for being unoriginal.  So  I had to start on my own. So I moved to San Francisco  and I started a little company  fuseproject. And what I wanted to work on is important stuff. And I wanted to really not just work on the skins  but I wanted to work on the entire human experience. And so the first projects were sort of humble  but they took technology and maybe made it into things that people would use in a new way  and maybe finding some new functionality. This is a watch we made for Mini Cooper  the car company  right when it launched  and it's the first watch that has a display that switches from horizontal to vertical. And that allows me to check my timer discretely  here  without bending my elbow. And other projects  which were really about transformation  about matching the human need. This is a little piece of furniture for an Italian manufacturer  and it ships completely flat  and then it folds into a coffee table and a stool and whatnot. And something a little bit more experimental  this is a light fixture for Swarovski  and what it does is  it changes shape. So  it goes from a circle  to a round  to a square  to a figure eight. And just by drawing on a little computer tablet  the entire light fixture adjusts to what shape you want. And then finally  the leaf lamp for Herman Miller. This is a pretty involved process  it took us about four and a half years. But I really was looking for creating a unique experience of light  a new experience of light. So  we had to design both the light and the light bulb. And that's a unique opportunity  I would say  in design. And the new experience I was looking for is giving the choice for the user to go from a warm  sort of glowing kind of mood light  all the way to a bright work light. So  the light bulb actually does that. It allows the person to switch  and to mix these two colorations. And it's done in a very simple way  one just touches the base of the light  and on one side  you can mix the brightness  and on the other  the coloration of the light. So  all of these projects have a humanistic sense to them  and I think as designers we need to really think about how we can create a different relationship between our work and the world  whether it's for business  or  as I'm going to show  on some civic type projects. Because I think everybody agrees that as designers we bring value to business  value to the users also  but I think it's the values that we put into these projects that ultimately create the greater value. And the values we bring can be about environmental issues  about sustainability  about lower power consumption. You know  they can be about function and beauty  they can be about business strategy. But designers are really the glue that brings these things together. So Jawbone is a project that you're familiar with  and it has a humanistic technology. It feels your skin. It rests on your skin  and it knows when it is you're talking. And by knowing when it is you're talking  it gets rid of the other noises that it knows about  which is the environmental noises. But the other thing that is humanistic about Jawbone is that we really decided to take out all the techie stuff  and all the nerdy stuff out of it  and try to make it as beautiful as we can. I mean  think about it  the care we take in selecting sunglasses  or jewelry  or accessories is really important  so if it isn't beautiful  it really doesn't belong on your face. And this is what we're pursuing here. But how we work on Jawbone is really unique. I want to point at something here  on the left. This is the board  this is one of the things that goes inside that makes this technology work. But this is the design process  there's somebody changing the board  putting tracers on the board  changing the location of the ICs  as the designers on the other side are doing the work. So  it's not about slapping skins  anymore  on a technology. It's really about designing from the inside out. And then  on the other side of the room  the designers are making small adjustments  sketching  drawing by hand  putting it in the computer. And it's what I call being design driven. You know  there is some push and pull  but design is really helping define the whole experience from the inside out. And then  of course  design is never done. And this is    the other new way that is unique in how we work is  because it's never done  you have to do all this other stuff. The packaging  and the website  and you need to continue to really touch the user  in many ways. But how do you retain somebody  when it's never done  And Hosain Rahman  the CEO of Aliph Jawbone  you know  really understands that you need a different structure. So  in a way  the different structure is that we're partners  it's a partnership. We can continue to work and dedicate ourselves to this project  and then we also share in the rewards. And here's another project  another partnership type approach. This is called Y Water  and it's this guy from Los Angeles  Thomas Arndt  Austrian originally  who came to us  and all he wanted to do was to create a healthy drink  or an organic drink for his kids  to replace the high sugar content sodas that he's trying to get them away from. So  we worked on this bottle  and it's completely symmetrical in every dimension. And this allows the bottle to turn into a game. The bottles connect together  and you can create different shapes  different forms. Thank you. And then while we were doing this  the shape of the bottle upside down reminded us of a Y  and then we thought  well these words   why  and  why not   are probably the most important words that kids ask. So we called it Y Water. And so this is another place where it all comes together in the same room  the three dimensional design  the ideas  the branding  it all becomes deeply connected. And then the other thing about this project is  we bring intellectual property  we bring a marketing approach  we bring all this stuff  but I think  at the end of the day  what we bring is these values  and these values create a soul for the companies we work with. And it's especially rewarding when your design work becomes a creative endeavor  when others can be creative and do more with it. Here's another project  which I think really emulates that. This is the One Laptop per Child  the      laptop. This picture is incredible. In Nigeria  people carry their most precious belongings on their heads. This girl is going to school with a laptop on her head. I mean  to me  it just means so much. But when Nicholas Negroponte    and he has spoken about this project a lot  he's the founder of OLPC    came to us about two and a half years ago  there were some clear ideas. He wanted to bring education and he wanted to bring technology  and those are pillars of his life  but also pillars of the mission of One Laptop per Child. But the third pillar that he talked about was design. And at the time  I wasn't really working on computers. I didn't really want to  from the previous adventure. But what he said was really significant  is that design was going to be why the kids were going to love this product  how we were going to make it low cost  robust. And plus  he said he was going to get rid of the Caps Lock key    and the Num Lock key  too. So  I was convinced. We designed it to be iconic  to look different. To look like it's for a kid  but not like a toy. And then the integration of all these great technologies  which you've heard about  the Wi Fi antennas that allow the kids to connect  the screen  which you can read in sunlight  the keyboard  which is made out of rubber  and it's protected from the environment. You know  all these great technologies really happened because of the passion and the OLPC people and the engineers. They fought the suppliers  they fought the manufacturers. I mean  they fought like animals for this to remain they way it is. And in a way  it is that will that makes projects like this one    allows the process from not destroying the original idea. And I think this is something really important. So  now you get these pictures    you get up in the morning  and you see the kids in Nigeria and you see them in Uruguay with their computers  and in Mongolia. And we went away from obviously the beige. I mean it's colorful  it's fun. In fact  you can see each logo is a little bit different. It's because we were able to run  during the manufacturing process     colors for the X and the O  which is the name of the computer  and by mixing them on the manufacturing floor  you get    times     you get     different options there. So  the lessons from seeing the kids using them in the developing world are incredible. But this is my nephew  Anthony  in Switzerland  and he had the laptop for an afternoon  and I had to take it back. It was hard. And it was a prototype. And a month and a half later  I come back to Switzerland  and there he is playing with his own version. Like paper  paper and cardboard. So  I'm going to finish with one last project  and this is a little bit more of adult play. Some of you might have heard about the New York City condom. It's actually just launched  actually launched on Valentine's Day  February     about    days ago. So  the Department of Health in New York came to us  and they needed a way to distribute    million condoms for free to the citizens of New York. So a pretty big endeavor  and we worked on the dispensers. These are the dispensers. There's this friendly shape. It's a little bit like designing a fire hydrant  and it has to be easily serviceable  you have to know where it is and what it does. And we also designed the condoms themselves. And I was just in New York at the launch  and I went to see all these places where they're installed  this is at a Puerto Rican little mom and pop store  at a bar in Christopher Street  at a pool hall. I mean  they're being installed in homeless clinics    everywhere. Of course  clubs and discos  too. And here's the public service announcement for this project. Get some. So  this is really where design is able to create a conversation. I was in these venues  and people were  you know  really into getting them. They were excited. It was breaking the ice  it was getting over a stigma  and I think that's also what design can do. So  I was going to throw some condoms in the room and whatnot  but I'm not sure it's the etiquette here. Yeah  All right  all right. I have only a few. So  I have more  you can always ask me for some more later. And if anybody asks why you're carrying a condom  you can just say you like the design. So  I'll finish with just one thought  if we all work together on creating value  but if we really keep in mind the values of the work that we do  I think we can change the work that we do. We can change these values  can change the companies we work with  and eventually  together  maybe we can change the world. So  thank you. A few words about how I got started  and it has a lot to do with happiness  actually. When I was a very young child  I was extremely introverted and very much to myself. And  kind of as a way of surviving  I would go into my own very personal space  and I would make things. I would make things for people as a way of  you know  giving  showing them my love. I would go into these private places  and I would put my ideas and my passions into objects    and sort of learning how to speak with my hands. So  the whole activity of working with my hands and creating objects is very much connected with not only the idea realm  but also with very much the feeling realm. And the ideas are very disparate. I'm going to show you many different kinds of pieces  and there's no real connection between one or the other  except that they sort of come out of my brain  and they're all different sort of thoughts that are triggered by looking at life  and seeing nature and seeing objects  and just having kind of playful random thoughts about things. When I was a child  I started to explore motion. I fell in love with the way things moved  so I started to explore motion by making little flipbooks. And this is one that I did  probably like when I was around seventh grade  and I remember when I was doing this  I was thinking about that little rock there  and the pathway of the vehicles as they would fly through the air  and how the characters    would come shooting out of the car  so  on my mind  I was thinking about the trajectory of the vehicles. And of course  when you're a little kid  there's always destruction. So  it has to end with this    gratuitous violence. So that was how I first started to explore the way things moved  and expressed it. Now  when I went to college  I found myself making fairly complicated  fragile machines. And this really came about from having many different kinds of interests. When I was in high school  I loved to program computers  so I sort of liked the logical flow of events. I was also very interested in perhaps going into surgery and becoming a surgeon  because it meant working with my hands in a very focused  intense way. So  I started taking art courses  and I found a way to make sculpture that brought together my love for being very precise with my hands  with coming up with different kinds of logical flows of energy through a system. And also  working with wire    everything that I did was both a visual and a mechanical engineering decision at the same time. So  I was able to sort of exercise all of that. Now  this kind of machine is as close as I can get to painting. And it's full of many little trivial end points  like there's a little foot here that just drags around in circles and it doesn't really mean anything. It's really just for the sort of joy of its own triviality. The connection I have with engineering is the same as any other engineer  in that I love to solve problems. I love to figure things out  but the end result of what I'm doing is really completely ambiguous. That's pretty ambiguous. The next piece that is going to come up is an example of a kind of machine that is fairly complex. I gave myself the problem. Since I'm always liking to solve problems  I gave myself the problem of turning a crank in one direction  and solving all of the mechanical problems for getting this little man to walk back and forth. So  when I started this  I didn't have an overall plan for the machine  but I did have a sense of the gesture  and a sense of the shape and how it would occupy space. And then it was a matter of starting from one point and sort of building to that final point. That little gear there switches back and forth to change direction. And that's a little found object. So a lot of the pieces that I've made  they involve found objects. And it really    it's almost like doing visual puns all the time. When I see objects  I imagine them in motion. I imagine what can be said with them. This next one here   Machine with Wishbone   it came about from playing with this wishbone after dinner. You know  they say  never play with your food    but I always play with things. So  I had this wishbone  and I thought  it's kind of like a cowboy who's been on his horse for too long. And I started to make him walk across the table  and I thought   Oh  I can make a little machine that will do that.  So  I made this device  linked it up  and the wishbone walks. And because the wishbone is bone    it's animal    it's sort of a point where I think we can enter into it. And that's the whole piece. That's about that big. This kind of work is also very much like puppetry  where the found object is  in a sense  the puppet  and I'm the puppeteer at first  because I'm playing with an object. But then I make the machine  which is sort of the stand in for me  and it is able to achieve the action that I want. The next piece I'll show you is a much more conceptual thought  and it's a little piece called  Cory's Yellow Chair.  I had this image in my mind  when I saw my son's little chair  and I saw it explode up and out. And    so the way I saw this in my mind at first  was that the pieces would explode up and out with infinite speed  and the pieces would move far out  and then they would begin to be pulled back with a kind of a gravitational feel  to the point where they would approach infinite speed back to the center. And they would coalesce for just a moment  so you could perceive that there was a chair there. For me  it's kind of a feeling about the fleetingness of the present moment  and I wanted to express that. Now  the machine is    in this case  it's a real approximation of that  because obviously you can't move physical matter infinitely with infinite speed and have it stop instantaneously. This whole thing is about four feet wide  and the chair itself is only about a few inches. Now  this is a funny sort of conceptual thing  and yesterday we were talking about Danny Hillis'         Year Clock.  So  we have a motor here on the left  and it goes through a gear train. There are    pairs of      reductions  so that means that the final speed of that gear on the end is so slow that it would take two trillion years to turn once. So I've invented it in concrete  because it doesn't really matter. Because it could run all the time. Now  a completely different thought. I'm always imagining myself in different situations. I'm imagining myself as a machine. What would I love  I would love to be bathed in oil. So  this machine does nothing but just bathe itself in oil. And it's really  just sort of    for me  it was just really about the lusciousness of oil. And then  I got a call from a friend who wanted to have a show of erotic art  and I didn't have any pieces. But when she suggested to be in the show  this piece came to mind. So  it's sort of related  but you can see it's much more overtly erotic. And this one I call  Machine with Grease.  It's just continually ejaculating  and it's    this is a happy machine  I'll tell you. It's definitely happy. From an engineering point of view  this is just a little four bar linkage. And then again  this is a found object  a little fan that I found. And I thought  what about the gesture of opening the fan  and how simply could I state something. And  in a case like this  I'm trying to make something which is clear but also not suggestive of any particular kind of animal or plant. For me  the process is very important  because I'm inventing machines  but I'm also inventing tools to make machines  and the whole thing is all sort of wrapped up from the beginning. So this is a little wire bending tool. After many years of bending gears with a pair of pliers  I made that tool  and then I made this other tool for sort of centering gears very quickly    sort of developing my own little world of technology. My life completely changed when I found a spot welder. And that was that tool. It completely changed what I could do. Now here  I'm going to do a very poor job of silver soldering. This is not the way they teach you to silver solder when you're in school. I just like  throw it in. I mean  real jewelers put little bits of solder in. So  that's a finished gear. When I moved to Boston  I joined a group called the World Sculpture Racing Society. And the idea  their premise was that we wanted to show pieces of sculpture on the street  and there'd be no subjective decision about what was the best. It would be    whatever came across the finish line first would be the winner. So I made    this is my first racing sculpture  and I thought   Oh  I'm going to make a cart  and I'm going to have it    I'm going to have my hand writing 'faster ' so as I run down the street  the cart's going to talk to me and it's going to go  'Faster  faster '   So  that's what it does. But then in the end  what I decided was every time you finish writing the word  I would stop and I would give the card to somebody on the side of the road. So I would never win the race because I'm always stopping. But I had a lot of fun. Now  I only have two and a half minutes    I'm going to play this. This is a piece that  for me  is in some ways the most complete kind of piece. Because when I was a kid  I also played a lot of guitar. And when I had this thought  I was imagining that I would make    I would have a whole machine theater evening  where I would    you would have an audience  the curtain would open  and you'd be entertained by machines on stage. So  I imagined a very simple gestural dance that would be between a machine and just a very simple chair  and ... When I'm making these pieces  I'm always trying to find a point where I'm saying something very clearly and it's very simple  but also at the same time it's very ambiguous. And I think there's a point between simplicity and ambiguity which can allow a viewer to perhaps take something from it. And that leads me to the thought that all of these pieces start off in my own mind  in my heart  and I do my best at finding ways to express them with materials  and it always feels really crude. It's always a struggle  but somehow I manage to sort of get this thought out into an object  and then it's there  OK. It means nothing at all. The object itself just means nothing. Once it's perceived  and someone brings it into their own mind  then there's a cycle that has been completed. And to me  that's the most important thing because  ever since being a kid  I've wanted to communicate my passion and love. And that means the complete cycle of coming from inside  out to the physical  to someone perceiving it. So I'll just let this chair come down. Thank you. Just to put everything in context  and to kind of give you a background to where I'm coming from  so that a lot of the things I'm going to say  and the things I'm going to do    or things I'm going to tell you I've done    you will understand exactly why and how I got motivated to be where I am. I graduated high school in Cleveland  Ohio      . And just like my parents did when they finished studying abroad  we went back home. Finished university education  got a medical degree      . And by the time I was an intern house officer  I could barely afford to maintain my mother's    year old car    and I was a paid doctor. This brings us to why a lot of us  who are professionals  are now  as they say  in diaspora. Now  are we going to make that a permanent thing  where we all get trained  and we leave  and we don't go back  Perhaps not  I should certainly hope not    because that is not my vision. All right  for good measure  that's where Nigeria is on the African map  and just there is the Delta region that I'm sure everybody's heard of. People getting kidnapped  where the oil comes from  the oil that sometimes I think has driven us all crazy in Nigeria. But  critical poverty  this slide is from a presentation I gave not that long ago. Gapminder.org tells the story of the gap between Africa and the rest of the world in terms of health care. Very interesting. How many people do you think are on that taxi  And believe it or not  that is a taxi in Nigeria. And the capital    well  what used to be the capital of Nigeria    Lagos  that's a taxi  and you have police on them. So  tell me  how many policemen do you think are on this taxi  And now  Three. So  when these kind of people    and  believe me  it's not just the police that use these taxis in Lagos. We all do. I've been on one of these  and I didn't have a helmet  either. And it just reminds me of the thought of what happens when one of us on a taxi like this falls off  has an accident and needs a hospital. Believe it or not  some of us do survive. Some of us do survive malaria  we do survive AIDS. And like I tell my family  and my wife reminds me every time   You're risking your life  you know  every time you go to that country.  And she's right. Every time you go there  you know that if you actually need critical care    critical care of any sort    if you have an accident    of which there are many  there are accidents everywhere    where do they go  Where do they go when they need help for this kind of stuff  I'm not saying instead of  I'm saying as well as  AIDS  TB  malaria  typhoid    the list goes on. I'm saying  where do they go when they're like me  When I go back home    and I do all kinds of things  I teach  I train    but I catch one of these things  or I'm chronically ill with one of those  where do they go  What's the economic impact when one of them dies or becomes disabled  I think it's quite significant. This is where they go. These are not old pictures and these are not from some downtrodden    this is a major hospital. In fact  it's from a major teaching hospital in Nigeria. Now that is less than a year old  in an operating room. That's sterilizing equipment in Nigeria. You remember all that oil  Yes  I'm sorry if it upsets some of you  but I think you need to see this. That's the floor  OK  You can say some of this is education. You can say it's hygiene. I'm not pleading poverty. I'm saying we need more than just  you know  vaccination  malaria  AIDS  because I want to be treated in a proper hospital if something happens to me out there. In fact  when I start running around saying   Hey  boys and girls  you're cardiologists in the U.S.  can you come home with me and do a mission   I want them to think   Well there's some hope.  Now  have a look at that. That's the anesthesiology machine. And that's my specialty  right  Anesthesiology and critical care    look at that bag. It's been taped with tape that we even stopped using in the U.K. And believe me  these are current pictures. Now  if something like this  which has happened in the U.K.  that's where they go. This is the intensive care unit in which I work. All right  this is a slide from a talk I gave about intensive care units in Nigeria  and jokingly we refer to it as  Expensive Scare.  Because it's scary and it's expensive  but we need to have it  OK  So  these are the problems. There are no prizes for telling us what the problems are  are there  I think we all know. And several speakers before and speakers after me are going to tell us even more problems. These are a few of them. So  what did I do  There we go    we're going on a mission. We're going to do some open heart surgery. I was the only Brit  on a team of about nine American cardiac surgeons  cardiac nurse  intensive care nurse. We all went out and did a mission and we've done three of them so far. Just so you know  I do believe in missions  I do believe in aid and I do believe in charity. They have their place  but where do they go for those things we talked about earlier  Because it's not everyone that's going to benefit from a mission. Health is wealth  in the words of Hans Rosling. You get wealthier faster if you are healthy first. So  here we are  mission. Big trouble. Open heart surgery in Nigeria    big trouble. That's Mike  Mike comes out from Mississippi. Does he look like he's happy  It took us two days just to organize the place  but hey  you know  we worked on it. Does he look happy  Yes  that's the medical advice the committee chairman says   Yes  I told you  you weren't going to be able to  you can't do this  I just know it.  Look  that's the technician we had. So yes  you go on  all right  I got him to come with me    anesthesia tech    come with me from the U.K. Yes  let's just go work this thing out. See  that's one of the problems we have in Nigeria and in Africa generally. We get a lot of donated equipment. Equipment that's obsolete  equipment that doesn't quite work  or it works and you can't fix it. And there's nothing wrong with that  so long as we use it and we move on. But we had problems with it. We had severe problems there. He had to get on the phone. This guy was always on the phone. So what we going to do now  It looks like all these Americans are here and yes  one Brit  and he's not going to do anything    he thinks he's British actually  and he's actually Nigerian  I just thought about that. We eventually got it working  is the truth  but it was one of these. Even older than the one you saw. The reason I have this picture here  this X ray  it's just to tell you where and how we were viewing X rays. Do you figure where that is  It was on a window. I mean  what's an X ray viewing box  Please. Well  nowadays everything's on PAX anyway. You look at your X rays on a screen and you do stuff with them  you email them. But we were still using X rays  but we didn't even have a viewing box  And we were doing open heart surgery. OK  I know it's not AIDS  I know it's not malaria  but we still need this stuff. Oh yeah  echo    this was just to get the children ready and the adults ready. People still believe in Voodoo. Heart disease  VSD  hole in the heart  tetralogies. You still get people who believe in it and they came. At    percent oxygen saturation  the normal is about   . Her condition  open heart surgery that as she required  would have been treated when she was a child. We had to do these for adults. So  we did succeed and we still do. We've done three. We're planning another one in July in the north of the country. So  we certainly still do open heart  but you can see the contrast between everything that was shipped in    we ship everything  instruments. We had explosions because the kit was designed and installed by people who weren't used to it. The oxygen tanks didn't quite work right. But how many did we do the first one    . We did    open heart surgical patients successfully. Here is our very first patient  out of intensive care  and just watch that chair  all right  This is what I mean about appropriate technology. That's what he was doing  propping up the bed because the bed simply didn't work. Have you seen one of those before  No  Yes  Doesn't matter  it worked. I'm sure you've all seen or heard this before   We  the willing  have been doing so much with so little for so long       we are now qualified to do anything with nothing.  Thank you. Sustainable Solutions    this was my first company. This one's sole aim is to provide the very things that I think are missing. So  we put my hand in my pocket and say   Guys  let's just buy stuff. Let's go set up a company that teaches people  educates them  gives them the tools they need to keep going.  And that's a perfect example of one. Usually when you buy a ventilator in a hospital  you buy a different one for children  you buy a different one for transport. This one will do everything  and it will do it at half the price and doesn't need compressed air. If you're in America and you don't know about this one  we do  because we make it our duty to find out what's appropriate technology for Africa    what's appropriately priced  does the job  and we move on. Anesthesia machine  multi parameter monitor  operating lights  suction. This little unit here    remember your little    volt plug in the car  that charges your  whatever  Game Boy  telephone  That's exactly how the outlets are designed. Yes  it will take a solar panel. Yes a solar panel will charge it. But if you've got mains as well  it will charge the batteries in there. And guess what  We have a little pedal charger too  just in case. And guess what  if it all fails  if you can find a car that's still got a live battery and you stick it in  it will still work. Then you can customize it. Is it dental surgery you want  General surgery you want  Decide which instruments  stock it up with consumables. And currently we're working on oxygen    oxygen delivery on site. The technology for oxygen delivery is not new. Oxygen concentrators are very old technology. What is new  and what we will have in a few months  I hope  is that ability to use this same renewable energy system to provide and produce oxygen on site. Zeolite    it's not new    zeolite removes nitrogen from air and nitrogen is    percent of air. If you take nitrogen out  what's left  Oxygen  pretty much. So that's not new. What we're doing is applying this technology to it. These are the basic features of my device  or our device. This is what makes it so special. Apart from the awards it's won  it's portable and it's certified. It's registered  the MHRA    and the CE mark  for those who don't know  for Europe  is the equivalent of the FDA in the U.S. If you compare it with what's on the market  price wise  size wise  ease of use  complexity ... This picture was taken last year. These are members of my graduating class      . It was in this gentleman's house in the Potomac  for those of you who are familiar with Maryland. There are too many of us outside and everybody  just to borrow a bit from Hans    Hans Rosling  he's my guy    if the size of the text represents what gets the most attention  it's the problems. But what we really need are African solutions that are appropriate for Africa    looking at the culture  looking at the people  looking at how much money they've got. African people  because they will do it with a passion  I hope. And lots and lots of that little bit down there  sacrifice. You have to do it. Africans have to do it  in conjunction with everyone else. Thank you. So  can we dare to be optimistic  Well  the thesis of  The Bottom Billion  is that a billion people have been stuck living in economies that have been stagnant for    years  and hence diverging from the rest of mankind. And so  the real question to pose is not   Can we be optimistic   It's   How can we give credible hope to that billion people   That  to my mind  is the fundamental challenge now of development. What I'm going to offer you is a recipe  a combination of the two forces that changed the world for good  which is the alliance of compassion and enlightened self interest. Compassion  because a billion people are living in societies that have not offered credible hope. That is a human tragedy. Enlightened self interest  because if that economic divergence continues for another    years  combined with social integration globally  it will build a nightmare for our children. We need compassion to get ourselves started  and enlightened self interest to get ourselves serious. That's the alliance that changes the world. So  what does it mean to get serious about providing hope for the bottom billion  What can we actually do  Well  a good guide is to think   What did we do last time the rich world got serious about developing another region of the world   That gives us  it turns out  quite a good clue  except you have to go back quite a long time. The last time the rich world got serious about developing another region was in the late     s. The rich world was you  America  and the region that needed to be developed was my world  Europe. That was post War Europe. Why did America get serious  It wasn't just compassion for Europe  though there was that. It was that you knew you had to  because  in the late     s  country after country in Central Europe was falling into the Soviet bloc  and so you knew you'd no choice. Europe had to be dragged into economic development. So  what did you do  last time you got serious  Well  yes  you had a big aid program. Thank you very much. That was Marshall aid  we need to do it again. Aid is part of the solution. But what else did you do  Well  you tore up your trade policy  and totally reversed it. Before the war  America had been highly protectionist. After the war  you opened your markets to Europe  you dragged Europe into the then global economy  which was your economy  and you institutionalized that trade liberalization through founding the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. So  total reversal of trade policy. Did you do anything else  Yes  you totally reversed your security policy. Before the war  your security policy had been isolationist. After the war  you tear that up  you put         troops in Europe for over    years. So  total reversal of security policy. Anything else  Yes  you tear up the  Eleventh Commandment     national sovereignty. Before the war  you treated national sovereignty as so sacrosanct that you weren't even willing to join the League of Nations. After the war  you found the United Nations  you found the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  you found the IMF  you encouraged Europe to create the European Community    all systems for mutual government support. That is still the waterfront of effective policies  aid  trade  security  governments. Of course  the details of policy are going to be different  because the challenge is different. It's not rebuilding Europe  it's reversing the divergence for the bottom billion  so that they actually catch up. Is that easier or harder  We need to be at least as serious as we were then. Now  today I'm going to take just one of those four. I'm going to take the one that sounds the weakest  the one that's just motherhood and apple pie    governments  mutual systems of support for governments    and I'm going to show you one idea in how we could do something to strengthen governance  and I'm going to show you that that is enormously important now. The opportunity we're going to look to is a genuine basis for optimism about the bottom billion  and that is the commodity booms. The commodity booms are pumping unprecedented amounts of money into many  though not all  of the countries of the bottom billion. Partly  they're pumping money in because commodity prices are high  but it's not just that. There's also a range of new discoveries. Uganda has just discovered oil  in about the most disastrous location on Earth  Ghana has discovered oil  Guinea has got a huge new exploitation of iron ore coming out of the ground. So  a mass of new discoveries. Between them  these new revenue flows dwarf aid. Just to give you one example  Angola alone is getting    billion dollars a year in oil revenue. The entire aid flows to the    countries of the bottom billion last year were    billion. So  the flow of resources from the commodity booms to the bottom billion are without precedent. So there's the optimism. The question is  how is it going to help their development  It's a huge opportunity for transformational development. Will it be taken  So  here comes a bit of science  and this is a bit of science I've done since  The Bottom Billion   so it's new. I've looked to see what is the relationship between higher commodity prices of exports  and the growth of commodity exporting countries. And I've looked globally  I've taken all the countries in the world for the last    years  and looked to see what the relationship is. And the short run    say  the first five to seven years    is just great. In fact  it's hunky dory  everything goes up. You get more money because your terms of trade have improved  but also that drives up output across the board. So GDP goes up a lot    fantastic  That's the short run. And how about the long run  Come back    years later. Well  the short run  it's hunky dory  but the long run  it's humpty dumpty. You go up in the short run  but then most societies historically have ended up worse than if they'd had no booms at all. That is not a forecast about how commodity prices go  it's a forecast of the consequences  the long term consequences  for growth of an increase in prices. So  what goes wrong  Why is there this  resource curse   as it's called  And again  I've looked at that  and it turns out that the critical issue is the level of governance  the initial level of economic governance  when the resource booms accrue. In fact  if you've got good enough governance  there is no resource boom. You go up in the short term  and then you go up even more in the long term. That's Norway  the richest country in Europe. It's Australia. It's Canada. The resource curse is entirely confined to countries below a threshold of governance. They still go up in the short run. That's what we're seeing across the bottom billion at the moment. The best growth rates they've had    ever. And the question is whether the short run will persist. And with bad governance historically  over the last    years  it hasn't. It's countries like Nigeria  which are worse off than if they'd never had oil. So  there's a threshold level above which you go up in the long term  and below which you go down. Just to benchmark that threshold  it's about the governance level of Portugal in the mid     s. So  the question is  are the bottom billion above or below that threshold  Now  there's one big change since the commodity booms of the     s  and that is the spread of democracy. So I thought  well  maybe that is the thing which has transformed governance in the bottom billion. Maybe we can be more optimistic because of the spread of democracy. So  I looked. Democracy does have significant effects    and unfortunately  they're adverse. Democracies make even more of a mess of these resource booms than autocracies. At that stage I just wanted to abandon the research  but       it turns out that democracy is a little bit more complicated than that. Because there are two distinct aspects of democracy  there's electoral competition  which determines how you acquire power  and there are checks and balances  which determine how you use power. It turns out that electoral competition is the thing that's doing the damage with democracy  whereas strong checks and balances make resource booms good. And so  what the countries of the bottom billion need is very strong checks and balances. They haven't got them. They got instant democracy in the     s  elections without checks and balances. How can we help improve governance and introduce checks and balances  In all the societies of the bottom billion  there are intense struggles to do just that. The simple proposal is that we should have some international standards  which will be voluntary  but which would spell out the key decision points that need to be taken in order to harness these resource revenues. We know these international standards work because we've already got one. It's called the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. That is the very simple idea that governments should report to their citizens what revenues they have. No sooner was it proposed than reformers in Nigeria adopted it  pushed it and published the revenues in the paper. Nigerian newspapers circulations spiked. People wanted to know what their government was getting in terms of revenue. So  we know it works. What would the content be of these international standards  I can't go through all of them  but I'll give you an example. The first is how to take the resources out of the ground    the economic processes  taking the resources out of the ground and putting assets on top of the ground. And the first step in that is selling the rights to resource extraction. You know how rights to resource extraction are being sold at the moment  how they've been sold over the last    years  A company flies in  does a deal with a minister. And that's great for the company  and it's quite often great for the minister       and it's not great for their country. There's a very simple institutional technology which can transform that  and it's called verified auctions. The public agency with the greatest expertise on Earth is of course the treasury    that is  the British Treasury. And the British Treasury decided that it would sell the rights to third generation mobile phones by working out what those rights were worth. They worked out they were worth two billion pounds. Just in time  a set of economists got there and said   Why not try an auction  It'll reveal the value.  It went for    billion pounds through auction. If the British Treasury can be out by a factor of     think what the ministry of finance in Sierra Leone is going to be like. When I put that to the President of Sierra Leone  the next day he asked the World Bank to send him a team to give expertise on how to conduct auctions. There are five such decision points  each one needs an international standard. If we could do it  we would change the world. We would be helping the reformers in these societies  who are struggling for change. That's our modest role. We cannot change these societies  but we can help the people in these societies who are struggling and usually failing  because the odds are so stacked against them. And yet  we've not got these rules. If you think about it  the cost of promulgating international rules is zilch    nothing. Why on Earth are they not there  I realized that the reason they're not there is that until we have a critical mass of informed citizens in our own societies  politicians will get away with gestures. That unless we have an informed society  what politicians do  especially in relation to Africa  is gestures  things that look good  but don't work. And so I realized we had to go through the business of building an informed citizenry. That's why I broke all the professional rules of conduct for an economist  and I wrote an economics book that you could read on a beach. However  I have to say  the process of communication does not come naturally to me. This is why I'm on this stage  but it's alarming. I grew up in a culture of self effacement. My wife showed me a blog comment on one of my last talks  and the blog comment said   Collier is not charismatic       but his arguments are compelling.  If you agree with that sentiment  and if you agree that we need a critical mass of informed citizenry  you will realize that I need you. Please  become ambassadors. Thank you. Cultural evolution is a dangerous child for any species to let loose on its planet. By the time you realize what's happening  the child is a toddler  up and causing havoc  and it's too late to put it back. We humans are Earth's Pandoran species. We're the ones who let the second replicator out of its box  and we can't push it back in. We're seeing the consequences all around us. Now that  I suggest  is the view that comes out of taking memetics seriously. And it gives us a new way of thinking about not only what's going on on our planet  but what might be going on elsewhere in the cosmos. So first of all  I'd like to say something about memetics and the theory of memes  and secondly  how this might answer questions about who's out there  if indeed anyone is. So  memetics  memetics is founded on the principle of Universal Darwinism. Darwin had this amazing idea. Indeed  some people say it's the best idea anybody ever had. Isn't that a wonderful thought  that there could be such a thing as a best idea anybody ever had  Do you think there could  Audience  No. Susan Blackmore  Someone says no  very loudly  from over there. Well  I say yes  and if there is  I give the prize to Darwin. Why  Because the idea was so simple  and yet it explains all design in the universe. I would say not just biological design  but all of the design that we think of as human design. It's all just the same thing happening. What did Darwin say  I know you know the idea  natural selection  but let me just paraphrase  The Origin of Species         in a few sentences. What Darwin said was something like this  if you have creatures that vary  and that can't be doubted    I've been to the Galapagos  and I've measured the size of the beaks and the size of the turtle shells and so on  and so on. And     pages later. And if there is a struggle for life  such that nearly all of these creatures die    and this can't be doubted  I've read Malthus and I've calculated how long it would take for elephants to cover the whole world if they bred unrestricted  and so on and so on. And another     pages later. And if the very few that survive pass onto their offspring whatever it was that helped them survive  then those offspring must be better adapted to the circumstances in which all this happened than their parents were. You see the idea  If  if  if  then. He had no concept of the idea of an algorithm  but that's what he described in that book  and this is what we now know as the evolutionary algorithm. The principle is you just need those three things    variation  selection and heredity. And as Dan Dennett puts it  if you have those  then you must get evolution. Or design out of chaos  without the aid of mind. There's one word I love on that slide. What do you think my favorite word is  Audience  Chaos. SB  Chaos  No. What  Mind  No. Audience  Without. SB  No  not without. You try them all in order  Mmm...  Audience  Must. SB  Must  at must. Must  must. This is what makes it so amazing. You don't need a designer  or a plan  or foresight  or anything else. If there's something that is copied with variation and it's selected  then you must get design appearing out of nowhere. You can't stop it. Must is my favorite word there. Now  what's this to do with memes  Well  the principle here applies to anything that is copied with variation and selection. We're so used to thinking in terms of biology  we think about genes this way. Darwin didn't  of course  he didn't know about genes. He talked mostly about animals and plants  but also about languages evolving and becoming extinct. But the principle of Universal Darwinism is that any information that is varied and selected will produce design. And this is what Richard Dawkins was on about in his      bestseller   The Selfish Gene.  The information that is copied  he called the replicator. It selfishly copies. Not meaning it kind of sits around inside cells going   I want to get copied.  But that it will get copied if it can  regardless of the consequences. It doesn't care about the consequences because it can't  because it's just information being copied. And he wanted to get away from everybody thinking all the time about genes  and so he said   Is there another replicator out there on the planet   Ah  yes  there is. Look around you    here will do  in this room. All around us  still clumsily drifting about in its primeval soup of culture  is another replicator. Information that we copy from person to person  by imitation  by language  by talking  by telling stories  by wearing clothes  by doing things. This is information copied with variation and selection. This is design process going on. He wanted a name for the new replicator. So  he took the Greek word  mimeme   which means that which is imitated. Remember that  that's the core definition  that which is imitated. And abbreviated it to meme  just because it sounds good and made a good meme  an effective spreading meme. So that's how the idea came about. It's important to stick with that definition. The whole science of memetics is much maligned  much misunderstood  much feared. But a lot of these problems can be avoided by remembering the definition. A meme is not equivalent to an idea. It's not an idea. It's not equivalent to anything else  really. Stick with the definition. It's that which is imitated  or information which is copied from person to person. So  let's see some memes. Well  you sir  you've got those glasses hung around your neck in that particularly fetching way. I wonder whether you invented that idea for yourself  or copied it from someone else  If you copied it from someone else  it's a meme. And what about  oh  I can't see any interesting memes here. All right everyone  who's got some interesting memes for me  Oh  well  your earrings  I don't suppose you invented the idea of earrings. You probably went out and bought them. There are plenty more in the shops. That's something that's passed on from person to person. All the stories that we're telling    well  of course  TED is a great meme fest  masses of memes. The way to think about memes  though  is to think  why do they spread  They're selfish information  they will get copied  if they can. But some of them will be copied because they're good  or true  or useful  or beautiful. Some of them will be copied even though they're not. Some  it's quite hard to tell why. There's one particular curious meme which I rather enjoy. And I'm glad to say  as I expected  I found it when I came here  and I'm sure all of you found it  too. You go to your nice  posh  international hotel somewhere  and you come in and you put down your clothes and you go to the bathroom  and what do you see  Audience  Bathroom soap. SB  Pardon  Audience  Soap. SB  Soap  yeah. What else do you see  Audience   Inaudible  SB  Mmm mmm. Audience  Sink  toilet  SB  Sink  toilet  yes  these are all memes  they're all memes  but they're sort of useful ones  and then there's this one. What is this one doing  This has spread all over the world. It's not surprising that you all found it when you arrived in your bathrooms here. But I took this photograph in a toilet at the back of a tent in the eco camp in the jungle in Assam. Who folded that thing up there  and why  Some people get carried away. Other people are just lazy and make mistakes. Some hotels exploit the opportunity to put even more memes with a little sticker. What is this all about  I suppose it's there to tell you that somebody's cleaned the place  and it's all lovely. And you know  actually  all it tells you is that another person has potentially spread germs from place to place. So  think of it this way. Imagine a world full of brains and far more memes than can possibly find homes. The memes are all trying to get copied    trying  in inverted commas    i.e.  that's the shorthand for  if they can get copied  they will. They're using you and me as their propagating  copying machinery  and we are the meme machines. Now  why is this important  Why is this useful  or what does it tell us  It gives us a completely new view of human origins and what it means to be human  all conventional theories of cultural evolution  of the origin of humans  and what makes us so different from other species. All other theories explaining the big brain  and language  and tool use and all these things that make us unique  are based upon genes. Language must have been useful for the genes. Tool use must have enhanced our survival  mating and so on. It always comes back  as Richard Dawkins complained all that long time ago  it always comes back to genes. The point of memetics is to say   Oh no  it doesn't.  There are two replicators now on this planet. From the moment that our ancestors  perhaps two and a half million years ago or so  began imitating  there was a new copying process. Copying with variation and selection. A new replicator was let loose  and it could never be    right from the start    it could never be that human beings who let loose this new creature  could just copy the useful  beautiful  true things  and not copy the other things. While their brains were having an advantage from being able to copy    lighting fires  keeping fires going  new techniques of hunting  these kinds of things    inevitably they were also copying putting feathers in their hair  or wearing strange clothes  or painting their faces  or whatever. So  you get an arms race between the genes which are trying to get the humans to have small economical brains and not waste their time copying all this stuff  and the memes themselves  like the sounds that people made and copied    in other words  what turned out to be language    competing to get the brains to get bigger and bigger. So  the big brain  on this theory  is driven by the memes. This is why  in  The Meme Machine   I called it memetic drive. As the memes evolve  as they inevitably must  they drive a bigger brain that is better at copying the memes that are doing the driving. This is why we've ended up with such peculiar brains  that we like religion  and music  and art. Language is a parasite that we've adapted to  not something that was there originally for our genes  on this view. And like most parasites  it can begin dangerous  but then it coevolves and adapts  and we end up with a symbiotic relationship with this new parasite. And so  from our perspective  we don't realize that that's how it began. So  this is a view of what humans are. All other species on this planet are gene machines only  they don't imitate at all well  hardly at all. We alone are gene machines and meme machines as well. The memes took a gene machine and turned it into a meme machine. But that's not all. We have a new kind of memes now. I've been wondering for a long time  since I've been thinking about memes a lot  is there a difference between the memes that we copy    the words we speak to each other  the gestures we copy  the human things    and all these technological things around us  I have always  until now  called them all memes  but I do honestly think now we need a new word for technological memes. Let's call them techno memes or temes. Because the processes are getting different. We began  perhaps       years ago  with writing. We put the storage of memes out there on a clay tablet  but in order to get true temes and true teme machines  you need to get the variation  the selection and the copying  all done outside of humans. And we're getting there. We're at this extraordinary point where we're nearly there  that there are machines like that. And indeed  in the short time I've already been at TED  I see we're even closer than I thought we were before. So actually  now the temes are forcing our brains to become more like teme machines. Our children are growing up very quickly learning to read  learning to use machinery. We're going to have all kinds of implants  drugs that force us to stay awake all the time. We'll think we're choosing these things  but the temes are making us do it. So  we're at this cusp now of having a third replicator on our planet. Now  what about what else is going on out there in the universe  Is there anyone else out there  People have been asking this question for a long time. We've been asking it here at TED already. In       Frank Drake made his famous equation  but I think he concentrated on the wrong things. It's been very productive  that equation. He wanted to estimate N  the number of communicative civilizations out there in our galaxy  and he included in there the rate of star formation  the rate of planets  but crucially  intelligence. I think that's the wrong way to think about it. Intelligence appears all over the place  in all kinds of guises. Human intelligence is only one kind of a thing. But what's really important is the replicators you have and the levels of replicators  one feeding on the one before. So  I would suggest that we don't think intelligence  we think replicators. And on that basis  I've suggested a different kind of equation. A very simple equation. N  the same thing  the number of communicative civilizations out there  that  we might expect in our galaxy. Just start with the number of planets there are in our galaxy. The fraction of those which get a first replicator. The fraction of those that get the second replicator. The fraction of those that get the third replicator. Because it's only the third replicator that's going to reach out    sending information  sending probes  getting out there  and communicating with anywhere else. OK  so if we take that equation  why haven't we heard from anybody out there  Because every step is dangerous. Getting a new replicator is dangerous. You can pull through  we have pulled through  but it's dangerous. Take the first step  as soon as life appeared on this earth. We may take the Gaian view. I loved Peter Ward's talk yesterday    it's not Gaian all the time. Actually  life forms produce things that kill themselves. Well  we did pull through on this planet. But then  a long time later  billions of years later  we got the second replicator  the memes. That was dangerous  all right. Think of the big brain. How many mothers do we have here  You know all about big brains. They are dangerous to give birth to  are agonizing to give birth to. My cat gave birth to four kittens  purring all the time. Ah  mm    slightly different. But not only is it painful  it kills lots of babies  it kills lots of mothers  and it's very expensive to produce. The genes are forced into producing all this myelin  all the fat to myelinate the brain. Do you know  sitting here  your brain is using about    percent of your body's energy output for two percent of your body weight  It's a really expensive organ to run. Why  Because it's producing the memes. Now  it could have killed us off. It could have killed us off  and maybe it nearly did  but you see  we don't know. But maybe it nearly did. Has it been tried before  What about all those other species  Louise Leakey talked yesterday about how we're the only one in this branch left. What happened to the others  Could it be that this experiment in imitation  this experiment in a second replicator  is dangerous enough to kill people off  Well  we did pull through  and we adapted. But now  we're hitting  as I've just described  we're hitting the third replicator point. And this is even more dangerous    well  it's dangerous again. Why  Because the temes are selfish replicators and they don't care about us  or our planet  or anything else. They're just information  why would they  They are using us to suck up the planet's resources to produce more computers  and more of all these amazing things we're hearing about here at TED. Don't think   Oh  we created the Internet for our own benefit.  That's how it seems to us. Think  temes spreading because they must. We are the old machines. Now  are we going to pull through  What's going to happen  What does it mean to pull through  Well  there are kind of two ways of pulling through. One that is obviously happening all around us now  is that the temes turn us into teme machines  with these implants  with the drugs  with us merging with the technology. And why would they do that  Because we are self replicating. We have babies. We make new ones  and so it's convenient to piggyback on us  because we're not yet at the stage on this planet where the other option is viable. Although it's closer  I heard this morning  it's closer than I thought it was. Where the teme machines themselves will replicate themselves. That way  it wouldn't matter if the planet's climate was utterly destabilized  and it was no longer possible for humans to live here. Because those teme machines  they wouldn't need    they're not squishy  wet  oxygen breathing  warmth requiring creatures. They could carry on without us. So  those are the two possibilities. The second  I don't think we're that close. It's coming  but we're not there yet. The first  it's coming too. But the damage that is already being done to the planet is showing us how dangerous the third point is  that third danger point  getting a third replicator. And will we get through this third danger point  like we got through the second and like we got through the first  Maybe we will  maybe we won't. I have no idea. Chris Anderson  That was an incredible talk. SB  Thank you. I scared myself. CA   Laughter  So  I'm in Chile  in the Atacama desert  sitting in a hotel lobby  because that's the only place that I can get a Wi Fi connection  and I have this picture up on my screen  and a woman comes up behind me. She says   Oh  that's beautiful. What is it  Is that Jackson Pollock   And unfortunately  I can be a little too honest. I said   No  it's    it's penguin shit.  And  you know   Excuse me   And I could sense that she thought I was speaking synecdochically. So  I said   No  no  really    it's penguin shit.  Because I had just been in the Falkland Islands taking pictures of penguins. This is a Gentoo penguin. And she was still skeptical. So  literally  a few minutes before that  I downloaded this scientific paper about calculations on avian defecation  which is really quite interesting  because it turns out you can model this as something called  Poiseuille flow   and you can learn an awful lot about the physics of the avian rectum. Actually  technically  it's not a rectum. It's called a cloaca. At this point  she stops me  and she says   Who are you  Wha    what do you do   And I was stuck  because I didn't have any way to describe what I do. And so  in some sense  this talk today is my answer to that. It's a selection of a random bunch of the stuff that I do. And it's very hard for me to make sense of it  so I'm not sure that you can. It's the kind of thing that I sit up late at night thinking about sometimes    often at four in the morning. So  some people are afraid of what I do. Some people think I am the nerd Tony Soprano  and in response  I have ordered a bulletproof pocket protector. I'm not sure what these people think  because I don't speak Norsk. But I'm not thinking  monsteret  is a good thing. I don't know  you know  So  one of the things that I love to do is travel around the world and look at archaeological sites. Because archaeology gives us an opportunity to study past civilizations  and see where they succeeded and where they failed. Use science to  you know  work backwards and say   Well  really  what were they thinking   And recently  I was in Easter Island  which is an incredibly beautiful place  and an incredibly mysterious place  because no matter where you go in Easter Island  you're struck by these statues  called the moai. The place is    square miles. They made  so far as we can tell      of them. Why on Earth  And if you haven't read Jared Diamond's book   Collapse   I totally recommend that you do. He's got a great chapter about it. Basically  these people committed ecological suicide in order to make more of these. And somewhere along the line  somebody said   I know  Let's cut down the last tree and commit suicide  because we need more identical statues.  And  one thing that isn't a mystery  actually  was when I grew up    because when I was a little kid  I'd seen these pictures    and I thought   Well  why that look on the face  Why that brow   I mean  it's such a powerful thing. Where did they get that inspiration  And then I met Yoyo  who is the native Rapa Nui an guide  and if you look at Yoyo's face  you kind of figure out where they got it. There's many mysteries  these statues. Everyone wants to know  how did they make them  how did they transport them  This woman in the foreground is Jo Anne Van Tilberg. She's the leading archaeologist working Easter Island today. And she has studied the statues for    some years  and she has detailed records of every single statue. The one on the page here is the same that's up there. One interesting problem is the stone isn't very hard. So  this used to be completely smooth. In fact  in many of the statues  when you excavate them  the backs are totally smooth    almost glass smooth. But after       years out in the weather  they look like this. Jo Anne and I have just embarked on a project to digitize them all  and we're going to do a very high res digitization  first because it's a way of preserving them. Second  we have these ideas about how you can algorithmically  then  learn a few of the mysteries about them. How long have they been standing in what positions  And maybe  indirectly  get at some of the issues of what caused them to be the way they are. While I was in Easter Island  comet McNaught was there also  so you get a gratuitous picture of a moai with a comet. I also have an archaeological project going on in Egypt.  Going on  is perhaps a little bit strong. We're trying to get all of the permissions to get everything all set  to get it going. So  I'll talk about it at a future TED. But there's some amazing opportunities in Egypt as well. Another thing I do is I invent stuff. In fact  I design nuclear reactors. Not a joke. This is the conventional nuclear fuel cycle. The red line is what is done in most nuclear reactors. It's called the open fuel cycle. The white lines are what's called an advance fuel cycle  where you reprocess. Now  this is the normal way it's done. It's got the huge advantage that it does not create carbon pollution. It has a lot of disadvantages  each one of these steps is extremely expensive  it's potentially dangerous and they have the interesting property that the step cannot be performed in anyone's backyard  which is a problem. So  our reactor eliminates these steps  which  if we can actually make it work  is a really cool thing. Now  it's kind of nuts to work on a new nuclear reactor. There's    no reactor's been even built to an old design  much less a new one  in the United States for    years. It's the kind of very high risk  but potentially very high return thing that we do. Changing into a totally different field  we do a lot of stuff in solid state physics  particularly in an area called metamaterials. A metamaterial is an artificial material  which manipulates  in this case  electromagnetic radiation  in a way that you couldn't otherwise. So  this device here is an invisibility cloak. It may not seem that  but if you were a microwave  this is how you would view it. Rays of light    in this case  microwave light    come in  and they just squish around the cell  and they come back the other side. Now  you could do that with mirrors from one angle. The cool thing is  this does it from all angles. Metamaterials  unfortunately    A  it only works on microwave  and B  it doesn't work all that well yet. But metamaterials are an incredibly exciting field. It's    you know  today I'd like to say it's a zero billion dollar business  but  in fact  it's negative. But some day  some day  maybe it's going to work. We do a lot of work in biomedical fields. In this case  we're working with a major medical foundation to develop inexpensive ways of diagnosing diseases in developing countries. So  they say the eyes are the windows of the soul    turns out they're a window to a whole lot more stuff. And these happen to be my eyes  by the way. Now  I'm also very interested in cooking. While I was at Microsoft  I took a leave of absence and went to a chef school in France. I used to work  also while at Microsoft  at a leading restaurant in Seattle  so I do a lot of cooking. I've been on a team that won the world championship of barbecue. But barbecue's interesting  because it's one of these cult foods like chili  or bouillabaisse. Various parts of the world will have a cult food that people get enormously attached to    there's tremendous traditions  there's secrecy. And I'm trying to use a very scientific approach. So  this is my latest cooker  and if this looks more complicated than the nuclear reactor  that's because it is. But if you get to play with all those knobs and dials    and of course  really the controller over there does it all on software    you can make some terrific ribs. This is a high speed centrifuge. You should all have one in your kitchen  beside your Turbochef. This subjects food to a force about        times that of normal gravity  and oh boy  does it clarify chicken stock. You would not believe it  I perform a series of ghoulish experiments on food    in this case  trying to calibrate a mathematical model so that one can predict exactly what the internal cooking times are. It turns out  A  it's useful  and for a geek like me  it's fun. Theory is red  black is experiment. So  I'm either really good at faking it  or this particular model seems to work. So  another random thing I do is the search for extraterrestrial intelligence  or SETI. And you may be familiar with the movie  Contact   which sort of popularized that. It turns out there are real people who go out and search for extraterrestrials in a very scientific way. In fact  almost everybody in the movie is based on a real character  a real person. So  the Jodie Foster character here is actually this woman  Jill Tarter  and Jill has dedicated her life to this. You know  a lot of people risk their lives in a brief act of heroism  which is kind of cool  but Jill has what I call slow heroism. She is risking her professional life on something that her own calculations show may not work for a thousand years    may not ever. So  I like to support people that are risking their lives. After the movie came out  of course  there was a lot of interest in SETI. My kids saw the movie  and afterwards they came to me and they said   So  Dad  so    so    that character    that's Jill  right   I said   Oh  yeah  yeah    absolutely.   And that other person  that's someone      I said   Yes.  They said   Well  you know that creepy rich guy in the movie  Is that you   I said   Well  you know  it's just a movie  Come on.  So  the SETI Institute  with a little bit of help from me  and a lot of help from Paul Allen and a variety of other people  is building a dedicated radio telescope in Hat Creek  California  so they can do this SETI work. Now  I travel a lot  and I change cell phones a lot  and the one person who always gets updated on all my cell phones and pagers and everything else is Jill  because I really don't want to miss  the call.  I mean  can you imagine  E.T.'s phoning home  and I'm not  like  there  You know  horrible  So  I do a lot of work on dinosaurs. I'm known to TEDsters as the guy that has sex with dinosaurs. And I resemble that remark. I'm going to talk about a different aspect of dinosaurs  which is the finding of them. Now  to find dinosaurs  you hike around in horrible conditions looking for a dinosaur. It sounds really dumb  but that's what it is. It's horrible conditions  because wherever you have nice weather  plants grow  and you don't get any erosion  and you don't see any dinosaurs. So  you always find dinosaurs in deserts or badlands  areas that have very little plant growth and have flash floods in the spring. You know  skiers pray for snow  Paleontologists pray for erosion. So  you hike around and    this is after you dig them up  they look like this. You hike around  you see something like this. Now  this is something I found  so look at it very closely here. You've got this bentonite clay  which is    sort of swells up and expands. And there's some stuff poking out. So  you look at that  and you look up close  and you say   Well  gee  that's kind of interesting. What are all of these pieces   Well  if you look closely  you can recognize  actually  from the shape  that these are skull fragments. And then when you look at this  you say   That's a tooth. It's a big tooth.  It's about the size of a banana. It has a big serration on the edge. This is what Tyrannosaurus rex looks like in the ground. And this is what it's like to find a Tyrannosaurus rex  which I was lucky enough to do a few years ago. Now  this is what Tyrannosaurus rex looks like in my living room. Not the same one  actually. This is a cast  which I had bought  and then  after buying the cast  I found my own  and I don't have room for two. You know. So  the thing that's wonderful for me about finding dinosaurs is that it is both an intellectual thing  because you're trying to reconstruct the environment of millions of years ago. It's something that can inform all sorts of science in unexpected ways. The study of dinosaurs led to the realization that there's a problem with asteroid impact  for example. The study of dinosaurs may  literally  one day save the planet. Study of the ancient climate is very important. In fact  the Mesozoic  when dinosaurs lived  had much higher CO  than today  was much warmer than today  and is one of the interesting proof points for the effects of CO  on climate. But  besides being intellectually and scientifically interesting  it's also very different than the other things I do  because you get to hike around in the badlands. This is actually what most dinosaur research looks like. This is one of my papers   A pygostyle from a non avian theropod.  It's not as gripping as dinosaur sex  so we're not going to go into it further. Now  I'm also really big on photography. I travel all over the world taking pictures    some of them good  most of them not. These days  bits are cheap. Unfortunately  that means you've got to spend more time sorting through them. Here's a picture I took in the Falkland Islands of king penguins on a beach. Here's a picture I took in Alaska  a few years ago  of Orcas. I'd gone up to photograph Orcas  and we had looked for a week  and we hadn't seen a damn Orca. And the last day  the sun comes out  the Orcas come  they're right by the boat. It's fantastic. And I get lots of pictures like this. Then  a little bit later  I start getting some pictures like this. Now  to a human audience  I need to explain that if Penthouse magazine had a marine mammal edition  this would be the centerfold. It's true. So  there's more and more activity near the boat  and all of a sudden somebody shouts   What's that in the water   I said   Well  I think that's what you call a free willy.  There's a variety of things you can learn from watching whales have sex. The first thing you learn is the overwhelming importance of hands. They don't have them. I think Paul Simon is in the audience  and he has    he may not realize it  but he wrote a song all about whale sex   Slip Slidin' Away.  That's kind of what it's like. The other interesting thing that I learned about whale sex  they curl their toes too. So    where do you go putting all of these disparate pieces together  You know  there's a tremendous amount of wisdom in finding a great thing  passion in life  and focusing all your energy on it  and I've never been able to do that. I just    you know  because  yes  I'll focus passion on something  but then there will be something else  and then there's something else again. And for a long time I fought this  and I thought   Well  gee  I really ought to buckle down.  And you know  when I was at Microsoft  that was so engrossing  and the whole industry was expanding so much  that it did tend to crowd out most of the other things in my life. But ultimately  I decided that what I really ought to do is not fight being who I am  but embrace it. And say   Yeah  you know  I    this whole talk has been a mile wide and an inch deep  but that's really what works for me.  And regardless of whether it's nuclear reactors or metamaterials or whale sex  the common    or lowest common denominator    is me. That's it  thank you. You know  culture was born of the imagination  and the imagination    the imagination as we know it    came into being when our species descended from our progenitor  Homo erectus  and  infused with consciousness  began a journey that would carry it to every corner of the habitable world. For a time  we shared the stage with our distant cousins  Neanderthal  who clearly had some spark of awareness  but    whether it was the increase in the size of the brain  or the development of language  or some other evolutionary catalyst    we quickly left Neanderthal gasping for survival. By the time the last Neanderthal disappeared in Europe         years ago  our direct ancestors had already  and for       years  been crawling into the belly of the earth  where in the light of the flickers of tallow candles  they had brought into being the great art of the Upper Paleolithic. And I spent two months in the caves of southwest France with the poet Clayton Eshleman  who wrote a beautiful book called  Juniper Fuse.  And you could look at this art and you could  of course  see the complex social organization of the people who brought it into being. But more importantly  it spoke of a deeper yearning  something far more sophisticated than hunting magic. And the way Clayton put it was this way. He said   You know  clearly at some point  we were all of an animal nature  and at some point  we weren't.  And he viewed proto shamanism as a kind of original attempt  through ritual  to rekindle a connection that had been irrevocably lost. So  he saw this art not as hunting magic  but as postcards of nostalgia. And viewed in that light  it takes on a whole other resonance. And the most amazing thing about the Upper Paleolithic art is that as an aesthetic expression  it lasted for almost        years. If these were postcards of nostalgia  ours was a very long farewell indeed. And it was also the beginning of our discontent  because if you wanted to distill all of our experience since the Paleolithic  it would come down to two words  how and why. And these are the slivers of insight upon which cultures have been forged. Now  all people share the same raw  adaptive imperatives. We all have children. We all have to deal with the mystery of death  the world that waits beyond death  the elders who fall away into their elderly years. All of this is part of our common experience  and this shouldn't surprise us  because  after all  biologists have finally proven it to be true  something that philosophers have always dreamt to be true. And that is the fact that we are all brothers and sisters. We are all cut from the same genetic cloth. All of humanity  probably  is descended from a thousand people who left Africa roughly        years ago. But the corollary of that is that  if we all are brothers and sisters and share the same genetic material  all human populations share the same raw human genius  the same intellectual acuity. And so whether that genius is placed into    technological wizardry has been the great achievement of the West    or by contrast  into unraveling the complex threads of memory inherent in a myth  is simply a matter of choice and cultural orientation. There is no progression of affairs in human experience. There is no trajectory of progress. There's no pyramid that conveniently places Victorian England at the apex and descends down the flanks to the so called primitives of the world. All peoples are simply cultural options  different visions of life itself. But what do I mean by different visions of life making for completely different possibilities for existence  Well  let's slip for a moment into the greatest culture sphere ever brought into being by the imagination  that of Polynesia.        square kilometers  tens of thousands of islands flung like jewels upon the southern sea. I recently sailed on the Hokulea  named after the sacred star of Hawaii  throughout the South Pacific to make a film about the navigators. These are men and women who  even today  can name     stars in the night sky. These are men and women who can sense the presence of distant atolls of islands beyond the visible horizon  simply by watching the reverberation of waves across the hull of their vessel  knowing full well that every island group in the Pacific has its unique refractive pattern that can be read with the same perspicacity with which a forensic scientist would read a fingerprint. These are sailors who in the darkness  in the hull of the vessel  can distinguish as many as    different sea swells moving through the canoe at any one point in time  distinguishing local wave disturbances from the great currents that pulsate across the ocean  that can be followed with the same ease that a terrestrial explorer would follow a river to the sea. Indeed  if you took all of the genius that allowed us to put a man on the moon and applied it to an understanding of the ocean  what you would get is Polynesia. And if we slip from the realm of the sea into the realm of the spirit of the imagination  you enter the realm of Tibetan Buddhism. And I recently made a film called  The Buddhist Science of the Mind.  Why did we use that word  science  What is science but the empirical pursuit of the truth  What is Buddhism but       years of empirical observation as to the nature of mind  I travelled for a month in Nepal with our good friend  Matthieu Ricard  and you'll remember Matthieu famously said to all of us here once at TED   Western science is a major response to minor needs.  We spend all of our lifetime trying to live to be     without losing our teeth. The Buddhist spends all their lifetime trying to understand the nature of existence. Our billboards celebrate naked children in underwear. Their billboards are manuals  prayers to the well being of all sentient creatures. And with the blessing of Trulshik Rinpoche  we began a pilgrimage to a curious destination  accompanied by a great doctor. And the destination was a single room in a nunnery  where a woman had gone into lifelong retreat    years before. And en route  we took darshan from Rinpoche  and he sat with us and told us about the Four Noble Truths  the essence of the Buddhist path. All life is suffering. That doesn't mean all life is negative. It means things happen. The cause of suffering is ignorance. By that  the Buddha did not mean stupidity  he meant clinging to the illusion that life is static and predictable. The third noble truth said that ignorance can be overcome. And the fourth and most important  of course  was the delineation of a contemplative practice that not only had the possibility of a transformation of the human heart  but had       years of empirical evidence that such a transformation was a certainty. And so  when this door opened onto the face of a woman who had not been out of that room in    years  you did not see a mad woman. You saw a woman who was more clear than a pool of water in a mountain stream. And of course  this is what the Tibetan monks told us. They said  at one point  you know  we don't really believe you went to the moon  but you did. You may not believe that we achieve enlightenment in one lifetime  but we do. And if we move from the realm of the spirit to the realm of the physical  to the sacred geography of Peru    I've always been interested in the relationships of indigenous people that literally believe that the Earth is alive  responsive to all of their aspirations  all of their needs. And  of course  the human population has its own reciprocal obligations. I spent    years living amongst the people of Chinchero and I always heard about an event that I always wanted to participate in. Once each year  the fastest young boy in each hamlet is given the honor of becoming a woman. And for one day  he wears the clothing of his sister and he becomes a transvestite  a waylaka. And for that day  he leads all able bodied men on a run  but it's not your ordinary run. You start off at        feet. You run down to the base of the sacred mountain  Antakillqa. You run up to        feet  descend       feet. Climb again over the course of    hours. And of course  the waylakama spin  the trajectory of the route  is marked by holy mounds of Earth  where coke is given to the Earth  libations of alcohol to the wind  the vortex of the feminine is brought to the mountaintop. And the metaphor is clear  you go into the mountain as an individual  but through exhaustion  through sacrifice  you emerge as a community that has once again reaffirmed its sense of place in the planet. And at     I was the only outsider ever to go through this  only one to finish it. I only managed to do it by chewing more coca leaves in one day than anyone in the       year history of the plant. But these localized rituals become pan Andean  and these fantastic festivals  like that of the Qoyllur Rit'i  which occurs when the Pleiades reappear in the winter sky. It's kind of like an Andean Woodstock         Indians on pilgrimage to the end of a dirt road that leads to the sacred valley  called the Sinakara  which is dominated by three tongues of the great glacier. The metaphor is so clear. You bring the crosses from your community  in this wonderful fusion of Christian and pre Columbian ideas. You place the cross into the ice  in the shadow of Ausangate  the most sacred of all Apus  or sacred mountains of the Inca. And then you do the ritual dances that empower the crosses. Now  these ideas and these events allow us even to deconstruct iconic places that many of you have been to  like Machu Picchu. Machu Picchu was never a lost city. On the contrary  it was completely linked in to the        kilometers of royal roads the Inca made in less than a century. But more importantly  it was linked in to the Andean notions of sacred geography. The intiwatana  the hitching post to the sun  is actually an obelisk that constantly reflects the light that falls on the sacred Apu of Machu Picchu  which is Sugarloaf Mountain  called Huayna Picchu. If you come to the south of the intiwatana  you find an altar. Climb Huayna Picchu  find another altar. Take a direct north south bearing  you find to your astonishment that it bisects the intiwatana stone  goes to the skyline  hits the heart of Salcantay  the second of the most important mountains of the Incan empire. And then beyond Salcantay  of course  when the southern cross reaches the southernmost point in the sky  directly in that same alignment  the Milky Way overhead. But what is enveloping Machu Picchu from below  The sacred river  the Urubamba  or the Vilcanota  which is itself the Earthly equivalent of the Milky Way  but it's also the trajectory that Viracocha walked at the dawn of time when he brought the universe into being. And where does the river rise  Right on the slopes of the Koariti. So      years after Columbus  these ancient rhythms of landscape are played out in ritual. Now  when I was here at the first TED  I showed this photograph  two men of the Elder Brothers  the descendants  survivors of El Dorado. These  of course  are the descendants of the ancient Tairona civilization. If those of you who are here remember that I mentioned that they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood  but the training for the priesthood is extraordinary. Taken from their families  sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness for    years    two nine year periods deliberately chosen to evoke the nine months they spend in the natural mother's womb. All that time  the world only exists as an abstraction  as they are taught the values of their society. Values that maintain the proposition that their prayers  and their prayers alone  maintain the cosmic balance. Now  the measure of a society is not only what it does  but the quality of its aspirations. And I always wanted to go back into these mountains  to see if this could possibly be true  as indeed had been reported by the great anthropologist  Reichel Dolmatoff. So  literally two weeks ago  I returned from having spent six weeks with the Elder Brothers on what was clearly the most extraordinary trip of my life. These really are a people who live and breathe the realm of the sacred  a baroque religiosity that is simply awesome. They consume more coca leaves than any human population  half a pound per man  per day. The gourd you see here is    everything in their lives is symbolic. Their central metaphor is a loom. They say   Upon this loom  I weave my life.  They refer to the movements as they exploit the ecological niches of the gradient as  threads.  When they pray for the dead  they make these gestures with their hands  spinning their thoughts into the heavens. You can see the calcium buildup on the head of the poporo gourd. The gourd is a feminine aspect  the stick is a male. You put the stick in the powder to take the sacred ashes    well  they're not ashes  they're burnt limestone    to empower the coca leaf  to change the pH of the mouth to facilitate the absorption of cocaine hydrochloride. But if you break a gourd  you cannot simply throw it away  because every stroke of that stick that has built up that calcium  the measure of a man's life  has a thought behind it. Fields are planted in such an extraordinary way  that the one side of the field is planted like that by the women. The other side is planted like that by the men. Metaphorically  you turn it on the side  and you have a piece of cloth. And they are the descendants of the ancient Tairona civilization  the greatest goldsmiths of South America  who in the wake of the conquest  retreated into this isolated volcanic massif that soars to        feet above the Caribbean coastal plain. There are four societies  the Kogi  the Wiwa  the Kankwano and the Arhuacos. I traveled with the Arhuacos  and the wonderful thing about this story was that this man  Danilo Villafane    if we just jump back here for a second. When I first met Danilo  in the Colombian embassy in Washington  I couldn't help but say   You know  you look a lot like an old friend of mine.  Well  it turns out he was the son of my friend  Adalberto  from       who had been killed by the FARC. And I said   Danilo  you won't remember this  but when you were an infant  I carried you on my back  up and down the mountains.  And because of that  Danilo invited us to go to the very heart of the world  a place where no journalist had ever been permitted. Not simply to the flanks of the mountains  but to the very iced peaks which are the destiny of the pilgrims. And this man sitting cross legged is now a grown up Eugenio  a man who I've known since     . And this is one of those initiates. No  it's not true that they're kept in the darkness for    years  but they are kept within the confines of the ceremonial men's circle for    years. This little boy will never step outside of the sacred fields that surround the men's hut for all that time  until he begins his journey of initiation. For that entire time  the world only exists as an abstraction  as he is taught the values of society  including this notion that their prayers alone maintain the cosmic balance. Before we could begin our journey  we had to be cleansed at the portal of the Earth. And it was extraordinary to be taken by a priest. And you see that the priest never wears shoes because holy feet    there must be nothing between the feet and the Earth for a mamo. And this is actually the place where the Great Mother sent the spindle into the world that elevated the mountains and created the homeland that they call the heart of the world. We traveled high into the paramo  and as we crested the hills  we realized that the men were interpreting every single bump on the landscape in terms of their own intense religiosity. And then of course  as we reached our final destination  a place called Mamancana  we were in for a surprise  because the FARC were waiting to kidnap us. And so we ended up being taken aside into these huts  hidden away until the darkness. And then  abandoning all our gear  we were forced to ride out in the middle of the night  in a quite dramatic scene. It's going to look like a John Ford Western. And we ran into a FARC patrol at dawn  so it was quite harrowing. It will be a very interesting film. But what was fascinating is that the minute there was a sense of dangers  the mamos went into a circle of divination. And of course  this is a photograph literally taken the night we were in hiding  as they divine their route to take us out of the mountains. We were able to  because we had trained people in filmmaking  continue with our work  and send our Wiwa and Arhuaco filmmakers to the final sacred lakes to get the last shots for the film  and we followed the rest of the Arhuaco back to the sea  taking the elements from the highlands to the sea. And here you see how their sacred landscape has been covered by brothels and hotels and casinos  and yet  still they pray. And it's an amazing thing to think that this close to Miami  two hours from Miami  there is an entire civilization of people praying every day for your well being. They call themselves the Elder Brothers. They dismiss the rest of us who have ruined the world as the Younger Brothers. They cannot understand why it is that we do what we do to the Earth. Now  if we slip to another end of the world  I was up in the high Arctic to tell a story about global warming  inspired in part by the former Vice President's wonderful book. And what struck me so extraordinary was to be again with the Inuit    a people who don't fear the cold  but take advantage of it. A people who find a way  with their imagination  to carve life out of that very frozen. A people for whom blood on ice is not a sign of death  but an affirmation of life. And yet tragically  when you now go to those northern communities  you find to your astonishment that whereas the sea ice used to come in in September and stay till July  in a place like Kanak in northern Greenland  it literally comes in now in November and stays until March. So  their entire year has been cut in half. Now  I want to stress that none of these peoples that I've been quickly talking about here are disappearing worlds. These are not dying peoples. On the contrary  you know  if you have the heart to feel and the eyes to see  you discover that the world is not flat. The world remains a rich tapestry. It remains a rich topography of the spirit. These myriad voices of humanity are not failed attempts at being new  failed attempts at being modern. They're unique facets of the human imagination. They're unique answers to a fundamental question  what does it mean to be human and alive  And when asked that question  they respond with       different voices. And collectively  those voices become our human repertoire for dealing with the challenges that will confront us in the ensuing millennia. Our industrial society is scarcely     years old. That shallow history shouldn't suggest to anyone that we have all of the answers for all of the questions that will confront us in the ensuing millennia. The myriad voices of humanity are not failed attempts at being us. They are unique answers to that fundamental question  what does it mean to be human and alive  And there is indeed a fire burning over the Earth  taking with it not only plants and animals  but the legacy of humanity's brilliance. Right now  as we sit here in this room  of those       languages spoken the day that you were born  fully half aren't being taught to children. So  you're living through a time when virtually half of humanity's intellectual  social and spiritual legacy is being allowed to slip away. This does not have to happen. These peoples are not failed attempts at being modern    quaint and colorful and destined to fade away as if by natural law. In every case  these are dynamic  living peoples being driven out of existence by identifiable forces. That's actually an optimistic observation  because it suggests that if human beings are the agents of cultural destruction  we can also be  and must be  the facilitators of cultural survival. Thank you very much. Last year  I told you the story  in seven minutes  of Project Orion  which was this very implausible technology that technically could have worked  but it had this one year political window where it could have happened. So it didn't happen. It was a dream that did not happen. This year I'm going to tell you the story of the birth of digital computing. This was a perfect introduction. And it's a story that did work. It did happen  and the machines are all around us. And it was a technology that was inevitable. If the people I'm going to tell you the story about  if they hadn't done it  somebody else would have. So  it was sort of the right idea at the right time. This is Barricelli's universe. This is the universe we live in now. It's the universe in which these machines are now doing all these things  including changing biology. I'm starting the story with the first atomic bomb at Trinity  which was the Manhattan Project. It was a little bit like TED  it brought a whole lot of very smart people together. And three of the smartest people were Stan Ulam  Richard Feynman and John von Neumann. And it was Von Neumann who said  after the bomb  he was working on something much more important than bombs  he's thinking about computers. So  he wasn't only thinking about them  he built one. This is the machine he built. He built this machine  and we had a beautiful demonstration of how this thing really works  with these little bits. And it's an idea that goes way back. The first person to really explain that was Thomas Hobbes  who  in       explained how arithmetic and logic are the same thing  and if you want to do artificial thinking and artificial logic  you can do it all with arithmetic. He said you needed addition and subtraction. Leibniz  who came a little bit later    this is         showed that you didn't even need subtraction. You could do the whole thing with addition. Here  we have all the binary arithmetic and logic that drove the computer revolution. And Leibniz was the first person to really talk about building such a machine. He talked about doing it with marbles  having gates and what we now call shift registers  where you shift the gates  drop the marbles down the tracks. And that's what all these machines are doing  except  instead of doing it with marbles  they're doing it with electrons. And then we jump to Von Neumann        when he sort of reinvents the whole same thing. And       after the war  the electronics existed to actually try and build such a machine. So June         actually  the bomb hasn't even been dropped yet    and Von Neumann is putting together all the theory to actually build this thing  which also goes back to Turing  who  before that  gave the idea that you could do all this with a very brainless  little  finite state machine  just reading a tape in and reading a tape out. The other sort of genesis of what Von Neumann did was the difficulty of how you would predict the weather. Lewis Richardson saw how you could do this with a cellular array of people  giving them each a little chunk  and putting it together. Here  we have an electrical model illustrating a mind having a will  but capable of only two ideas. And that's really the simplest computer. It's basically why you need the qubit  because it only has two ideas. And you put lots of those together  you get the essentials of the modern computer  the arithmetic unit  the central control  the memory  the recording medium  the input and the output. But  there's one catch. This is the fatal    you know  we saw it in starting these programs up. The instructions which govern this operation must be given in absolutely exhaustive detail. So  the programming has to be perfect  or it won't work. If you look at the origins of this  the classic history sort of takes it all back to the ENIAC here. But actually  the machine I'm going to tell you about  the Institute for Advanced Study machine  which is way up there  really should be down there. So  I'm trying to revise history  and give some of these guys more credit than they've had. Such a computer would open up universes  which are  at the present  outside the range of any instruments. So it opens up a whole new world  and these people saw it. The guy who was supposed to build this machine was the guy in the middle  Vladimir Zworykin  from RCA. RCA  in probably one of the lousiest business decisions of all time  decided not to go into computers. But the first meetings  November       were at RCA's offices. RCA started this whole thing off  and said  you know  televisions are the future  not computers. The essentials were all there    all the things that make these machines run. Von Neumann  and a logician  and a mathematician from the army put this together. Then  they needed a place to build it. When RCA said no  that's when they decided to build it in Princeton  where Freeman works at the Institute. That's where I grew up as a kid. That's me  that's my sister Esther  who's talked to you before  so we both go back to the birth of this thing. That's Freeman  a long time ago  and that was me. And this is Von Neumann and Morgenstern  who wrote the  Theory of Games.  All these forces came together there  in Princeton. Oppenheimer  who had built the bomb. The machine was actually used mainly for doing bomb calculations. And Julian Bigelow  who took Zworkykin's place as the engineer  to actually figure out  using electronics  how you would build this thing. The whole gang of people who came to work on this  and women in front  who actually did most of the coding  were the first programmers. These were the prototype geeks  the nerds. They didn't fit in at the Institute. This is a letter from the director  concerned about     especially unfair on the matter of sugar.  You can read the text. This is hackers getting in trouble for the first time. These were not theoretical physicists. They were real soldering gun type guys  and they actually built this thing. And we take it for granted now  that each of these machines has billions of transistors  doing billions of cycles per second without failing. They were using vacuum tubes  very narrow  sloppy techniques to get actually binary behavior out of these radio vacuum tubes. They actually used  J   the common radio tube  because they found they were more reliable than the more expensive tubes. And what they did at the Institute was publish every step of the way. Reports were issued  so that this machine was cloned at    other places around the world. And it really was. It was the original microprocessor. All the computers now are copies of that machine. The memory was in cathode ray tubes    a whole bunch of spots on the face of the tube    very  very sensitive to electromagnetic disturbances. So  there's    of these tubes  like a V    engine running the memory. The input and the output was by teletype tape at first. This is a wire drive  using bicycle wheels. This is the archetype of the hard disk that's in your machine now. Then they switched to a magnetic drum. This is modifying IBM equipment  which is the origins of the whole data processing industry  later at IBM. And this is the beginning of computer graphics. The  Graph'g Beam Turn On.  This next slide  that's the    as far as I know    the first digital bitmap display      . So  Von Neumann was already off in a theoretical cloud  doing abstract sorts of studies of how you could build reliable machines out of unreliable components. Those guys drinking all the tea with sugar in it were writing in their logbooks  trying to get this thing to work  with all these       vacuum tubes that failed half the time. And that's what I've been doing  this last six months  is going through the logs.  Running time  two minutes. Input  output     minutes.  This includes a large amount of human error. So they are always trying to figure out  what's machine error  What's human error  What's code  what's hardware  That's an engineer gazing at tube number     trying to figure out why the memory's not in focus. He had to focus the memory    seems OK. So  he had to focus each tube just to get the memory up and running  let alone having  you know  software problems.  No use  went home.   Laughter   Impossible to follow the damn thing  where's a directory   So  already  they're complaining about the manuals   before closing down in disgust ...    The General Arithmetic  Operating Logs.  Burning lots of midnight oil.  MANIAC   which became the acronym for the machine  Mathematical and Numerical Integrator and Calculator   lost its memory.   MANIAC regained its memory  when the power went off.   Machine or human    Aha   So  they figured out it's a code problem.  Found trouble in code  I hope.   Code error  machine not guilty.   Damn it  I can be just as stubborn as this thing.   And the dawn came.  So they ran all night. Twenty four hours a day  this thing was running  mainly running bomb calculations.  Everything up to this point is wasted time.   What's the use  Good night.   Master control off. The hell with it. Way off.   Laughter   Something's wrong with the air conditioner    smell of burning V belts in the air.   A short    do not turn the machine on.   IBM machine putting a tar like substance on the cards. The tar is from the roof.  So they really were working under tough conditions. Here   A mouse has climbed into the blower behind the regulator rack  set blower to vibrating. Result  no more mouse.   Here lies mouse. Born   . Died       a.m.  May     .  There's an inside joke someone has penciled in   Here lies Marston Mouse.  If you're a mathematician  you get that  because Marston was a mathematician who objected to the computer being there.  Picked a lightning bug off the drum.   Running at two kilocycles.  That's two thousand cycles per second     yes  I'm chicken     so two kilocycles was slow speed. The high speed was    kilocycles. I don't know if you remember a Mac that was    Megahertz  that's slow speed.  I have now duplicated both results. How will I know which is right  assuming one result is correct  This now is the third different output. I know when I'm licked.   We've duplicated errors before.   Machine run  fine. Code isn't.   Only happens when the machine is running.  And sometimes things are okay.  Machine a thing of beauty  and a joy forever.   Perfect running.   Parting thought  when there's bigger and better errors  we'll have them.  So  nobody was supposed to know they were actually designing bombs. They're designing hydrogen bombs. But someone in the logbook  late one night  finally drew a bomb. So  that was the result. It was Mike  the first thermonuclear bomb  in     . That was designed on that machine  in the woods behind the Institute. So Von Neumann invited a whole gang of weirdos from all over the world to work on all these problems. Barricelli  he came to do what we now call  really  artificial life  trying to see if  in this artificial universe    he was a viral geneticist  way  way  way ahead of his time. He's still ahead of some of the stuff that's being done now. Trying to start an artificial genetic system running in the computer. Began    his universe started March    '  . So it's almost exactly    it's    years ago next Tuesday  I guess. And he saw everything in terms of    he could read the binary code straight off the machine. He had a wonderful rapport. Other people couldn't get the machine running. It always worked for him. Even errors were duplicated.  Dr. Barricelli claims machine is wrong  code is right.  So he designed this universe  and ran it. When the bomb people went home  he was allowed in there. He would run that thing all night long  running these things  if anybody remembers Stephen Wolfram  who reinvented this stuff. And he published it. It wasn't locked up and disappeared. It was published in the literature.  If it's that easy to create living organisms  why not create a few yourself   So  he decided to give it a try  to start this artificial biology going in the machines. And he found all these  sort of    it was like a naturalist coming in and looking at this tiny        byte universe  and seeing all these things happening that we see in the outside world  in biology. This is some of the generations of his universe. But they're just going to stay numbers  they're not going to become organisms. They have to have something. You have a genotype and you have to have a phenotype. They have to go out and do something. And he started doing that  started giving these little numerical organisms things they could play with    playing chess with other machines and so on. And they did start to evolve. And he went around the country after that. Every time there was a new  fast machine  he started using it  and saw exactly what's happening now. That the programs  instead of being turned off    when you quit the program  you'd keep running and  basically  all the sorts of things like Windows is doing  running as a multi cellular organism on many machines  he envisioned all that happening. And he saw that evolution itself was an intelligent process. It wasn't any sort of creator intelligence  but the thing itself was a giant parallel computation that would have some intelligence. And he went out of his way to say that he was not saying this was lifelike  or a new kind of life. It just was another version of the same thing happening. And there's really no difference between what he was doing in the computer and what nature did billions of years ago. And could you do it again now  So  when I went into these archives looking at this stuff  lo and behold  the archivist came up one day  saying   I think we found another box that had been thrown out.  And it was his universe on punch cards. So there it is     years later  sitting there    sort of suspended animation. That's the instructions for running    this is actually the source code for one of those universes  with a note from the engineers saying they're having some problems.  There must be something about this code that you haven't explained yet.  And I think that's really the truth. We still don't understand how these very simple instructions can lead to increasing complexity. What's the dividing line between when that is lifelike and when it really is alive  These cards  now  thanks to me showing up  are being saved. And the question is  should we run them or not  You know  could we get them running  Do you want to let it loose on the Internet  These machines would think they    these organisms  if they came back to life now    whether they've died and gone to heaven  there's a universe. My laptop is    thousand million times the size of the universe that they lived in when Barricelli quit the project. He was thinking far ahead  to how this would really grow into a new kind of life. And that's what's happening  When Juan Enriquez told us about these    trillion bits being transferred back and forth  of all this genomics data going to the proteomics lab  that's what Barricelli imagined  that this digital code in these machines is actually starting to code    it already is coding from nucleic acids. We've been doing that since  you know  since we started PCR and synthesizing small strings of DNA. And real soon  we're actually going to be synthesizing the proteins  and  like Steve showed us  that just opens an entirely new world. It's a world that Von Neumann himself envisioned. This was published after he died  his sort of unfinished notes on self reproducing machines  what it takes to get the machines sort of jump started to where they begin to reproduce. It took really three people  Barricelli had the concept of the code as a living thing  Von Neumann saw how you could build the machines    that now  last count  four million of these Von Neumann machines is built every    hours  and Julian Bigelow  who died    days ago    this is John Markoff's obituary for him    he was the important missing link  the engineer who came in and knew how to put those vacuum tubes together and make it work. And all our computers have  inside them  the copies of the architecture that he had to just design one day  sort of on pencil and paper. And we owe a tremendous credit to that. And he explained  in a very generous way  the spirit that brought all these different people to the Institute for Advanced Study in the '  s to do this project  and make it freely available with no patents  no restrictions  no intellectual property disputes to the rest of the world. That's the last entry in the logbook when the machine was shut down  July     . And it's Julian Bigelow who was running it until midnight when the machine was officially turned off. And that's the end. Thank you very much. My work is about the behaviors that we all engage in unconsciously  on a collective level. And what I mean by that  it's the behaviors that we're in denial about  and the ones that operate below the surface of our daily awareness. And as individuals  we all do these things  all the time  everyday. It's like when you're mean to your wife because you're mad at somebody else. Or when you drink a little too much at a party  just out of anxiety. Or when you overeat because your feelings are hurt  or whatever. And when we do these kind of things  when     million people do unconscious behaviors  then it can add up to a catastrophic consequence that nobody wants  and no one intended. And that's what I look at with my photographic work. This is an image I just recently completed  that is    when you stand back at a distance  it looks like some kind of neo Gothic  cartoon image of a factory spewing out pollution. And as you get a little bit closer  it starts looking like lots of pipes  like maybe a chemical plant  or a refinery  or maybe a hellish freeway interchange. And as you get all the way up close  you realize that it's actually made of lots and lots of plastic cups. And in fact  this is one million plastic cups  which is the number of plastic cups that are used on airline flights in the United States every six hours. We use four million cups a day on airline flights  and virtually none of them are reused or recycled. They just don't do that in that industry. Now  that number is dwarfed by the number of paper cups we use every day  and that is    million cups a day for hot beverages  most of which is coffee. I couldn't fit    million cups on a canvas  but I was able to put        . That's what         cups looks like. That's    minutes of our cup consumption. And if you could actually stack up that many cups in real life  that's the size it would be. And there's an hour's worth of our cups. And there's a day's worth of our cups. You can still see the little people way down there. That's as high as a    story building  and I put the Statue of Liberty in there as a scale reference. Speaking of justice  there's another phenomenon going on in our culture that I find deeply troubling  and that is that America  right now  has the largest percentage of its population in prison of any country on Earth. One out of four people  one out of four humans in prison are Americans  imprisoned in our country. And I wanted to show the number. The number is  .  million Americans were incarcerated in     . And that's gone up since then  but we don't have the numbers yet. So  I wanted to show  .  million prison uniforms  and in the actual print of this piece  each uniform is the size of a nickel on its edge. They're tiny. They're barely visible as a piece of material  and to show  .  million of them required a canvas that was larger than any printer in the world would print. And so I had to divide it up into multiple panels that are    feet tall by    feet wide. This is that piece installed in a gallery in New York    those are my parents looking at the piece. Every time I look at this piece  I always wonder if my mom's whispering to my dad   He finally folded his laundry.  I want to show you some pieces now that are about addiction. And this particular one is about cigarette addiction. I wanted to make a piece that shows the actual number of Americans who die from cigarette smoking. More than         people die in the United States every year from smoking cigarettes. And so  this piece is made up of lots and lots of boxes of cigarettes. And  as you slowly step back  you see that it's a painting by Van Gogh  called  Skull with Cigarette.  It's a strange thing to think about  that on       when that tragedy happened        Americans died. And do you remember the response  It reverberated around the world  and will continue to reverberate through time. It will be something that we talk about in     years. And yet on that same day        Americans died from smoking. And the day after that  another       Americans died from smoking. And every single day since then        Americans have died. And today        Americans are dying from cigarette smoking. And we aren't talking about it    we dismiss it. The tobacco lobby  it's too strong. We just dismiss it out of our consciousness. And knowing what we know about the destructive power of cigarettes  we continue to allow our children  our sons and daughters  to be in the presence of the influences that start them smoking. And this is what the next piece is about. This is just lots and lots of cigarettes         cigarettes  which is equal to the number of teenagers who will start smoking this month  and every month in the U.S. More than         children in the United States aged    and under begin smoking every year. One more strange epidemic in the United States that I want to acquaint you with is this phenomenon of abuse and misuse of prescription drugs. This is an image I've made out of lots and lots of Vicodin. Well  actually  I only had one Vicodin that I scanned lots and lots of times. And so  as you stand back  you see         Vicodin pills  which is the number of hospital emergency room visits yearly in the United States  attributable to abuse and misuse of prescription painkillers and anti anxiety medications. One third of all drug overdoses in the U.S.    and that includes cocaine  heroin  alcohol  everything    one third of drug overdoses are prescription medications. A strange phenomenon. This is a piece that I just recently completed about another tragic phenomenon. And that is the phenomenon  this growing obsession we have with breast augmentation surgery.         women  American women  last year went in for elective breast augmentation surgery. It's rapidly becoming the most popular high school graduation gift  given to young girls who are about to go off to college. So  I made this image out of Barbie dolls  and so  as you stand back you see this kind of floral pattern  and as you get all the way back  you see        Barbie dolls  which represents the number of breast augmentation surgeries that are performed in the U.S. each month. The vast majority of those are on women under the age of   . And strangely enough  the only plastic surgery that is more popular than breast augmentation is liposuction  and most of that is being done by men. Now  I want to emphasize that these are just examples. I'm not holding these out as being the biggest issues. They're just examples. And the reason that I do this  it's because I have this fear that we aren't feeling enough as a culture right now. There's this kind of anesthesia in America at the moment. We've lost our sense of outrage  our anger and our grief about what's going on in our culture right now  what's going on in our country  the atrocities that are being committed in our names around the world. They've gone missing  these feelings have gone missing. Our cultural joy  our national joy is nowhere to be seen. And one of the causes of this  I think  is that as each of us attempts to build this new kind of worldview  this holoptical worldview  this holographic image that we're all trying to create in our mind of the interconnection of things  the environmental footprints       miles away of the things that we buy  the social consequences        miles away of the daily decisions that we make as consumers. As we try to build this view  and try to educate ourselves about the enormity of our culture  the information that we have to work with is these gigantic numbers  numbers in the millions  in the hundreds of millions  in the billions and now in the trillions. Bush's new budget is in the trillions  and these are numbers that our brain just doesn't have the ability to comprehend. We can't make meaning out of these enormous statistics. And so that's what I'm trying to do with my work  is to take these numbers  these statistics from the raw language of data  and to translate them into a more universal visual language  that can be felt. Because my belief is  if we can feel these issues  if we can feel these things more deeply  then they'll matter to us more than they do now. And if we can find that  then we'll be able to find  within each one of us  what it is that we need to find to face the big question  which is  how do we change  That  to me  is the big question that we face as a people right now  how do we change  How do we change as a culture  and how do we each individually take responsibility for the one piece of the solution that we are in charge of  and that is our own behavior  My belief is that you don't have to make yourself bad to look at these issues. I'm not pointing the finger at America in a blaming way. I'm simply saying  this is who we are right now. And if there are things that we see that we don't like about our culture  then we have a choice. The degree of integrity that each of us can bring to the surface  to bring to this question  the depth of character that we can summon  as we show up for the question of how do we change    it's already defining us as individuals and as a nation  and it will continue to do that  on into the future. And it will profoundly affect the well being  the quality of life of the billions of people who are going to inherit the results of our decisions. I'm not speaking abstractly about this  I'm speaking    this is who we are in this room  right now  in this moment. Thank you and good afternoon. One way to change our genes is to make new ones  as Craig Venter has so elegantly shown. Another is to change our lifestyles. And what we're learning is how powerful and dynamic these changes can be  that you don't have to wait very long to see the benefits. When you eat healthier  manage stress  exercise and love more  your brain actually gets more blood flow and more oxygen. But more than that  your brain gets measurably bigger. Things that were thought impossible just a few years ago can actually be measured now. This was figured out by Robin Williams a few years before the rest of us. Now  there's some things that you can do to make your brain grow new brain cells. Some of my favorite things  like chocolate and tea  blueberries  alcohol in moderation  stress management and cannabinoids found in marijuana. I'm just the messenger. What were we just talking about  And other things that can make it worse  that can cause you to lose brain cells. The usual suspects  like saturated fat and sugar  nicotine  opiates  cocaine  too much alcohol and chronic stress. Your skin gets more blood flow when you change your lifestyle  so you age less quickly. Your skin doesn't wrinkle as much. Your heart gets more blood flow. We've shown that you can actually reverse heart disease. That these clogged arteries that you see on the upper left  after only a year become measurably less clogged. And the cardiac PET scan shown on the lower left  the blue means no blood flow. A year later    orange and white is maximum blood flow. We've shown you may be able to stop and reverse the progression of early prostate cancer and  by extension  breast cancer  simply by making these changes. We've found that tumor growth in vitro was inhibited    percent in the group that made these changes  whereas only nine percent in the comparison group. These differences were highly significant. Even your sexual organs get more blood flow  so you increase sexual potency. One of the most effective anti smoking ads was done by the Department of Health Services  showing that nicotine  which constricts your arteries  can cause a heart attack or a stroke  but it also causes impotence. Half of guys who smoke are impotent. How sexy is that  Now we're also about to publish a study    the first study showing you can change gene expression in men with prostate cancer. This is what's called a heat map    and the different colors    and along the side  on the right  are different genes. And we found that over     genes were favorably changed    in effect  turning on the good genes  the disease preventing genes  turning off the disease promoting genes. And so these findings I think are really very powerful  giving many people new hope and new choices. And companies like Navigenics and DNA Direct and   andMe  that are giving you your genetic profiles  are giving some people a sense of   Gosh  well  what can I do about it   Well  our genes are not our fate  and if we make these changes    they're a predisposition    but if we make bigger changes than we might have made otherwise  we can actually change how our genes are expressed. Thank you. Welcome. If I could have the first slide  please  Contrary to calculations made by some engineers  bees can fly  dolphins can swim  and geckos can even climb up the smoothest surfaces. Now  what I want to do  in the short time I have  is to try to allow each of you to experience the thrill of revealing nature's design. I get to do this all the time  and it's just incredible. I want to try to share just a little bit of that with you in this presentation. The challenge of looking at nature's designs    and I'll tell you the way that we perceive it  and the way we've used it. The challenge  of course  is to answer this question  what permits this extraordinary performance of animals that allows them basically to go anywhere  And if we could figure that out  how can we implement those designs  Well  many biologists will tell engineers  and others  organisms have millions of years to get it right  they're spectacular  they can do everything wonderfully well. So  the answer is bio mimicry  just copy nature directly. We know from working on animals that the truth is that's exactly what you don't want to do    because evolution works on the just good enough principle  not on a perfecting principle. And the constraints in building any organism  when you look at it  are really severe. Natural technologies have incredible constraints. Think about it. If you were an engineer and I told you that you had to build an automobile  but it had to start off to be this big  then it had to grow to be full size and had to work every step along the way. Or think about the fact that if you build an automobile  I'll tell you that you also    inside it    have to put a factory that allows you to make another automobile. And you can absolutely never  absolutely never  because of history and the inherited plan  start with a clean slate. So  organisms have this important history. Really evolution works more like a tinkerer than an engineer. And this is really important when you begin to look at animals. Instead  we believe you need to be inspired by biology. You need to discover the general principles of nature  and then use these analogies when they're advantageous. This is a real challenge to do this  because animals  when you start to really look inside them    how they work    appear hopelessly complex. There's no detailed history of the design plans  you can't go look it up anywhere. They have way too many motions for their joints  too many muscles. Even the simplest animal we think of  something like an insect  and they have more neurons and connections than you can imagine. How can you make sense of this  Well  we believed    and we hypothesized    that one way animals could work simply  is if the control of their movements tended to be built into their bodies themselves. What we discovered was that two   four   six  and eight legged animals all produce the same forces on the ground when they move. They all work like this kangaroo  they bounce. And they can be modeled by a spring mass system that we call the spring mass system because we're biomechanists. It's actually a pogo stick. They all produce the pattern of a pogo stick. How is that true  Well  a human  one of your legs works like two legs of a trotting dog  or works like three legs  together as one  of a trotting insect  or four legs as one of a trotting crab. And then they alternate in their propulsion  but the patterns are all the same. Almost every organism we've looked at this way    you'll see next week  I'll give you a hint  there'll be an article coming out that says that really big things like T. rex probably couldn't do this  but you'll see that next week. Now  what's interesting is the animals  then    we said    bounce along the vertical plane this way  and in our collaborations with Pixar  in  A Bug's Life   we discussed the bipedal nature of the characters of the ants. And we told them  of course  they move in another plane as well. And they asked us this question. They say   Why model just in the sagittal plane or the vertical plane  when you're telling us these animals are moving in the horizontal plane   This is a good question. Nobody in biology ever modeled it this way. We took their advice and we modeled the animals moving in the horizontal plane as well. We took their three legs  we collapsed them down as one. We got some of the best mathematicians in the world from Princeton to work on this problem. And we were able to create a model where animals are not only bouncing up and down  but they're also bouncing side to side at the same time. And many organisms fit this kind of pattern. Now  why is this important to have this model  Because it's very interesting. When you take this model and you perturb it  you give it a push  as it bumps into something  it self stabilizes  with no brain or no reflexes  just by the structure alone. It's a beautiful model. Let's look at the mathematics. That's enough  The animals  when you look at them running  appear to be self stabilizing like this  using basically springy legs. That is  the legs can do computations on their own  the control algorithms  in a sense  are embedded in the form of the animal itself. Why haven't we been more inspired by nature and these kinds of discoveries  Well  I would argue that human technologies are really different from natural technologies  at least they have been so far. Think about the typical kind of robot that you see. Human technologies have tended to be large  flat  with right angles  stiff  made of metal. They have rolling devices and axles. There are very few motors  very few sensors. Whereas nature tends to be small  and curved  and it bends and twists  and has legs instead  and appendages  and has many muscles and many  many sensors. So it's a very different design. However  what's changing  what's really exciting    and I'll show you some of that next    is that as human technology takes on more of the characteristics of nature  then nature really can become a much more useful teacher. And here's one example that's really exciting. This is a collaboration we have with Stanford. And they developed this new technique  called Shape Deposition Manufacturing. It's a technique where they can mix materials together and mold any shape that they like  and put in the material properties. They can embed sensors and actuators right in the form itself. For example  here's a leg  the clear part is stiff  the white part is compliant  and you don't need any axles there or anything. It just bends by itself beautifully. So  you can put those properties in. It inspired them to show off this design by producing a little robot they named Sprawl. Our work has also inspired another robot  a biologically inspired bouncing robot  from the University of Michigan and McGill named RHex  for robot hexapod  and this one's autonomous. Let's go to the video  and let me show you some of these animals moving and then some of the simple robots that have been inspired by our discoveries. Here's what some of you did this morning  although you did it outside  not on a treadmill. Here's what we do. This is a death's head cockroach. This is an American cockroach you think you don't have in your kitchen. This is an eight legged scorpion  six legged ant  forty four legged centipede. Now  I said all these animals are sort of working like pogo sticks    they're bouncing along as they move. And you can see that in this ghost crab  from the beaches of Panama and North Carolina. It goes up to four meters per second when it runs. It actually leaps into the air  and has aerial phases when it does it  like a horse  and you'll see it's bouncing here. What we discovered is whether you look at the leg of a human like Richard  or a cockroach  or a crab  or a kangaroo  the relative leg stiffness of that spring is the same for everything we've seen so far. Now  what good are springy legs then  What can they do  Well  we wanted to see if they allowed the animals to have greater stability and maneuverability. So  we built a terrain that had obstacles three times the hip height of the animals that we're looking at. And we were certain they couldn't do this. And here's what they did. The animal ran over it and it didn't even slow down  It didn't decrease its preferred speed at all. We couldn't believe that it could do this. It said to us that if you could build a robot with very simple  springy legs  you could make it as maneuverable as any that's ever been built. Here's the first example of that. This is the Stanford Shape Deposition Manufactured robot  named Sprawl. It has six legs    there are the tuned  springy legs. It moves in a gait that an insect uses  and here it is going on the treadmill. Now  what's important about this robot  compared to other robots  is that it can't see anything  it can't feel anything  it doesn't have a brain  yet it can maneuver over these obstacles without any difficulty whatsoever. It's this technique of building the properties into the form. This is a graduate student. This is what he's doing to his thesis project    very robust  if a graduate student does that to his thesis project. This is from McGill and University of Michigan. This is the RHex  making its first outing in a demo. Same principle  it only has six moving parts  six motors  but it has springy  tuned legs. It moves in the gait of the insect. It has the middle leg moving in synchrony with the front  and the hind leg on the other side. Sort of an alternating tripod  and they can negotiate obstacles just like the animal. Robert Full  It'll go on different surfaces    here's sand    although we haven't perfected the feet yet  but I'll talk about that later. Here's RHex entering the woods. Again  this robot can't see anything  it can't feel anything  it has no brain. It's just working with a tuned mechanical system  with very simple parts  but inspired from the fundamental dynamics of the animal. I presented this to the jet propulsion lab at NASA  and they said that they had no ability to go down craters to look for ice  and life  ultimately  on Mars. And he said    especially with legged robots  because they're way too complicated. Nothing can do that. And I talk next. I showed them this video with the simple design of RHex here. And just to convince them we should go to Mars in       I tinted the video orange just to give them the sense of being on Mars. Another reason why animals have extraordinary performance  and can go anywhere  is because they have an effective interaction with the environment. The animal I'm going to show you  that we studied to look at this  is the gecko. We have one here and notice its position. It's holding on. Now I'm going to challenge you. I'm going show you a video. One of the animals is going to be running on the level  and the other one's going to be running up a wall. Which one's which  They're going at a meter a second. How many think the one on the left is running up the wall  Okay. The point is it's really hard to tell  isn't it  It's incredible  we looked at students do this and they couldn't tell. They can run up a wall at a meter a second     steps per second  and they look like they're running on the level. How do they do this  It's just phenomenal. The one on the right was going up the hill. How do they do this  They have bizarre toes. They have toes that uncurl like party favors when you blow them out  and then peel off the surface  like tape. Like if we had a piece of tape now  we'd peel it this way. They do this with their toes. It's bizarre  This peeling inspired iRobot    that we work with    to build Mecho Geckos. Here's a legged version and a tractor version  or a bulldozer version. Let's see some of the geckos move with some video  and then I'll show you a little bit of a clip of the robots. Here's the gecko running up a vertical surface. There it goes  in real time. There it goes again. Obviously  we have to slow this down a little bit. You can't use regular cameras. You have to take       pictures per second to see this. And here's some video at       frames per second. Now  I want you to look at the animal's back. Do you see how much it's bending like that  We can't figure that out    that's an unsolved mystery. We don't know how it works. If you have a son or a daughter that wants to come to Berkeley  come to my lab and we'll figure this out. Okay  send them to Berkeley because that's the next thing I want to do. Here's the gecko mill. It's a see through treadmill with a see through treadmill belt  so we can watch the animal's feet  and videotape them through the treadmill belt  to see how they move. Here's the animal that we have here  running on a vertical surface. Pick a foot and try to watch a toe  and see if you can see what the animal's doing. See it uncurl and then peel these toes. It can do this in    milliseconds. It's unbelievable. Here are the robots that they inspire  the Mecho Geckos from iRobot. First we'll see the animals toes peeling    look at that. And here's the peeling action of the Mecho Gecko. It uses a pressure sensitive adhesive to do it. Peeling in the animal. Peeling in the Mecho Gecko    that allows them climb autonomously. Can go on the flat surface  transition to a wall  and then go onto a ceiling. There's the bulldozer version. Now  it doesn't use pressure sensitive glue. The animal does not use that. But that's what we're limited to  at the moment. What does the animal do  The animal has weird toes. And if you look at the toes  they have these little leaves there  and if you blow them up and zoom in  you'll see that's there's little striations in these leaves. And if you zoom in     times  you'll see it looks like a rug. And if you blow that up  and zoom in     times  you see there are hairs there  tiny hairs. And if you look carefully  those tiny hairs have striations. And if you zoom in on those        times  you'll see each hair has split ends. And if you blow those up  they have these little structures on the end. The smallest branch of the hairs looks like spatulae  and an animal like that has one billion of these nano size split ends  to get very close to the surface. In fact  there's the diameter of your hair    a gecko has two million of these  and each hair has     to       split ends. Think of the contact of that that's possible. We were fortunate to work with another group at Stanford that built us a special manned sensor  that we were able to measure the force of an individual hair. Here's an individual hair with a little split end there. When we measured the forces  they were enormous. They were so large that a patch of hairs about this size    the gecko's foot could support the weight of a small child  about    pounds  easily. Now  how do they do it  We've recently discovered this. Do they do it by friction  No  force is too low. Do they do it by electrostatics  No  you can change the charge    they still hold on. Do they do it by interlocking  That's kind of a like a Velcro like thing. No  you can put them on molecular smooth surfaces    they don't do it. How about suction  They stick on in a vacuum. How about wet adhesion  Or capillary adhesion  They don't have any glue  and they even stick under water just fine. If you put their foot under water  they grab on. How do they do it then  Believe it or not  they grab on by intermolecular forces  by Van der Waals forces. You know  you probably had this a long time ago in chemistry  where you had these two atoms  they're close together  and the electrons are moving around. That tiny force is sufficient to allow them to do that because it's added up so many times with these small structures. What we're doing is  we're taking that inspiration of the hairs  and with another colleague at Berkeley  we're manufacturing them. And just recently we've made a breakthrough  where we now believe we're going to be able to create the first synthetic  self cleaning  dry adhesive. Many companies are interested in this. We also presented to Nike even. We'll see where this goes. We were so excited about this that we realized that that small size scale    and where everything gets sticky  and gravity doesn't matter anymore    we needed to look at ants and their feet  because one of my other colleagues at Berkeley has built a six millimeter silicone robot with legs. But it gets stuck. It doesn't move very well. But the ants do  and we'll figure out why  so that ultimately we'll make this move. And imagine  you're going to be able to have swarms of these six millimeter robots available to run around. Where's this going  I think you can see it already. Clearly  the Internet is already having eyes and ears  you have web cams and so forth. But it's going to also have legs and hands. You're going to be able to do programmable work through these kinds of robots  so that you can run  fly and swim anywhere. We saw David Kelly is at the beginning of that with his fish. So  in conclusion  I think the message is clear. If you need a message  if nature's not enough  if you care about search and rescue  or mine clearance  or medicine  or the various things we're working on  we must preserve nature's designs  otherwise these secrets will be lost forever. Thank you. This is a work in process  based on some comments that were made at TED two years ago about the need for the storage of vaccine.  .  billion people don't have access to electricity  refrigeration or stored fuels. This is a problem. It impacts  the spread of disease  the storage of food and medicine and the quality of life. So here's the plan  inexpensive refrigeration that doesn't use electricity  propane  gas  kerosene or consumables. Time for some thermodynamics. And the story of the Intermittent Absorption Refrigerator. Adam Grosser  So    years ago  I had this thermo teacher who talked about absorption and refrigeration. It's one of those things that stuck in my head. It was a lot like the Stirling engine  it was cool  but you didn't know what to do with it. And it was invented in       by this guy Ferdinand Carre  but he couldn't actually build anything with it because of the tools of the time. This crazy Canadian named Powel Crosley commercialized this thing called the IcyBall in       and it was a really neat idea  and I'll get to why it didn't work  but here's how it works. There's two spheres and they're separated in distance. One has a working fluid  water and ammonia  and the other is a condenser. You heat up one side  the hot side. The ammonia evaporates and it re condenses in the other side. You let it cool to room temperature  and then  as the ammonia re evaporates and combines with the water back on the erstwhile hot side  it creates a powerful cooling effect. So  it was a great idea that didn't work at all  it blew up. Because using ammonia you get hugely high pressures if you heated them wrong. It topped     psi. The ammonia was toxic. It sprayed everywhere. But it was kind of an interesting thought. So  the great thing about      is there's a lot of really great computational work you can do. So  we got the whole thermodynamics department at Stanford involved    a lot of computational fluid dynamics. We proved that most of the ammonia refrigeration tables are wrong. We found some non toxic refrigerants that worked at very low vapor pressures. Brought in a team from the U.K.    there's a lot of great refrigeration people  it turned out  in the U.K.    and built a test rig  and proved that  in fact  we could make a low pressure  non toxic refrigerator. So  this is the way it works. You put it on a cooking fire. Most people have cooking fires in the world  whether it's camel dung or wood. It heats up for about    minutes  cools for an hour. Put it into a container and it will refrigerate for    hours. It looks like this. This is the fifth prototype. It's not quite done. Weighs about eight pounds  and this is the way it works. You put it into a    liter vessel  about three gallons  and it'll cool it down to just above freezing    three degrees above freezing    for    hours in a    degree C environment. It's really cheap. We think we can build these in high volumes for about    dollars  in low volumes for about    dollars. And we think we can make refrigeration something that everybody can have. Thank you. Once upon a time  there was a dread disease that afflicted children. And in fact  among all the diseases that existed in this land  it was the worst. It killed the most children. And along came a brilliant inventor  a scientist  who came up with a partial cure for that disease. And it wasn't perfect. Many children still died  but it was certainly better than what they had before. And one of the good things about this cure was that it was free  virtually free  and was very easy to use. But the worst thing about it was that you couldn't use it on the youngest children  on infants  and on one year olds. And so  as a consequence  a few years later  another scientist    perhaps maybe this scientist not quite as brilliant as the one who had preceded him  but building on the invention of the first one    came up with a second cure. And the beauty of the second cure for this disease was that it could be used on infants and one year olds. And the problem with this cure was it was very expensive  and it was very complicated to use. And although parents tried as hard as they could to use it properly  almost all of them ended up using it wrong in the end. But what they did  of course  since it was so complicated and expensive  they only used it on the zero year olds and the one year olds. And they kept on using the existing cure that they had on the two year olds and up. And this went on for quite some time. People were happy. They had their two cures. Until a particular mother  whose child had just turned two  died of this disease. And she thought to herself   My child just turned two  and until the child turned two  I had always used this complicated  expensive cure  you know  this treatment. And then the child turned two  and I started using the cheap and easy treatment  and I wonder     and she wondered  like all parents who lose children wonder     if there isn't something that I could have done  like keep on using that complicated  expensive cure.  And she told all the other people  and she said   How could it possibly be that something that's cheap and simple works as well as something that's complicated and expensive   And the people thought   You know  you're right. It probably is the wrong thing to do to switch and use the cheap and simple solution.  And the government  they heard her story and the other people  and they said   Yeah  you're right  we should make a law. We should outlaw this cheap and simple treatment and not let anybody use this on their children.  And the people were happy. They were satisfied. For many years this went along  and everything was fine. But then along came a lowly economist  who had children himself  and he used the expensive and complicated treatment. But he knew about the cheap and simple one. And he thought about it  and the expensive one didn't seem that great to him. So he thought   I don't know anything about science  but I do know something about data  so maybe I should go and look at the data and see whether this expensive and complicated treatment actually works any better than the cheap and simple one.  And lo and behold  when he went through the data  he found that it didn't look like the expensive  complicated solution was any better than the cheap one  at least for the children who were two and older    the cheap one still didn't work on the kids who were younger. And so  he went forth to the people and he said   I've made this wonderful finding  it looks as if we could just use the cheap and simple solution  and by doing so we could save ourselves     million dollars a year  and we could spend that on our children in other ways.  And the parents were very unhappy  and they said   This is a terrible thing  because how can the cheap and easy thing be as good as the hard thing   And the government was very upset. And in particular  the people who made this expensive solution were very upset because they thought   How can we hope to compete with something that's essentially free  We would lose all of our market.  And people were very angry  and they called him horrible names. And he decided that maybe he should leave the country for a few days  and seek out some more intelligent  open minded people in a place called Oxford  and come and try and tell the story at that place. And so  anyway  here I am. It's not a fairy tale. It's a true story about the United States today  and the disease I'm referring to is actually motor vehicle accidents for children. And the free cure is adult seatbelts  and the expensive cure    the     million dollar a year cure    is child car seats. And what I'd like to talk to you about today is some of the evidence why I believe this to be true  that for children two years old and up  there really is no real benefit    proven benefit    of car seats  in spite of the incredible energy that has been devoted toward expanding the laws and making it socially unacceptable to put your children into seatbelts. And then talk about why    what is it that makes that true  And then  finally talk a little bit about a third way  about another technology  which is probably better than anything we have  but which    there hasn't been any enthusiasm for adoption precisely because people are so enamored with the current car seat solution. OK. So  many times when you try to do research on data  it records complicated stories    it's hard to find in the data. It doesn't turn out to be the case when you look at seatbelts versus car seats. So the United States keeps a data set of every fatal accident that's happened since     . So in every car crash in which at least one person dies  they have information on all of the people. So if you look at that data    it's right up on the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration's website    you can just look at the raw data  and begin to get a sense of the limited amount of evidence that's in favor of car seats for children aged two and up. So  here is the data. Here I have  among two  to six year olds    anyone above six  basically no one uses car seats  so you can't compare      .  percent of the children who are unrestrained in a crash in which at least one person dies  themselves die. If you put a child in a car seat    .  percent of the children die. If they're wearing a lap and shoulder belt  in this raw data    .  percent die. And interestingly  wearing a lap only seatbelt    .  percent die. And actually  the theory tells you that the lap only seatbelt's got to be worse than the lap and shoulder belt. And that just reminds you that when you deal with raw data  there are hundreds of confounding variables that may be getting in the way. So what we do in the study is    and this is just presenting the same information  but turned into a figure to make it easier. So the yellow bar represents car seats  the orange bar lap and shoulder  and the red bar lap only seatbelts. And this is all relative to unrestrained    the bigger the bar  the better. Okay. So  this is the data I just showed  OK  So the highest bar is what you're striving to beat. So you can control for the basic things  like how hard the crash was  what seat the child was sitting in  etc.  the age of the child. And that's that middle set of bars. And so  you can see that the lap only seatbelts start to look worse once you do that. And then finally  the last set of bars  which are really controlling for everything you could possibly imagine about the crash              different characteristics of the crash. And what you find is that the car seats and the lap and shoulder belts  when it comes to saving lives  fatalities look exactly identical. And the standard error bands are relatively small around these estimates as well. And it's not just overall. It's very robust to anything you want to look at. One thing that's interesting  if you look at frontal impact crashes    when the car crashes  the front hits into something    indeed  what you see is that the car seats look a little bit better. And I think this isn't just chance. In order to have the car seat approved  you need to pass certain federal standards  all of which involve slamming your car into a direct frontal crash. But when you look at other types of crashes  like rear impact crashes  indeed  the car seats don't perform as well. And I think that's because they've been optimized to pass  as we always expect people to do  to optimize relative to bright line rules about how affected the car will be. And the other thing you might argue is   Well  car seats have got a lot better over time. And so if we look at recent crashes    the whole data set is almost    years' worth of data    you won't see it in the recent crashes. The new car seats are far  far better.  But indeed  in recent crashes the lap and shoulder seatbelts  actually  are doing even better than the car seats. They say   Well  that's impossible  that can't be.  And the line of argument  if you ask parents  is   But car seats are so expensive and complicated  and they have this big tangle of latches  how could they possibly not work better than seatbelts because they are so expensive and complicated   It's kind of an interesting logic  I think  that people use. And the other logic  they say   Well  the government wouldn't have told us  to  use them if they weren't much better.  But what's interesting is the government telling us to use them is not actually based on very much. It really is based on some impassioned pleas of parents whose children died after they turned two  which has led to the passage of all these laws    not very much on data. So you can only get so far  I think  in telling your story by using these abstract statistics. And so I had some friends over to dinner  and I was asking    we had a cookout    I was asking them what advice they might have for me about proving my point. They said   Why don't you run some crash tests   And I said   That's a great idea.  So we actually tried to commission some crash tests. And it turns out that as we called around to the independent crash test companies around the country  none of them wanted to do our crash test because they said  some explicitly  some not so explicitly   All of our business comes from car seat manufacturers. We can't risk alienating them by testing seatbelts relative to car seats.  Now  eventually  one did. Under the conditions of anonymity  they said they would be happy to do this test for us    so anonymity  and       dollars per seat that we crashed. And so  we went to Buffalo  New York  and here is the precursor to it. These are the crash test dummies  waiting for their chance to take the center stage. And then  here's how the crash test works. Here  they don't actually crash the entire car  you know    it's not worth ruining a whole car to do it. So they just have these bench seats  and they strap the car seat and the seatbelt onto it. So I just wanted you to look at this. And I think this gives you a good idea of why parents think car seats are so great. Look at the kid in the car seat. Does he not look content  ready to go  like he could survive anything  And then  if you look at the kid in back  it looks like he's already choking before the crash even happens. It's hard to believe  when you look at this  that that kid in back is going to do very well when you get in a crash. So this is going to be a crash where they're going to slam this thing forward into a wall at    miles an hour  and see what happens. OK  So  let me show you what happens. These are three year old dummies  by the way. So here    this is the car seat. Now watch two things  watch how the head goes forward  and basically hits the knees    and this is in the car seat    and watch how the car seat flies around  in the rebound  up in the air. The car seat's moving all over the place. Bear in mind there are two things about this. This is a car seat that was installed by someone who has installed       car seats  who knew exactly how to do it. And also it turned out these bench seats are the very best way to install car seats. Having a flat back makes it much easier to install them. And so this is a test that's very much rigged in favor of the car seat  OK  So  that kid in this crash fared very well. The federal standards are that you have to score below a       to be an approved car seat on this crash  in some metric of units which are not important. And this crash would have been about a    . So this car seat was actually an above average car seat from Consumer Reports  and did quite well. So the next one. Now  this is the kid  same crash  who is in the seatbelt. He hardly moves at all  actually  relative to the other child. The funny thing is  the cam work is terrible because they've only set it up to do the car seats  and so  they actually don't even have a way to move the camera so you can see the kid that's on the rebound. Anyway  it turns out that those two crashes  that actually the three year old did slightly worse. So  he gets about a     out of    you know  on this range    relative to a     and something. But still  if you just took that data from that crash to the federal government  and said   I have invented a new car seat. I would like you to approve it for selling   then they would say   This is a fantastic new car seat  it works great. It only got a      it could have gotten as high up as a      .  And this seatbelt would have passed with flying colors into being approved as a car seat. So  in some sense  what this is suggesting is that it's not just that people are setting up their car seats wrong  which is putting children at risk. It's just that  fundamentally  the car seats aren't doing much. So here's the crash. So these are timed at the same time  so you can see that it takes much longer with the car seat    at rebound  it takes a lot longer    but there's just a lot less movement for child who's in the seatbelt. So  I'll show you the six year old crashes as well. The six year old is in a car seat  and it turns out that looks terrible  but that's great. That's like a      OK  So that kid would do fine in the crash. Nothing about that would have been problematic to the child at all. And then here's the six year old in the seatbelt  and in fact  they get exactly within  you know  within one or two points of the same. So really  for the six year old  the car seat did absolutely nothing whatsoever. That's some more evidence  so in some sense    I was criticized by a scientist  who said   You could never publish a study with an n of     meaning those four crashes. So I wrote him back and I said   What about an n of          Because I had the other        other real world crashes. And I just think that it's interesting that the idea of using real world crashes  which is very much something that economists think would be the right thing to do  is something that scientists don't actually  usually think    they would rather use a laboratory  a very imperfect science of looking at the dummies  than actually    years of data of what we've seen with children and with car seats. And so I think the answer to this puzzle is that there's a much better solution out there  that's gotten nobody excited because everyone is so delighted with the way car seats are presumably working. And if you think from a design perspective  about going back to square one  and say   I just want to protect kids in the back seat.  I don't there's anyone in this room who'd say   Well  the right way to start would be  let's make a great seat belt for adults. And then  let's make this really big contraption that you have to rig up to it in this daisy chain.  I mean  why not start    who's sitting in the back seat anyway except for kids  But essentially  do something like this  which I don't know exactly how much it would cost to do  but there's no reason I could see why this should be much more expensive than a regular car seat. It's just actually    you see  this is folding up    it's behind the seat. You've got a regular seat for adults  and then you fold it down  and the kid sits on top  and it's integrated. It seems to me that this can't be a very expensive solution  and it's got to work better than what we already have. So the question is  is there any hope for adoption of something like this  which would presumably save a lot of lives  And I think the answer  perhaps  lies in a story. The answer both to why has a car seat been so successful  and why this may someday be adopted or not  lies in a story that my dad told me  relating to when he was a doctor in the U.S. Air Force in England. And this is a long time ago  you were allowed to do things then you can't do today. So  my father would have patients come in who he thought were not really sick. And he had a big jar full of placebo pills that he would give them  and he'd say   Come back in a week  if you still feel lousy.  OK  and most of them would not come back  but some of them would come back. And when they came back  he  still convinced they were not sick  had another jar of pills. In this jar were huge horse pills. They were almost impossible to swallow. And these  to me  are the analogy for the car seats. People would look at these and say   Man  this thing is so big and so hard to swallow. If this doesn't make me feel better  you know  what possibly could   And it turned out that most people wouldn't come back  because it worked. But every once in a while  there was still a patient convinced that he was sick  and he'd come back. And my dad had a third jar of pills. And the jar of pills he had  he said  were the tiniest little pills he could find  so small you could barely see them. And he would say  listen  I know I gave you that huge pill  that complicated  hard to swallow pill before  but now I've got one that's so potent  that is really tiny and small and almost invisible. It's almost like this thing here  which you can't even see.  And it turned out that never  in all the times my dad gave out this pill  the really tiny pill  did anyone ever come back still complaining of sickness. So  my dad always took that as evidence that this little  teeny  powerful pill had the ultimate placebo effect. And in some sense  if that's the right story  I think integrated car seats you will see  very quickly  becoming something that everyone has. The other possible conclusion is  well  maybe after coming to my father three times  getting sent home with placebos  he still felt sick  he went and found another doctor. And that's completely possible. And if that's the case  then I think we're stuck with conventional car seats for a long time to come. Thank you very much. we don't necessarily wear them just to prevent loss of life  it's also to prevent lots of serious injury. Your data looks at fatalities. It doesn't look at serious injury. Is there any data to show that child seats are actually less effective  or just as effective as seatbelts for serious injury  Because that would prove your case.  Steven Levitt  Yeah  that's a great question. In my data  and in another data set I've looked at for New Jersey crashes  I find very small differences in injury. So in this data  it's statistically insignificant differences in injury between car seats and lap and shoulder belts. In the New Jersey data  which is different  because it's not just fatal crashes  but all crashes in New Jersey that are reported  it turns out that there is a    percent difference in injuries  but generally they're the minor injuries. Now  what's interesting  I should say this as a disclaimer  there is medical literature that is very difficult to resolve with this other data  which suggests that car seats are dramatically better. And they use a completely different methodology that involves    after the crash occurs  they get from the insurance companies the names of the people who were in the crash  and they call them on the phone  and they asked them what happened. And I really can't resolve  yet  and I'd like to work with these medical researchers to try to understand how there can be these differences  which are completely at odds with one another. But it's obviously a critical question. The question is even if    are there enough serious injuries to make these cost effective  It's kind of tricky. Even if they're right  it's not so clear that they're so cost effective. Probably a lot of you know the story of the two salesmen who went down to Africa in the     s. They were sent down to find if there was any opportunity for selling shoes  and they wrote telegrams back to Manchester. And one of them wrote   Situation hopeless. Stop. They don't wear shoes.  And the other one wrote   Glorious opportunity. They don't have any shoes yet.  Now  there's a similar situation in the classical music world  because there are some people who think that classical music is dying. And there are some of us who think you ain't seen nothing yet. And rather than go into statistics and trends  and tell you about all the orchestras that are closing  and the record companies that are folding  I thought we should do an experiment tonight. Actually  it's not really an experiment  because I know the outcome. But it's like an experiment. Now  before we start    Before we start  I need to do two things. One is I want to remind you of what a seven year old child sounds like when he plays the piano. Maybe you have this child at home. He sounds something like this. I see some of you recognize this child. Now  if he practices for a year and takes lessons  he's now eight and he sounds like this. He practices for another year and takes lessons    he's nine. Then he practices for another year and takes lessons    now he's   . At that point  they usually give up. Now  if you'd waited for one more year  you would have heard this. Now  what happened was not maybe what you thought  which is  he suddenly became passionate  engaged  involved  got a new teacher  he hit puberty  or whatever it is. What actually happened was the impulses were reduced. You see  the first time  he was playing with an impulse on every note. And the second  with an impulse every other note. You can see it by looking at my head. The nine year old put an impulse on every four notes. The    year old  on every eight notes. And the    year old  one impulse on the whole phrase. I don't know how we got into this position. I didn't say   I'm going to move my shoulder over  move my body.  No  the music pushed me over  which is why I call it one buttock playing. It can be the other buttock. You know  a gentleman was once watching a presentation I was doing  when I was working with a young pianist. He was the president of a corporation in Ohio. I was working with this young pianist  and said   The trouble with you is you're a two buttock player. You should be a one buttock player.  I moved his body while he was playing. And suddenly  the music took off. It took flight. The audience gasped when they heard the difference. Then I got a letter from this gentleman. He said   I was so moved. I went back and I transformed my entire company into a one buttock company.  Now  the other thing I wanted to do is to tell you about you. There are       people  I believe. My estimation is that probably    of you are absolutely passionate about classical music. You adore classical music. Your FM is always on that classical dial. You have CDs in your car  and you go to the symphony  your children are playing instruments. You can't imagine your life without classical music. That's the first group  quite small. Then there's another bigger group. The people who don't mind classical music. You know  you've come home from a long day  and you take a glass of wine  and you put your feet up. A little Vivaldi in the background doesn't do any harm. That's the second group. Now comes the third group  people who never listen to classical music. It's just simply not part of your life. You might hear it like second hand smoke at the airport ...    and maybe a little bit of a march from  Aida  when you come into the hall. But otherwise  you never hear it. That's probably the largest group. And then there's a very small group. These are the people who think they're tone deaf. Amazing number of people think they're tone deaf. Actually  I hear a lot   My husband is tone deaf.  Actually  you cannot be tone deaf. Nobody is tone deaf. If you were tone deaf  you couldn't change the gears on your car  in a stick shift car. You couldn't tell the difference between somebody from Texas and somebody from Rome. And the telephone. The telephone. If your mother calls on the miserable telephone  she calls and says   Hello   you not only know who it is  you know what mood she's in. You have a fantastic ear. Everybody has a fantastic ear. So nobody is tone deaf. But I tell you what. It doesn't work for me to go on with this thing  with such a wide gulf between those who understand  love and are passionate about classical music  and those who have no relationship to it at all. The tone deaf people  they're no longer here. But even between those three categories  it's too wide a gulf. So I'm not going to go on until every single person in this room  downstairs and in Aspen  and everybody else looking  will come to love and understand classical music. So that's what we're going to do. Now  you notice that there is not the slightest doubt in my mind that this is going to work  if you look at my face  right  It's one of the characteristics of a leader that he not doubt for one moment the capacity of the people he's leading to realize whatever he's dreaming. Imagine if Martin Luther King had said   I have a dream. Of course  I'm not sure they'll be up to it.  All right. So I'm going to take a piece of Chopin. This is a beautiful prelude by Chopin. Some of you will know it. Do you know what I think probably happened here  When I started  you thought   How beautiful that sounds.   I don't think we should go to the same place for our summer holidays next year.  It's funny  isn't it  It's funny how those thoughts kind of waft into your head. And of course    Of course  if the piece is long and you've had a long day  you might actually drift off. Then your companion will dig you in the ribs and say   Wake up  It's culture   And then you feel even worse. But has it ever occurred to you that the reason you feel sleepy in classical music is not because of you  but because of us  Did anybody think while I was playing   Why is he using so many impulses   If I'd done this with my head you certainly would have thought it. And for the rest of your life  every time you hear classical music  you'll always be able to know if you hear those impulses. So let's see what's really going on here. We have a B. This is a B. The next note is a C. And the job of the C is to make the B sad. And it does  doesn't it  Composers know that. If they want sad music  they just play those two notes. But basically  it's just a B  with four sads. Now  it goes down to A. Now to G. And then to F. So we have B  A  G  F. And if we have B  A  G  F  what do we expect next  That might have been a fluke. Let's try it again. Oh  the TED choir. And you notice nobody is tone deaf  right  Nobody is. You know  every village in Bangladesh and every hamlet in China    everybody knows  da  da  da  da    da. Everybody knows  who's expecting that E. Chopin didn't want to reach the E there  because what will have happened  It will be over  like Hamlet. Do you remember  Act One  scene three  he finds out his uncle killed his father. He keeps on going up to his uncle and almost killing him. And then he backs away  he goes up to him again  almost kills him. The critics sitting in the back row there  they have to have an opinion  so they say   Hamlet is a procrastinator.  Or they say   Hamlet has an Oedipus complex.  No  otherwise the play would be over  stupid. That's why Shakespeare puts all that stuff in Hamlet    Ophelia going mad  the play within the play  and Yorick's skull  and the gravediggers. That's in order to delay    until Act Five  he can kill him. It's the same with the Chopin. He's just about to reach the E  and he says   Oops  better go back up and do it again.  So he does it again. Now  he gets excited. That's excitement  don't worry about it. Now  he gets to F sharp  and finally he goes down to E  but it's the wrong chord    because the chord he's looking for is this one  and instead he does ... Now  we call that a deceptive cadence  because it deceives us. I tell my students   If you have a deceptive cadence  raise your eyebrows  and everybody will know.  Right. He gets to E  but it's the wrong chord. Now  he tries E again. That chord doesn't work. Now  he tries the E again. That chord doesn't work. Now  he tries E again  and that doesn't work. And then finally ... There was a gentleman in the front row who went   Mmm.  It's the same gesture he makes when he comes home after a long day  turns off the key in his car and says   Aah  I'm home.  Because we all know where home is. So this is a piece which goes from away to home. I'm going to play it all the way through and you're going to follow. B  C  B  C  B  C  B    down to A  down to G  down to F. Almost goes to E  but otherwise the play would be over. He goes back up to B  he gets very excited. Goes to F sharp. Goes to E. It's the wrong chord. It's the wrong chord. And finally goes to E  and it's home. And what you're going to see is one buttock playing. Because for me  to join the B to the E  I have to stop thinking about every single note along the way  and start thinking about the long  long line from B to E. You know  we were just in South Africa  and you can't go to South Africa without thinking of Mandela in jail for    years. What was he thinking about  Lunch  No  he was thinking about the vision for South Africa and for human beings. This is about vision. This is about the long line. Like the bird who flies over the field and doesn't care about the fences underneath  all right  So now  you're going to follow the line all the way from B to E. And I've one last request before I play this piece all the way through. Would you think of somebody who you adore  who's no longer there  A beloved grandmother  a lover    somebody in your life who you love with all your heart  but that person is no longer with you. Bring that person into your mind  and at the same time  follow the line all the way from B to E  and you'll hear everything that Chopin had to say. Now  you may be wondering    You may be wondering why I'm clapping. Well  I did this at a school in Boston with about    seventh graders     year olds. I did exactly what I did with you  and I explained the whole thing. At the end  they went crazy  clapping. I was clapping. They were clapping. Finally  I said   Why am I clapping   And one of them said   Because we were listening.  Think of it.       people  busy people  involved in all sorts of different things  listening  understanding and being moved by a piece by Chopin. Now  that is something. Am I sure that every single person followed that  understood it  was moved by it  Of course  I can't be sure. But I'll tell you what happened to me in Ireland during the Troubles     years ago  and I was working with some Catholic and Protestant kids on conflict resolution. And I did this with them    a risky thing to do  because they were street kids. And one of them came to me the next morning and he said   You know  I've never listened to classical music in my life  but when you played that shopping piece ...  He said   My brother was shot last year and I didn't cry for him. But last night  when you played that piece  he was the one I was thinking about. And I felt the tears streaming down my face. And it felt really good to cry for my brother.  So I made up my mind at that moment that classical music is for everybody. Everybody. Now  how would you walk    my profession  the music profession doesn't see it that way. They say three percent of the population likes classical music. If only we could move it to four percent  our problems would be over. How would you walk  How would you talk  How would you be  If you thought   Three percent of the population likes classical music  if only we could move it to four percent.  How would you walk or talk  How would you be  If you thought   Everybody loves classical music    they just haven't found out about it yet.  See  these are totally different worlds. Now  I had an amazing experience. I was    years old  I'd been conducting for    years  and I suddenly had a realization. The conductor of an orchestra doesn't make a sound. My picture appears on the front of the CD    But the conductor doesn't make a sound. He depends  for his power  on his ability to make other people powerful. And that changed everything for me. It was totally life changing. People in my orchestra said   Ben  what happened   That's what happened. I realized my job was to awaken possibility in other people. And of course  I wanted to know whether I was doing that. How do you find out  You look at their eyes. If their eyes are shining  you know you're doing it. You could light up a village with this guy's eyes. Right. So if the eyes are shining  you know you're doing it. If the eyes are not shining  you get to ask a question. And this is the question  who am I being that my players' eyes are not shining  We can do that with our children  too. Who am I being  that my children's eyes are not shining  That's a totally different world. Now  we're all about to end this magical  on the mountain week  we're going back into the world. And I say  it's appropriate for us to ask the question  who are we being as we go back out into the world  And you know  I have a definition of success. For me  it's very simple. It's not about wealth and fame and power. It's about how many shining eyes I have around me. So now  I have one last thought  which is that it really makes a difference what we say    the words that come out of our mouth. I learned this from a woman who survived Auschwitz  one of the rare survivors. She went to Auschwitz when she was    years old. And ... And her brother was eight  and the parents were lost. And she told me this  she said   We were in the train going to Auschwitz  and I looked down and saw my brother's shoes were missing. I said  'Why are you so stupid  can't you keep your things together for goodness' sake '  The way an elder sister might speak to a younger brother. Unfortunately  it was the last thing she ever said to him  because she never saw him again. He did not survive. And so when she came out of Auschwitz  she made a vow. She told me this. She said   I walked out of Auschwitz into life and I made a vow. And the vow was   I will never say anything that couldn't stand as the last thing I ever say.  Now  can we do that  No. And we'll make ourselves wrong and others wrong. But it is a possibility to live into. Thank you. Shining eyes. Shining eyes. Thank you  thank you. Most people don't know that when I went to high school in this country    I applied for university at a time when I was convinced I was going to be an artist and be a sculptor. And I came from a very privileged background. I was very lucky. My family was wealthy  and my father believed in one thing  and that was to give us all as much education as we wanted. And I announced I wanted to be a sculptor in Paris. And he was a clever man. He sort of said   Well  that's OK  but you've done very well in your math SATs.  In fact  I'd got an    . And he thought I did very well    and I did  too    in the arts  this was my passion. And he said  If you go to MIT   to which I had been given early admission   I will pay for every year you're at MIT  in graduate or undergraduate    as much as you want    I will pay for an equal number of years for you to live in Paris.  And I thought that was the best deal in town  so I accepted it immediately. And I decided that if I was good in art  and I was good in mathematics  I'd study architecture  which was the blending of the two. I went and told my headmaster that  at prep school. And I said to him what I was doing  that I was going to go study architecture because it was art and mathematics put together. He said to me something that just went completely over my head. He said   You know  I like grey suits  and I like pin striped suits  but I don't like grey pin striped suits.  And I thought   What a turkey this guy is   and I went off to MIT. I studied architecture  then did a second degree in architecture  and then actually quickly realized that it wasn't architecture. That really  the mixing of art and science was computers  and that that really was the place to bring both  and enjoyed a career doing that. And probably  if I were to fill out Jim Citrin's scale  I'd put     percent on the side of the equation where you spend time making it possible for others to be creative. And after doing this for a long time  and the Media Lab passing the baton on  I thought   Well  maybe it's time for me to do a project. Something that would be important  but also something that would take advantage of all of these privileges that one had.  And in the case of the Media Lab  knowing a lot of people  knowing people who were either executives or wealthy  and also not having  in my own case  a career to worry about anymore. My career  I mean  I'd done my career. Didn't have to worry about earning money. Didn't have to worry about what people thought about me. And I said   Boy  let's really do something that takes advantage of all these features   and thought that if we could address education  by leveraging the children  and bringing to the world the access of the computers  that that was really the thing we should do. Never shown this picture before  and probably going to be sued for it. It's taken at three o'clock in the morning  without the permission of the company. It's about two weeks old. There they are  folks. If you look at the picture  you'll see they're stacked up. Those are conveyor belts that go around. This is one of the conveyor belts with the thing going by  but then you'll see the ones up above. What happens is  they burn into flash memory the software  and then test them for a few hours. But you've got to have the thing moving on the assembly line  because it's constant. So they go around in this loop  which is why you see them up there. So this was great for us because it was a real turning point. But it goes back. This picture was taken in       just before the IBM PC was even announced. Seymour Papert and I were bringing computers to schools and developing nations at a time when it was way ahead of itself. But one thing we learned was that these kids can absolutely jump into it just the same way as our kids do here. And when people tell me   Who's going to teach the teachers to teach the kids   I say to myself   What planet do you come from   Okay  there's not a person in this room    I don't care how techie you are    there's not a person in this room that doesn't give their laptop or cell phone to a kid to help them debug it. OK  We all need help  even those of us who are very seasoned. This picture of Seymour       years ago. Seymour made a very simple observation in       and then basically presented it in         April    to be precise    called  Teaching Children Thinking.  What he observed was that kids who write computer programs understand things differently  and when they debug the programs  they come the closest to learning about learning. That was very important  and in some sense  we've lost that. Kids don't program enough and boy  if there's anything I hope this brings back  it's programming to kids. It's really important. Using applications is OK  but programming is absolutely fundamental. This is being launched with three languages in it  Squeak  Logo  and a third  that I've never even seen before. The point being  this is going to be very  very intensive on the programming side. This photograph is very important because it's much later. This is in the early     s. My son  Dimitri    who's here  many of you know Dimitri    went to Cambodia  set up this school that we had built  just as the school connected it to the Internet. And these kids had their laptops. But it was really what spirited this  plus the influence of Joe and others. We started One Laptop per Child. This is the same village in Cambodia  just a couple of months ago. These kids are real pros. There were just       machines out there being tested by kids. Being a nonprofit is absolutely fundamental. Everybody advised me not to be a nonprofit  but they were all wrong. And the reason being a nonprofit is important is actually twofold. There are many reasons  but the two that merit the little bit of time is  one  the clarity of purpose is there. The moral purpose is clear. I can see any head of state  any executive I want  at any time  because I'm not selling laptops. OK  I have no shareholders. Whether we sell  it doesn't make any difference whatsoever. The clarity of purpose is absolutely critical. And the second is very counterintuitive    you can get the best people in the world. If you look at our professional services  including search firms  including communications  including legal services  including banking  they're all pro bono. And it's not to save money. We've got money in the bank. It's because you get the best people. You get the people who are doing it because they believe in the mission  and they're the best people. We couldn't afford to hire a CFO. We put out a job description for a CFO at zero salary  and we had a queue of people. It allows you to team up with people. The U.N.'s not going to be our partner if we're profit making. So announcing this with Kofi Annan was very important  and the U.N. allowed us to basically reach all the countries. And this was the machine we were showing before I met Yves Behar. And while this machine in some sense is silly  in retrospect  it actually served a very important purpose. That pencil yellow crank was remembered by everybody. Everybody remembered the pencil yellow crank. It's different. It was getting its power in a different way. It's kind of childlike. Even though this wasn't the direction we went because the crank    it really is stupid to have it on board  by the way. In spite of what some people in the press don't get it  didn't understand it  we didn't take it off because we didn't want to do    having it on the laptop itself is really not what you want. You want a separate thing  like the AC adaptor. I didn't bring one with me  but they really work much better off board. And then  I could tell you lots about the laptop  but I decided on just four things. Just keep in mind    because there are other people  including Bill Gates  who said   Gee  you've got a real computer.  That computer is unlike anything you've had  and does things    there are four of them    that you don't come close to. And it's very important to be low power  and I hope that's picked up more by the industry. That the reason that you want to be below two watts is that's roughly what you can generate with your upper body. Dual mode display    that sunlight display's fantastic. We were using it at lunch today in the sunlight  and the more sunlight the better. And that was really critical. The mesh network  it'll become commonplace. And of course   rugged  goes without saying. And the reason I think design matters isn't because I wanted to go to art school. And by the way  when I graduated from MIT  I thought the worst and silliest thing to do would be to go to Paris for six years.  Laughter  So  I didn't do that. But design matters for a number of reasons. The most important being that it is the best way to make an inexpensive product. Most people make inexpensive products by taking cheap design  cheap labor  cheap components  and making a cheap laptop. And  in English  the word  cheap  has a double meaning  which is really appropriate  because it's cheap  in the pejorative sense  as well as inexpensive. But if you take a different approach  and you think of very large scale integration  very advanced materials  very advanced manufacturing    so you're pouring chemicals in one end  iPods are spewing out the other    and really cool design  that's what we wanted to do. And I can race through these and save a lot of time because Yves and I obviously didn't compare notes. These are his slides  and so I don't have to talk about them. But it was really  to us  very important as a strategy. It wasn't just to kind of make it cute  because somebody    you know  good design is very important. Yves showed one of the power generating devices. The mesh network  the reason I    and I won't go into it in great detail    but when we deliver laptops to kids in the remotest and poorest parts of the world  they're connected. There's not just laptops. And so  we have to drop in satellite dishes. We put in generators. It's a lot of stuff that goes behind these. These can talk to each other. If you're in a desert  they can talk to each other about two kilometers apart. If you're in the jungle  it's about     meters. So if a kid bicycles home  or walks a few miles  they're going to be off the grid  so to speak. They're not going to be near another laptop  so you have to nail these onto a tree  and sort of  get it. You don't call Verizon or Sprint. You build your own network. And that's very important  the user interface. We are launching with    keyboards. English is by far the minority. Latin is relatively rare  too. You just look at some of the languages. I'm willing to suspect some of you hadn't even heard of them before. Is there anybody in the room  one person  unless you work with OLPC  is there anybody in the room that can tell me what language the keyboard is that's on the screen  There's only one hand    so you get it. Yes  you're right. He's right. It's Amharic  it's Ethiopian. In Ethiopia  there's never been a keyboard. There is no keyboard standard because there's no market. And this is the big difference. Again  when you're a nonprofit  you look at children as a mission  not as a market. So we went to Ethiopia  and we helped them make a keyboard. And this will become the standard Ethiopian keyboard. So what I want to end with is sort of what we're doing to roll it out. And we changed strategy completely. I decided at the beginning    it was a pretty good thing to decide in the beginning  it's not what we're doing now    is to go to six countries. Big countries  one of them is not so big  but it's rich. Here's the six. We went to the six  and in each case the head of state said he would do it  he'd do a million. In the case of Gaddafi  he'd do  .  million  and that they would launch it. We thought  this is exactly the right strategy  get it out  and then the little countries could sort of piggyback on these big countries. And so I went to each of those countries at least six times  met with the head of state probably two or three times. In each case  got the ministers  went through a lot of the stuff. This was a period in my life where I was traveling     days per year. Not something you'd envy or want to do. In the case of Libya  it was a lot of fun meeting Gaddafi in his tent. The camel smells were unbelievable. And it was    degrees C. I mean  this was not what you'd call a cool experience. And former countries    I say former  because none of them really came through this summer    there was a big difference between getting a head of state to have a photo opportunity  make a press release. So we went to smaller ones. Uruguay  bless their hearts. Small country  not so rich. President said he'd do it  and guess what  He did do it. The tender had nothing in it that related to us  nothing specific about sunlight readable  mesh network  low power  but just a vanilla laptop proposal. And guess what  We won it hands down. When it was announced that they were going to do every child in Uruguay  the first          boom  went to OLPC. The next day    the next day  not even    hours had passed    in Peru  the president of Peru said   We'll do    .  And boom  a little domino effect. The president of Rwanda stepped in and said he would do it. The president of Ethiopia said he would do it. And boom  boom  boom. The president of Mongolia. And so what happens is  these things start to happen with these countries    still not enough. Add up all those countries  it didn't quite get to thing  so we said   Let's start a program in the United States.  So  end of August  early September  we decide to do this. We announced it near the middle  end    just when the Clinton Initiative was taking place. We thought that was a good time to announce it. Launched it on the    of November. We said it would be just for a short period until the   . We've extended it until the   . And the  Give One  Get One  program is really important because it got a lot of people absolutely interested. The first day it was just wild. And then we said   Well  let's get people to give many. Not just one  and get one  but maybe give      give      .  And that's where you come in. And that's where I think it's very important. I don't want you all to go out and buy     dollars worth of laptops. Okay  Do it  but that's not going to help. Okay  If everybody in this room goes out tonight and orders one of these things for     dollars  whatever it is      people in the room doing it    yeah  great. I want you do something else. And it's not to go out and buy     or        though  I invite you to do that  and        would be even better. Tell people about it  It's got to become viral  OK  Use your mailing lists. People in this room have extraordinary mailing lists. Get your friends to give one  get one. And if each one of you sends it to     or     people  that would be fantastic. I won't dwell on the pricing at all. Just to say that when you do the  Give One  Get One   a lot of press is a bit about   They didn't make it  it's     dollars  it's not    .  It will be     in two years. It will go below    . We've pledged not to add features  but to bring that price down. But it was the countries that wanted it to go up  and we let them push it up for all sorts of reasons. So what you can do    I've just said it. Don't just give one  get one. I just want to end with one last one. This one is not even    hours old  or maybe it's    hours. The first kids got their laptops. They got them by ship  and I'm talking now about              at a time went out this week. They went to Uruguay  Peru  Mexico. And it's been slow coming  and we're only making about       a week  but we hope  we hope  sometime in next year  maybe by the middle of the year  to hit a million a month. Now put that number  and a million isn't so much. It's not a big number. We're selling a billion cell phones worldwide this year. But a million a month in laptop land is a big number. And the world production today  everybody combined  making laptops  is five million a month. So I'm standing here telling you that sometime next year  we're going to make    percent of the world production. And if we do that  there are going to be a lot of lucky kids out there. And we hope if you have EG two years from now  or whenever you have it again  I won't have bad breath  and I will be invited back  and will have  hopefully by then  maybe     million out there to children. Thank you. Those of you who know me know how passionate I am about opening the space frontier. So when I had the chance to give the world's expert in gravity the experience of zero gravity  it was incredible. And I want to tell you that story. I first met him through the Archon X PRIZE for Genomics. It's a competition we're holding  the second X PRIZE  for the first team to sequence     human genomes in    days. We have something called the Genome            individuals we're sequencing as part of that. Craig Venter chairs that event. And I met Professor Hawking  and he said his dream was to travel into space. And I said   I can't take you there  but I can take you into weightlessness into zero g. And he said  on the spot   Absolutely  yes.  Well  the only way to experience zero g on Earth is actually with parabolic flight  weightless flight. You take an airplane  you fly over the top  you're weightless for    seconds. Come back down  you weigh twice as much. You do it again and again. You can get eight     minutes of weightlessness    how NASA's trained their astronauts for so long. We set out to do this. It took us    years to become operational. And we announced that we were going to fly Stephen Hawking. We had one government agency and one company aircraft operator say  you're crazy  don't do that  you're going kill the guy. And he wanted to go. We worked hard to get all the permissions. And six months later  we sat down at Kennedy Space Center. We had a press conference  we announced our intent to do one zero g parabola  give him    seconds of zero g. And if it went really well  we might do three parabolas. Well  we asked him why he wanted to go up and do this. And what he said  for me  was very moving. He said   Life on Earth is at an ever increasing risk of being wiped out by disaster ... I think the human race doesn't have a future if it doesn't go into space. I therefore want to encourage public interest in space.  We took him out to the Kennedy Space Center  up inside the NASA vehicle  into the back of the zero g airplane. We had about    people who made donations    we raised          in donations for children's charities    who flew with us. A few TEDsters here. We set up a whole ER. We had four emergency room doctors and two nurses on board the airplane. We were monitoring his PO  of his blood  his heart rate  his blood pressure. We had everything all set in case of an emergency  God knows  you don't want to hurt this world renowned expert. We took off from the shuttle landing facility  where the shuttle takes off and lands. And my partner Byron Lichtenberg and I carefully suspended him into zero g. Once he was there   we  let him go to experience what weightlessness was truly like. And after that first parabola  you know  the doc said everything is great. He was smiling  and we said go. So we did a second parabola. And a third. We actually floated an apple in homage to Sir Isaac Newton because Professor Hawking holds the same chair at Cambridge that Isaac Newton did. And we did a fourth  and a fifth and a sixth. And a seventh and an eighth. And this man does not look like a    year old wheelchair bound man. He was so happy. We are living on a precious jewel  and it's during our lifetime that we're moving off this planet. Please join us in this epic adventure. Thank you so much. Some of you have heard the story before  but  in fact  there's somebody in the audience who's never heard this story    in front of an audience    before  so I'm a little more nervous than I normally am telling this story. I used to be a photographer for many years. In       I was working for Time magazine  and I was given a three day assignment to photograph Amerasian children  children who had been fathered by American GIs all over Southeast Asia  and then abandoned           children all over Asia. I had never heard the word Amerasian before. I spent a few days photographing children in different countries  and like a lot of photographers and a lot of journalists  I always hope that when my pictures were published  they might actually have an effect on a situation  instead of just documenting it. So  I was so disturbed by what I saw  and I was so unhappy with the article that ran afterwards  that I decided I would take six months off. I was    years old. I decided I would find six children in different countries  and actually go spend some time with the kids  and try to tell their story a little bit better than I thought I had done for Time magazine. In the course of doing the story  I was looking for children who hadn't been photographed before  and the Pearl Buck Foundation told me that they worked with a lot of Americans who were donating money to help some of these kids. And a man told me  who ran the Pearl Buck Foundation in Korea  that there was a young girl  who was    years old  being raised by her grandmother. And the grandmother had never let any Westerners ever see her. Every time any Westerners came to the village  she hid the girl. And of course  I was immediately intrigued. I saw photographs of her  and I thought I wanted to go. And the guy just told me   There's no way. This grandmother won't even    you know  there's no way she's ever going to let you meet this girl that's she's raising.  I took a translator with me  and went to this village  found the grandmother  sat down with her. And to my astonishment  she agreed to let me photograph her granddaughter. And I was paying for this myself  so I asked the translator if it would be OK if I stayed for the week. I had a sleeping bag. The family had a small shed on the side of the house  so I said   Could I sleep in my sleeping bag in the evenings   And I just told the little girl  whose name was Hyun Sook Lee  that if I ever did anything to embarrass her    she didn't speak a word of English  although she looked very American    she could just put up her hand and say   Stop   and I would stop taking pictures. And then  my translator left. So there I was  I couldn't speak a word of Korean  and this is the first night I met Hyun Sook. Her mother was still alive. Her mother was not raising her  her grandmother was raising her. And what struck me immediately was how in love the two of these people were. The grandmother was incredibly fond  deeply in love with this little girl. They slept on the floor at night. The way they heat their homes in Korea is to put bricks under the floors  so the heat actually radiates from underneath the floor. Hyun Sook was    years old. I had photographed  as I said  a lot of these kids. Hyun Sook was in fact the fifth child that I found to photograph. And almost universally  amongst all the kids  they were really psychologically damaged by having been made fun of  ridiculed  picked on and been rejected. And Korea was probably the place I found to be the worst for these kids. And what struck me immediately in meeting Hyun Sook was how confident she appeared to be  how happy she seemed to be in her own skin. And remember this picture  because I'm going to show you another picture later  but you can see how much she looks like her grandmother  although she looks so Western. I decided to follow her to school. This is the first morning I stayed with her. This is on the way to school. This is the morning assembly outside her school. And I noticed that she was clowning around. When the teachers would ask questions  she'd be the first person to raise her hand. Again  not at all shy or withdrawn  or anything like the other children that I'd photographed. Again  the first one to go to the blackboard to answer questions. Getting in trouble for whispering into her best friend's ears in the middle of class. And one of the other things that I said to her through the translator    again  this thing about saying stop    was to not pay attention to me. And so  she really just completely ignored me most of the time. I noticed that at recess  she was the girl who picked the other girls to be on her team. It was very obvious  from the very beginning  that she was a leader. This is on the way home. And that's North Korea up along the hill. This is up along the DMZ. They would actually cover the windows every night  so that light couldn't be seen  because the South Korean government has said for years that the North Koreans may invade at any time. So there's always this    the closer you were to North Korea  the more terrifying it was. Very often at school  I'd be taking pictures  and she would whisper into her girlfriends' ears  and then look at me and say   Stop.  And I would stand at attention  and all the girls would crack up  and it was sort of a little joke. The end of the week came and my translator came back  because I'd asked her to come back  so I could formally thank the grandmother and Hyun Sook. And in the course of the grandmother talking to the translator  the grandmother started crying. And I said to my translator   What's going on  why is she crying   And she spoke to the grandmother for a moment  and then she started getting tears in her eyes. And I said   OK  what did I do  What's going on  Why is everyone crying   And the translator said   The grandmother says that she thinks she's dying  and she wants to know if you would take Hyun Sook to America with you.  And I said   I'm    years old  and I live in hotels  and I'm not married.  I mean I had fallen in love with this girl  but I    you know  it was  like  emotionally I was about    years old. If you know of photographers  the joke is it's the finest form of delayed adolescence ever invented.  Sorry  I have to go on an assignment  I'll be back     and then you never come back. So  I asked the translator why she thought she was dying. Can I get her to a hospital  Could I pay to get her a doctor  And she refused any help at all. And so  when I got outside  I actually gave the translator some money and said   Please go back and see if you can do something.  And I gave the grandmother my business card. And I said   If you're serious  I will try to find a family for her.  And I immediately wrote a letter to my best friends in Atlanta  Georgia  who had an    year old son. And my best friend had mistakenly one day said something about wishing he had another child. So here my friends Gene and Gail had not heard from me in about a year  and suddenly I was calling  saying  I'm in Korea  and I've met this extraordinary girl.  And I said   The grandmother thinks she's sick  but I think maybe we would have to bring the grandmother over also.  And I said   I'll pay for the ...   I mean  I had this whole sort of picture. So anyway  I left. And my friends actually said they were very interested in adopting her. And I said   Look  I think I'll scare the grandmother to death  if I actually write to her and tell her that you're willing to adopt her  I want to go back and talk to her.  But I was off on assignment. I figured I'd come back in a couple of weeks and talk to the grandmother. And on Christmas Day  I was in Bangkok with a group of photographers and got a telegram    back in those days  you got telegrams    from Time magazine saying someone in Korea had died  and left their child in a will to me. Did I know anything about this  Because I hadn't told them what I was doing  because I was so upset with the story they'd run. So  I went back to Korea  and I went back to Hyun Sook's village  and she was gone. And the house that I had spent time in was empty. It was incredibly cold. No one in the village would tell me where Hyun Sook was  because the grandmother had always hidden her from Westerners. And they had no idea about this request that she'd made of me. So I finally found Myung Sung  her best friend that she used to play with after school every day. And Myung Sung  under some pressure from me and the translator  gave us an address on the outside of Seoul. And I went to that address and knocked on the door  and a man answered the door. It was not a very nice area of Seoul  as there were mud streets outside of it. And I knocked on the door  and Hyun Sook answered the door  and her eyes were bloodshot  and she seemed to be in shock. She didn't recognize me    there was no recognition whatsoever. And this man came to the door and kind of barked something in Korean. And I said to the translator   What did he say   And she said   He wants to know who you are.  And I said   Well  tell him that I am a photographer.  I started explaining who I was  and he interrupted. And she said   He says he knows who you are  what do you want   I said   Well  tell him that I was asked by this little girl's grandmother to find a family for her.  And he said   I'm her uncle  she's fine  you can leave now.  So I was    you know  the door was being slammed in my face  it's incredibly cold  and I'm trying to think   What would the hero do in a movie  if I was writing this as a movie script   So I said   Listen  it's really cold  I've come a very long way  do you mind if I just come in for a minute  I'm freezing.  So the guy kind of reluctantly let us in and we sat down on the floor. And as we started talking  I saw him yell something  and Hyun Sook came and brought us some food. And I had this whole mental picture of  sort of like Cinderella. I sort of had this picture of this incredibly wonderful  bright  happy little child  who now appeared to be very withdrawn  being enslaved by this family. And I was really appalled  and I couldn't figure out what to do. And the more I tried talking to him  the less friendly he was getting. So I finally decided  I said  Look      this is all through the translator  because  this is all  you know  I don't speak a word of Korean    and I said   Look  I'm really glad that Hyun Sook has a family to live with. I was very worried about her. I made a promise to her grandmother  your mother  that I would find a family  and now I'm so happy that you're going to take care of her.  I said   But you know  I bought an airline ticket  and I'm stuck here for a week.  And I said   I'm staying in a hotel downtown. Would you like to come and have lunch tomorrow  And you can practice your English.  Because he told me    I was trying to ask him questions about himself. And so I went to the hotel  and I found two older Amerasians. A girl whose mother had been a prostitute  and she was a prostitute  and a boy who'd been in and out of jail. And I said to them   Look  there's a little girl who has a tiny chance of getting out of here and going to America.  I said   I don't know if it's the right decision or not  but I would like you to come to lunch tomorrow and tell the uncle what it's like to walk down the street  what people say to you  what you do for a living. And just    I want him to understand what happens if she stays here. And I could be wrong  I don't know  but I wish you would come tomorrow.  So  these two came to lunch  and we got thrown out of the restaurant. They were yelling at him  they were    it got to be really ugly. And we went outside  and he was just furious. And I knew I had totally blown this whole thing. Here I was again  trying to figure out what to do. And he started yelling at me  and I said to the translator   OK  tell him to calm down  what is he saying   And she said   Well  he's saying  'Who the hell are you to walk into my house  some rich American with your cameras around your neck  accusing me of enslaving my niece  This is my niece  I love her  she's my sister's daughter. Who the hell are you to accuse me of something like this '  And I said  you know   Look   I said   You're absolutely right. I don't pretend to understand what's going on here.  I said   All I know is  I've been photographing a lot of these children.  I said   I'm in love with your niece  I think she's an incredibly special child.  And I said   Look  I will fly my friends over here from the United States if you want to meet them  to see if you approve of them. I just think that    what little I know about the situation  she has very little chance here of having the kind of life that you probably would like her to have.  So  everyone told me afterwards that inviting the prospective parents over was  again  the stupidest thing I could have possibly done  because who's ever good enough for your relative  But he invited me to come to a ceremony they were having that day for her grandmother. And they actually take items of clothing and photographs  and they burn them as part of the ritual. And you can see how different she looks just in three months. This was now  I think  February  early February. And the pictures before were taken in September. Well  there was an American Marine priest that I had met in the course of doing the story  who had    children living in his house. He had three women helping him take care of these kids. And so I suggested to the uncle that we go down and meet Father Keene  to find out how the adoption process worked. Because I wanted him to feel like this was all being done very much above board. So  this is on the way down to the orphanage. This is Father Keene. He's just a wonderful guy. He had kids from all over Korea living there  and he would find families for these kids. This is a social worker interviewing Hyun Sook. Now  I had always thought she was completely untouched by all of this  because the grandmother  to me  appeared to be sort of the village wise woman  and the person everybody    throughout the day  I noticed people kept coming to visit her grandmother. And I always had this mental picture that even though they may have been one of the poorer families in the village  they were one of the most respected families in the village. And I always felt that the grandmother had kind of demanded  and insisted  that the villagers treat Hyun Sook with the same respect they treated her. Hyun Sook stayed at Father Keene's  and her uncle agreed to let her stay there until the adoption went through. He actually agreed to the adoption. And I went off on assignment and came back a week later  and Father Keene said   I've got to talk to you about Hyun Sook.  I kind of said   Oh God  now what   And he takes me into this room  and he closes the door  and he says   I have    children here in the orphanage  and it's total bedlam.  And there's clothes  and there's kids  and  you know  there's three adults and    kids    you can imagine. And he said   The second day she was here she made up a list of all of the names of the older kids and the younger kids. And she assigned one of the older kids to each of the younger kids. And then she set up a work detail list of who cleaned the orphanage on what day.  And he said   She's telling me that I'm messy  and I have to clean up my room.  And he said   I don't know who raised her  but   he said   she's running the orphanage  and she's been here three days.  This was movie day    that she organized    where all the kids went to the movies. A lot of the kids who had been adopted actually wrote back to the other kids  telling them about what their life was like with their new families. So  it was a really big deal when the letters showed up. This is a woman who is now working at the orphanage  whose son had been adopted. Gene and Gail started studying Korean the moment they had gotten my first letter. They really wanted to be able to welcome Hyun Sook into their family. And one of the things Father Keene told me when I came back from one of these trips    Hyun Sook had chosen the name Natasha  which I understood was from her watching a  Rocky and Bullwinkle  cartoon on the American Air Force station. This may be one of those myth buster things that we'll have to clear up here  in a minute. So  my friend Gene flew over with his son  Tim. Gail couldn't come. And they spent a lot of time huddled over a dictionary. And this was Gene showing the uncle where Atlanta was on the map  where he lived. This is the uncle signing the adoption papers. Now  we went out to dinner that night to celebrate. The uncle went back to his family  and Natasha and Tim and Gene and I went out to dinner. And Gene was showing Natasha how to use a knife and fork  and then Natasha was returning the utensil lessons. We went back to our hotel room  and Gene was showing Natasha also where Atlanta was. This is the third night we were in Korea. The first night we'd gotten a room for the kids right next to us. Now  I'd been staying in this room for about three months    it was a little    story Korean hotel. So  the second night  we didn't keep the kids' room  because we went down and slept on the floor with all the kids at the orphanage. And the third night  we came back  we'd just gone out to dinner  where you saw the pictures  and we got to the front desk and the guy at the front desk said   There's no other free rooms on your floor tonight  so if you want to put the kids five floors below you  there's a room there.  And Gene and I looked at each other and said   No  we don't want two    year olds five floors away.  So  his son said   Dad  I have a sleeping bag  I'll sleep on the floor.  And I said   Yeah  I have one too.  So  Tim and I slept on the floor  Natasha got one bed  Gene got the other    kids pass out  it's been very exciting for three days. We're lying in bed  and Gene and I are talking about how cool we are. We said   That was so great  we saved this little girl's life.  We were just like  you know  ah  just full of ourselves. And we fall asleep    and I've been in this room  you know  for a couple of months now. And they always overheat the hotels in Korea terribly  so during the day I always left the window open. And then  at night  about midnight  they turn the heat off in the hotel. So at about   a.m.  the whole room would be like    below zero  and I'd get up. I'd been doing this every night I'd been there. So  sure enough  it's one o'clock  room's freezing  I go to close the window  and I hear people shouting outside  and I thought   Oh  the bars must have just gotten out.  And I don't speak Korean  but I'm hearing these voices  and I'm not hearing anger  I'm hearing terror. So  I open the window  and I look out  and there's flames coming up the side of our hotel  and the hotel's on fire. So  I run over to Gene  and I wake him up  and I say   Gene  don't freak out  I think the hotel's on fire.  And now there's smoke and flames coming by our windows    we're on the eleventh floor. So  the two of us were just like   Oh my God  oh my God.  So  we're trying to get Natasha up  and we can't talk to her. And you know what kids are like when they've been asleep for like an hour  it's like they took five Valiums    you know  they're all over the place. And we can't talk to her. I remember his son had the L.L. Bean bootlaces  and we're trying to do up his laces. So  we try to get to the door  and we run to the door  and we open the door and it's like walking into a blast furnace. There's people screaming  there's the sound of glass breaking  there's these weird thumps. And the whole room filled with smoke in about two seconds. And Gene turns around and says   We're not going to make it.  And he closes the door  and the whole room is now filled with smoke. We're all choking  and there's smoke pouring through the vents  under the doors. There's people screaming. I just remember this unbelievable  just utter chaos. I remember sitting near the bed  and I was just so    I had two overwhelming feelings. One was absolute terror    it's like   Oh  please God  I just want to wake up. This has got to be a nightmare  this can't be happening. Please  I just want to wake up  it's got to be a nightmare.  And the other is unbelievable guilt. Here I've been  playing God with my friends' lives  my friends' son  with Natasha's life  and this what you get when you try playing God  is you hurt people. I remember just being so frightened and terrified. And Gene  who's lying on the floor  says   Man  we've got to soak towels.  I said   What   He says   We've got to soak towels. We're going to die from the smoke.  So  we ran to the bathroom  and got towels  and put them over our faces  and the kids faces. Then he said   Do you have gaffer's tape   I said   What   He said   Do you have gaffer's tape   I said   Yeah  somewhere in my Halliburton.  He says   We've got to stop the smoke.  He said   That's all we can do  we've got to stop the smoke.  I mean  Gene    thank God for Gene. So  we put the room service menus over the vents in the wall  we put blankets at the bottom of the door  we put the kids on the windowsill to try to get some air. And there was a building  a new building  going up  that was being built right outside  across the street from our hotel. And there  in the building were photographers waiting for people to jump. Eleven people ended up dying in the fire. Five people jumped and died  other people were killed by the smoke. And there's this loud thumping on the door after about    minutes in all this  and people were shouting in Korean. And I remember  Natasha didn't want us opening the door    sorry  I was trying not to open the door  because we'd spent so much time barricading the room. I didn't know who it was  I didn't know what they wanted  and Natasha could tell they were firemen trying to get us out. I remember a sort of a tussle at the door  trying to get the door open. In any case     hours later  I mean  they put us in the lobby. Gene ended up using his coat  and his fist in the coat  to break open a liquor cabinet. People were lying on the floor. It was one of just the most horrifying nights. And then    hours later  we rented a car  as we had planned to  and drove back to Natasha's village. And we kept saying   Do you realize we were dying in a hotel fire  like eight hours ago   It's so weird how life just goes on. Natasha wanted to introduce her brother and father to all the villagers  and the day we showed up turned out to be a    year old man's birthday. This guy's    years old. So it turned into a dual celebration  because Natasha was the first person from this village ever to go to the United States. So  these are the greenhouse tents. This is the elders teaching Gene their dances. We drank a lot of rice wine. We were both so drunk  I couldn't believe it. This is the last picture before Gene and Tim headed back. The adoption people told us it was going to take a year for the adoption to go through. Like  what could you do for a year  So I found out the name of every official on both the Korean and American side  and I photographed them  and told them how famous they were going to be when this book was done. And four months later  the adoption papers came through. This is saying goodbye to everybody at the orphanage. This is Father Keene with Natasha at the bus stop. Her great aunt at the airport. I had a wonderful deal with Cathay Pacific airlines for many years  where they gave me free passes on all their airlines in return for photography. It was like the ultimate perk. And the pilot  I actually knew    because they used to let me sit in the jump seat  to tell you how long ago this was. This is a Tri Star  and so they let Natasha actually sit in the jump seat. And the pilot  Jeff Cowley  actually went back and adopted one of the other kids at the orphanage after meeting Natasha. This is    hours later in Atlanta. It's a very long flight. Just to make things even crazier  Gail  Natasha's new mom  was three days away from giving birth to her own daughter. So you know  if you were writing this  you'd say   No  we've got to write the script differently.  This is the first night showing Natasha her new cousins and uncles and aunts. Gene and Gail know everyone in Atlanta    they're the most social couple imaginable. So  at this point  Natasha doesn't speak a word of English  other than what little Father Keene taught her. This is Kylie  her sister  who's now a doctor  on the right. This is a deal I had with Natasha  which is that when we got to Atlanta she could take    she could cut off my beard. She never liked it very much. She learned English in three months. She entered seventh grade at her own age level. Pledge of Allegiance for the first time. This is her cooking teacher. Natasha told me that a lot of the kids thought she was stuck up  because they would talk to her and she wouldn't answer  and they didn't realize she didn't actually speak English very well  in the beginning. But what I noticed  again as an observer  was she was choosing who was going to be on her team  and seemed to be very popular very  very quickly. Now  remember the picture  how much she looked like her grandmother  at the beginning  People were always telling Natasha how much she looks like her mother  Gail. This is a tense moment in the first football game  I think. And Kylie    I mean  it was almost like Kylie was her own child. She's being baptized. Now  a lot of parents  when they adopt  actually want to erase their children's history. And Gail and Gene did the complete opposite. They were studying Korean  they bought Korean clothes. Gene even did a little tile work in the kitchen  which was that   Once upon a time  there was a beautiful girl that came from hills of Korea to live happily ever after in Atlanta.  She hates this picture    it was her first job. She bought a bright red Karmann Ghia with the money she made working at Burger King. The captain of the cheerleaders. Beauty pageant. Used to do their Christmas card every year. Gene's been restoring this car for a million years. Kodak hired Natasha to be a translator for them at the Olympics in Korea. Her future husband  Jeff  was working for Canon cameras  and met Natasha at the Olympic Village. This is her first trip back to Korea  so there's her uncle. This is her half sister. She went back to the village. That's her best friend's mother. And I always thought that was a very Annie Hall kind of outfit. It's just  you know  it was just so interesting  just to watch    this is her mother in the background there. This is Natasha's wedding day. Gene is looking a little older. This is Sydney  who's going to be three years old in a couple of days. And there's Evan. Natasha  would you just come up  for a second  just maybe to say hello to everybody  Natasha's actually never heard me tell the story. I mean  she    you know  we've looked at the pictures together. Natasha  I've seen pictures millions of times  but today was the first time I'm actually seeing him give the whole presentation. I started crying. Rick Smolan  I'm sure there's about    things she's going to tell me   That wasn't what happened  that wasn't what you said.  Natasha  Later  I'll do that later. RS  Anyway  thank you  Mike and Richard  so much for letting us tell the story. Thank you all of you.   Picture yourself in a world where there's no one else      nobody anywhere.     A moment ago  there were voices and faces to look upon      you can't see them anywhere.     Nothing more to say     and no one left to say it to  anyway.     Oh  listen to what I say.     Everybody can be somebody     and everybody is free to make a difference.     Everybody can be somebody.     Everybody is free to make a difference in this world.     Now picture a world where the people all feel their worth.     Children are everywhere.     Now there is a reason for everyone's time on Earth.     Wondering why you should care  yeah.     Nothing more to say     and only love can see us through  anyway.     Oh  listen what I say  yeah.     Everybody can be somebody     and everybody is free to make a difference.     Everybody can be somebody.     Everybody is free to make a difference.     You don't have to be a big celebrity     to feel the power  the power in your soul  no.     You don't have to be a big star on MTV     to realize that in your eyes is a view that only you can see.     Everybody can be somebody.     Everybody is free to make a difference in this world.     You can make a little difference in this world.     I can make a little difference in this world.     She can make a little difference in this world.     He can make a little difference in this world.     You can  I can  she can  he can      we can make a little bit of difference in this world.     Everybody gonna make a little     little difference  yeah.     Talking 'bout everybody gonna make a little difference.     Everybody gonna make a little difference in this world      oh yeah.   Thank you so much. This is a song that came about because I think it's difficult to be in the world and not be aware of what's going on  and the wars and so forth. This song kind of came out of all of that. And I wrote a lot of happy songs on my first record  which I still stand by  but this has got something else in it. It's called  Peace on Earth.    There is no hope.     There is no future.     No faith in God to save the day.     There is no reason  no understanding     no sacred place to hide away.     There is no earnest conversation.     No words of wisdom from the wise.     There is no reconciliation     and no collective compromise.     Peace on Earth      that's what we want.     Peace on Earth      that's what we all say.     Peace on Earth.     Yet  there in the hallway     lurks the ghost of war.     He wants more  and more  and more  and more      and more  and more  and more  and more.     There is no darkness  no sunshine.     There is no great society.     There is no freedom without conviction.     There is no freedom to be free.     There is no heaven  no fire and brimstone.     There is no brotherhood of man.     There is no country  no one religion.     There is no universal plan.     Peace on Earth      that's what we want.     Peace on Earth      that's what we all say.     Peace on Earth.     Yet  there in the hallway     lurks the ghost of war.     He wants more  and more  and more  and more      and more  and more  and more  and more  and more.     The answer is     mutual assured destruction      a balance of power      a weapon for everyone.     Mutual assured destruction     bringing peace to everyone.     Peace on Earth      that's what we want.     Peace on Earth      that's what we all say.     Peace on Earth.     There in the hallway      peace on Earth.     Peace on Earth.     Peace on Earth.   I don't speak English. I start speaking English  learning English  about a year ago. I speak French and I grew up with French  so my English is Franglais. I'm born in the Western Congo  in an area around here  and then went to university in Kisangani. And after I finished  I went to this area  the Ituri Forest. But what I've been doing    when I was about     I grew in my uncle's house. And my father was a soldier  and my uncle was a fisherman and also a poacher. What I've been doing from    to    was  I was assisting them collecting ivory tusk  meat and whatever they were killing  poaching  hunting in the forest  bring it in the main city to get access to the market. But finally  I got myself involved. Around    to    years  I became  myself  a poacher. And I wanted to do it  because    I believed    to continue my studies. I wanted to go to university  but my father was poor  my uncle even. So  I did it. And for three to four years  I went to university. For three times  I applied to biomedical science  to be a doctor. I didn't succeed. I was having my inscriptions  my admission to biology. And I said   No way  I'm not doing it. My family's poor  my area don't have better health care. I want to be a doctor to serve them.  Three times  that means three years  and I start getting old. I say   Oh  no  I continue.  So  I did tropical ecology and plant botany. When I finished  I went to the Ituri Forest for my internship. It's where I really getting passion with what I'm doing right up to now    I'm standing in front of you    doing botany and wildlife conservation. That time the Ituri Forest was created as a forest reserve with some animals and also plants. And the training center there was built around the scientific Congolese staff and some American scientists also. So  the Okapi Faunal Reserve protects number    I think that is the largest number of elephants we have right now in protected areas in Congo. It has also chimpanzees. And it has been named Okapi Faunal Reserve because of this beautiful creature. That is a forest giraffe. I think you guys know it quite well. Here we have savanna giraffes  but through evolution we have this forest giraffe that lives only in Congo. It has also some beautiful primates. Thirteen species    highest diversity we can find in one single area in Africa. And it has the Ituri Forest itself    about       species of plants  so far known. I joined the Wildlife Conservation Society  working there  in       but I started working with them as a student in     . I was appointed as a teaching assistant at my university because I accomplished with honor. But I didn't like the way    the instruction I got was very poor. And I wanted to be formed to a training center and a research center. With the end of the dictatorship regime of Mobutu Sese Seko  that most of you know  life became very  very difficult. And the work we have been doing was completely difficult to do and to achieve it. When Kabila started his movement to liberate Congo  so Mobutu soldiers started moving and retreated. So they started fleeing from the east to the west. And the Okapi Faunal Reserve is there  so there was a road from Goma  somewhere here  and coming like this. So they might go through  pass through the Okapi Faunal Reserve. Congo has five of the world's richest sites of protected area  and the Okapi Faunal Reserve is one of them. So soldier was fleeing in the Okapi Faunal Reserve. On their way  they looted everything. Torture  wars    oh  my God  you can't believe. Every person was looking his way    where to go  we don't know. And it was for us  the young  the first time really we hear the language of war  of guns. And even people who faced the rebellion of       after our independence  they didn't believe what was happening. They were killing people. They were doing whatever they want because they have power. Who have been doing that  Young children. Child soldiers. You can't ask him how old he is because he has guns. But I was from the west  working in the east. I even  at  that time was not speaking Swahili. And when they came  they looted everything. You can't speak Lingala because Lingala was from Mobutu  and everyone speaking Lingala is soldier. And I was from the same area to him. All my friends said  we are leaving because we are a target. But I'm not going to the east  because I don't know Swahili. I stay. If I go  I will be killed. I can't go back to my area    it's more than       kilometers  away . I stayed after they looted everything. We have been doing research on botany  and we have a small herbarium of       sheets of plants. We cut  we dry and we packed them  we mounted them on a folder. Purpose  so that we start them for agriculture  for medicine  for whatever  and for science  for the study of the flora and the change of the forest. That is people moving around  that's even Pygmies. And this is a bright guy  hard working person  and Pygmy. I've been working with him about    years. And with soldiers  they went to the forest for poaching elephants. Because he's Pygmy  he knows how to track elephants in the forest. He has been attacked by a leopard and they abandon him in the forest. They came to told me  I have to save him. And what I did  I gave him just antibiotics that we care for tuberculosis. And fortunately  I saved his life. And that was the language of the war. Everywhere there has been constant extraction of mineral  killing animals  the logging timbers and so on. And what of important things    I think all of you here have a cell phone. That mineral has killed a lot  five millions of Congolese have gone because of this Colombo Tantalite    they call it Coltan    that they use it to make cell phones and it has been in that area  all over in Congo. Extraction  and good  big business of the war. And what I did for the first war  after we have lost everything  I have to save something  even myself  my life and life of the staff. I buried some of our new vehicle engines  I buried it to save it. And some of equipment went with them  on the top of the canopy  to save it. He's not collecting plants  he's going to save our equipment on the canopy. And with the material that's left    because they wanted to destroy it  to burn it  they didn't understand it  they didn't go to school    I packed it. And that is me  going to  hurrying to Uganda  to try to save that       material  with people carrying them on the bikes  bicycles. And after that  we succeeded. I housed that       material at the herbarium of Makerere University. And after the war  I have been able to bring it back home  so that we continue our studies. The second war came while we didn't expect it. With friends  we had been sitting and watching match football  and having some good music with WorldSpace radio  when it started  I think. So  it was so bad. We heard that now from the east again the war started  and it's going fast. This time I think Kabila will go in place of  as he did with Mobutu. And the reserve was a target to the rebels. Three different movements and two militia acting in the same area and competing for natural resources. And there was no way to work. They destroy everything. Poaching    oh  no way. And that's the powerful men. We have to meet and to talk to them. What's the regulation of the reserve and what is the regulation of the parks  And they can't do what they are doing. So we went to meet them. That is Coltan extraction  gold mining. So  we started talking with them  convincing them that we are in a protected area. There are regulations that it's prohibited to do logging  mining and poaching  specifically. But they said   You guys  you think that soldiers who are dying are not important  and your animals you are protecting are most important. We don't think so. We have to do it  because to let our movement advance.  I say   No way  you are not going to do it here.  We started talking with them and I was negotiating. Tried to protect our equipment  tried to protect our staff and the villages of about       people. And we continued. But I was doing that  negotiating with them. Sometimes we are having meeting and they are talking with Jean Pierre Bemba  with Mbusa Nyamwisi  with Kabila  and I'm there. Sometimes  they talk to my own language  that is  Lingala. I hear it and what strategy they are doing  what they are planning. Sometimes  they are having a helicopter to supply them with ammunition and so on. They used me to carry that  and I was doing counting  what comes from where  and where  and where. I had only this equipment    my satellite phone  my computer and a plastic solar panel    that I hide it in the forest. And every time  daily  after we have meeting  what compromise we have  whatever  I go  I write a short email  send it. I don't know how many people I had on my address. I sent the message  what is going about the progress of the war and what they are planning to do. They started suspecting that what we do on the morning  and the afternoon  it's on the news  BBC  RFI. Something might be going on. And one day  we went for a meeting. Sorry. One day  we went to meet the Chief Commander. He had the same iridium cell phone like me. And he asked me   Do you know how to use this   I said   I have never seen it. I don't know.  And I had mine on my pocket. So  it was a chance that they trusted me a lot. They didn't    they was not looking on me. So I was scared. And when we finished the meeting  I went to return it in the forest. And I was sending news  doing whatever  reporting daily to the U.N.  to UNESCO  to our institution in New York  what have been going. And for that  they have been having big pressure to leave  to free the area. Because there was no way    whatever they do  it's known the same time. During the first two rebellions  they killed all animals in the zoo. We have a zoo of    Okapis  and one of them was pregnant. And during the war  after a week of heavy war  fighting in the area  we succeeded  we had the first Okapi. This is the only trouser and shirt remind me of this. This is not local population  this is rebels. They are now happy sending the news that they have protected the Okapi with the war  because we sent the news that they are killing and poaching everywhere. After a week  we celebrated the birthday of that Okapi  they killed an elephant  just    meters to the area where the zoo  where Okapi was born. And I was mad. I oppose it    that they are now going to dissect it  until I do my report and then I see the Chief Commander. And I succeeded. The elephant just decayed and they just got the tusks. What we are doing after that    that was the situation of the war    we have to rebuild. I had some money. I was paid     dollars. I devoted half of it to rebuild the herbarium  because we didn't have good infrastructure to start plants. Wildlife Conservation Society more dealing with plants. I started this with    dollars  and start fundraising money to where I've been going. I had opportunity to go all over  where herbarium for my African material is. And they supported me a bit  and I built this. Now  it's doing work to train young Congolese. And also  what one of the speciality we are doing  my design is tracking the global warming effect on biodiversity  and what the impacts of the Ituri Forest is playing to uptake carbon. This is one of the studies we are doing on a    hectare plot  where we have tagged trees and lianas from one centimeters  and we are tracking them. We have now data of about    years  to see how that forest is contributing to the carbon reductions. And that is    I think it's difficult for me. This is a very embarrassing talk  I know. I don't know where to start  where to finish it. When I was thinking to come here  what best title I wanted to say to my talk  I didn't find this. But now I think that I would have titled it   The Language of Guns.  Where are you people  Now we are talking about reconstitution  rebuild Africa. But is gun industries a tool to rebuild  or is it a game  I think we see the war like a game    like soccer  football. Everybody is happy  but see what it's doing  see what is going in Darfur. Now we say  oh  my God. See what the wars in Rwanda. That's because of the language of guns. I don't think that someone may blame Google  because it's doing the right things  even if people like Al Qaeda are using Google to connect between them. But it's serving millions for the best. But what is doing with gun industries  Thank you. Chris Anderson  Thank you  thank you. Just wait over there. It's an amazing story. I suspect a lot of people here have the same question I have. How can we help you  Corneille Ewango  That's really embarrassing questions. I think that now I feel nervous. And I think  helping us  people are acting sometimes by ignorance. I did it myself. If I know when I was young  that  by  killing an elephant  I'm destroying biodiversity  I would not have done it. Many  many of you have seen the talents of Africans  but there are few who are going to school. Many are dying because of all those kind of pandemics  HIV  malaria  poverty  not going to school. What you can assist us  it's by building capacities. How many have got opportunity like me to go to U.S.  do a master's  And go    now  I'm in the Netherlands to do a Ph.D. But many of them are just here  because they don't have money. And they can't go even to university. They can't even attain the bachelor's degree. Building capacities for the young generation is going to make a better generation and a better future tomorrow for Africa. CA  Thank you  thank you. I'm going to talk about a technology that we're developing at Oxford now  that we think is going to change the way that computer games and Hollywood movies are being made. That technology is simulating humans. It's simulated humans with a simulated body and a simulated nervous system to control that body. Now  before I talk more about that technology  let's have a quick look at what human characters look like at the moment in computer games. This is a clip from a game called  Grand Theft Auto  .  We already saw that briefly yesterday. And what you can see is    it is actually a very good game. It's one of the most successful games of all time. But what you'll see is that all the animations in this game are very repetitive. They pretty much look the same. I've made him run into a wall here  over and over again. And you can see he looks always the same. The reason for that is that these characters are actually not real characters. They are a graphical visualization of a character. To produce these animations  an animator at a studio has to anticipate what's going to happen in the actual game  and then has to animate that particular sequence. So  he or she sits down  animates it  and tries to anticipate what's going to happen  and then these particular animations are just played back at appropriate times in the computer game. Now  the result of that is that you can't have real interactivity. All you have is animations that are played back at more or less the appropriate times. It also means that games aren't really going to be as surprising as they could be  because you only get out of it  at least in terms of the character  what you actually put into it. There's no real emergence there. And thirdly  as I said  most of the animations are very repetitive because of that. Now  the only way to get around that is to actually simulate the human body and to simulate that bit of the nervous system of the brain that controls that body. And maybe  if I could have you for a quick demonstration to show what the difference is    because  I mean  it's very  very trivial. If I push Chris a bit  like this  for example  he'll react to it. If I push him from a different angle  he'll react to it differently  and that's because he has a physical body  and because he has the motor skills to control that body. It's a very trivial thing. It's not something you get in computer games at the moment  at all. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  That's it  Torsten Reil  That's it  yes. So  that's what we're trying to simulate    not Chris specifically  I should say  but humans in general. Now  we started working on this a while ago at Oxford University  and we tried to start very simply. What we tried to do was teach a stick figure how to walk. That stick figure is physically stimulated. You can see it here on the screen. So  it's subject to gravity  has joints  etc. If you just run the simulation  it will just collapse  like this. The tricky bit is now to put an AI controller in it that actually makes it work. And for that  we use the neural network  which we based on that part of the nervous system that we have in our spine that controls walking in humans. It's called the central pattern generator. So  we simulated that as well  and then the really tricky bit is to teach that network how to walk. For that we used artificial evolution    genetic algorithms. We heard about those already yesterday  and I suppose that most of you are familiar with that already. But  just briefly  the concept is that you create a large number of different individuals    neural networks  in this case    all of which are random at the beginning. You hook these up    in this case  to the virtual muscles of that two legged creature here    and hope that it does something interesting. At the beginning  they're all going to be very boring. Most of them won't move at all  but some of them might make a tiny step. Those are then selected by the algorithm  reproduced with mutation and recombinations to introduce sex as well. And you repeat that process over and over again  until you have something that walks    in this case  in a straight line  like this. So that was the idea behind this. When we started this  I set up the simulation one evening. It took about three to four hours to run the simulation. I got up the next morning  went to the computer and looked at the results  and was hoping for something that walked in a straight line  like I've just demonstrated  and this is what I got instead. So  it was back to the drawing board for us. We did get it to work eventually  after tweaking a bit here and there. And this is an example of a successful evolutionary run. So  what you'll see in a moment is a very simple biped that's learning how to walk using artificial evolution. At the beginning  it can't walk at all  but it will get better and better over time. So  this is the one that can't walk at all. Now  after five generations of applying evolutionary process  the genetic algorithm is getting a tiny bit better. Generation    and it'll take a few steps more    still not quite there. But now  after generation     it actually walks in a straight line without falling over. That was the real breakthrough for us. It was  academically  quite a challenging project  and once we had reached that stage  we were quite confident that we could try and do other things as well with this approach    actually simulating the body and simulating that part of the nervous system that controls it. Now  at this stage  it also became clear that this could be very exciting for things like computer games or online worlds. What you see here is the character standing there  and there's an obstacle that we put in its way. And what you see is  it's going to fall over the obstacle. Now  the interesting bit is  if I move the obstacle a tiny bit to the right  which is what I'm doing now  here  it will fall over it in a completely different way. And again  if you move the obstacle a tiny bit  it'll again fall differently. Now  what you see  by the way  at the top there  are some of the neural activations being fed into the virtual muscles. Okay. That's the video. Thanks. Now  this might look kind of trivial  but it's actually very important because this is not something you get at the moment in any interactive or any virtual worlds. Now  at this stage  we decided to start a company and move this further  because obviously this was just a very simple  blocky biped. What we really wanted was a full human body. So we started the company. We hired a team of physicists  software engineers and biologists to work on this  and the first thing we had to work on was to create the human body  basically. It's got to be relatively fast  so you can run it on a normal machine  but it's got to be accurate enough  so it looks good enough  basically. So we put quite a bit of biomechanical knowledge into this thing  and tried to make it as realistic as possible. What you see here on the screen right now is a very simple visualization of that body. I should add that it's very simple to add things like hair  clothes  etc.  but what we've done here is use a very simple visualization  so you can concentrate on the movement. Now  what I'm going to do right now  in a moment  is just push this character a tiny bit and we'll see what happens. Nothing really interesting  basically. It falls over  but it falls over like a rag doll  basically. The reason for that is that there's no intelligence in it. It becomes interesting when you put artificial intelligence into it. So  this character now has motor skills in the upper body    nothing in the legs yet  in this particular one. But what it will do    I'm going to push it again. It will realize autonomously that it's being pushed. It's going to stick out its hands. It's going to turn around into the fall  and try and catch the fall. So that's what you see here. Now  it gets really interesting if you then add the AI for the lower part of the body as well. So here  we've got the same character. I'm going to push it a bit harder now  harder than I just pushed Chris. But what you'll see is    it's going to receive a push now from the left. What you see is it takes steps backwards  it tries to counter balance  it tries to look at the place where it thinks it's going to land. I'll show you this again. And then  finally hits the floor. Now  this becomes really exciting when you push that character in different directions  again  just as I've done. That's something that you cannot do right now. At the moment  you only have empty computer graphics in games. What this is now is a real simulation. That's what I want to show you now. So  here's the same character with the same behavior I've just shown you  but now I'm just going to push it from different directions. First  starting with a push from the right. This is all slow motion  by the way  so we can see what's going on. Now  the angle will have changed a tiny bit  so you can see that the reaction is different. Again  a push  now this time from the front. And you see it falls differently. And now from the left    and it falls differently. That was really exciting for us to see that. That was the first time we've seen that. This is the first time the public sees this as well  because we have been in stealth mode. I haven't shown this to anybody yet. Now  just a fun thing  what happens if you put that character    this is now a wooden version of it  but it's got the same AI in it    but if you put that character on a slippery surface  like ice. We just did that for a laugh  just to see what happens. And this is what happens. It's nothing we had to do about this. We just took this character that I just talked about  put it on a slippery surface  and this is what you get out of it. And that's a really fascinating thing about this approach. Now  when we went to film studios and games developers and showed them that technology  we got a very good response. And what they said was  the first thing they need immediately is virtual stuntmen. Because stunts are obviously very dangerous  they're very expensive  and there are a lot of stunt scenes that you cannot do  obviously  because you can't really allow the stuntman to be seriously hurt. So  they wanted to have a digital version of a stuntman and that's what we've been working on for the past few months. And that's our first product that we're going to release in a couple of weeks. So  here are just a few very simple scenes of the guy just being kicked. That's what people want. That's what we're giving them. You can see  it's always reacting. This is not a dead body. This is a body who basically  in this particular case  feels the force and tries to protect its head. Only  I think it's quite a big blow again. You feel kind of sorry for that thing  and we've seen it so many times now that we don't really care any more. There are much worse videos than this  by the way  which I have taken out  but ... Now  here's another one. What people wanted as a behavior was to have an explosion  a strong force applied to the character  and have the character react to it in midair. So that you don't have a character that looks limp  but actually a character that you can use in an action film straight away  that looks kind of alive in midair as well. So this character is going to be hit by a force  it's going to realize it's in the air  and it's going to try and  well  stick out its arm in the direction where it's landing. That's one angle  here's another angle. We now think that the realism we're achieving with this is good enough to be used in films. And let's just have a look at a slightly different visualization. This is something I just got last night from an animation studio in London  who are using our software and experimenting with it right now. So this is exactly the same behavior that you saw  but in a slightly better rendered version. So if you look at the character carefully  you see there are lots of body movements going on  none of which you have to animate like in the old days. Animators had to actually animate them. This is all happening automatically in the simulation. This is a slightly different angle  and again a slow motion version of this. This is incredibly quick. This is happening in real time. You can run this simulation in real time  in front of your eyes  change it  if you want to  and you get the animation straight out of it. At the moment  doing something like this by hand would take you probably a couple of days. This is another behavior they requested. I'm not quite sure why  but we've done it anyway. It's a very simple behavior that shows you the power of this approach. In this case  the character's hands are fixed to a particular point in space  and all we've told the character to do is to struggle. And it looks organic. It looks realistic. You feel kind of sorry for the guy. It's even worse    and that is another video I just got last night    if you render that a bit more realistically. Now  I'm showing this to you just to show you how organic it actually can feel  how realistic it can look. And this is all a physical simulation of the body  using AI to drive virtual muscles in that body. Now  one thing which we did for a laugh was to create a slightly more complex stunt scene  and one of the most famous stunts is the one where James Bond jumps off a dam in Switzerland and then is caught by a bungee. Got a very short clip here. Yes  you can just about see it here. In this case  they were using a real stunt man. It was a very dangerous stunt. It was just voted  I think in the Sunday Times  as one of the most impressive stunts. Now  we've just tried and    looked at our character and asked ourselves   Can we do that ourselves as well   Can we use the physical simulation of the character  use artificial intelligence  put that artificial intelligence into the character  drive virtual muscles  simulate the way he jumps off the dam  and then skydive afterwards  and have him caught by a bungee afterwards  We did that. It took about altogether just two hours  pretty much  to create the simulation. And that's what it looks like  here. Now  this could do with a bit more work. It's still very early stages  and we pretty much just did this for a laugh  just to see what we'd get out of it. But what we found over the past few months is that this approach    that we're pretty much standard upon    is incredibly powerful. We are ourselves surprised what you actually get out of the simulations. There's very often very surprising behavior that you didn't predict before. There's so many things we can do with this right now. The first thing  as I said  is going to be virtual stuntmen. Several studios are using this software now to produce virtual stuntmen  and they're going to hit the screen quite soon  actually  for some major productions. The second thing is video games. With this technology  video games will look different and they will feel very different. For the first time  you'll have actors that really feel very interactive  that have real bodies that really react. I think that's going to be incredibly exciting. Probably starting with sports games  which are going to become much more interactive. But I particularly am really excited about using this technology in online worlds  like there  for example  that Tom Melcher has shown us. The degree of interactivity you're going to get is totally different  I think  from what you're getting right now. A third thing we are looking at and very interested in is simulation. We've been approached by several simulation companies  but one project we're particularly excited about  which we're starting next month  is to use our technology    and in particular  the walking technology    to help aid surgeons who work on children with cerebral palsy  to predict the outcome of operations on these children. As you probably know  it's very difficult to predict what the outcome of an operation is if you try and correct the gait. The classic quote is  I think  it's unpredictable at best  is what people think right now  is the outcome. Now  what we want to do with our software is allow our surgeons to have a tool. We're going to simulate the gait of a particular child and the surgeon can then work on that simulation and try out different ways to improve that gait  before he actually commits to an actual surgery. That's one project we're particularly excited about  and that's going to start next month. Just finally  this is only just the beginning. We can only do several behaviors right now. The AI isn't good enough to simulate a full human body. The body yes  but not all the motor skills that we have. And  I think  we're only there if we can have something like ballet dancing. Right now  we don't have that but I'm very sure that we will be able to do that at some stage. We do have one unintentional dancer actually  the last thing I'm going to show you. This was an AI contour that was produced and evolved    half evolved  I should say    to produce balance  basically. So  you kick the guy and the guy's supposed to counter balance. That's what we thought was going to come out of this. But this is what emerged out of it  in the end. Bizarrely  this thing doesn't have a head. I'm not quite sure why. So  this was not something we actually put in there. He just started to create that dance himself. He's actually a better dancer than I am  I have to say. And what you see after a while    I think he even goes into a climax right at the end. And I think    there you go. So  that all happened automatically. We didn't put that in there. That's just the simulation creating this itself  basically. So it's just    Thanks. Not quite John Travolta yet  but we're working on that as well  so thanks very much for your time. Thanks. CA  Incredible. That was really incredible. TR  Thanks. I had a fire nine days ago. My archive      films  my    millimeter negative  all my books  my dad's books  my photographs. I'd collected    I was a collector  major  big time. It's gone. I just looked at it  and I didn't know what to do. I mean  this was    was I my things  I always live in the present    I love the present. I cherish the future. And I was taught some strange thing as a kid  like  you've got to make something good out of something bad. You've got to make something good out of something bad. This was bad  Man  I was    I cough. I was sick. That's my camera lens. The first one    the one I shot my Bob Dylan film with    years ago. That's my feature film.  King  Murray  won Cannes Film Festival         the only print I had. That's my papers. That was in minutes       minutes. Epiphany hit me. Something hit me.  You've got to make something good out of something bad   I started to say to my friends  neighbors  my sister. By the way  that's  Sputnik.  I ran it last year.  Sputnik  was downtown  the negative. It wasn't touched. These are some pieces of things I used in my Sputnik feature film  which opens in New York in two weeks downtown. I called my sister. I called my neighbors. I said   Come dig.  That's me at my desk. That was a desk took    some years to build. You know    all the stuff. That's my daughter  Jean. She came. She's a nurse in San Francisco.  Dig it up   I said.  Pieces. I want pieces. Bits and pieces.  I came up with this idea  a life of bits and pieces  which I'm just starting to work on    my next project. That's my sister. She took care of pictures  because I was a big collector of snapshot photography that I believed said a lot. And those are some of the pictures that    something was good about the burnt pictures. I didn't know. I looked at that    I said   Wow  is that better than the     That's my proposal on Jimmy Doolittle. I made that movie for television. It's the only copy I had. Pieces of it. Idea about women. So I started to say   Hey  man  you are too much  You could cry about this.  I really didn't. I just instead said   I'm going to make something out of it  and maybe next year ...   And I appreciate this moment to come up on this stage with so many people who've already given me so much solace  and just say to TEDsters  I'm proud of me. That I take something bad  I turn it  and I'm going to make something good out of this  all these pieces. That's Arthur Leipzig's original photograph I loved. I was a big record collector    the records didn't make it. Boy  I tell you  film burns. Film burns. I mean  this was    millimeter safety film. The negatives are gone. That's my father's letter to me  telling me to marry the woman I first married when I was   . That's my daughter and me. She's still there. She's there this morning  actually. That's my house. My family's living in the Hilton Hotel in Scotts Valley. That's my wife  Heidi  who didn't take it as well as I did. My children  Davey and Henry. My son  Davey  in the hotel two nights ago. So  my message to you folks  from my three minutes  is that I appreciate the chance to share this with you. I will be back. I love being at TED. I came to live it  and I am living it. That's my view from my window outside of Santa Cruz  in Bonny Doon  just    miles from here. Thank you everybody. How do groups get anything done  Right  How do you organize a group of individuals so that the output of the group is something coherent and of lasting value  instead of just being chaos  And the economic framing of that problem is called coordination costs. And a coordination cost is essentially all of the financial or institutional difficulties in arranging group output. And we've had a classic answer for coordination costs  which is  if you want to coordinate the work of a group of people  you start an institution  right  You raise some resources. You found something. It can be private or public. It can be for profit or not profit. It can be large or small. But you get these resources together. You found an institution  and you use the institution to coordinate the activities of the group. More recently  because the cost of letting groups communicate with each other has fallen through the floor    and communication costs are one of the big inputs to coordination    there has been a second answer  which is to put the cooperation into the infrastructure  to design systems that coordinate the output of the group as a by product of the operating of the system  without regard to institutional models. So  that's what I want to talk about today. I'm going to illustrate it with some fairly concrete examples  but always pointing to the broader themes. So  I'm going to start by trying to answer a question that I know each of you will have asked yourself at some point or other  and which the Internet is purpose built to answer  which is  where can I get a picture of a roller skating mermaid  So  in New York City  on the first Saturday of every summer  Coney Island  our local  charmingly run down amusement park  hosts the Mermaid Parade. It's an amateur parade  people come from all over the city  people get all dressed up. Some people get less dressed up. Young and old  dancing in the streets. Colorful characters  and a good time is had by all. And what I want to call your attention to is not the Mermaid Parade itself  charming though it is  but rather to these photos. I didn't take them. How did I get them  And the answer is  I got them from Flickr. Flickr is a photo sharing service that allows people to take photos  upload them  share them over the Web and so forth. Recently  Flickr has added an additional function called tagging. Tagging was pioneered by Delicious and Joshua Schachter. Delicious is a social bookmarking service. Tagging is a cooperative infrastructure answer to classification. Right  If I had given this talk last year  I couldn't do what I just did  because I couldn't have found those photos. But instead of saying  we need to hire a professional class of librarians to organize these photos once they're uploaded  Flickr simply turned over to the users the ability to characterize the photos. So  I was able to go in and draw down photos that had been tagged  Mermaid Parade.  There were       photos taken by     photographers  all aggregated and then put under this nice  neat name  shown in reverse chronological order. And I was then able to go and retrieve them to give you that little slideshow. Now  what hard problem is being solved here  And it's    in the most schematic possible view  it's a coordination problem  right  There are a large number of people on the Internet  a very small fraction of them have photos of the Mermaid Parade. How do we get those people together to contribute that work  The classic answer is to form an institution  right  To draw those people into some prearranged structure that has explicit goals. And I want to call your attention to some of the side effects of going the institutional route. First of all  when you form an institution  you take on a management problem  right  No good just hiring employees  you also have to hire other employees to manage those employees and to enforce the goals of the institution and so forth. Secondly  you have to bring structure into place. Right  You have to have economic structure. You have to have legal structure. You have to have physical structure. And that creates additional costs. Third  forming an institution is inherently exclusionary. You notice we haven't got everybody who has a photo. You can't hire everyone in a company  right  You can't recruit everyone into a governmental organization. You have to exclude some people. And fourth  as a result of that exclusion  you end up with a professional class. Look at the change here. We've gone from people with photos to photographers. Right  We've created a professional class of photographers whose goal is to go out and photograph the Mermaid Parade  or whatever else they're sent out to photograph. When you build cooperation into the infrastructure  which is the Flickr answer  you can leave the people where they are and you take the problem to the individuals  rather than moving the individuals to the problem. You arrange the coordination in the group  and by doing that you get the same outcome  without the institutional difficulties. You lose the institutional imperative. You lose the right to shape people's work when it's volunteer effort  but you also shed the institutional cost  which gives you greater flexibility. What Flickr does is it replaces planning with coordination. And this is a general aspect of these cooperative systems. Right. You'll have experienced this in your life whenever you bought your first mobile phone  and you stopped making plans. You just said   I'll call you when I get there.   Call me when you get off work.  Right  That is a point to point replacement of coordination with planning. Right. We're now able to do that kind of thing with groups. To say instead of  we must make an advance plan  we must have a five year projection of where the Wikipedia is going to be  or whatever  you can just say  let's coordinate the group effort  and let's deal with it as we go  because we're now well enough coordinated that we don't have to take on the problems of deciding in advance what to do. So here's another example. This one's somewhat more somber. These are photos on Flickr tagged  Iraq.  And everything that was hard about the coordination cost with the Mermaid Parade is even harder here. There are more pictures. There are more photographers. It's taken over a wider geographic area. The photos are spread out over a longer period of time. And worst of all  that figure at the bottom  approximately ten photos per photographer  is a lie. It's mathematically true  but it doesn't really talk about anything important    because in these systems  the average isn't really what matters. What matters is this. This is a graph of photographs tagged Iraq as taken by the     photographers who contributed the       photos. And it's ranked in order of number of photos taken per photographer. You can see here  over at the end  our most prolific photographer has taken around     photos  and you can see there's a few people who have taken hundreds of photos. Then there's dozens of people who've taken dozens of photos. And by the time we get around here  we get ten or fewer photos  and then there's this long  flat tail. And by the time you get to the middle  you've got hundreds of people who have contributed only one photo each. This is called a power law distribution. It appears often in unconstrained social systems where people are allowed to contribute as much or as little as they like    this is often what you get. Right  The math behind the power law distribution is that whatever's in the nth position is doing about one nth of whatever's being measured  relative to the person in the first position. So  we'd expect the tenth most prolific photographer to have contributed about a tenth of the photos  and the hundredth most prolific photographer to have contributed only about a hundred as many photos as the most prolific photographer did. So  the head of the curve can be sharper or flatter. But that basic math accounts both for the steep slope and for the long  flat tail. And curiously  in these systems  as they grow larger  the systems don't converge  they diverge more. In bigger systems  the head gets bigger and the tail gets longer  so the imbalance increases. You can see the curve is obviously heavily left weighted. Here's how heavily  if you take the top    percent of photographers contributing to this system  they account for three quarters of the photos taken    just the top    percent most prolific photographers. If you go down to five percent  you're still accounting for    percent of the photos. If you go down to one percent  exclude    percent of the group effort  you're still accounting for almost a quarter of the photos. And because of this left weighting  the average is actually here  way to the left. And that sounds strange to our ears  but what ends up happening is that    percent of the contributors have contributed a below average amount. That sounds strange because we expect average and middle to be about the same  but they're not at all. This is the math underlying the       rule. Right  Whenever you hear anybody talking about the       rule  this is what's going on. Right     percent of the merchandise accounts for    percent of the revenue     percent of the users use    percent of the resources    this is the shape people are talking about when that happens. Institutions only have two tools  carrots and sticks. And the    percent zone is a no carrot and no stick zone. The costs of running the institution mean that you cannot take on the work of those people easily in an institutional frame. The institutional model always pushes leftwards  treating these people as employees. The institutional response is  I can get    percent of the value for    percent of the hires    great  that's what I'll do. The cooperative infrastructure model says  why do you want to give up a quarter of the value  If your system is designed so that you have to give up a quarter of the value  re engineer the system. Don't take on the cost that prevents you from getting to the contributions of these people. Build the system so that anybody can contribute at any amount. So the coordination response asks not  how are these people as employees  but rather  what is their contribution like  Right  We have over here Psycho Milt  a Flickr user  who has contributed one  and only one  photo titled  Iraq.  And here's the photo. Right. Labeled   Bad Day at Work.  Right  So the question is  do you want that photo  Yes or no. The question is not  is Psycho Milt a good employee  And the tension here is between institution as enabler and institution as obstacle. When you're dealing with the left hand edge of one of these distributions  when you're dealing with the people who spend a lot of time producing a lot of the material you want  that's an institution as enabler world. You can hire those people as employees  you can coordinate their work and you can get some output. But when you're down here  where the Psycho Milts of the world are adding one photo at a time  that's institution as obstacle. Institutions hate being told they're obstacles. One of the first things that happens when you institutionalize a problem is that the first goal of the institution immediately shifts from whatever the nominal goal was to self preservation. And the actual goal of the institution goes to two through n. Right  So  when institutions are told they are obstacles  and that there are other ways of coordinating the value  they go through something a little bit like the Kubler Ross stages       of reaction  being told you have a fatal illness  denial  anger  bargaining  acceptance. Most of the cooperative systems we've seen haven't been around long enough to have gotten to the acceptance phase. Many  many institutions are still in denial  but we're seeing recently a lot of both anger and bargaining. There's a wonderful  small example going on right now. In France  a bus company is suing people for forming a carpool  right  because the fact that they have coordinated themselves to create cooperative value is depriving them of revenue. You can follow this in the Guardian. It's actually quite entertaining. The bigger question is  what do you do about the value down here  Right  How do you capture that  And institutions  as I've said  are prevented from capturing that. Steve Ballmer  now CEO of Microsoft  was criticizing Linux a couple of years ago  and he said   Oh  this business of thousands of programmers contributing to Linux  this is a myth. We've looked at who's contributed to Linux  and most of the patches have been produced by programmers who've only done one thing.  Right  You can hear this distribution under that complaint. And you can see why  from Ballmer's point of view  that's a bad idea  right  We hired this programmer  he came in  he drank our Cokes and played Foosball for three years and he had one idea. Right  Bad hire. Right  The Psycho Milt question is  was it a good idea  What if it was a security patch  What if it was a security patch for a buffer overflow exploit  of which Windows has not some   but  several  Do you want that patch  right  The fact that a single programmer can  without having to move into a professional relation to an institution  improve Linux once and never be seen from again  should terrify Ballmer. Because this kind of value is unreachable in classic institutional frameworks  but is part of cooperative systems of open source software  of file sharing  of the Wikipedia. I've used a lot of examples from Flickr  but there are actually stories about this from all over. Meetup  a service founded so that users could find people in their local area who share their interests and affinities and actually have a real world meeting offline in a cafe or a pub or what have you. When Scott Heiferman founded Meetup  he thought it would be used for  you know  train spotters and cat fanciers    classic affinity groups. The inventors don't know what the invention is. Number one group on Meetup right now  most chapters in most cities with most members  most active  Stay at home moms. Right  In the suburbanized  dual income United States  stay at home moms are actually missing the social infrastructure that comes from extended family and local  small scale neighborhoods. So they're reinventing it  using these tools. Meetup is the platform  but the value here is in social infrastructure. If you want to know what technology is going to change the world  don't pay attention to    year old boys    pay attention to young mothers  because they have got not an ounce of support for technology that doesn't materially make their lives better. This is so much more important than Xbox  but it's a lot less glitzy. I think this is a revolution. I think that this is a really profound change in the way human affairs are arranged. And I use that word advisedly. It's a revolution in that it's a change in equilibrium. It's a whole new way of doing things  which includes new downsides. In the United States right now  a woman named Judith Miller is in jail for not having given to a Federal Grand Jury her sources    she's a reporter for the New York Times    her sources  in a very abstract and hard to follow case. And journalists are in the street rallying to improve the shield laws. The shield laws are our laws    pretty much a patchwork of state laws    that prevent a journalist from having to betray a source. This is happening  however  against the background of the rise of Web logging. Web logging is a classic example of mass amateurization. It has de professionalized publishing. Want to publish globally anything you think today  It is a one button operation that you can do for free. That has sent the professional class of publishing down into the ranks of mass amateurization. And so the shield law  as much as we want it    we want a professional class of truth tellers    it is becoming increasingly incoherent  because the institution is becoming incoherent. There are people in the States right now tying themselves into knots  trying to figure out whether or not bloggers are journalists. And the answer to that question is  it doesn't matter  because that's not the right question. Journalism was an answer to an even more important question  which is  how will society be informed  How will they share ideas and opinions  And if there is an answer to that that happens outside the professional framework of journalism  it makes no sense to take a professional metaphor and apply it to this distributed class. So as much as we want the shield laws  the background    the institution to which they were attached    is becoming incoherent. Here's another example. Pro ana  the pro ana groups. These are groups of teenage girls who have taken on Web logs  bulletin boards  other kinds of cooperative infrastructure  and have used it to set up support groups for remaining anorexic by choice. They post pictures of thin models  which they call  thinspiration.  They have little slogans  like  Salvation through Starvation.  They even have Lance Armstrong style bracelets  these red bracelets  which signify  in the small group  I am trying to maintain my eating disorder. They trade tips  like  if you feel like eating something  clean a toilet or the litter box. The feeling will pass. We're used to support groups being beneficial. We have an attitude that support groups are inherently beneficial. But it turns out that the logic of the support group is value neutral. A support group is simply a small group that wants to maintain a way of living in the context of a larger group. Now  when the larger group is a bunch of drunks  and the small group wants to stay sober  then we think  that's a great support group. But when the small group is teenage girls who want to stay anorexic by choice  then we're horrified. What's happened is that the normative goals of the support groups that we're used to  came from the institutions that were framing them  and not from the infrastructure. Once the infrastructure becomes generically available  the logic of the support group has been revealed to be accessible to anyone  including people pursuing these kinds of goals. So  there are significant downsides to these changes as well as upsides. And of course  in the current environment  one need allude only lightly to the work of non state actors trying to influence global affairs  and taking advantage of these. This is a social map of the hijackers and their associates who perpetrated the      attack. It was produced by analyzing their communications patterns using a lot of these tools. And doubtless the intelligence communities of the world are doing the same work today for the attacks of last week. Now  this is the part of the talk where I tell you what's going to come as a result of all of this  but I'm running out of time  which is good  because I don't know. Right. As with the printing press  if it's really a revolution  it doesn't take us from Point A to Point B. It takes us from Point A to chaos. The printing press precipitated     years of chaos  moving from a world where the Catholic Church was the sort of organizing political force to the Treaty of Westphalia  when we finally knew what the new unit was  the nation state. Now  I'm not predicting     years of chaos as a result of this.   .    years in which loosely coordinated groups are going to be given increasingly high leverage  and the more those groups forego traditional institutional imperatives    like deciding in advance what's going to happen  or the profit motive    the more leverage they'll get. And institutions are going to come under an increasing degree of pressure  and the more rigidly managed  and the more they rely on information monopolies  the greater the pressure is going to be. And that's going to happen one arena at a time  one institution at a time. The forces are general  but the results are going to be specific. And so the point here is not   This is wonderful   or  We're going to see a transition from only institutions to only cooperative framework.  It's going to be much more complicated than that. But the point is that it's going to be a massive readjustment. And since we can see it in advance and know it's coming  my argument is essentially  we might as well get good at it. Thank you very much. How will we be remembered in     years  I happen to live in a little town  Princeton  in New Jersey  which every year celebrates the great event in Princeton history  the Battle of Princeton  which was  in fact  a very important battle. It was the first battle that George Washington won  in fact  and was pretty much of a turning point in the war of independence. It happened     years ago. It was actually a terrible disaster for Princeton. The town was burned down  it was in the middle of winter  and it was a very  very severe winter. And about a quarter of all the people in Princeton died that winter from hunger and cold  but nobody remembers that. What they remember is  of course  the great triumph  that the Brits were beaten  and we won  and that the country was born. And so I agree very emphatically that the pain of childbirth is not remembered. It's the child that's remembered. And that's what we're going through at this time. I wanted to just talk for one minute about the future of biotechnology  because I think I know very little about that    I'm not a biologist    so everything I know about it can be said in one minute. What I'm saying is that we should follow the model that has been so successful with the electronic industry  that what really turned computers into a great success  in the world as a whole  is toys. As soon as computers became toys  when kids could come home and play with them  then the industry really took off. And that has to happen with biotech. There's a huge       there's a huge community of people in the world who are practical biologists  who are dog breeders  pigeon breeders  orchid breeders  rose breeders  people who handle biology with their hands  and who are dedicated to producing beautiful things  beautiful creatures  plants  animals  pets. These people will be empowered with biotech  and that will be an enormous positive step to acceptance of biotechnology. That will blow away a lot of the opposition. When people have this technology in their hands  you have a do it yourself biotech kit  grow your own    grow your dog  grow your own cat. Just buy the software  you design it. I won't say anymore  you can take it on from there. It's going to happen  and I think it has to happen before the technology becomes natural  becomes part of the human condition  something that everybody's familiar with and everybody accepts. So  let's leave that aside. I want to talk about something quite different  which is what I know about  and that is astronomy. And I'm interested in searching for life in the universe. And it's open to us to introduce a new way of doing that  and that's what I'll talk about for    minutes  or whatever the time remains. The important fact is  that most of the real estate that's accessible to us    I'm not talking about the stars  I'm talking about the solar system  the stuff that's within reach for spacecraft and within reach of our earthbound telescopes    most of the real estate is very cold and very far from the Sun. If you look at the solar system  as we know it today  it has a few planets close to the Sun. That's where we live. It has a fairly substantial number of asteroids between the orbit of the Earth out through    to the orbit of Jupiter. The asteroids are a substantial amount of real estate  but not very large. And it's not very promising for life  since most of it consists of rock and metal  mostly rock. It's not only cold  but very dry. So the asteroids we don't have much hope for. There stand some interesting places a little further out  the moons of Jupiter and Saturn. Particularly  there's a place called Europa  which is    Europa is one of the moons of Jupiter  where we see a very level ice surface  which looks as if it's floating on top of an ocean. So  we believe that on Europa there is  in fact  a deep ocean. And that makes it extraordinarily interesting as a place to explore. Ocean    probably the most likely place for life to originate  just as it originated on the Earth. So we would love to explore Europa  to go down through the ice  find out who is swimming around in the ocean  whether there are fish or seaweed or sea monsters    whatever there may be that's exciting     or cephalopods. But that's hard to do. Unfortunately  the ice is thick. We don't know just how thick it is  probably miles thick  so it's very expensive and very difficult to go down there    send down your submarine or whatever it is    and explore. That's something we don't yet know how to do. There are plans to do it  but it's hard. Go out a bit further  you'll find that beyond the orbit of Neptune  way out  far from the Sun  that's where the real estate really begins. You'll find millions or trillions or billions of objects which  in what we call the Kuiper Belt or the Oort Cloud    these are clouds of small objects which appear as comets when they fall close to the Sun. Mostly  they just live out there in the cold of the outer solar system  but they are biologically very interesting indeed  because they consist primarily of ice with other minerals  which are just the right ones for developing life. So if life could be established out there  it would have all the essentials    chemistry and sunlight    everything that's needed. So  what I'm proposing is that there is where we should be looking for life  rather than on Mars  although Mars is  of course  also a very promising and interesting place. But we can look outside  very cheaply and in a simple fashion. And that's what I'm going to talk about. There is a    imagine that life originated on Europa  and it was sitting in the ocean for billions of years. It's quite likely that it would move out of the ocean onto the surface  just as it did on the Earth. Staying in the ocean and evolving in the ocean for   billion years  finally came out onto the land. And then of course it had great    much greater freedom  and a much greater variety of creatures developed on the land than had ever been possible in the ocean. And the step from the ocean to the land was not easy  but it happened. Now  if life had originated on Europa in the ocean  it could also have moved out onto the surface. There wouldn't have been any air there    it's a vacuum. It is out in the cold  but it still could have come. You can imagine that the plants growing up like kelp through cracks in the ice  growing on the surface. What would they need in order to grow on the surface  They'd need  first of all  to have a thick skin to protect themselves from losing water through the skin. So they would have to have something like a reptilian skin. But better    what is more important is that they would have to concentrate sunlight. The sunlight in Jupiter  on the satellites of Jupiter  is    times fainter than it is here  since Jupiter is five times as far from the Sun. So they would have to have    these creatures  which I call sunflowers  which I imagine living on the surface of Europa  would have to have either lenses or mirrors to concentrate sunlight  so they could keep themselves warm on the surface. Otherwise  they would be at a temperature of minus      which is certainly not favorable for developing life  at least of the kind we know. But if they just simply could grow  like leaves  little lenses and mirrors to concentrate sunlight  then they could keep warm on the surface. They could enjoy all the benefits of the sunlight and have roots going down into the ocean  life then could flourish much more. So  why not look  Of course  it's not very likely that there's life on the surface of Europa. None of these things is likely  but my  my philosophy is  look for what's detectable  not for what's probable. There's a long history in astronomy of unlikely things turning out to be there. And I mean  the finest example of that was radio astronomy as a whole. This was    originally  when radio astronomy began  Mr. Jansky  at the Bell labs  detected radio waves coming from the sky. And the regular astronomers were scornful about this. They said   It's all right  you can detect radio waves from the Sun  but the Sun is the only object in the universe that's close enough and bright enough actually to be detectable. You can easily calculate that radio waves from the Sun are fairly faint  and everything else in the universe is millions of times further away  so it certainly will not be detectable. So there's no point in looking.  And that  of course  that set back the progress of radio astronomy by about    years. Since there was nothing there  you might as well not look. Well  of course  as soon as anybody did look  which was after about    years  when radio astronomy really took off. Because it turned out the universe is absolutely full of all kinds of wonderful things radiating in the radio spectrum  much brighter than the Sun. So  the same thing could be true for this kind of life  which I'm talking about  on cold objects  that it could in fact be very abundant all over the universe  and it's not been detected just because we haven't taken the trouble to look. So  the last thing I want to talk about is how to detect it. There is something called pit lamping. That's the phrase which I learned from my son George  who is there in the audience. You take    that's a Canadian expression. If you happen to want to hunt animals at night  you take a miner's lamp  which is a pit lamp. You strap it onto your forehead  so you can see the reflection in the eyes of the animal. So  if you go out at night  you shine a flashlight  the animals are bright. You see the red glow in their eyes  which is the reflection of the flashlight. And then  if you're one of these unsporting characters  you shoot the animals and take them home. And of course  that spoils the game for the other hunters who hunt in the daytime  so in Canada that's illegal. In New Zealand  it's legal  because the New Zealand farmers use this as a way of getting rid of rabbits  because the rabbits compete with the sheep in New Zealand. So  the farmers go out at night with heavily armed jeeps  and shine the headlights  and anything that doesn't look like a sheep  you shoot. So I have proposed to apply the same trick to looking for life in the universe. That if these creatures who are living on cold surfaces    either on Europa  or further out  anywhere where you can live on a cold surface    those creatures must be provided with reflectors. In order to concentrate sunlight  they have to have lenses and mirrors    in order to keep themselves warm. And then  when you shine sunlight at them  the sunlight will be reflected back  just as it is in the eyes of an animal. So these creatures will be bright against the cold surroundings. And the further out you go in this  away from the Sun  the more powerful this reflection will be. So actually  this method of hunting for life gets stronger and stronger as you go further away  because the optical reflectors have to be more powerful so the reflected light shines out even more in contrast against the dark background. So as you go further away from the Sun  this becomes more and more powerful. So  in fact  you can look for these creatures with telescopes from the Earth. Why aren't we doing it  Simply because nobody thought of it yet. But I hope that we shall look  and with any    we probably won't find anything  none of these speculations may have any basis in fact. But still  it's a good chance. And of course  if it happens  it will transform our view of life altogether. Because it means that    the way life can live out there  it has enormous advantages as compared with living on a planet. It's extremely hard to move from one planet to another. We're having great difficulties at the moment and any creatures that live on a planet are pretty well stuck. Especially if you breathe air  it's very hard to get from planet A to planet B  because there's no air in between. But if you breathe air       you're dead       as soon as you're off the planet  unless you have a spaceship. But if you live in a vacuum  if you live on the surface of one of these objects  say  in the Kuiper Belt  this    an object like Pluto  or one of the smaller objects in the neighborhood of Pluto  and you happened    if you're living on the surface there  and you get knocked off the surface by a collision  then it doesn't change anything all that much. You still are on a piece of ice  you can still have sunlight and you can still survive while you're traveling from one place to another. And then if you run into another object  you can stay there and colonize the other object. So life will spread  then  from one object to another. So if it exists at all in the Kuiper Belt  it's likely to be very widespread. And you will have then a great competition amongst species    Darwinian evolution    so there'll be a huge advantage to the species which is able to jump from one place to another without having to wait for a collision. And there'll be advantages for spreading out long  sort of kelp like forest of vegetation. I call these creatures sunflowers. They look like  maybe like sunflowers. They have to be all the time pointing toward the Sun  and they will be able to spread out in space  because gravity on these objects is weak. So they can collect sunlight from a big area. So they will  in fact  be quite easy for us to detect. So  I hope in the next    years  we'll find these creatures  and then  of course  our whole view of life in the universe will change. If we don't find them  then we can create them ourselves. That's another wonderful opportunity that's opening. We can    as soon as we have a little bit more understanding of genetic engineering  one of the things you can do with your take it home  do it yourself genetic engineering kit    is to design a creature that can live on a cold satellite  a place like Europa  so we could colonize Europa with our own creatures. That would be a fun thing to do. In the long run  of course  it would also make it possible for us to move out there. What's going to happen in the end  it's not going to be just humans colonizing space  it's going to be life moving out from the Earth  moving it into its kingdom. And the kingdom of life  of course  is going to be the universe. And if life is already there  it makes it much more exciting  in the short run. But in the long run  if there's no life there  we create it ourselves. We transform the universe into something much more rich and beautiful than it is today. So again  we have a big and wonderful future to look forward. Thank you. I and my colleagues Art Aron and Lucy Brown and others  have put    people who are madly in love into a functional MRI brain scanner.    who were happily in love     who had just been dumped  and we're just starting our third experiment  studying people who report that they're still in love after    to    years of marriage. So  this is the short story of that research. In the jungles of Guatemala  in Tikal  stands a temple. It was built by the grandest Sun King  of the grandest city state  of the grandest civilization of the Americas  the Mayas. His name was Jasaw Chan K'awiil. He stood over six feet tall. He lived into his   s  and he was buried beneath this monument in     AD. And Mayan inscriptions proclaim that he was deeply in love with his wife. So  he built a temple in her honor  facing his. And every spring and autumn  exactly at the equinox  the sun rises behind his temple  and perfectly bathes her temple with his shadow. And as the sun sets behind her temple in the afternoon  it perfectly bathes his temple with her shadow. After       years  these two lovers still touch and kiss from their tomb. Around the world  people love. They sing for love  they dance for love  they compose poems and stories about love. They tell myths and legends about love. They pine for love  they live for love  they kill for love  and they die for love. As Walt Whitman once said  he said   Oh  I would stake all for you.  Anthropologists have found evidence of romantic love in     societies. They've never found a society that did not have it. But love isn't always a happy experience. In one study of college students  they asked a lot of questions about love  but the two that stood out to me the most were   Have you ever been rejected by somebody who you really loved   And the second question was   Have you ever dumped somebody who really loved you   And almost    percent of both men and women said yes to both. Almost nobody gets out of love alive. So  before I start telling you about the brain  I want to read for you what I think is the most powerful love poem on Earth. There's other love poems that are  of course  just as good  but I don't think this one can be surpassed. It was told by an anonymous Kwakiutl Indian of southern Alaska to a missionary in       and here it is. I've never had the opportunity to say it before.  Fire runs through my body with the pain of loving you. Pain runs through my body with the fires of my love for you. Pain like a boil about to burst with my love for you  consumed by fire with my love for you. I remember what you said to me. I am thinking of your love for me. I am torn by your love for me. Pain and more pain    where are you going with my love  I am told you will go from here. I am told you will leave me here. My body is numb with grief. Remember what I said  my love. Goodbye  my love  goodbye.  Emily Dickinson once wrote   Parting is all we need to know of hell.  How many people have suffered in all the millions of years of human evolution  How many people around the world are dancing with elation at this very minute  Romantic love is one of the most powerful sensations on Earth. So  several years ago  I decided to look into the brain and study this madness. Our first study of people who were happily in love has been widely publicized  so I'm only going to say a very little about it. We found activity in a tiny  little factory near the base of the brain called the ventral tegmental area. We found activity in some cells called the A   cells  cells that actually make dopamine  a natural stimulant  and spray it to many brain regions. Indeed  this part  the VTA  is part of the brain's reward system. It's way below your cognitive thinking process. It's below your emotions. It's part of what we call the reptilian core of the brain  associated with wanting  with motivation  with focus and with craving. In fact  the same brain region where we found activity becomes active also when you feel the rush of cocaine. But romantic love is much more than a cocaine high    at least you come down from cocaine. Romantic love is an obsession. It possesses you. You lose your sense of self. You can't stop thinking about another human being. Somebody is camping in your head. As an eighth century Japanese poet said   My longing had no time when it ceases.  Wild is love. And the obsession can get worse when you've been rejected. So  right now  Lucy Brown and I  the neuroscientist on our project  are looking at the data of the people who were put into the machine after they had just been dumped. It was very difficult actually  putting these people in the machine  because they were in such bad shape. So anyway  we found activity in three brain regions. We found activity in the brain region  in exactly the same brain region associated with intense romantic love. What a bad deal. You know  when you've been dumped  the one thing you love to do is just forget about this human being  and then go on with your life    but no  you just love them harder. As the poet Terence  the Roman poet once said  he said   The less my hope  the hotter my love.  And indeed  we now know why. Two thousand years later  we can explain this in the brain. That brain system    the reward system for wanting  for motivation  for craving  for focus    becomes more active when you can't get what you want. In this case  life's greatest prize  an appropriate mating partner. We found activity in other brain regions also    in a brain region associated with calculating gains and losses. You know  you're lying there  you're looking at the picture  and you're in this machine  and you're calculating  you know  what went wrong. How  you know  what have I lost  As a matter of fact  Lucy and I have a little joke about this. It comes from a David Mamet play  and there's two con artists in the play  and the woman is conning the man  and the man looks at the woman and says   Oh  you're a bad pony  I'm not going to bet on you.  And indeed  it's this part of the brain  the core of the nucleus accumbens  actually  that is becoming active as you're measuring your gains and losses. It's also the brain region that becomes active when you're willing to take enormous risks for huge gains and huge losses. Last but not least  we found activity in a brain region associated with deep attachment to another individual. No wonder people suffer around the world  and we have so many crimes of passion. When you've been rejected in love  not only are you engulfed with feelings of romantic love  but you're feeling deep attachment to this individual. Moreover  this brain circuit for reward is working  and you're feeling intense energy  intense focus  intense motivation and the willingness to risk it all to win life's greatest prize. So  what have I learned from this experiment that I would like to tell the world  Foremost  I have come to think that romantic love is a drive  a basic mating drive. Not the sex drive    the sex drive gets you out there  looking for a whole range of partners. Romantic love enables you to focus your mating energy on just one at a time  conserve your mating energy  and start the mating process with this single individual. I think of all the poetry that I've read about romantic love  what sums it up best is something that is said by Plato  over       years ago. He said   The god of love lives in a state of need. It is a need. It is an urge. It is a homeostatic imbalance. Like hunger and thirst  it's almost impossible to stamp out.  I've also come to believe that romantic love is an addiction  a perfectly wonderful addiction when it's going well  and a perfectly horrible addiction when it's going poorly. And indeed  it has all of the characteristics of addiction. You focus on the person  you obsessively think about them  you crave them  you distort reality  your willingness to take enormous risks to win this person. And it's got the three main characteristics of addiction  tolerance  you need to see them more  and more  and more  withdrawals  and last  relapse. I've got a girlfriend who's just getting over a terrible love affair. It's been about eight months  she's beginning to feel better. And she was driving along in her car the other day  and suddenly she heard a song on the car radio that reminded her of this man. And she    not only did the instant craving come back  but she had to pull over from the side of the road and cry. So  one thing I would like the medical community  and the legal community  and even the college community  to see if they can understand  that indeed  romantic love is one of the most addictive substances on Earth. I would also like to tell the world that animals love. There's not an animal on this planet that will copulate with anything that comes along. Too old  too young  too scruffy  too stupid  and they won't do it. Unless you're stuck in a laboratory cage    and you know  if you spend your entire life in a little box  you're not going to be as picky about who you have sex with    but I've looked in a hundred species  and everywhere in the wild  animals have favorites. As a matter of fact ethologists know this. There are over eight words for what they call  animal favoritism   selective proceptivity  mate choice  female choice  sexual choice. And indeed  there are now three academic articles in which they've looked at this attraction  which may only last for a second  but it's a definite attraction  and either this same brain region  this reward system  or the chemicals of that reward system are involved. In fact  I think animal attraction can be instant    you can see an elephant instantly go for another elephant. And I think that this is really the origin of what you and I call  love at first sight.  People have often asked me whether what I know about love has spoiled it for me. And I just simply say   Hardly.  You can know every single ingredient in a piece of chocolate cake  and then when you sit down and eat that cake  you can still feel that joy. And certainly  I make all the same mistakes that everybody else does too  but it's really deepened my understanding and compassion  really  for all human life. As a matter of fact  in New York  I often catch myself looking in baby carriages and feeling a little sorry for the tot. And in fact  sometimes I feel a little sorry for the chicken on my dinner plate  when I think of how intense this brain system is. Our newest experiment has been hatched by my colleague  Art Aron    putting people who are reporting that they are still in love  in a long term relationship  into the functional MRI. We've put five people in so far  and indeed  we found exactly the same thing. They're not lying. The brain areas associated with intense romantic love still become active     years later. There are still many questions to be answered and asked about romantic love. The question that I'm working on right this minute    and I'm only going to say it for a second  and then end    is  why do you fall in love with one person  rather than another  I never would have even thought to think of this  but Match.com  the Internet dating site  came to me three years ago and asked me that question. And I said  I don't know. I know what happens in the brain  when you do become in love  but I don't know why you fall in love with one person rather than another. And so  I've spent the last three years on this. And there are many reasons that you fall in love with one person rather than another  that psychologists can tell you. And we tend to fall in love with somebody from the same socioeconomic background  the same general level of intelligence  the same general level of good looks  the same religious values. Your childhood certainly plays a role  but nobody knows how. And that's about it  that's all they know. No  they've never found the way two personalities fit together to make a good relationship. So  it began to occur to me that maybe your biology pulls you towards some people rather than another. And I have concocted a questionnaire to see to what degree you express dopamine  serotonin  estrogen and testosterone. I think we've evolved four very broad personality types associated with the ratios of these four chemicals in the brain. And on this dating site that I have created  called Chemistry.com  I ask you first a series of questions to see to what degree you express these chemicals  and I'm watching who chooses who to love. And  .  million people have taken the questionnaire in America. About         people have taken it in    other countries. I'm putting the data together now  and at some point    there will always be magic to love  but I think I will come closer to understanding why it is you can walk into a room and everybody is from your background  your same general level of intelligence  your same general level of good looks  and you don't feel pulled towards all of them. I think there's biology to that. I think we're going to end up  in the next few years  to understand all kinds of brain mechanisms that pull us to one person rather than another. So  I will close with this. These are my older people. Faulkner once said   The past is not dead  it's not even the past.  Indeed  we carry a lot of luggage from our yesteryear in the human brain. And so  there's one thing that makes me pursue my understanding of human nature  and this reminds me of it. These are two women. Women tend to get intimacy differently than men do. Women get intimacy from face to face talking. We swivel towards each other  we do what we call the  anchoring gaze  and we talk. This is intimacy to women. I think it comes from millions of years of holding that baby in front of your face  cajoling it  reprimanding it  educating it with words. Men tend to get intimacy from side by side doing. As soon as one guy looks up  the other guy will look away. I think it comes from millions of years of standing behind that    sitting behind the bush  looking straight ahead  trying to hit that buffalo on the head with a rock. I think  for millions of years  men faced their enemies  they sat side by side with friends. So my final statement is  love is in us. It's deeply embedded in the brain. Our challenge is to understand each other. Thank you. As a clergyman  you can imagine how out of place I feel. I feel like a fish out of water  or maybe an owl out of the air. I was preaching in San Jose some time ago  and my friend Mark Kvamme  who helped introduce me to this conference  brought several CEOs and leaders of some of the companies here in the Silicon Valley to have breakfast with me  or I with them. And I was so stimulated. And had such    it was an eye opening experience to hear them talk about the world that is yet to come through technology and science. I know that we're near the end of this conference  and some of you may be wondering why they have a speaker from the field of religion. Richard can answer that  because he made that decision. But some years ago I was on an elevator in Philadelphia  coming down. I was to address a conference at a hotel. And on that elevator a man said   I hear Billy Graham is staying in this hotel.  And another man looked in my direction and said   Yes  there he is. He's on this elevator with us.  And this man looked me up and down for about    seconds  and he said   My  what an anticlimax   I hope that you won't feel that these few moments with me is not a    is an anticlimax  after all these tremendous talks that you've heard  and addresses  which I intend to listen to every one of them. But I was on an airplane in the east some years ago  and the man sitting across the aisle from me was the mayor of Charlotte  North Carolina. His name was John Belk. Some of you will probably know him. And there was a drunk man on there  and he got up out of his seat two or three times  and he was making everybody upset by what he was trying to do. And he was slapping the stewardess and pinching her as she went by  and everybody was upset with him. And finally  John Belk said   Do you know who's sitting here   And the man said   No  who   He said   It's Billy Graham  the preacher.  He said   You don't say   And he turned to me  and he said   Put her there   He said   Your sermons have certainly helped me.  And I suppose that that's true with thousands of people. I know that as you have been peering into the future  and as we've heard some of it here tonight  I would like to live in that age and see what is going to be. But I won't  because I'm    years old. This is my eightieth year  and I know that my time is brief. I have phlebitis at the moment  in both legs  and that's the reason that I had to have a little help in getting up here  because I have Parkinson's disease in addition to that  and some other problems that I won't talk about. But this is not the first time that we've had a technological revolution. We've had others. And there's one that I want to talk about. In one generation  the nation of the people of Israel had a tremendous and dramatic change that made them a great power in the Near East. A man by the name of David came to the throne  and King David became one of the great leaders of his generation. He was a man of tremendous leadership. He had the favor of God with him. He was a brilliant poet  philosopher  writer  soldier    with strategies in battle and conflict that people study even today. But about two centuries before David  the Hittites had discovered the secret of smelting and processing of iron  and  slowly  that skill spread. But they wouldn't allow the Israelis to look into it  or to have any. But David changed all of that  and he introduced the Iron Age to Israel. And the Bible says that David laid up great stores of iron  and which archaeologists have found  that in present day Palestine  there are evidences of that generation. Now  instead of crude tools made of sticks and stones  Israel now had iron plows  and sickles  and hoes and military weapons. And in the course of one generation  Israel was completely changed. The introduction of iron  in some ways  had an impact a little bit like the microchip has had on our generation. And David found that there were many problems that technology could not solve. There were many problems still left. And they're still with us  and you haven't solved them  and I haven't heard anybody here speak to that. How do we solve these three problems that I'd like to mention  The first one that David saw was human evil. Where does it come from  How do we solve it  Over again and again in the Psalms  which Gladstone said was the greatest book in the world  David describes the evils of the human race. And yet he says   He restores my soul.  Have you ever thought about what a contradiction we are  On one hand  we can probe the deepest secrets of the universe and dramatically push back the frontiers of technology  as this conference vividly demonstrates. We've seen under the sea  three miles down  or galaxies hundreds of billions of years out in the future. But on the other hand  something is wrong. Our battleships  our soldiers  are on a frontier now  almost ready to go to war with Iraq. Now  what causes this  Why do we have these wars in every generation  and in every part of the world  And revolutions  We can't get along with other people  even in our own families. We find ourselves in the paralyzing grip of self destructive habits we can't break. Racism and injustice and violence sweep our world  bringing a tragic harvest of heartache and death. Even the most sophisticated among us seem powerless to break this cycle. I would like to see Oracle take up that  or some other technological geniuses work on this. How do we change man  so that he doesn't lie and cheat  and our newspapers are not filled with stories of fraud in business or labor or athletics or wherever  The Bible says the problem is within us  within our hearts and our souls. Our problem is that we are separated from our Creator  which we call God  and we need to have our souls restored  something only God can do. Jesus said   For out of the heart come evil thoughts  murders  sexual immorality  theft  false testimonies  slander.  The British philosopher Bertrand Russell was not a religious man  but he said   It's in our hearts that the evil lies  and it's from our hearts that it must be plucked out.  Albert Einstein    I was just talking to someone  when I was speaking at Princeton  and I met Mr. Einstein. He didn't have a doctor's degree  because he said nobody was qualified to give him one. But he made this statement. He said   It's easier to denature plutonium than to denature the evil spirit of man.  And many of you  I'm sure  have thought about that and puzzled over it. You've seen people take beneficial technological advances  such as the Internet we've heard about tonight  and twist them into something corrupting. You've seen brilliant people devise computer viruses that bring down whole systems. The Oklahoma City bombing was simple technology  horribly used. The problem is not technology. The problem is the person or persons using it. King David said that he knew the depths of his own soul. He couldn't free himself from personal problems and personal evils that included murder and adultery. Yet King David sought God's forgiveness  and said   You can restore my soul.  You see  the Bible teaches that we're more than a body and a mind. We are a soul. And there's something inside of us that is beyond our understanding. That's the part of us that yearns for God  or something more than we find in technology. Your soul is that part of you that yearns for meaning in life  and which seeks for something beyond this life. It's the part of you that yearns  really  for God. I find  that  young people all over the world are searching for something. They don't know what it is. I speak at many universities  and I have many questions and answer periods  and whether it's Cambridge  or Harvard  or Oxford    I've spoken at all of those universities. I'm going to Harvard in about three or four    no  it's about two months from now    to give a lecture. And I'll be asked the same questions that I was asked the last few times I've been there. And it'll be on these questions  where did I come from  Why am I here  Where am I going  What's life all about  Why am I here  Even if you have no religious belief  there are times when you wonder that there's something else. Thomas Edison also said   When you see everything that happens in the world of science  and in the working of the universe  you cannot deny that there's a captain on the bridge.  I remember once  I sat beside Mrs. Gorbachev at a White House dinner. I went to Ambassador Dobrynin  whom I knew very well. And I'd been to Russia several times under the Communists  and they'd given me marvelous freedom that I didn't expect. And I knew Mr. Dobrynin very well  and I said   I'm going to sit beside Mrs. Gorbachev tonight. What shall I talk to her about   And he surprised me with the answer. He said   Talk to her about religion and philosophy. That's what she's really interested in.  I was a little bit surprised  but that evening that's what we talked about  and it was a stimulating conversation. And afterward  she said   You know  I'm an atheist  but I know that there's something up there higher than we are.  The second problem that King David realized he could not solve was the problem of human suffering. Writing the oldest book in the world was Job  and he said   Man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward.  Yes  to be sure  science has done much to push back certain types of human suffering. But I'm    in a few months  I'll be    years of age. I admit that I'm very grateful for all the medical advances that have kept me in relatively good health all these years. My doctors at the Mayo Clinic urged me not to take this trip out here to this    to be here. I haven't given a talk in nearly four months. And when you speak as much as I do  three or four times a day  you get rusty. That's the reason I'm using this podium and using these notes. Every time you ever hear me on the television or somewhere  I'm ad libbing. I'm not reading. I never read an address. I never read a speech or a talk or a lecture. I talk ad lib. But tonight  I've got some notes here so that if I begin to forget  which I do sometimes  I've got something I can turn to. But even here among us  most    in the most advanced society in the world  we have poverty. We have families that self destruct  friends that betray us. Unbearable psychological pressures bear down on us. I've never met a person in the world that didn't have a problem or a worry. Why do we suffer  It's an age old question that we haven't answered. Yet David again and again said that he would turn to God. He said   The Lord is my shepherd.  The final problem that David knew he could not solve was death. Many commentators have said that death is the forbidden subject of our generation. Most people live as if they're never going to die. Technology projects the myth of control over our mortality. We see people on our screens. Marilyn Monroe is just as beautiful on the screen as she was in person  and our    many young people think she's still alive. They don't know that she's dead. Or Clark Gable  or whoever it is. The old stars  they come to life. And they're    they're just as great on that screen as they were in person. But death is inevitable. I spoke some time ago to a joint session of Congress  last year. And we were meeting in that room  the statue room. About     of them were there. And I said   There's one thing that we have in common in this room  all of us together  whether Republican or Democrat  or whoever.  I said   We're all going to die. And we have that in common with all these great men of the past that are staring down at us.  And it's often difficult for young people to understand that. It's difficult for them to understand that they're going to die. As the ancient writer of Ecclesiastes wrote  he said  there's every activity under heaven. There's a time to be born  and there's a time to die. I've stood at the deathbed of several famous people  whom you would know. I've talked to them. I've seen them in those agonizing moments when they were scared to death. And yet  a few years earlier  death never crossed their mind. I talked to a woman this past week whose father was a famous doctor. She said he never thought of God  never talked about God  didn't believe in God. He was an atheist. But she said  as he came to die  he sat up on the side of the bed one day  and he asked the nurse if he could see the chaplain. And he said  for the first time in his life he'd thought about the inevitable  and about God. Was there a God  A few years ago  a university student asked me   What is the greatest surprise in your life   And I said   The greatest surprise in my life is the brevity of life. It passes so fast.  But it does not need to have to be that way. Wernher von Braun  in the aftermath of World War II concluded  quote   science and religion are not antagonists. On the contrary  they're sisters.  He put it on a personal basis. I knew Dr. von Braun very well. And he said   Speaking for myself  I can only say that the grandeur of the cosmos serves only to confirm a belief in the certainty of a creator.  He also said   In our search to know God  I've come to believe that the life of Jesus Christ should be the focus of our efforts and inspiration. The reality of this life and His resurrection is the hope of mankind.  I've done a lot of speaking in Germany and in France  and in different parts of the world        countries it's been my privilege to speak in. And I was invited one day to visit Chancellor Adenauer  who was looked upon as sort of the founder of modern Germany  since the war. And he once    and he said to me  he said   Young man.  He said   Do you believe in the resurrection of Jesus Christ   And I said   Sir  I do.  He said   So do I.  He said   When I leave office  I'm going to spend my time writing a book on why Jesus Christ rose again  and why it's so important to believe that.  In one of his plays  Alexander Solzhenitsyn depicts a man dying  who says to those gathered around his bed   The moment when it's terrible to feel regret is when one is dying.  How should one live in order not to feel regret when one is dying  Blaise Pascal asked exactly that question in seventeenth century France. Pascal has been called the architect of modern civilization. He was a brilliant scientist at the frontiers of mathematics  even as a teenager. He is viewed by many as the founder of the probability theory  and a creator of the first model of a computer. And of course  you are all familiar with the computer language named for him. Pascal explored in depth our human dilemmas of evil  suffering and death. He was astounded at the phenomenon we've been considering  that people can achieve extraordinary heights in science  the arts and human enterprise  yet they also are full of anger  hypocrisy and have    and self hatreds. Pascal saw us as a remarkable mixture of genius and self delusion. On November           Pascal had a profound religious experience. He wrote in his journal these words   I submit myself  absolutely  to Jesus Christ  my redeemer.  A French historian said  two centuries later   Seldom has so mighty an intellect submitted with such humility to the authority of Jesus Christ.  Pascal came to believe not only the love and the grace of God could bring us back into harmony  but he believed that his own sins and failures could be forgiven  and that when he died he would go to a place called heaven. He experienced it in a way that went beyond scientific observation and reason. It was he who penned the well known words   The heart has its reasons  which reason knows not of.  Equally well known is Pascal's Wager. Essentially  he said this   if you bet on God  and open yourself to his love  you lose nothing  even if you're wrong. But if instead you bet that there is no God  then you can lose it all  in this life and the life to come.  For Pascal  scientific knowledge paled beside the knowledge of God. The knowledge of God was far beyond anything that ever crossed his mind. He was ready to face him when he died at the age of   . King David lived to be     a long time in his era. Yet he too had to face death  and he wrote these words   even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death  I will fear no evil  for you are with me.  This was David's answer to three dilemmas of evil  suffering and death. It can be yours  as well  as you seek the living God and allow him to fill your life and give you hope for the future. When I was    years of age  I was born and reared on a farm in North Carolina. I milked cows every morning  and I had to milk the same cows every evening when I came home from school. And there were    of them that I had    that I was responsible for  and I worked on the farm and tried to keep up with my studies. I didn't make good grades in high school. I didn't make them in college  until something happened in my heart. One day  I was faced face to face with Christ. He said   I am the way  the truth and the life.  Can you imagine that   I am the truth. I'm the embodiment of all truth.  He was a liar. Or he was insane. Or he was what he claimed to be. Which was he  I had to make that decision. I couldn't prove it. I couldn't take it to a laboratory and experiment with it. But by faith I said  I believe him  and he came into my heart and changed my life. And now I'm ready  when I hear that call  to go into the presence of God. Thank you  and God bless all of you. Thank you for the privilege. It was great. Richard Wurman  You did it. Thanks. I thought I'd tell you a little about what I like to write. And I like to immerse myself in my topics. I just like to dive right in and become sort of a human guinea pig. And I see my life as a series of experiments. So  I work for Esquire magazine  and a couple of years ago  I wrote an article called  My Outsourced Life   where I hired a team of people in Bangalore  India  to live my life for me. So  they answered my emails. They answered my phone. They argued with my wife for me  and they read my son bedtime stories. It was the best month of my life  because I just sat back and I read books and watched movies. It was a wonderful experience. More recently  I wrote an article for Esquire called    about radical honesty. And this is a movement where    this is started by a psychologist in Virginia  who says that you should never  ever lie  except maybe during poker and golf  his only exceptions. And  more than that  whatever is on your brain should come out of your mouth. So  I decided I would try this for a month. This was the worst month of my life. I do not recommend this at all. To give you a sense of the experience  the article was called   I Think You're Fat.  So  that was hard. My most recent book    my previous book was called  The Know It All   and it was about the year I spent reading the Encyclopedia Britannica from A to Z in my quest to learn everything in the world  or more precisely from Aak  which is a type of East Asian music  all the way to Zwyiec  which is    well  I don't want to ruin the ending. It's a very exciting twist ending  like an O. Henry novel  so I won't ruin it. But I love that one  because that was an experiment about how much information one human brain could absorb. Although  listening to Kevin Kelly  you don't have to remember anything. You can just Google it. So  I wasted some time there. I love those experiments  but I think that the most profound and life changing experiment that I've done is my most recent experiment  where I spent a year trying to follow all of the rules of the Bible   The Year of Living Biblically.  And I undertook this for two reasons. The first was that I grew up with no religion at all. As I say in my book  I'm Jewish in the same way the Olive Garden is Italian. So  not very. But I've become increasingly interested in religion. I do think it's the defining issue of our time  or one of the main ones. And I have a son. I want to know what to teach him. So  I decided to dive in head first  and try to live the Bible. The second reason I undertook this is because I'm concerned about the rise of fundamentalism  religious fundamentalism  and people who say they take the Bible literally  which is  according to some polls  as high as    or    percent of America. So I decided  what if you really did take the Bible literally  I decided to take it to its logical conclusion and take everything in the Bible literally  without picking and choosing. The first thing I did was I got a stack of bibles. I had Christian bibles. I had Jewish bibles. A friend of mine sent me something called a hip hop bible  where the twenty third Psalm is rendered as   The Lord is all that   as opposed to what I knew it as   The Lord is my shepherd.  Then I went down and I read several versions  and I wrote down every single law that I could find. And this was a very long list    over     rules. And they range from the famous ones that I had heard of    The Ten Commandments  love your neighbor  be fruitful and multiply. So I wanted to follow those. And actually  I take my projects very seriously  because I had twins during my year  so I definitely take my projects seriously. But I also wanted to follow the hundreds of arcane and obscure laws that are in the Bible. There is the law in Leviticus   You cannot shave the corners of your beard.  I didn't know where my corners were  so I decided to let the whole thing grow  and this is what I looked like by the end. As you can imagine  I spent a lot of time at airport security. My wife wouldn't kiss me for the last two months. So  certainly the challenge was there. The Bible says you cannot wear clothes made of mixed fibers  so I thought   Sounds strange  but I'll try it.  You only know if you try it. I got rid of all my poly cotton T shirts. The Bible says that if two men are in a fight  and the wife of one of those men grabs the testicles of the other man  then her hand shall be cut off. So  I wanted to follow that rule. That one I followed by default  by not getting in a fight with a man whose wife was standing nearby  looking like she had a strong grip. So    oh  there's another shot of my beard. I will say it was an amazing year because it really was life changing  and incredibly challenging. And there were two types of laws that were particularly challenging. The first was avoiding the little sins that we all commit every day. You know  I could spend a year not killing  but spending a year not gossiping  not coveting  not lying    you know  I live in New York  and I work as a journalist  so this was        percent of my day I had to do it. But it was really interesting  because I was able to make some progress  because I couldn't believe how much my behavior changed my thoughts. This was one of the huge lessons of the year  is that I almost pretended to be a better person  and I became a little bit of a better person. So I had always thought  you know   You change your mind  and you change your behavior   but it's often the other way around. You change your behavior  and you change your mind. So  you know  if you want to become more compassionate  you visit sick people in the hospital  and you will become more compassionate. You donate money to a cause  and you become emotionally involved in that cause. So  it really was cognitive psychology    you know  cognitive dissonance    that I was experiencing. The Bible actually talks about cognitive psychology  very primitive cognitive psychology. In the Proverbs  it says that if you smile  you will become happier  which  as we know  is actually true. The second type of rule that was difficult to obey was the rules that will get you into a little trouble in twenty first century America. And perhaps the clearest example of this is stoning adulterers. But it's a big part of the Bible  so I figured I had to address it. So  I was able to stone one adulterer. It happened    I was in the park  and I was dressed in my biblical clothing  so sandals and sort of a white robe  you know  because again  the outer affects the inner. I wanted to see how dressing biblically affected my mind. And this man came up to me and he said   Why are you dressed like that   And I explained my project  and he said   Well  I am an adulterer  are you going to stone me   And I said   Well  that would be great   And I actually took out a handful of stones from my pocket that I had been carrying around for weeks  hoping for just this interaction    and  you know  they were pebbles    but he grabbed them out of my hand. He was actually an elderly man  mid   s  just so you know. But he's still an adulterer  and still quite angry. He grabbed them out of my hand and threw them at my face  and I felt that I could    eye for an eye    I could retaliate  and throw one back at him. So that was my experience stoning  and it did allow me to talk about  in a more serious way  these big issues. How can the Bible be so barbaric in some places  and yet so incredibly wise in others  How should we view the Bible  Should we view it  you know  as original intent  like a sort of a Scalia version of the Bible  How was the Bible written  And actually  since this is a tech crowd  I talk in the book about how the Bible actually reminds me of the Wikipedia  because it has all of these authors and editors over hundreds of years. And it's sort of evolved. It's not a book that was written and came down from on high. So I thought I would end by telling you just a couple of the take aways  the bigger lessons that I learned from my year. The first is  thou shalt not take the Bible literally. This became very  very clear  early on. Because if you do  then you end up acting like a crazy person  and stoning adulterers  or    here's another example. Well  that's another. I did spend some time shepherding. It's a very relaxing vocation. I recommend it. But this one is    the Bible says that you cannot touch women during certain times of the month  and more than that  you cannot sit on a seat where a menstruating woman has sat. And my wife thought this was very offensive  so she sat in every seat in our apartment  and I had to spend much of the year standing until I bought my own seat and carried it around. So  you know  I met with creationists. I went to the creationists' museum. And these are the ultimate literalists. And it was fascinating  because they were not stupid people at all. I would wager that their IQ is exactly the same as the average evolutionist. It's just that their faith is so strong in this literal interpretation of the Bible that they distort all the data to fit their model. And they go through these amazing mental gymnastics to accomplish this. And I will say  though  the museum is gorgeous. They really did a fantastic job. If you're ever in Kentucky  there's  you can see a movie of the flood  and they have sprinklers in the ceiling that will sprinkle on you during the flood scenes. So  whatever you think of creationism    and I think it's crazy    they did a great job. Another lesson is that thou shalt give thanks. And this one was a big lesson because I was praying  giving these prayers of thanksgiving  which was odd for an agnostic. But I was saying thanks all the time  every day  and I started to change my perspective. And I started to realize the hundreds of little things that go right every day  that I didn't even notice  that I took for granted  as opposed to focusing on the three or four that went wrong. So  this is actually a key to happiness for me  is to just remember when I came over here  the car didn't flip over  and I didn't trip coming up the stairs. It's a remarkable thing. Third  that thou shall have reverence. This one was unexpected because I started the year as an agnostic  and by the end of the year  I became what a friend of mine calls a reverent agnostic  which I love. And I'm trying to start it as a movement. So  if anyone wants to join  the basic idea is  whether or not there is a God  there's something important and beautiful about the idea of sacredness  and that our rituals can be sacred. The Sabbath can be sacred. This was one of the great things about my year  doing the Sabbath  because I am a workaholic  so having this one day where you cannot work  it really  that changed my life. So  this idea of sacredness  whether or not there is a God. Thou shall not stereotype. This one happened because I spent a lot of time with various religious communities throughout America because I wanted it to be more than about my journey. I wanted it to be about religion in America. So  I spent time with evangelical Christians  and Hasidic Jews  and the Amish. I'm very proud because I think I'm the only person in America to out Bible talk a Jehovah's Witness. After three and a half hours  he looked at his watch  he's like   I gotta go.  Oh  thank you very much. Thank you. Bless you  bless you. But it was interesting because I had some very preconceived notions about  for instance  evangelical Christianity  and I found that it's such a wide and varied movement that it is difficult to make generalizations about it. There's a group I met with called the Red Letter Christians  and they focus on the red words in the Bible  which are the ones that Jesus spoke. That's how they printed them in the old Bibles. And their argument is that Jesus never talked about homosexuality. They have a pamphlet that says   Here's what Jesus said about homosexuality   and you open it up  and there's nothing in it. So  they say Jesus did talk a lot about helping the outcasts  helping poor people. So  this was very inspiring to me. I recommend Jim Wallis and Tony Campolo. They're very inspiring leaders  even though I disagree with much of what they say. Also  thou shalt not disregard the irrational. This one was very unexpected because  you know  I grew up with the scientific worldview  and I was shocked learning how much of my life is governed by irrational forces. And the thing is  if they're not harmful  they're not to be completely dismissed. Because I learned that    I was thinking  I was doing all these rituals  these biblical rituals  separating my wool and linen  and I would ask these religious people  Why would the Bible possibly tell us to do this  Why would God care   And they said   We don't know  but it's just rituals that give us meaning.  And I would say   But that's crazy.  And they would say   Well  what about you  You blow out candles on top of a birthday cake. If a guy from Mars came down and saw  here's one guy blowing out the fire on top of a cake versus another guy not wearing clothes of mixed fabrics  would the Martians say  'Well  that guy  he makes sense  but that guy's crazy '  So no  I think that rituals are  by nature  irrational. So the key is to choose the right rituals  the ones that are not harmful    but rituals by themselves are not to be dismissed. And finally I learned that thou shall pick and choose. And this one I learned because I tried to follow everything in the Bible. And I failed miserably. Because you can't. You have to pick and choose. And anyone who follows the Bible is going to be picking and choosing. The key is to pick and choose the right parts. There's the phrase called cafeteria religion  and the fundamentalists will use it in a denigrating way  and they'll say   Oh  it's just cafeteria religion. You're just picking and choosing.  But my argument is   What's wrong with cafeterias   I've had some great meals at cafeterias. I've also had some meals that make me want to dry heave. So  it's about choosing the parts of the Bible about compassion  about tolerance  about loving your neighbor  as opposed to the parts about homosexuality is a sin  or intolerance  or violence  which are very much in the Bible as well. So if we are to find any meaning in this book  then we have to really engage it  and wrestle with it. And I thought I'd end with just a couple more. There's me reading the Bible. That's how I hailed taxicabs. Seriously  and it worked. And yes  that was actually a rented sheep  so I had to return that in the morning  but it served well for a day. So  anyway  thank you so much for letting me speak. Brain magic. What's brain magic all about  Brain magic to me indicates that area of magic dealing with psychological and mind reading effects. So unlike traditional magic  it uses the power of words  linguistic deception  non verbal communication and various other techniques to create the illusion of a sixth sense. I'm going to show you all how easy it is to manipulate the human mind once you know how. I want everybody downstairs also to join in with me and everybody. I want everybody to put out your hands like this for me  first of all. OK  clap them together  once. OK  reverse your hands. Now  follow my actions exactly. Now about half the audience has their left hand up. Why is that  OK  swap them around  put your right hand up. Cross your hands over  so your right hand goes over  interlace your fingers like this  then make sure your right thumb is outside your left thumb    that's very important. Yours is the other way around  so swap it around. Excellent  OK. Extend your fingers like this for me. All right. Tap them together once. OK  now  if you did not allow me to deceive your minds  you would all be able to do this. Now you can see how easy it is for me to manipulate the human mind  once you know how. Now  I remember when I was about     I read a copy of Life magazine  which detailed a story about a    year old blind Russian woman who could sense printed letters    there's still people trying to do it       who could sense printed letters and even sense colors  just by touch. And she was completely blind. She could also read the serial numbers on bills when they were placed  face down  on a hard surface. Now  I was fascinated  but at the same time  skeptical. How could somebody read using their fingertips  You know  if you actually think about it  if somebody is totally blind    a guy yesterday did a demonstration in one of the rooms  where people had to close their eyes and they could just hear things. And it's just a really weird thing to try and figure out. How could somebody read using their fingertips  Now earlier on  as part of a TV show that I have coming up on MTV  I attempted to give a similar demonstration of what is now known as second sight. So  let's take a look. I'm going to guide you into the car. Kathryn Thomas   Laughter  Man  You're OK  keep on going. KT  How are you  Keith Barry  Kathryn  it's Keith here. I'm going to take you to a secret location  OK  Kathryn  there was no way you could see through that blindfold. KT  OK  but don't say my name like that. KB  But you're OK  KT  Yes. KB  No way to see through it  KT  No. KB  I'll take it off. Do you want to take the rest off  Take it off  you're OK. We'll stop for a second. KT  I'm so afraid of what I'm going to see. KB  You're fine  take it off. You're OK. You're safe. Have you ever heard of second sight  KT  No. KB  Second sight is whereby a mind control expert can see through somebody else's eyes. And I'm going to try that right now. KT  God. KB  Are you ready  Where is it  There's no way    KT   Beep  KT  Oh  my God  KB  Don't say anything  I'm trying to see through your eyes. I can't see. KT  There's a wall  there's a wall. KB  Look at the road  look at the road. KT  OK  OK  OK. Oh  my God  KB  Now  anything coming at all  KT  No. KB  Sure there's not  KT  No  no  I'm just still looking at the road. I'm looking at the road  all the time. I'm not taking my eyes off the road. KT  Oh  my God  KB  Where are we  Where are we  We're going uphill  are we going uphill  KT  Look at the road     Beep  Still got that goddamn blindfold on. KB  What  KT  How are you doing this  KB  Just don't break my concentration. We're OK  though  KT  Yes. That's so weird. We're nearly there. Oh  my God  Oh  my God  KB  And I've stopped. KT  That is weird. You're like a freak ass of nature. That was the most scary thing I've ever done in my life  KB  Thank you. By the way  two days ago  we were going to film this down there  at the race course  and we got a guy into a car  and we got a camera man in the back  but halfway through the drive  he told me he had  I think it was a nine millimeter  stuck to his leg. So  I stopped pretty quick  and that was it. So  do you believe it's possible to see through somebody else's eyes  That's the question. Now  most people here would automatically say no. OK  but I want you to realize some facts. I couldn't see through the blindfold. The car was not gimmicked or tricked in any way. The girl  I'd never met before  all right. So  I want you to just think about it for a moment. A lot of people try to come up with a logical solution to what just happened  all right. But because your brains are not trained in the art of deception  the solutions you come up with will     percent of the time  be way off the mark. This is because magic is all about directing attention. If  for instance  I didn't want you to look at my right hand  then I don't look at it. But if I wanted you to look at my right hand  then I look at it  too. You see  it's very simple  once you know how  but very complicated in other ways. I'm going to give you some demonstrations right now. I need two people to help me out real quick. Can you come up  And let's see  down at the end  here  can you also come up  real quick  Do you mind  Yes  at the end. OK  give them a round of applause as they come up. You might want to use the stairs  there. It's very important for everybody here to realize I haven't set anything up with you. You don't know what will happen  right  Would you mind just standing over here for a moment  Your name is  Nicole  Nicole. KB  Nicole  and  KB  Actually  here's the thing  answer it  answer it  answer it. Is it a girl  Man  They've already gone. KB  OK  swap over positions. Can you stand over here  This will make it easier. Pity  I would have told them it was the ace of spades. OK  a little bit closer. OK  a little bit closer  come over    they look really nervous up here. Do you believe in witchcraft  Nicole  No. KB  Voodoo  Nicole  No. KB  Things that go bump in the night  Nicole  No. KB  Besides  who's next  no  OK. I want you to just stand exactly like this for me  pull up your sleeves  if you don't mind. OK  now  I want you to be aware of all the different sensations around you  because we'll try a voodoo experiment. I want you to be aware of the sensations  but don't say anything until I ask you  and don't open your eyes until I ask you. From this point onwards  close your eyes  do not say anything  do not open them  be aware of the sensations. Yes or no  did you feel anything  Nicole  Yes. KB  You did feel that  What did you feel  Nicole  A touch on my back. KB  How many times did you feel it  Nicole  Twice. KB  Twice. OK  extend your left arm out in front of you. Extend your left arm  OK. OK  keep it there. Be aware of the sensations  don't say anything  don't open your eyes  OK. Did you feel anything  there  Nicole  Yes. KB  What did you feel  Nicole  Three    KB  Like a tickling sensation  Nicole  Yes. KB  Can you show us where  OK  excellent. Open your eyes. I never touched you. I just touched his back  and I just touched his arm. A voodoo experiment. Yeah  I walk around nightclubs all night like this. You just take a seat over here for a second. I'm going to use you again  in a moment. Can you take a seat right over here  if you don't mind. Sit right here. Man  OK. KB  OK  take a seat. Excellent  OK. Now  what I want you to do is look directly at me  OK  just take a deep breath in through your nose  letting it out through your mouth  and relax. Allow your eyes to close  on five  four  three  two  one. Close your eyes right now. OK  now  I'm not hypnotizing you  I'm merely placing you in a heightened state of synchronicity  so our minds are along the same lines. And as you sink and drift and float into this relaxed state of mind  I'm going to take your left hand  and just place it up here. I want you to hold it there just for a moment  and I only want you to allow your hand to sink and drift and float back to the tabletop at the same rate and speed as you drift and float into this relaxed state of awareness  and allow it to go all the way down to the tabletop. That's it  all the way down  all the way down. and further  and further. Excellent. I want you to allow your hand to stick firmly to the tabletop. OK  now  allow it to stay there. OK  now  in a moment  you'll feel a certain pressure  OK  and I want you to be aware of the pressure. Just be aware of the pressure. And I only want you to allow your hand to float slowly back up from the tabletop as you feel the pressure release  but only when you feel the pressure release. Do you understand  Just answer yes or no. Man  Yes. KB  Hold it right there. And only when you feel the pressure go back  allow your hand to drift back to the tabletop  but only when you feel the pressure. OK  that was wonderfully done. Let's try it again. Excellent. Now that you've got the idea  let's try something even more interesting. Allow it to stick firmly to the tabletop  keep your eyes closed. Can you stand up  Just stand  stage forward. I want you to point directly at his forehead. OK. Imagine a connection between you and him. Only when you want the pressure to be released  make an upward gesture  like this  but only when you want it to be released. You can wait as long as you want  but only when you want the pressure released. OK  let's try it again. OK  now  imagine the connection  OK. Point directly at his forehead. Only when you want the pressure released  we'll try it again. OK  it worked that time  excellent. And hold it there  both of you. Only when you want the pressure to go back  make a downward gesture. You can wait as long as you want. You did it pretty quickly  but it went down  OK. Now  I want you to be aware that in a moment  when I snap my fingers  your eyes will open  again. It's OK to remember to forget  or forget to remember what happened. Most people ask you   What the hell just happened up here   But it's OK that even though you're not hypnotized  you will forget everything that happened. On five  four  three  two  one    open your eyes  wide awake. Give them a round of applause  as they go back to their seats. OK  you can go back. I once saw a film called  The Gods Are Crazy.  Has anybody here seen that film  Yeah. Remember when they threw the Coke out of the airplane  and it landed on the ground  and it didn't break  Now  see  that's because Coke bottles are solid. It's nearly impossible to break a Coke bottle. Do you want to try it  Good job. She's not taking any chances. You see  psychokinesis is the paranormal influence of the mind on physical events and processes. For some magicians or mentalists  sometimes the spoon will bend or melt  sometimes it will not. Sometimes the object will slide across the table  sometimes it will not. It depends on how much energy you have that day  so on and so forth. We're going to try an experiment in psychokinesis  right now. Come right over here  next to me. Excellent. Now  have a look at the Coke bottle. Make sure it is solid  there's only one hole  and it's a normal Coke bottle. And you can whack it against the table  if you want  be careful. Even though it's solid  I'm standing away. I want you to pinch right here with two fingers and your thumb. Excellent. Now  I've got a shard of glass here  OK. I want you to examine the shard of glass. Careful  it's sharp. Just hold on to it for a moment. Now  hold it out here. I want you to imagine  right now  a broken relationship from many years ago. I want you to imagine all the negative energy from that broken relationship  from that guy  being imparted into the broken piece of glass  which will represent him  OK. But I want you to take this very seriously. Stare at the glass  ignore everybody right here. In a moment  you'll feel a certain sensation  OK  and when you feel that sensation  I want you to drop the piece of glass into the bottle. Think of that guy  that ba    that guy. I'm trying to be good here. OK  and when you feel the sensation    it might take a while    drop it into the glass. OK  drop it in. Now  imagine all that negative energy in there. Imagine his name and imagine him inside the glass. And I want you to release that negative energy by shaking it from side to side. That was a lot of negative energy  built up in there. I also want you to look at me and think of his name. OK  think of how many letters in the title of his name. There's five letters in the title. You didn't react to that  so it's four letters. Think of one of the letters in the title. There's a K in his name  there is a K. I knew that because my name starts with a K also  but his name doesn't start with a K  it starts with an M. Tell Mike I said hello  the next time you see him. Was that his name  Nicole  Mm hmm. KB  OK  give her a round of applause. Thank you. I've got one more thing to share with you right now. Actually  Chris  I was going to pick you for this  but instead of picking you  can you hop up here and pick a victim for this next experiment  And it should be a male victim  that's the only thing. Chris Anderson  Oh  OK. KB  I was going to use you  but I decided I might want to come back another year. CA  Well  to reward him for saying  eureka   and for selecting Michael Mercil to come and talk to us    Steve Jurvetson. KB  OK  Steve  come on up here. CA  You knew  KB  OK  Steve  I want you to take a seat  right behind here. Excellent. Now  Steve    oh  you can check underneath. Go ahead  I've no fancy assistants underneath there. They insist that because I was a magician  put a nice  black tablecloth on. There you are  OK. I've got four wooden plinths here  Steve. One  two  three and four. Now  they're all the exact same except this one obviously has a stainless steel spike sticking out of it. I want you to examine it  and make sure it's solid. Happy  Steve Jurvetson  Mmm  yes. KB  OK. Now  Steve  I'm going to stand in front of the table  When I stand in front of the table  I want you to put the cups on the plinths  in any order you want  and then mix them all up  so nobody has any idea where the spike is  all right  SJ  No one in the audience  KB  Yes  and just to help you out  I'll block them from view  so nobody can see what you're doing. I'll also look away. So  go ahead and mix them up  now. OK  and tell me when you're done. KB  You done  SJ  Almost. KB  Almost  oh. OK  you're making sure that's well hidden. Oh  we've got one here  we've got one here. So  all right  we'll leave them like that. I'm going to have the last laugh  though. Now  Steve  you know where the spike is  but nobody else  does  Correct  But I don't want you to know either  so swivel around on your chair. They'll keep an eye on me to make sure I don't do anything funny. No  stay around  OK. Now  Steve  look back. Now you don't know where the spike is  and I don't know where it is either. Now  is there any way to see through this blindfold  SJ  Put this on  KB  No  just  is there any way to see through it  No  SJ  No  I can't see through it. KB  Excellent. Now  I'm going to put on the blindfold. Don't stack them up  OK. Give them an extra mix up. Don't move the cups  I don't want anybody to see where the spike is  but give the plinths an extra mix up  and then line them up. I'll put the blindfold on. Give them an extra mix up. No messing around this time. OK  go ahead  mix them up. My hand is at risk here. Tell me when you're done. SJ  Done. KB  OK  where are you  Put out your hand. Your right hand. Tell me when I'm over a cup. SJ  You're over a cup. KB  I'm over a cup  right now  SJ  Mm hmm. KB  Now  Steve  do you think it's here  Yes or no  SJ  Oh  KB  I told you I'd have the last laugh. SJ  I don't think it's there. KB  No  Good decision. Now  if I go this way  is there another cup over here  SJ  Can we do the left hand  KB  Oh  no  no  no. He asked me could he do the left hand. Absolutely not. KB  If I go this way  is there another cup  SJ  Yes. KB  Tell me when to stop. SJ  OK. KB  There  SJ  Yes  there's one. KB  OK. Do you think it's here  yes or no  This is your decision  not mine. SJ  I'm going to say no. KB  Good decision. OK  give me both hands. Now  put them on both cups. Do you think the spike is under your left or your right hand  SJ  Neither. KB  Neither  oh  OK. But if you were to guess. SJ  Under my right hand. KB  Under your right hand  Now  remember  you made all the decisions all along. Psychologists  figure this out. Have a look. SJ  Oh  KB  Thank you. If anybody wants to see some sleight of hand later on  I'll be outside. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. When I was president of the American Psychological Association  they tried to media train me  and an encounter I had with CNN summarizes what I'm going to be talking about today  which is the eleventh reason to be optimistic. The editor of Discover told us    of them  I'm going to give you the eleventh. So they came to me    CNN    and they said   Professor Seligman  would you tell us about the state of psychology today  We'd like to interview you about that.  And I said   Great.  And she said   But this is CNN  so you only get a sound bite.  So I said   Well  how many words do I get   And she said   Well  one.  And cameras rolled  and she said   Professor Seligman  what is the state of psychology today    Good.   Cut. Cut. That won't do. We'd really better give you a longer sound bite.   Well  how many words do I get this time    I think  well  you get two. Doctor Seligman  what is the state of psychology today    Not good.   Look  Doctor Seligman  we can see you're really not comfortable in this medium. We'd better give you a real sound bite. This time you can have three words. Professor Seligman  what is the state of psychology today    Not good enough.  And that's what I'm going to be talking about. I want to say why psychology was good  why it was not good and how it may become  in the next    years  good enough. And by parallel summary  I want to say the same thing about technology  about entertainment and design  because I think the issues are very similar. So  why was psychology good  Well  for more than    years  psychology worked within the disease model. Ten years ago  when I was on an airplane and I introduced myself to my seatmate  and told them what I did  they'd move away from me. And because  quite rightly  they were saying psychology is about finding what's wrong with you. Spot the loony. And now  when I tell people what I do  they move toward me. And what was good about psychology  about the    billion dollar investment NIMH made  about working in the disease model  about what you mean by psychology  is that     years ago  none of the disorders were treatable    it was entirely smoke and mirrors. And now     of the disorders are treatable  two of them actually curable. And the other thing that happened is that a science developed  a science of mental illness. That we found out that we could take fuzzy concepts    like depression  alcoholism    and measure them with rigor. That we could create a classification of the mental illnesses. That we could understand the causality of the mental illnesses. We could look across time at the same people    people  for example  who were genetically vulnerable to schizophrenia    and ask what the contribution of mothering  of genetics are  and we could isolate third variables by doing experiments on the mental illnesses. And best of all  we were able  in the last    years  to invent drug treatments and psychological treatments. And then we were able to test them rigorously  in random assignment  placebo controlled designs  throw out the things that didn't work  keep the things that actively did. And the conclusion of that is that psychology and psychiatry  over the last    years  can actually claim that we can make miserable people less miserable. And I think that's terrific. I'm proud of it. But what was not good  the consequences of that were three things. The first was moral  that psychologists and psychiatrists became victimologists  pathologizers  that our view of human nature was that if you were in trouble  bricks fell on you. And we forgot that people made choices and decisions. We forgot responsibility. That was the first cost. The second cost was that we forgot about you people. We forgot about improving normal lives. We forgot about a mission to make relatively untroubled people happier  more fulfilled  more productive. And  genius    high talent   became a dirty word. No one works on that. And the third problem about the disease model is  in our rush to do something about people in trouble  in our rush to do something about repairing damage  it never occurred to us to develop interventions to make people happier  positive interventions. So that was not good. And so  that's what led people like Nancy Etcoff  Dan Gilbert  Mike Csikszentmihalyi and myself to work in something I call positive psychology  which has three aims. The first is that psychology should be just as concerned with human strength as it is with weakness. It should be just as concerned with building strength as with repairing damage. It should be interested in the best things in life. And it should be just as concerned with making the lives of normal people fulfilling  and with genius  with nurturing high talent. So in the last    years and the hope for the future  we've seen the beginnings of a science of positive psychology  a science of what makes life worth living. It turns out that we can measure different forms of happiness. And any of you  for free  can go to that website and take the entire panoply of tests of happiness. You can ask  how do you stack up for positive emotion  for meaning  for flow  against literally tens of thousands of other people  We created the opposite of the diagnostic manual of the insanities  a classification of the strengths and virtues that looks at the sex ratio  how they're defined  how to diagnose them  what builds them and what gets in their way. We found that we could discover the causation of the positive states  the relationship between left hemispheric activity and right hemispheric activity as a cause of happiness. I've spent my life working on extremely miserable people  and I've asked the question  how do extremely miserable people differ from the rest of you  And starting about six years ago  we asked about extremely happy people. And how do they differ from the rest of us  And it turns out there's one way. They're not more religious  they're not in better shape  they don't have more money  they're not better looking  they don't have more good events and fewer bad events. The one way in which they differ  they're extremely social. They don't sit in seminars on Saturday morning. They don't spend time alone. Each of them is in a romantic relationship and each has a rich repertoire of friends. But watch out here. This is merely correlational data  not causal  and it's about happiness in the first Hollywood sense I'm going to talk about  happiness of ebullience and giggling and good cheer. And I'm going to suggest to you that's not nearly enough  in just a moment. We found we could begin to look at interventions over the centuries  from the Buddha to Tony Robbins. About     interventions have been proposed that allegedly make people happy. And we find that we've been able to manualize many of them  and we actually carry out random assignment efficacy and effectiveness studies. That is  which ones actually make people lastingly happier  In a couple of minutes  I'll tell you about some of those results. But the upshot of this is that the mission I want psychology to have  in addition to its mission of curing the mentally ill  and in addition to its mission of making miserable people less miserable  is can psychology actually make people happier  And to ask that question    happy is not a word I use very much    we've had to break it down into what I think is askable about happy. And I believe there are three different    and I call them different because different interventions build them  it's possible to have one rather than the other    three different happy lives. The first happy life is the pleasant life. This is a life in which you have as much positive emotion as you possibly can  and the skills to amplify it. The second is a life of engagement    a life in your work  your parenting  your love  your leisure  time stops for you. That's what Aristotle was talking about. And third  the meaningful life. So I want to say a little bit about each of those lives and what we know about them. The first life is the pleasant life and it's simply  as best we can find it  it's having as many of the pleasures as you can  as much positive emotion as you can  and learning the skills    savoring  mindfulness    that amplify them  that stretch them over time and space. But the pleasant life has three drawbacks  and it's why positive psychology is not happy ology and why it doesn't end here. The first drawback is that it turns out the pleasant life  your experience of positive emotion  is heritable  about    percent heritable  and  in fact  not very modifiable. So the different tricks that Matthieu  Ricard  and I and others know about increasing the amount of positive emotion in your life are    to    percent tricks  getting more of it. Second is that positive emotion habituates. It habituates rapidly  indeed. It's all like French vanilla ice cream  the first taste is a     percent  by the time you're down to the sixth taste  it's gone. And  as I said  it's not particularly malleable. And this leads to the second life. And I have to tell you about my friend  Len  to talk about why positive psychology is more than positive emotion  more than building pleasure. In two of the three great arenas of life  by the time Len was     Len was enormously successful. The first arena was work. By the time he was     he was an options trader. By the time he was     he was a multimillionaire and the head of an options trading company. Second  in play    he's a national champion bridge player. But in the third great arena of life  love  Len is an abysmal failure. And the reason he was  was that Len is a cold fish. Len is an introvert. American women said to Len  when he dated them   You're no fun. You don't have positive emotion. Get lost.  And Len was wealthy enough to be able to afford a Park Avenue psychoanalyst  who for five years tried to find the sexual trauma that had somehow locked positive emotion inside of him. But it turned out there wasn't any sexual trauma. It turned out that    Len grew up in Long Island and he played football and watched football  and played bridge    Len is in the bottom five percent of what we call positive affectivities. The question is  is Len unhappy  And I want to say not. Contrary to what psychology told us about the bottom    percent of the human race in positive affectivity  I think Len is one of the happiest people I know. He's not consigned to the hell of unhappiness and that's because Len  like most of you  is enormously capable of flow. When he walks onto the floor of the American Exchange at      in the morning  time stops for him. And it stops till the closing bell. When the first card is played  until    days later  the tournament is over  time stops for Len. And this is indeed what Mike Csikszentmihalyi has been talking about  about flow. And it's distinct from pleasure in a very important way. Pleasure has raw feels  you know it's happening. It's thought and feeling. But what Mike told you yesterday    during flow  you can't feel anything. You're one with the music. Time stops. You have intense concentration. And this is indeed the characteristic of what we think of as the good life. And we think there's a recipe for it  and it's knowing what your highest strengths are. And again  there's a valid test of what your five highest strengths are. And then re crafting your life to use them as much as you possibly can. Re crafting your work  your love  your play  your friendship  your parenting. Just one example. One person I worked with was a bagger at Genuardi's. Hated the job. She's working her way through college. Her highest strength was social intelligence  so she re crafted bagging to make the encounter with her the social highlight of every customer's day. Now obviously she failed. But what she did was to take her highest strengths  and re craft work to use them as much as possible. What you get out of that is not smiley ness. You don't look like Debbie Reynolds. You don't giggle a lot. What you get is more absorption. So  that's the second path. The first path  positive emotion. The second path is eudaimonian flow. And the third path is meaning. This is the most venerable of the happinesses  traditionally. And meaning  in this view  consists of    very parallel to eudaimonia    it consists of knowing what your highest strengths are  and using them to belong to and in the service of something larger than you are. I mentioned that for all three kinds of lives  the pleasant life  the good life  the meaningful life  people are now hard at work on the question  are there things that lastingly change those lives  And the answer seems to be yes. And I'll just give you some samples of it. It's being done in a rigorous manner. It's being done in the same way that we test drugs to see what really works. So we do random assignment  placebo controlled  long term studies of different interventions. And just to sample the kind of interventions that we find have an effect  when we teach people about the pleasant life  how to have more pleasure in your life  one of your assignments is to take the mindfulness skills  the savoring skills  and you're assigned to design a beautiful day. Next Saturday  set a day aside  design yourself a beautiful day  and use savoring and mindfulness to enhance those pleasures. And we can show in that way that the pleasant life is enhanced. Gratitude visit. I want you all to do this with me now  if you would. Close your eyes. I'd like you to remember someone who did something enormously important that changed your life in a good direction  and who you never properly thanked. The person has to be alive. OK. Now  OK  you can open your eyes. I hope all of you have such a person. Your assignment  when you're learning the gratitude visit  is to write a     word testimonial to that person  call them on the phone in Phoenix  ask if you can visit  don't tell them why  show up at their door  you read the testimonial    everyone weeps when this happens. And what happens is when we test people one week later  a month later  three months later  they're both happier and less depressed. Another example is a strength date  in which we get couples to identify their highest strengths on the strengths test  and then to design an evening in which they both use their strengths  and we find this is a strengthener of relationships. And fun versus philanthropy. But it's so heartening to be in a group like this  in which so many of you have turned your lives to philanthropy. Well  my undergraduates and the people I work with haven't discovered this  so we actually have people do something altruistic and do something fun  and to contrast it. And what you find is when you do something fun  it has a square wave walk set. When you do something philanthropic to help another person  it lasts and it lasts. So those are examples of positive interventions. So  the next to last thing I want to say is we're interested in how much life satisfaction people have. And this is really what you're about. And that's our target variable. And we ask the question as a function of the three different lives  how much life satisfaction do you get  So we ask    and we've done this in    replications involving thousands of people    to what extent does the pursuit of pleasure  the pursuit of positive emotion  the pleasant life  the pursuit of engagement  time stopping for you  and the pursuit of meaning contribute to life satisfaction  And our results surprised us  but they were backward of what we thought. It turns out the pursuit of pleasure has almost no contribution to life satisfaction. The pursuit of meaning is the strongest. The pursuit of engagement is also very strong. Where pleasure matters is if you have both engagement and you have meaning  then pleasure's the whipped cream and the cherry. Which is to say  the full life    the sum is greater than the parts  if you've got all three. Conversely  if you have none of the three  the empty life  the sum is less than the parts. And what we're asking now is does the very same relationship  physical health  morbidity  how long you live and productivity  follow the same relationship  That is  in a corporation  is productivity a function of positive emotion  engagement and meaning  Is health a function of positive engagement  of pleasure  and of meaning in life  And there is reason to think the answer to both of those may well be yes. So  Chris said that the last speaker had a chance to try to integrate what he heard  and so this was amazing for me. I've never been in a gathering like this. I've never seen speakers stretch beyond themselves so much  which was one of the remarkable things. But I found that the problems of psychology seemed to be parallel to the problems of technology  entertainment and design in the following way. We all know that technology  entertainment and design have been and can be used for destructive purposes. We also know that technology  entertainment and design can be used to relieve misery. And by the way  the distinction between relieving misery and building happiness is extremely important. I thought  when I first became a therapist    years ago  that if I was good enough to make someone not depressed  not anxious  not angry  that I'd make them happy. And I never found that. I found the best you could ever do was to get to zero. But they were empty. And it turns out the skills of happiness  the skills of the pleasant life  the skills of engagement  the skills of meaning  are different from the skills of relieving misery. And so  the parallel thing holds with technology  entertainment and design  I believe. That is  it is possible for these three drivers of our world to increase happiness  to increase positive emotion  and that's typically how they've been used. But once you fractionate happiness the way I do    not just positive emotion  that's not nearly enough    there's flow in life  and there's meaning in life. As Laura Lee told us  design  and  I believe  entertainment and technology  can be used to increase meaning engagement in life as well. So in conclusion  the eleventh reason for optimism  in addition to the space elevator  is that I think with technology  entertainment and design  we can actually increase the amount of tonnage of human happiness on the planet. And if technology can  in the next decade or two  increase the pleasant life  the good life and the meaningful life  it will be good enough. If entertainment can be diverted to also increase positive emotion  meaning  eudaimonia  it will be good enough. And if design can increase positive emotion  eudaimonia  and flow and meaning  what we're all doing together will become good enough. Thank you. My search is always to find ways to chronicle  to share and to document stories about people  just everyday people. Stories that offer transformation  that lean into transcendence  but that are never sentimental  that never look away from the darkest things about us. Because I really believe that we're never more beautiful than when we're most ugly. Because that's really the moment we really know what we're made of. As Chris said  I grew up in Nigeria with a whole generation    in the '  s    of students who were protesting a military dictatorship  which has finally ended. So it wasn't just me  there was a whole generation of us. But what I've come to learn is that the world is never saved in grand messianic gestures  but in the simple accumulation of gentle  soft  almost invisible acts of compassion  everyday acts of compassion. In South Africa  they have a phrase called Ubuntu. Ubuntu comes out of a philosophy that says  the only way for me to be human is for you to reflect my humanity back at me. But if you're like me  my humanity is more like a window. I don't really see it  I don't pay attention to it until there's  you know  like a bug that's dead on the window. Then suddenly I see it  and usually  it's never good. It's usually when I'm cussing in traffic at someone who is trying to drive their car and drink coffee and send emails and make notes. So what Ubuntu really says is that there is no way for us to be human without other people. It's really very simple  but really very complicated. So  I thought I should start with some stories. I should tell you some stories about remarkable people  so I thought I'd start with my mother. And she was dark  too. My mother was English. My parents met in Oxford in the '  s  and my mother moved to Nigeria and lived there. She was five foot two  very feisty and very English. This is how English my mother is    or was  she just passed. She came out to California  to Los Angeles  to visit me  and we went to Malibu  which she thought was very disappointing. And then we went to a fish restaurant  and we had Chad  the surfer dude  serving us  and he came up and my mother said   Do you have any specials  young man   And Chad says   Sure  like  we have this  like  salmon  that's  like  rolled in this  like  wasabi  like  crust. It's totally rad.  And my mother turned to me and said   What language is he speaking   I said   English  mum.  And she shook her head and said   Oh  these Americans. We gave them a language  why don't they use it   So  this woman  who converted from the Church of England to Catholicism when she married my father    and there's no one more rabid than a Catholic convert    decided to teach in the rural areas in Nigeria  particularly among Igbo women  the Billings ovulation method  which was the only approved birth control by the Catholic Church. But her Igbo wasn't too good. So she took me along to translate. I was seven. So  here are these women  who never discuss their period with their husbands  and here I am telling them   Well  how often do you get your period   And   Do you notice any discharges   And   How swollen is your vulva   She never would have thought of herself as a feminist  my mother  but she always used to say   Anything a man can do  I can fix.  And when my father complained about this situation  where she's taking a seven year old boy to teach this birth control  you know  he used to say   Oh  you're turning him into    you're teaching him how to be a woman.  My mother said   Someone has to.  This woman    during the Biafran war  we were caught in the war. It was my mother with five little children. It takes her one year  through refugee camp after refugee camp  to make her way to an airstrip where we can fly out of the country. At every single refugee camp  she has to face off soldiers who want to take my elder brother Mark  who was nine  and make him a boy soldier. Can you imagine this five foot two woman  standing up to men with guns who want to kill us  All through that one year  my mother never cried one time  not once. But when we were in Lisbon  in the airport  about to fly to England  this woman saw my mother wearing this dress  which had been washed so many times it was basically see through  with five really hungry looking kids  came over and asked her what had happened. And she told this woman. And so this woman emptied out her suitcase and gave all of her clothes to my mother  and to us  and the toys of her kids  who didn't like that very much  but    that was the only time she cried. And I remember years later  I was writing about my mother  and I asked her   Why did you cry then   And she said   You know  you can steel your heart against any kind of trouble  any kind of horror. But the simple act of kindness from a complete stranger will unstitch you.  The old women in my father's village  after this war had happened  memorized the names of every dead person  and they would sing these dirges  made up of these names. Dirges so melancholic that they would scorch you. And they would sing them only when they planted the rice  as though they were seeding the hearts of the dead into the rice. But when it came for harvest time  they would sing these joyful songs  that were made up of the names of every child who had been born that year. And then the next planting season  when they sang the dirge  they would remove as many names of the dead that equaled as many people that were born. And in this way  these women enacted a lot of transformation  beautiful transformation. Did you know  that before the genocide in Rwanda  the word for rape and the word for marriage was the same one  But today  women are rebuilding Rwanda. Did you also know that after apartheid  when the new government went into the parliament houses  there were no female toilets in the building  Which would seem to suggest that apartheid was entirely the business of men. All of this to say  that despite the horror  and despite the death  women are never really counted. Their humanity never seems to matter very much to us. When I was growing up in Nigeria    and I shouldn't say Nigeria  because that's too general  but in Afikpo  the Igbo part of the country where I'm from    there were always rites of passage for young men. Men were taught to be men in the ways in which we are not women  that's essentially what it is. And a lot of rituals involved killing  killing little animals  progressing along  so when I turned       and  I mean  it made sense  it was an agrarian community  somebody had to kill the animals  there was no Whole Foods you could go and get kangaroo steak at    so when I turned     it was my turn now to kill a goat. And I was this weird  sensitive kid  who couldn't really do it  but I had to do it. And I was supposed to do this alone. But a friend of mine  called Emmanuel  who was significantly older than me  who'd been a boy soldier during the Biafran war  decided to come with me. Which sort of made me feel good  because he'd seen a lot of things. Now  when I was growing up  he used to tell me stories about how he used to bayonet people  and their intestines would fall out  but they would keep running. So  this guy comes with me. And I don't know if you've ever heard a goat  or seen one    they sound like human beings  that's why we call tragedies  a song of a goat.  My friend Brad Kessler says that we didn't become human until we started keeping goats. Anyway  a goat's eyes are like a child's eyes. So when I tried to kill this goat and I couldn't  Emmanuel bent down  he puts his hand over the mouth of the goat  covers its eyes  so I don't have to look into them  while I kill the goat. It didn't seem like a lot  for this guy who'd seen so much  and to whom the killing of a goat must have seemed such a quotidian experience  still found it in himself to try to protect me. I was a wimp. I cried for a very long time. And afterwards  he didn't say a word. He just sat there watching me cry for an hour. And then afterwards he said to me   It will always be difficult  but if you cry like this every time  you will die of heartbreak. Just know that it is enough sometimes to know that it is difficult.  Of course  talking about goats makes me think of sheep  and not in good ways. So  I was born two days after Christmas. So growing up  you know  I had a cake and everything  but I never got any presents  because  born two days after Christmas. So  I was about nine  and my uncle had just come back from Germany  and we had the Catholic priest over  my mother was entertaining him with tea. And my uncle suddenly says   Where are Chris' presents   And my mother said   Don't talk about that in front of guests.  But he was desperate to show that he'd just come back  so he summoned me up  and he said   Go into the bedroom  my bedroom. Take anything you want out of the suitcase. It's your birthday present.  I'm sure he thought I'd take a book or a shirt  but I found an inflatable sheep. So  I blew it up and ran into the living room  my finger where it shouldn't have been  I was waving this buzzing sheep around  and my mother looked like she was going to die of shock. And Father McGetrick was completely unflustered  just stirred his tea and looked at my mother and said   It's all right Daphne  I'm Scottish.  My last days in prison  the last    months  my cellmate    for the last year  the first year of the last    months    my cellmate was    years old. The name was John James  and in those days  if a family member committed a crime  the military would hold you as ransom till your family turned themselves in. So  here was this    year old kid on death row. And not everybody on death row was a political prisoner. There were some really bad people there. And he had smuggled in two comics  two comic books     Spiderman  and  X Men.  He was obsessed. And when he got tired of reading them  he started to teach the men in death row how to read  with these comic books. And so  I remember night after night  you'd hear all these men  these really hardened criminals  huddled around John James  reciting   Take that  Spidey   It's incredible. I was really worried. He didn't know what death row meant. I'd been there twice  and I was terribly afraid that I was going to die. And he would always laugh  and say   Come on  man  we'll make it out.  Then I'd say   How do you know   And he said   Oh  I heard it on the grapevine.  They killed him. They handcuffed him to a chair  and they tacked his penis to a table with a six inch nail  then left him there to bleed to death. That's how I ended up in solitary  because I let my feelings be known. All around us  everywhere  there are people like this. The Igbo used to say that they built their own gods. They would come together as a community  and they would express a wish. And their wish would then be brought to a priest  who would find a ritual object  and the appropriate sacrifices would be made  and the shrine would be built for the god. But if the god became unruly and began to ask for human sacrifice  the Igbos would destroy the god. They would knock down the shrine  and they would stop saying the god's name. This is how they came to reclaim their humanity. Every day  all of us here  we're building gods that have gone rampant  and it's time we started knocking them down and forgetting their names. It doesn't require a tremendous thing. All it requires is to recognize among us  every day    the few of us that can see    are surrounded by people like the ones I've told you. There are some of you in this room  amazing people  who offer all of us the mirror to our own humanity. I want to end with a poem by an American poet called Lucille Clifton. The poem is called  Libation   and it's for my friend Vusi who is in the audience here somewhere.  Libation  North Carolina      . I offer to this ground  this gin. I imagine an old man crying here  out of the sight of the overseer. He pushes his tongue through a hole where his tooth would be  if he were whole. It aches in that space where his tooth would be  where his land would be  his house  his wife  his son  his beautiful daughter. He wipes sorrow from his face  and puts his thirsty finger to his thirsty tongue  and tastes the salt. I call a name that could be his. This is for you  old man. This gin  this salty earth.  Thank you. Who are we  That is the big question. And essentially we are just an upright walking  big brained  super intelligent ape. This could be us. We belong to the family called the Hominidae. We are the species called Homo sapiens sapiens  and it's important to remember that  in terms of our place in the world today and our future on planet Earth. We are one species of about five and a half thousand mammalian species that exist on planet Earth today. And that's just a tiny fraction of all species that have ever lived on the planet in past times. We're one species out of approximately  or let's say  at least    upright walking apes that have existed over the past six to eight million years. But as far as we know  we're the only upright walking ape that exists on planet Earth today  except for the bonobos. And it's important to remember that  because the bonobos are so human  and they share    percent of their genes with us. And we share our origins with a handful of the living great apes. It's important to remember that we evolved. Now  I know that's a dirty word for some people  but we evolved from common ancestors with the gorillas  the chimpanzee and also the bonobos. We have a common past  and we have a common future. And it is important to remember that all of these great apes have come on as long and as interesting evolutionary journey as we ourselves have today. And it's this journey that is of such interest to humanity  and it's this journey that has been the focus of the past three generations of my family  as we've been in East Africa looking for the fossil remains of our ancestors to try and piece together our evolutionary past. And this is how we look for them. A group of dedicated young men and women walk very slowly out across vast areas of Africa  looking for small fragments of bone  fossil bone  that may be on the surface. And that's an example of what we may do as we walk across the landscape in Northern Kenya  looking for fossils. I doubt many of you in the audience can see the fossil that's in this picture  but if you look very carefully  there is a jaw  a lower jaw  of a  .  million year old upright walking ape as it was found at Lake Turkana on the west side. It's extremely time consuming  labor intensive and it is something that is going to involve a lot more people  to begin to piece together our past. We still really haven't got a very complete picture of it. When we find a fossil  we mark it. Today  we've got great technology  we have GPS. We mark it with a GPS fix  and we also take a digital photograph of the specimen  so we could essentially put it back on the surface  exactly where we found it. And we can bring all this information into big GIS packages  today. When we then find something very important  like the bones of a human ancestor  we begin to excavate it extremely carefully and slowly  using dental picks and fine paintbrushes. And all the sediment is then put through these screens  and where we go again through it very carefully  looking for small bone fragments  and it's then washed. And these things are so exciting. They are so often the only  or the very first time that anybody has ever seen the remains. And here's a very special moment  when my mother and myself were digging up some remains of human ancestors. And it is one of the most special things to ever do with your mother. Not many people can say that. But now  let me take you back to Africa  two million years ago. I'd just like to point out  if you look at the map of Africa  it does actually look like a hominid skull in its shape. Now we're going to go to the East African and the Rift Valley. It essentially runs up from the Gulf of Aden  or runs down to Lake Malawi. And the Rift Valley is a depression. It's a basin  and rivers flow down from the highlands into the basin  carrying sediment  preserving the bones of animals that lived there. If you want to become a fossil  you actually need to die somewhere where your bones will be rapidly buried. You then hope that the earth moves in such a way as to bring the bones back up to the surface. And then you hope that one of us lot will walk around and find small pieces of you. OK  so it is absolutely surprising that we know as much as we do know today about our ancestors  because it's incredibly difficult  A  for these things to become    to be    preserved  and secondly  for them to have been brought back up to the surface. And we really have only spent    years looking for these remains  and begin to actually piece together our evolutionary story. So  let's go to Lake Turkana  which is one such lake basin in the very north of our country  Kenya. And if you look north here  there's a big river that flows into the lake that's been carrying sediment and preserving the remains of the animals that lived there. Fossil sites run up and down both lengths of that lake basin  which represents some        square miles. That's a huge job that we've got on our hands. Two million years ago at Lake Turkana  Homo erectus  one of our human ancestors  actually lived in this region. You can see some of the major fossil sites that we've been working in the north. But  essentially  two million years ago  Homo erectus  up in the far right corner  lived alongside three other species of human ancestor. And here is a skull of a Homo erectus  which I just pulled off the shelf there. But it is not to say that being a single species on planet Earth is the norm. In fact  if you go back in time  it is the norm that there are multiple species of hominids or of human ancestors that coexist at any one time. Where did these things come from  That's what we're still trying to find answers to  and it is important to realize that there is diversity in all different species  and our ancestors are no exception. Here's some reconstructions of some of the fossils that have been found from Lake Turkana. But I was very lucky to have been brought up in Kenya  essentially accompanying my parents to Lake Turkana in search of human remains. And we were able to dig up  when we got old enough  fossils such as this  a slender snouted crocodile. And we dug up giant tortoises  and elephants and things like that. But when I was     as I was in this picture  a very exciting expedition was in place on the west side  when they found essentially the skeleton of this Homo erectus. I could relate to this Homo erectus skeleton very well  because I was the same age that he was when he died. And I imagined him to be tall  dark skinned. His brothers certainly were able to run long distances chasing prey  probably sweating heavily as they did so. He was very able to use stones effectively as tools. And this individual himself  this one that I'm holding up here  actually had a bad back. He'd probably had an injury as a child. He had a scoliosis and therefore must have been looked after quite carefully by other female  and probably much smaller  members of his family group  to have got to where he did in life  age   . Unfortunately for him  he fell into a swamp and couldn't get out. Essentially  his bones were rapidly buried and beautifully preserved. And he remained there until  .  million years later  when this very famous fossil hunter  Kamoya Kimeu  walked along a small hillside and found that small piece of his skull lying on the surface amongst the pebbles  recognized it as being hominid. It's actually this little piece up here on the top. Well  an excavation was begun immediately  and more and more little bits of skull started to be extracted from the sediment. And what was so fun about it was this  the skull pieces got closer and closer to the roots of the tree  and fairly recently the tree had grown up  but it had found that the skull had captured nice water in the hillside  and so it had decided to grow its roots in and around this  holding it in place and preventing it from washing away down the slope. We began to find limb bones  we found finger bones  the bones of the pelvis  vertebrae  ribs  the collar bones  things that had never  ever been seen before in Homo erectus. It was truly exciting. He had a body very similar to our own  and he was on the threshold of becoming human. Well  shortly afterwards  members of his species started to move northwards out of Africa  and you start to see fossils of Homo erectus in Georgia  China and also in parts of Indonesia. So  Homo erectus was the first human ancestor to leave Africa and begin its spread across the globe. Some exciting finds  again  as I mentioned  from Dmanisi  in the Republic of Georgia. But also  surprising finds recently announced from the Island of Flores in Indonesia  where a group of these human ancestors have been isolated  and have become dwarfed  and they're only about a meter in height. But they lived only        years ago  and that is truly extraordinary to think about. Just to put this in terms of generations  because people do find it hard to think of time  Homo erectus left Africa        generations ago. We evolved essentially from an African stock. Again  at about         years as a fully fledged us. And we only left Africa about        years ago. And until        years ago  at least three upright walking apes shared the planet Earth. The question now is  well  who are we  We're certainly a polluting  wasteful  aggressive species  with a few nice things thrown in  perhaps. For the most part  we're not particularly pleasant at all. We have a much larger brain than our ape ancestors. Is this a good evolutionary adaptation  or is it going to lead us to being the shortest lived hominid species on planet Earth  And what is it that really makes us us  I think it's our collective intelligence. It's our ability to write things down  our language and our consciousness. From very primitive beginnings  with a very crude tool kit of stones  we now have a very advanced tool kit  and our tool use has really reached unprecedented levels  we've got buggies to Mars  we've mapped the human genome  and recently even created synthetic life  thanks to Craig Venter. And we've also managed to communicate with people all over the world  from extraordinary places. Even from within an excavation in northern Kenya  we can talk to people about what we're doing. As Al Gore so clearly has reminded us  we have reached extraordinary numbers of people on this planet. Human ancestors really only survive on planet Earth  if you look at the fossil record  for about  on average  a million years at a time. We've only been around for the past         years as a species  yet we've reached a population of more than six and a half billion people. And last year  our population grew by    million. I mean  these are extraordinary numbers. You can see here  again  taken from Al Gore's book. But what's happened is our technology has removed the checks and balances on our population growth. We have to control our numbers  and I think this is as important as anything else that's being done in the world today. But we have to control our numbers  because we can't really hold it together as a species. My father so appropriately put it  that  We are certainly the only animal that makes conscious choices that are bad for our survival as a species.  Can we hold it together  It's important to remember that we all evolved in Africa. We all have an African origin. We have a common past and we share a common future. Evolutionarily speaking  we're just a blip. We're sitting on the edge of a precipice  and we have the tools and the technology at our hands to communicate what needs to be done to hold it together today. We could tell every single human being out there  if we really wanted to. But will we do that  or will we just let nature take its course  Well  to end on a very positive note  I think evolutionarily speaking  this is probably a fairly good thing  in the end. I'll leave it at that  thank you very much. So I'm going to talk today about collecting stories in some unconventional ways. This is a picture of me from a very awkward stage in my life. You might enjoy the awkwardly tight  cut off pajama bottoms with balloons. Anyway  it was a time when I was mainly interested in collecting imaginary stories. So this is a picture of me holding one of the first watercolor paintings I ever made. And recently I've been much more interested in collecting stories from reality    so  real stories. And specifically  I'm interested in collecting my own stories  stories from the Internet  and then recently  stories from life  which is kind of a new area of work that I've been doing recently. So I'll be talking about each of those today. So  first of all  my own stories. These are two of my sketchbooks. I have many of these books  and I've been keeping them for about the last eight or nine years. They accompany me wherever I go in my life  and I fill them with all sorts of things  records of my lived experience  so watercolor paintings  drawings of what I see  dead flowers  dead insects  pasted ticket stubs  rusting coins  business cards  writings. And in these books  you can find these short  little glimpses of moments and experiences and people that I meet. And  you know  after keeping these books for a number of years  I started to become very interested in collecting not only my own personal artifacts  but also the artifacts of other people. So  I started collecting found objects. This is a photograph I found lying in a gutter in New York City about    years ago. On the front  you can see the tattered black and white photo of a woman's face  and on the back it says   To Judy  the girl with the Bill Bailey voice. Have fun in whatever you do.  And I really loved this idea of the partial glimpse into somebody's life. As opposed to knowing the whole story  just knowing a little bit of the story  and then letting your own mind fill in the rest. And that idea of a partial glimpse is something that will come back in a lot of the work I'll be showing later today. So  around this time I was studying computer science at Princeton University  and I noticed that it was suddenly possible to collect these sorts of personal artifacts  not just from street corners  but also from the Internet. And that suddenly  people  en masse  were leaving scores and scores of digital footprints online that told stories of their private lives. Blog posts  photographs  thoughts  feelings  opinions  all of these things were being expressed by people online  and leaving behind trails. So  I started to write computer programs that study very  very large sets of these online footprints. One such project is about a year and a half old. It's called  We Feel Fine.  This is a project that scans the world's newly posted blog entries every two or three minutes  searching for occurrences of the phrases  I feel  and  I am feeling.  And when it finds one of those phrases  it grabs the full sentence up to the period and also tries to identify demographic information about the author. So  their gender  their age  their geographic location and what the weather conditions were like when they wrote that sentence. It collects about        such sentences a day and it's been running for about a year and a half  having collected over    and a half million feelings now. This is  then  how they're presented. These dots here represent some of the English speaking world's feelings from the last few hours  each dot being a single sentence stated by a single blogger. And the color of each dot corresponds to the type of feeling inside  so the bright ones are happy  and the dark ones are sad. And the diameter of each dot corresponds to the length of the sentence inside. So the small ones are short  and the bigger ones are longer.  I feel fine with the body I'm in  there'll be no easy excuse for why I still feel uncomfortable being close to my boyfriend   from a twenty two year old in Japan.  I got this on some trading locally  but really don't feel like screwing with wiring and crap.  Also  some of the feelings contain photographs in the blog posts. And when that happens  these montage compositions are automatically created  which consist of the sentence and images being combined. And any of these can be opened up to reveal the sentence inside.  I feel good.   I feel rough now  and I probably gained         pounds  but it was worth it.   I love how they were able to preserve most in everything that makes you feel close to nature    butterflies  man made forests  limestone caves and hey  even a huge python.  So the next movement is called mobs. This provides a slightly more statistical look at things. This is showing the world's most common feelings overall right now  dominated by better  then bad  then good  then guilty  and so on. Weather causes the feelings to assume the physical traits of the weather they represent. So the sunny ones swirl around  the cloudy ones float along  the rainy ones fall down  and the snowy ones flutter to the ground. You can also stop a raindrop and open the feeling inside. Finally  location causes the feelings to move to their spots on a world map  giving you a sense of their geographic distribution. So I'll show you now some of my favorite montages from  We Feel Fine.  These are the images that are automatically constructed.  I feel like I'm diagonally parked in a parallel universe.   I've kissed numerous other boys and it hasn't felt good  the kisses felt messy and wrong  but kissing Lucas feels beautiful and almost spiritual.   I can feel my cancer grow.   I feel pretty.   I feel skinny  but I'm not.   I'm     and a recovering meth and heroin addict  and feel absolutely blessed to still be alive.   I can't wait to see them racing for the first time at Daytona next month  because I feel the need for speed.   I feel sassy.   I feel so sexy in this new wig.  As you can see   We Feel Fine  collects very  very small scale personal stories. Sometimes  stories as short as two or three words. So  really even challenging the notion of what can be considered a story. And recently  I've become interested in diving much more deeply into a single story. And that's led me to doing some work with the physical world  not with the Internet  and only using the Internet at the very last moment  as a presentation medium. So these are some newer projects that actually aren't even launched publicly yet. The first such one is called  The Whale Hunt.  Last May  I spent nine days living up in Barrow  Alaska  the northernmost settlement in the United States  with a family of Inupiat Eskimos  documenting their annual spring whale hunt. This is the whaling camp here  we're about six miles from shore  camping on five and a half feet of thick  frozen pack ice. And that water that you see there is the open lead  and through that lead  bowhead whales migrate north each springtime. And the Eskimo community basically camps out on the edge of the ice here  waits for a whale to come close enough to attack. And when it does  it throws a harpoon at it  and then hauls the whale up under the ice  and cuts it up. And that would provide the community's food supply for a long time. So I went up there  and I lived with these guys out in their whaling camp here  and photographed the entire experience  beginning with the taxi ride to Newark airport in New York  and ending with the butchering of the second whale  seven and a half days later. I photographed that entire experience at five minute intervals. So every five minutes  I took a photograph. When I was awake  with the camera around my neck. When I was sleeping  with a tripod and a timer. And then in moments of high adrenaline  like when something exciting was happening  I would up that photographic frequency to as many as    photographs in five minutes. So what this created was a photographic heartbeat that sped up and slowed down  more or less matching the changing pace of my own heartbeat. That was the first concept here. The second concept was to use this experience to think about the fundamental components of any story. What are the things that make up a story  So  stories have characters. Stories have concepts. Stories take place in a certain area. They have contexts. They have colors. What do they look like  They have time. When did it take place  Dates    when did it occur  And in the case of the whale hunt  also this idea of an excitement level. The thing about stories  though  in most of the existing mediums that we're accustomed to    things like novels  radio  photographs  movies  even lectures like this one    we're very accustomed to this idea of the narrator or the camera position  some kind of omniscient  external body through whose eyes you see the story. We're very used to this. But if you think about real life  it's not like that at all. I mean  in real life  things are much more nuanced and complex  and there's all of these overlapping stories intersecting and touching each other. And so I thought it would be interesting to build a framework to surface those types of stories. So  in the case of  The Whale Hunt   how could we extract something like the story of Simeon and Crawford  involving the concepts of wildlife  tools and blood  taking place on the Arctic Ocean  dominated by the color red  happening around    a.m. on May    with an excitement level of high  So  how to extract this order of narrative from this larger story  I built a web interface for viewing  The Whale Hunt  that attempts to do just this. So these are all       pictures taken up there. This is my studio in Brooklyn. This is the Arctic Ocean  and the butchering of the second whale  seven days later. You can start to see some of the story here  told by color. So this red strip signifies the color of the wallpaper in the basement apartment where I was staying. And things go white as we move out onto the Arctic Ocean. Introduction of red down here  when whales are being cut up. You can see a timeline  showing you the exciting moments throughout the story. These are organized chronologically. Wheel provides a slightly more playful version of the same  so these are also all the photographs organized chronologically. And any of these can be clicked  and then the narrative is entered at that position. So here I am sleeping on the airplane heading up to Alaska. That's  Moby Dick.  This is the food we ate. This is in the Patkotak's family living room in their house in Barrow. The boxed wine they served us. Cigarette break outside    I don't smoke. This is a really exciting sequence of me sleeping. This is out at whale camp  on the Arctic Ocean. This graph that I'm clicking down here is meant to be reminiscent of a medical heartbeat graph  showing the exciting moments of adrenaline. This is the ice starting to freeze over. The snow fence they built. And so what I'll show you now is the ability to pull out sub stories. So  here you see the cast. These are all of the people in  The Whale Hunt  and the two whales that were killed down here. And we could do something as arbitrary as  say  extract the story of Rony  involving the concepts of blood and whales and tools  taking place on the Arctic Ocean  at Ahkivgaq camp  with the heartbeat level of fast. And now we've whittled down that whole story to just    matching photographs  and then we can enter the narrative at that position. And you can see Rony cutting up the whale here. These whales are about    feet long  and weighing over    tons. And they provide the food source for the community for much of the year. Skipping ahead a bit more here  this is Rony on the whale carcass. They use no chainsaws or anything  it's entirely just blades  and an incredibly efficient process. This is the guys on the rope  pulling open the carcass. This is the muktuk  or the blubber  all lined up for community distribution. It's baleen. Moving on. So what I'm going to tell you about next is a very new thing. It's not even a project yet. So  just yesterday  I flew in here from Singapore  and before that  I was spending two weeks in Bhutan  the small Himalayan kingdom nestled between Tibet and India. And I was doing a project there about happiness  interviewing a lot of local people. So Bhutan has this really wacky thing where they base most of their high level governmental decisions around the concept of gross national happiness instead of gross domestic product  and they've been doing this since the '  s. And it leads to just a completely different value system. It's an incredibly non materialistic culture  where people don't have a lot  but they're incredibly happy. So I went around and I talked to people about some of these ideas. So  I did a number of things. I asked people a number of set questions  and took a number of set photographs  and interviewed them with audio  and also took pictures. I would start by asking people to rate their happiness between one and     which is kind of inherently absurd. And then when they answered  I would inflate that number of balloons and give them that number of balloons to hold. So  you have some really happy person holding    balloons  and some really sad soul holding one balloon. But you know  even holding one balloon is like  kind of happy. And then I would ask them a number of questions like what was the happiest day in their life  what makes them happy. And then finally  I would ask them to make a wish. And when they made a wish  I would write their wish onto one of the balloons and take a picture of them holding it. So I'm going to show you now just a few brief snippets of some of the interviews that I did  some of the people I spoke with. This is an    year old student. He was playing cops and robbers with his friends  running around town  and they all had plastic toy guns. His wish was to become a police officer. He was getting started early. Those were his hands. I took pictures of everybody's hands  because I think you can often tell a lot about somebody from how their hands look. I took a portrait of everybody  and asked everybody to make a funny face. A    year old student. Her wish was to have been born a boy. She thinks that women have a pretty tough go of things in Bhutan  and it's a lot easier if you're a boy. A    year old cell phone shop owner. If you knew what Paro looked like  you'd understand how amazing it is that there's a cell phone shop there. He wanted to help poor people. A    year old farmer. She was chaffing wheat  and that pile of wheat behind her had taken her about a week to make. She wanted to keep farming until she dies. You can really start to see the stories told by the hands here. She was wearing this silver ring that had the word  love  engraved on it  and she'd found it in the road somewhere. A    year old quarry worker. This guy was breaking rocks with a hammer in the hot sunlight  but he just wanted to spend his life as a farmer. A    year old monk. He was very happy. He wanted to live a long life at the monastery. He had this amazing series of hairs growing out of a mole on the left side of his face  which I'm told is very good luck. He was kind of too shy to make a funny face. A    year old student. She wanted to become an independent woman. I asked her about that  and she said she meant that she doesn't want to be married  because  in her opinion  when you get married in Bhutan as a woman  your chances to live an independent life kind of end  and so she had no interest in that. A    year old truck driver. There are these terrifyingly huge Indian trucks that come careening around one lane roads with two lane traffic  with       foot drop offs right next to the road  and he was driving one of these trucks. But all he wanted was to just live a comfortable life  like other people. A    year old road sweeper. I caught her on her lunch break. She'd built a little fire to keep warm  right next to the road. Her wish was to marry someone with a car. She wanted a change in her life. She lives in a little worker's camp right next to the road  and she wanted a different lot on things. An    year old itinerant farmer. I saw this guy on the side of the road  and he actually doesn't have a home. He travels from farm to farm each day trying to find work  and then he tries to sleep at whatever farm he gets work at. So his wish was to come with me  so that he had somewhere to live. He had this amazing knife that he pulled out of his gho and started brandishing when I asked him to make a funny face. It was all good natured. A    year old. He wanted to join a school and learn to read  but his parents didn't have enough money to send him to school. He was eating this orange  sugary candy that he kept dipping his fingers into  and since there was so much saliva on his hands  this orange paste started to form on his palms. A    year old road worker. One of the more touchy political subjects in Bhutan is the use of Indian cheap labor that they import from India to build the roads  and then they send these people home once the roads are built. So these guys were in a worker's gang mixing up asphalt one morning on the side of the highway. His wish was to make some money and open a store. A    year old farmer. She was selling oranges on the side of the road. I asked her about her wish  and she said   You know  maybe I'll live  maybe I'll die  but I don't have a wish.  She was chewing betel nut  which caused her teeth over the years to turn very red. Finally  this is a    year old nun I spoke to. Her wish was to make a pilgrimage to Tibet. I asked her how long she planned to live in the nunnery and she said   Well  you know  of course  it's impermanent  but my plan is to live here until I'm     and then enter a hermitage.  And I said   You mean  like a cave   And she said   Yeah  like a cave.  And I said   Wow  and how long will you live in the cave   And she said   Well  you know  I think I'd kind of like to live my whole life in the cave.  I just thought that was amazing. I mean  she spoke in a way    with amazing English  and amazing humor  and amazing laughter    that made her seem like somebody I could have bumped into on the streets of New York  or in Vermont  where I'm from. But here she had been living in a nunnery for the last seven years. I asked her a little bit more about the cave and what she planned would happen once she went there  you know. What if she saw the truth after just one year  what would she do for the next    years in her life  And this is what she said. Woman  I think I'm going to stay for   . Maybe    maybe I'll die. Jonathan Harris  Maybe you'll die  Woman  Yes. JH     years  Woman  Yes  yes. JH     years  that's a long time. Woman  Yes  not maybe one     years  maybe I can die within one year  or something like that. JH  Are you hoping to  Woman  Ah  because you know  it's impermanent. JH  Yeah  but    yeah  OK. Do you hope    would you prefer to live in the cave for    years  or to live for one year  Woman  But I prefer for maybe    to   . JH     to     Yeah. Woman  Yes. From then  I'm going to the heaven. JH  Well  I wish you the best of luck with it. Woman  Thank you. JH  I hope it's everything that you hope it will be. So thank you again  so much. Woman  You're most welcome. JH  So if you caught that  she said she hoped to die when she was around   . That was enough life for her. So  the last thing we did  very quickly  is I took all those wish balloons    there were     interviews      wishes    and I brought them up to a place called Dochula  which is a mountain pass in Bhutan  at        feet  one of the more sacred places in Bhutan. And up there  there are thousands of prayer flags that people have spread out over the years. And we re inflated all of the balloons  put them up on a string  and hung them up there among the prayer flags. And they're actually still flying up there today. So if any of you have any Bhutan travel plans in the near future  you can go check these out. Here are some images from that. We said a Buddhist prayer so that all these wishes could come true. You can start to see some familiar balloons here.  To make some money and to open a store  was the Indian road worker. Thanks very much. To be new at TED    it's like being the last high school virgin. You know that all of the cool people are    they're doing it. And you're on the outside  you're at home. You're like the Raspyni Brothers  where you've got your balls in cold water. And    you just play with your fingers all day. And then you get invited. And you're on the inside  and it's everything you hoped it would be. It's exciting and there's music playing all of the time and then suddenly it's over. And it's only taken five minutes. And you want to go back and do it again. But I really appreciate being here. And thank you  Chris  and also  thank you  Deborah Patton  for making this possible. So anyway  today we'll talk about architecture a little bit  within the subject of creation and optimism. And if you put creation and optimism together  you've got two choices that you can talk about. You can talk about creationism    which I think wouldn't go down well with this audience  at least not from a view where you were a proponent of it    or you can talk about optimisations  spelled the British way  with an S  instead of a Z. And I think that's what I'd like to talk about today. But any kind of conversation about architecture    which is  in fact  what you were just talking about  what was going on here  setting up TED  small scale architecture    at the present time can't really happen without a conversation about this  the World Trade Center  and what's been going on there  what it means to us. Because if architecture is what I believe it to be  which is the built form of our cultural ambitions  what do you do when presented with an opportunity to rectify a situation that represents somebody else's cultural ambitions relative to us  And our own opportunity to make something new there  This has been a really galvanizing issue for a long time. I think that the World Trade Center in  rather an unfortunate way  brought architecture into focus in a way that I don't think people had thought of in a long time  and made it a subject for common conversation. I don't remember  in my    year career of practicing and writing about architecture  a time when five people sat me down at a table and asked me very serious questions about zoning  fire exiting  safety concerns and whether carpet burns. These are just not things we talked about very often. And yet  now  it's talked about all the time. At the point where you can weaponize your buildings  you have to suddenly think about architecture in a very different way. And so now we're going to think about architecture in a very different way  we're going to think about it like this. How many of you saw USA Today  today  There it is. Looks like that. There's the World Trade Center site  on the front cover. They've made a selection. They've chosen a project by Daniel Libeskind  the enfant terrible of the moment of architecture. Child prodigy piano player  he started on the squeezebox  and moved to a little more serious issue  a bigger instrument  and now to an even larger instrument  upon which to work his particular brand of deconstructivist magic  as you see here. He was one of six people who were invited to participate in this competition  after six previous firms struck out with things that were so stupid and banal that even the city of New York was forced to go   Oh  I'm really sorry  we screwed up.  Right. Can we do this again from the top  except use some people with a vague hint of talent  instead of just six utter boobs like we brought in last time  real estate hacks of the kind who usually plan our cities. Let's bring in some real architects for a change. And so we got this  or we had a choice of that. Oh  stop clapping. It's too late. That is gone. This was a scheme by a team called THINK  a New York based team  and then there was that one  which was the Libeskind scheme. This one  this is going to be the new World Trade Center  a giant hole in the ground with big buildings falling into it. Now  I don't know what you think  but I think this is a pretty stupid decision  because what you've done is just made a permanent memorial to destruction by making it look like the destruction is going to continue forever. But that's what we're going to do. But I want you to think about these things in terms of a kind of ongoing struggle that American architecture represents  and that these two things talk about very specifically. And that is the wild divergence in how we choose our architects  in trying to decide whether we want architecture from the kind of technocratic solution to everything    that there is a large  technical answer that can solve all problems  be they social  be they physical  be they chemical    or something that's more of a romantic solution. Now  I don't mean romantic as in  this is a nice place to take someone on a date. I mean romantic in the sense of  there are things larger and grander than us. So  in the American tradition  the difference between the technocratic and the romantic  would be the difference between Thomas Jefferson's Cartesian grids spreading across the United States  that gives us basically the whole shape of every western state in the United States  as a really  truly  technocratic solution  a bowing to the    in Jefferson's time    current  popular philosophy of rationalism. Or the way we went to describe that later  manifest destiny. Now  which would you rather be  A grid  or manifest destiny  Manifest destiny. It's a big deal. It sounds big  it sounds important  it sounds solid. It sounds American. Ballsy  serious  male. And that kind of fight has gone on back and forth in architecture all the time. I mean  it goes on in our private lives  too  every single day. We all want to go out and buy an Audi TT  don't we  Everyone here must own one  or at least they craved one the moment they saw one. And then they hopped in it  turned the little electronic key  rather than the real key  zipped home on their new superhighway  and drove straight into a garage that looks like a Tudor castle. Why  Why  Why do you want to do that  Why do we all want to do that  I even owned a Tudor thing once myself. It's in our nature to go ricocheting back and forth between this technocratic solution and a larger  sort of more romantic image of where we are. So we're going to go straight into this. Can I have the lights off for a moment  I'm going to talk about two architects very  very briefly that represent the current split  architecturally  between these two traditions of a technocratic or technological solution and a romantic solution. And these are two of the top architectural practices in the United States today. One very young  one a little more mature. This is the work of a firm called SHoP  and what you're seeing here  is their isometric drawings of what will be a large scale camera obscura in a public park. Does everybody know what a camera obscura is  Yeah  it's one of those giant camera lenses that takes a picture of the outside world    it's sort of a little movie  without any moving parts    and projects it on a page  and you can see the world outside you as you walk around it. This is just the outline of it  and you can see  does it look like a regular building  No. It's actually non orthogonal  it's not up and down  square  rectangular  anything like that  that you'd see in a normal shape of a building. The computer revolution  the technocratic  technological revolution  has allowed us to jettison normal shaped buildings  traditionally shaped buildings  in favor of non orthogonal buildings such as this. What's interesting about it is not the shape. What's interesting about it is how it's made. How it's made. A brand new way to put buildings together  something called mass customization. No  it is not an oxymoron. What makes the building expensive  in the traditional sense  is making individual parts custom  that you can't do over and over again. That's why we all live in developer houses. They all want to save money by building the same thing     times. That's because it's cheaper. Mass customization works by an architect feeding into a computer  a program that says  manufacture these parts. The computer then talks to a machine    a computer operated machine  a cad cam machine    that can make a zillion different changes  at a moment's notice  because the computer is just a machine. It doesn't care. It's manufacturing the parts. It doesn't see any excess cost. It doesn't spend any extra time. It's not a laborer    it's simply an electronic lathe  so the parts can all be cut at the same time. Meanwhile  instead of sending someone working drawings  which are those huge sets of blueprints that you've seen your whole life  what the architect can do is send a set of assembly instructions  like you used to get when you were a child  when you bought little models that said   Bolt A to B  and C to D.  And so what the builder will get is every single individual part that has been custom manufactured off site and delivered on a truck to the site  to that builder  and a set of these instruction manuals. Just simple  Bolt A to B  and they will be able to put them together. Here's the little drawing that tells them how that works    and that's what will happen in the end. You're underneath it  looking up into the lens of the camera obscura. Lest you think this is all fiction  lest you think this is all fantasy  or romance  these same architects were asked to produce something for the central courtyard of PS   which is a museum in Brooklyn  New York  as part of their young architects summer series. And they said  well  it's summer  what do you do  In the summer  you go to the beach. And when you go to the beach  what do you get  You get sand dunes. So let's make architectural sand dunes and a beach cabana. So they went out and they modeled a computer model of a sand dune. They took photographs  they fed the photographs into their computer program  and that computer program shaped a sand dune and then took that sand dune shape and turned it into    at their instructions  using standard software with slight modifications    a set of instructions for pieces of wood. And those are the pieces of wood. Those are the instructions. These are the pieces  and here's a little of that blown up. What you can see is there's about six different colors  and each color represents a type of wood to be cut  a piece of wood to be cut. All of which were delivered by flat bed  on a truck  and hand assembled in    hours by a team of eight people  only one of whom had ever seen the plans before. Only one of whom had ever seen the plans before. And here comes dune scape  coming up out of the courtyard  and there it is fully built. There are only    different pieces of wood  only    different assembly parts here. Looks like a beautiful piano sounding board on the inside. It has its own built in swimming pool  very  very cool. It's a great place for parties    it was  it was only up for six weeks. It's got little dressing rooms and cabanas  where lots of interesting things went on  all summer long. Now  lest you think that this is only for the light at heart  or just temporary installations  this is the same firm working at the World Trade Center  replacing the bridge that used to go across West Street  that very important pedestrian connection between the city of New York and the redevelopment of the West Side. They were asked to design  replace that bridge in six weeks  building it  including all of the parts  manufactured. And they were able to do it. That was their design  using that same computer modeling system and only five or six really different kinds of parts  a couple of struts  like this  some exterior cladding material and a very simple framing system that was all manufactured off site and delivered by truck. They were able to create that. They were able to create something wonderful. They're now building a    story building on the side of New York  using the same technology. Here we're going to walk across the bridge at night. It's self lit  you don't need any overhead lighting  so the neighbors don't complain about metal halide lighting in their face. Here it is going across. And there  down the other side  and you get the same kind of grandeur. Now  let me show you  quickly  the opposite  if I may. Woo  pretty  huh. This is the other side of the coin. This is the work of David Rockwell from New York City  whose work you can see out here today. The current king of the romantics  who approaches his work in a very different fashion. It's not to create a technological solution  it's to seduce you into something that you can do  into something that will please you  something that will lift your spirits  something that will make you feel as if are in another world    such as his Nobu restaurant in New York  which is supposed to take you from the clutter of New York City to the simplicity of Japan and the elegance of Japanese tradition.  When it's all said and done  it's got to look like seaweed   said the owner. Or his restaurant  Pod  in Philadelphia  Pennsylvania. I want you to know the room you're looking at is stark white. Every single surface of this restaurant is white. The reason it has so much color is that it changes using lighting. It's all about sensuality. It's all about transforming. Watch this    I'm not touching any buttons  ladies and gentlemen. This is happening by itself. It transforms through the magic of lighting. It's all about sensuality. It's all about touch. Rosa Mexicano restaurant  where he transports us to the shores of Acapulco  up on the Upper West Side  with this wall of cliff divers who    there you go  like that. Let's see it one more time. Okay  just to make sure that you've enjoyed it. And finally  it's about comfort  it's about making you feel good in places that you wouldn't have felt good before. It's about bringing nature to the inside. In the Guardian Tower of New York  converted to a W Union Square    I'm sorry I'm rushing    where we had to bring in the best horticulturists in the world to make sure that the interior of this dragged the garden space of the court garden of the Union Square into the building itself. It's about stimulation. This is a wine buying experience simplified by color and taste. Fizzy  fresh  soft  luscious  juicy  smooth  big and sweet wines  all explained to you by color and texture on the wall. And finally  it's about entertainment  as in his headquarters for the Cirque du Soleil  Orlando  Florida  where you're asked to enter the Greek theater  look under the tent and join the magic world of Cirque du Soleil. And I think I'll probably leave it at that. Thank you very much. The Internet  the Web as we know it  the kind of Web    the things we're all talking about    is already less than       days old. So all of the things that we've seen come about  starting  say  with satellite images of the whole Earth  which we couldn't even imagine happening before  all these things rolling into our lives  just this abundance of things that are right before us  sitting in front of our laptop  or our desktop. This kind of cornucopia of stuff just coming and never ending is amazing  and we're not amazed. It's really amazing that all this stuff is here. It's in       days  all this stuff has come. And I know that    years ago  if I had told you that this was all coming  you would have said that that's impossible. There's simply no economic model that that would be possible. And if I told you it was all coming for free  you would say  this is simply    you're dreaming. You're a Californian utopian. You're a wild eyed optimist. And yet it's here. The other thing that we know about it was that    years ago  as I looked at what even Wired was talking about  we thought it was going to be TV  but better. That was the model. That was what everybody was suggesting was going to be coming. And it turns out that that's not what it was. First of all  it was impossible  and it's not what it was. And so one of the things that I think we're learning    if you think about  like  Wikipedia  it's something that was simply impossible. It's impossible in theory  but possible in practice. And if you take all these things that are impossible  I think one of the things that we're learning from this era  from this last decade  is that we have to get good at believing in the impossible  because we're unprepared for it. So  I'm curious about what's going to happen in the next       days. But if that's happened in the last       days  what's going to happen in the next       days  So  I have a kind of a simple story  and it suggests that what we want to think about is this thing that we're making  this thing that has happened in       days    that's all these computers  all these handhelds  all these cell phones  all these laptops  all these servers    basically what we're getting out of all these connections is we're getting one machine. If there is only one machine  and our little handhelds and devices are actually just little windows into those machines  but that we're basically constructing a single  global machine. And so I began to think about that. And it turned out that this machine happens to be the most reliable machine that we've ever made. It has not crashed  it's running uninterrupted. And there's almost no other machine that we've ever made that runs the number of hours  the number of days.       days without interruption    that's just unbelievable. And of course  the Internet is longer than just       days  the Web is only       days. So  I was trying to basically make measurements. What are the dimensions of this machine  And I started off by calculating how many billions of clicks there are all around the globe on all the computers. And there is a     billion clicks per day. And there's    trillion links between all the Web pages of the world. And so I began thinking more about other kinds of dimensions  and I made a quick list. Was it Chris Jordan  the photographer  talking about numbers being so large that they're meaningless  Well  here's a list of them. They're hard to tell  but there's one billion PC chips on the Internet  if you count all the chips in all the computers on the Internet. There's two million emails per second. So it's a very big number. It's just a huge machine  and it uses five percent of the global electricity on the planet. So here's the specifications  just as if you were to make up a spec sheet for it      quadrillion transistors     trillion links  emails running at two megahertz itself     kilohertz text messaging      exabyte storage. That's a big disk. That's a lot of storage  memory. Nine exabyte RAM. And the total traffic on this is running at seven terabytes per second. Brewster was saying the Library of Congress is about twenty terabytes. So every second  half of the Library of Congress is swooshing around in this machine. It's a big machine. So I did something else. I figured out     billion clicks per day     trillion links is almost the same as the number of synapses in your brain. A quadrillion transistors is almost the same as the number of neurons in your brain. So to a first approximation  we have these things    twenty petahertz synapse firings. Of course  the memory is really huge. But to a first approximation  the size of this machine is the size    and its complexity  kind of    to your brain. Because in fact  that's how your brain works    in kind of the same way that the Web works. However  your brain isn't doubling every two years. So if we say this machine right now that we've made is about one HB  one human brain  if we look at the rate that this is increasing     years from now  there'll be six billion HBs. So by the year       the total processing of this machine will exceed a total processing power of humanity  in raw bits and stuff. And this is  I think  where Ray Kurzweil and others get this little chart saying that we're going to cross. So  what about that  Well  here's a couple of things. I have three kind of general things I would like to say  three consequences of this. First  that basically what this machine is doing is embodying. We're giving it a body. And that's what we're going to do in the next       days    we're going to give this machine a body. And the second thing is  we're going to restructure its architecture. And thirdly  we're going to become completely codependent upon it. So let me go through those three things. First of all  we have all these things in our hands. We think they're all separate devices  but in fact  every screen in the world is looking into the one machine. These are all basically portals into that one machine. The second thing is that    some people call this the cloud  and you're kind of touching the cloud with this. And so in some ways  all you really need is a cloudbook. And the cloudbook doesn't have any storage. It's wireless. It's always connected. There's many things about it. It becomes very simple  and basically what you're doing is you're just touching the machine  you're touching the cloud and you're going to compute that way. So the machine is computing. And in some ways  it's sort of back to the kind of old idea of centralized computing. But everything  all the cameras  and the microphones  and the sensors in cars and everything is connected to this machine. And everything will go through the Web. And we're seeing that already with  say  phones. Right now  phones don't go through the Web  but they are beginning to  and they will. And if you imagine what  say  just as an example  what Google Labs has in terms of experiments with Google Docs  Google Spreadsheets  blah  blah  blah    all these things are going to become Web based. They're going through the machine. And I am suggesting that every bit will be owned by the Web. Right now  it's not. If you do spreadsheets and things at work  a Word document  they aren't on the Web  but they are going to be. They're going to be part of this machine. They're going to speak the Web language. They're going to talk to the machine. The Web  in some sense  is kind of like a black hole that's sucking up everything into it. And so every thing will be part of the Web. So every item  every artifact that we make  will have embedded in it some little sliver of Web ness and connection  and it will be part of this machine  so that our environment    kind of in that ubiquitous computing sense    our environment becomes the Web. Everything is connected. Now  with RFIDs and other things    whatever technology it is  it doesn't really matter. The point is that everything will have embedded in it some sensor connecting it to the machine  and so we have  basically  an Internet of things. So you begin to think of a shoe as a chip with heels  and a car as a chip with wheels  because basically most of the cost of manufacturing cars is the embedded intelligence and electronics in it  and not the materials. A lot of people think about the new economy as something that was going to be a disembodied  alternative  virtual existence  and that we would have the old economy of atoms. But in fact  what the new economy really is is the marriage of those two  where we embed the information  and the digital nature of things into the material world. That's what we're looking forward to. That is where we're going    this union  this convergence of the atomic and the digital. And so one of the consequences of that  I believe  is that where we have this sort of spectrum of media right now    TV  film  video    that basically becomes one media platform. And while there's many differences in some senses  they will share more and more in common with each other. So that the laws of media  such as the fact that copies have no value  the value's in the uncopiable things  the immediacy  the authentication  the personalization. The media wants to be liquid. The reason why things are free is so that you can manipulate them  not so that they are  free  as in  beer   but  free  as in  freedom.  And the network effects rule  meaning that the more you have  the more you get. The first fax machine    the person who bought the first fax machine was an idiot  because there was nobody to fax to. But here she became an evangelist  recruiting others to get the fax machines because it made their purchase more valuable. Those are the effects that we're going to see. Attention is the currency. So those laws are going to kind of spread throughout all media. And the other thing about this embodiment is that there's kind of what I call the McLuhan reversal. McLuhan was saying   Machines are the extensions of the human senses.  And I'm saying   Humans are now going to be the extended senses of the machine   in a certain sense. So we have a trillion eyes  and ears  and touches  through all our digital photographs and cameras. And we see that in things like Flickr  or Photosynth  this program from Microsoft that will allow you to assemble a view of a touristy place from the thousands of tourist snapshots of it. In a certain sense  the machine is seeing through the pixels of individual cameras. Now  the second thing that I want to talk about was this idea of restructuring  that what the Web is doing is restructuring. And I have to warn you  that what we'll talk about is    I'm going to give my explanation of a term you're hearing  which is a  semantic Web.  So first of all  the first stage that we've seen of the Internet was that it was going to link computers. And that's what we called the Net  that was the Internet of nets. And we saw that  where you have all the computers of the world. And if you remember  it was a kind of green screen with cursors  and there was really not much to do  and if you wanted to connect it  you connected it from one computer to another computer. And what you had to do was    if you wanted to participate in this  you had to share packets of information. So you were forwarding on. You didn't have control. It wasn't like a telephone system where you had control of a line  you had to share packets. The second stage that we're in now is the idea of linking pages. So in the old one  if I wanted to go on to an airline Web page  I went from my computer  to an FTP site  to another airline computer. Now we have pages    the unit has been resolved into pages  so one page links to another page. And if I want to go in to book a flight  I go into the airline's flight page  the website of the airline  and I'm linking to that page. And what we're sharing were links  so you had to be kind of open with links. You couldn't deny    if someone wanted to link to you  you couldn't stop them. You had to participate in this idea of opening up your pages to be linked by anybody. So that's what we were doing. We're now entering to the third stage  which is what I'm talking about  and that is where we link the data. So  I don't know what the name of this thing is. I'm calling it the one machine. But we're linking data. So we're going from machine to machine  from page to page  and now data to data. So the difference is  is that rather than linking from page to page  we're actually going to link from one idea on a page to another idea  rather than to the other page. So every idea is basically being supported    or every item  or every noun    is being supported by the entire Web. It's being resolved at the level of items  or ideas  or words  if you want. So besides physically coming out again into this idea that it's not just virtual  it's actually going out to things. So something will resolve down to the information about a particular person  so every person will have a unique ID. Every person  every item will have a something that will be very specific  and will link to a specific representation of that idea or item. So now  in this new one  when I link to it  I would link to my particular flight  my particular seat. And so  giving an example of this thing  I live in Pacifica  rather than    right now Pacifica is just sort of a name on the Web somewhere. The Web doesn't know that that is actually a town  and that it's a specific town that I live in  but that's what we're going to be talking about. It's going to link directly to    it will know  the Web will be able to read itself and know that that actually is a place  and that whenever it sees that word   Pacifica   it knows that it actually has a place  latitude  longitude  a certain population. So here are some of the technical terms  all three letter things  that you'll see a lot more of. All these things are about enabling this idea of linking to the data. So I'll give you one kind of an example. There's like a billion social sites on the Web. Each time you go into there  you have to tell it again who you are and all your friends are. Why should you be doing that  You should just do that once  and it should know who all your friends are. So that's what you want  is all your friends are identified  and you should just carry these relationships around. All this data about you should just be conveyed  and you should do it once and that's all that should happen. And you should have all the networks of all the relationships between those pieces of data. That's what we're moving into    where it sort of knows these things down to that level. A semantic Web  Web  .   giant global graph    we're kind of trying out what we want to call this thing. But what's it's doing is sharing data. So you have to be open to having your data shared  which is a much bigger step than just sharing your Web page  or your computer. And all these things that are going to be on this are not just pages  they are things. Everything we've described  every artifact or place  will be a specific representation  will have a specific character that can be linked to directly. So we have this database of things. And so there's actually a fourth thing that we have not get to  that we won't see in the next    years  or       days  but I think that's where we're going to. And as the Internet of things    where I'm linking directly to the particular things of my seat on the plane    that that physical thing becomes part of the Web. And so we are in the middle of this thing that's completely linked  down to every object in the little sliver of a connection that it has. So  the last thing I want to talk about is this idea that we're going to be codependent. It's always going to be there  and the closer it is  the better. If you allow Google to  it will tell you your search history. And I found out by looking at it that I search most at    o'clock in the morning. So I am open  and being transparent to that. And I think total personalization in this new world will require total transparency. That is going to be the price. If you want to have total personalization  you have to be totally transparent. Google. I can't remember my phone number  I'll just ask Google. We're so dependent on this that I have now gotten to the point where I don't even try to remember things    I'll just Google it. It's easier to do that. And we kind of object at first  saying   Oh  that's awful.  But if we think about the dependency that we have on this other technology  called the alphabet  and writing  we're totally dependent on it  and it's transformed culture. We cannot imagine ourselves without the alphabet and writing. And so in the same way  we're going to not imagine ourselves without this other machine being there. And what is happening with this is some kind of AI  but it's not the AI in conscious AI  as being an expert  Larry Page told me that that's what they're trying to do  and that's what they're trying to do. But when six billion humans are Googling  who's searching who  It goes both ways. So we are the Web  that's what this thing is. We are going to be the machine. So the next       days  it's not going to be the Web and only better. Just like it wasn't TV and only better. The next       days  it's not just going to be the Web but only better    it's going to be something different. And I think it's going to be smarter. It'll have an intelligence in there  that's not  again  conscious. But it'll anticipate what we're doing  in a good sense. Secondly  it's become much more personalized. It will know us  and that's good. And again  the price of that will be transparency. And thirdly  it's going to become more ubiquitous in terms of filling your entire environment  and we will be in the middle of it. And all these devices will be portals into that. So the single idea that I wanted to leave with you is that we have to begin to think about this as not just  the Web  only better   but a new kind of stage in this development. It looks more global. If you take this whole thing  it is a very big machine  very reliable machine  more reliable than its parts. But we can also think about it as kind of a large organism. So we might respond to it more as if this was a whole system  more as if this wasn't a large organism that we are going to be interacting with. It's a  One.  And I don't know what else to call it  than the One. We'll have a better word for it. But there's a unity of some sort that's starting to emerge. And again  I don't want to talk about consciousness  I want to talk about it just as if it was a little bacteria  or a volvox  which is what that organism is. So  to do  action  take away. So  here's what I would say  there's only one machine  and the Web is its OS. All screens look into the One. No bits will live outside the Web. To share is to gain. Let the One read it. It's going to be machine readable. You want to make something that the machine can read. And the One is us. We are in the One. I appreciate your time. I got my first computer when I was a teenager growing up in Accra  and it was a really cool device. You could play games with it. You could program it in BASIC. And I was fascinated. So I went into the library to figure out how did this thing work. I read about how the CPU is constantly shuffling data back and forth between the memory  the RAM and the ALU  the arithmetic and logic unit. And I thought to myself  this CPU really has to work like crazy just to keep all this data moving through the system. But nobody was really worried about this. When computers were first introduced  they were said to be a million times faster than neurons. People were really excited. They thought they would soon outstrip the capacity of the brain. This is a quote  actually  from Alan Turing   In    years  it will be as easy to ask a computer a question as to ask a person.  This was in     . And now  in       it's still not true. And so  the question is  why aren't we really seeing this kind of power in computers that we see in the brain  What people didn't realize  and I'm just beginning to realize right now  is that we pay a huge price for the speed that we claim is a big advantage of these computers. Let's take a look at some numbers. This is Blue Gene  the fastest computer in the world. It's got         processors  they can basically process    quadrillion bits of information per second. That's    to the sixteenth. And they consume one and a half megawatts of power. So that would be really great  if you could add that to the production capacity in Tanzania. It would really boost the economy. Just to go back to the States  if you translate the amount of power or electricity this computer uses to the amount of households in the States  you get       households in the U.S. That's how much power this computer uses. Now  let's compare this with the brain. This is a picture of  actually Rory Sayres' girlfriend's brain. Rory is a graduate student at Stanford. He studies the brain using MRI  and he claims that this is the most beautiful brain that he has ever scanned. So that's true love  right there. Now  how much computation does the brain do  I estimate    to the    bits per second  which is actually about very similar to what Blue Gene does. So that's the question. The question is  how much    they are doing a similar amount of processing  similar amount of data    the question is how much energy or electricity does the brain use  And it's actually as much as your laptop computer  it's just    watts. So what we are doing right now with computers with the energy consumed by       houses  the brain is doing with the energy consumed by your laptop. So the question is  how is the brain able to achieve this kind of efficiency  And let me just summarize. So the bottom line  the brain processes information using         times less energy than we do right now with this computer technology that we have. How is the brain able to do this  Let's just take a look about how the brain works  and then I'll compare that with how computers work. So  this clip is from the PBS series   The Secret Life of the Brain.  It shows you these cells that process information. They are called neurons. They send little pulses of electricity down their processes to each other  and where they contact each other  those little pulses of electricity can jump from one neuron to the other. That process is called a synapse. You've got this huge network of cells interacting with each other    about     million of them  sending about    quadrillion of these pulses around every second. And that's basically what's going on in your brain right now as you're watching this. How does that compare with the way computers work  In the computer  you have all the data going through the central processing unit  and any piece of data basically has to go through that bottleneck  whereas in the brain  what you have is these neurons  and the data just really flows through a network of connections among the neurons. There's no bottleneck here. It's really a network in the literal sense of the word. The net is doing the work in the brain. If you just look at these two pictures  these kind of words pop into your mind. This is serial and it's rigid    it's like cars on a freeway  everything has to happen in lockstep    whereas this is parallel and it's fluid. Information processing is very dynamic and adaptive. So I'm not the first to figure this out. This is a quote from Brian Eno   the problem with computers is that there is not enough Africa in them.  Brian actually said this in     . And nobody was listening then  but now people are beginning to listen because there's a pressing  technological problem that we face. And I'll just take you through that a little bit in the next few slides. This is    it's actually really this remarkable convergence between the devices that we use to compute in computers  and the devices that our brains use to compute. The devices that computers use are what's called a transistor. This electrode here  called the gate  controls the flow of current from the source to the drain    these two electrodes. And that current  electrical current  is carried by electrons  just like in your house and so on. And what you have here is  when you actually turn on the gate  you get an increase in the amount of current  and you get a steady flow of current. And when you turn off the gate  there's no current flowing through the device. Your computer uses this presence of current to represent a one  and the absence of current to represent a zero. Now  what's happening is that as transistors are getting smaller and smaller and smaller  they no longer behave like this. In fact  they are starting to behave like the device that neurons use to compute  which is called an ion channel. And this is a little protein molecule. I mean  neurons have thousands of these. And it sits in the membrane of the cell and it's got a pore in it. And these are individual potassium ions that are flowing through that pore. Now  this pore can open and close. But  when it's open  because these ions have to line up and flow through  one at a time  you get a kind of sporadic  not steady    it's a sporadic flow of current. And even when you close the pore    which neurons can do  they can open and close these pores to generate electrical activity    even when it's closed  because these ions are so small  they can actually sneak through  a few can sneak through at a time. So  what you have is that when the pore is open  you get some current sometimes. These are your ones  but you've got a few zeros thrown in. And when it's closed  you have a zero  but you have a few ones thrown in. Now  this is starting to happen in transistors. And the reason why that's happening is that  right now  in         the technology that we are using    a transistor is big enough that several electrons can flow through the channel simultaneously  side by side. In fact  there's about    electrons can all be flowing this way. And that means that a transistor corresponds to about    ion channels in parallel. Now  in a few years time  by       we will shrink transistors so much. This is what Intel does to keep adding more cores onto the chip. Or your memory sticks that you have now can carry one gigabyte of stuff on them    before  it was    . Transistors are getting smaller to allow this to happen  and technology has really benefitted from that. But what's happening now is that in       the transistor is going to become so small  that it corresponds to only one electron at a time can flow through that channel  and that corresponds to a single ion channel. And you start having the same kind of traffic jams that you have in the ion channel. The current will turn on and off at random  even when it's supposed to be on. And that means your computer is going to get its ones and zeros mixed up  and that's going to crash your machine. So  we are at the stage where we don't really know how to compute with these kinds of devices. And the only kind of thing    the only thing we know right now that can compute with these kinds of devices are the brain. OK  so a computer picks a specific item of data from memory  it sends it into the processor or the ALU  and then it puts the result back into memory. That's the red path that's highlighted. The way brains work  I told you all  you have got all these neurons. And the way they represent information is they break up that data into little pieces that are represented by pulses and different neurons. So you have all these pieces of data distributed throughout the network. And then the way that you process that data to get a result is that you translate this pattern of activity into a new pattern of activity  just by it flowing through the network. So you set up these connections such that the input pattern just flows and generates the output pattern. What you see here is that there's these redundant connections. So if this piece of data or this piece of the data gets clobbered  it doesn't show up over here  these two pieces can activate the missing part with these redundant connections. So even when you go to these crappy devices where sometimes you want a one and you get a zero  and it doesn't show up  there's redundancy in the network that can actually recover the missing information. It makes the brain inherently robust. What you have here is a system where you store data locally. And it's brittle  because each of these steps has to be flawless  otherwise you lose that data  whereas in the brain  you have a system that stores data in a distributed way  and it's robust. What I want to basically talk about is my dream  which is to build a computer that works like the brain. This is something that we've been working on for the last couple of years. And I'm going to show you a system that we designed to model the retina  which is a piece of brain that lines the inside of your eyeball. We didn't do this by actually writing code  like you do in a computer. In fact  the processing that happens in that little piece of brain is very similar to the kind of processing that computers do when they stream video over the Internet. They want to compress the information    they just want to send the changes  what's new in the image  and so on    and that is how your eyeball is able to squeeze all that information down to your optic nerve  to send to the rest of the brain. Instead of doing this in software  or doing those kinds of algorithms  we went and talked to neurobiologists who have actually reverse engineered that piece of brain that's called the retina. And they figured out all the different cells  and they figured out the network  and we just took that network and we used it as the blueprint for the design of a silicon chip. So now the neurons are represented by little nodes or circuits on the chip  and the connections among the neurons are represented  actually modeled by transistors. And these transistors are behaving essentially just like ion channels behave in the brain. It will give you the same kind of robust architecture that I described. Here is actually what our artificial eye looks like. The retina chip that we designed sits behind this lens here. And the chip    I'm going to show you a video that the silicon retina put out of its output when it was looking at Kareem Zaghloul  who's the student who designed this chip. Let me explain what you're going to see  OK  because it's putting out different kinds of information  it's not as straightforward as a camera. The retina chip extracts four different kinds of information. It extracts regions with dark contrast  which will show up on the video as red. And it extracts regions with white or light contrast  which will show up on the video as green. This is Kareem's dark eyes and that's the white background that you see here. And then it also extracts movement. When Kareem moves his head to the right  you will see this blue activity there  it represents regions where the contrast is increasing in the image  that's where it's going from dark to light. And you also see this yellow activity  which represents regions where contrast is decreasing  it's going from light to dark. And these four types of information    your optic nerve has about a million fibers in it  and         of those fibers send these four types of information. So we are really duplicating the kind of signals that you have on the optic nerve. What you notice here is that these snapshots taken from the output of the retina chip are very sparse  right  It doesn't light up green everywhere in the background  only on the edges  and then in the hair  and so on. And this is the same thing you see when people compress video to send  they want to make it very sparse  because that file is smaller. And this is what the retina is doing  and it's doing it just with the circuitry  and how this network of neurons that are interacting in there  which we've captured on the chip. But the point that I want to make    I'll show you up here. So this image here is going to look like these ones  but here I'll show you that we can reconstruct the image  so  you know  you can almost recognize Kareem in that top part there. And so  here you go. Yes  so that's the idea. When you stand still  you just see the light and dark contrasts. But when it's moving back and forth  the retina picks up these changes. And that's why  you know  when you're sitting here and something happens in your background  you merely move your eyes to it. There are these cells that detect change and you move your attention to it. So those are very important for catching somebody who's trying to sneak up on you. Let me just end by saying that this is what happens when you put Africa in a piano  OK. This is a steel drum here that has been modified  and that's what happens when you put Africa in a piano. And what I would like us to do is put Africa in the computer  and come up with a new kind of computer that will generate thought  imagination  be creative and things like that. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Question for you  Kwabena. Do you put together in your mind the work you're doing  the future of Africa  this conference    what connections can we make  if any  between them  Kwabena Boahen  Yes  like I said at the beginning  I got my first computer when I was a teenager  growing up in Accra. And I had this gut reaction that this was the wrong way to do it. It was very brute force  it was very inelegant. I don't think that I would've had that reaction  if I'd grown up reading all this science fiction  hearing about RD D   whatever it was called  and just    you know  buying into this hype about computers. I was coming at it from a different perspective  where I was bringing that different perspective to bear on the problem. And I think a lot of people in Africa have this different perspective  and I think that's going to impact technology. And that's going to impact how it's going to evolve. And I think you're going to be able to see  use that infusion  to come up with new things  because you're coming from a different perspective. I think we can contribute. We can dream like everybody else. CA  Thanks Kwabena  that was really interesting. Thank you. My talk is  Flapping Birds and Space Telescopes.  And you would think that should have nothing to do with one another  but I hope by the end of these    minutes  you'll see a little bit of a relation. It ties to origami. So let me start. What is origami  Most people think they know what origami is. It's this  flapping birds  toys  cootie catchers  that sort of thing. And that is what origami used to be. But it's become something else. It's become an art form  a form of sculpture. The common theme    what makes it origami    is folding is how we create the form. You know  it's very old. This is a plate from     . It shows these women playing with these toys. If you look close  it's this shape  called a crane. Every Japanese kid learns how to fold that crane. So this art has been around for hundreds of years  and you would think something that's been around that long    so restrictive  folding only    everything that could be done has been done a long time ago. And that might have been the case. But in the twentieth century  a Japanese folder named Yoshizawa came along  and he created tens of thousands of new designs. But even more importantly  he created a language  a way we could communicate  a code of dots  dashes and arrows. Harkening back to Susan Blackmore's talk  we now have a means of transmitting information with heredity and selection  and we know where that leads. And where it has led in origami is to things like this. This is an origami figure    one sheet  no cuts  folding only  hundreds of folds. This  too  is origami  and this shows where we've gone in the modern world. Naturalism. Detail. You can get horns  antlers    even  if you look close  cloven hooves. And it raises a question  what changed  And what changed is something you might not have expected in an art  which is math. That is  people applied mathematical principles to the art  to discover the underlying laws. And that leads to a very powerful tool. The secret to productivity in so many fields    and in origami    is letting dead people do your work for you. Because what you can do is take your problem  and turn it into a problem that someone else has solved  and use their solutions. And I want to tell you how we did that in origami. Origami revolves around crease patterns. The crease pattern shown here is the underlying blueprint for an origami figure. And you can't just draw them arbitrarily. They have to obey four simple laws. And they're very simple  easy to understand. The first law is two colorability. You can color any crease pattern with just two colors without ever having the same color meeting. The directions of the folds at any vertex    the number of mountain folds  the number of valley folds    always differs by two. Two more or two less. Nothing else. If you look at the angles around the fold  you find that if you number the angles in a circle  all the even numbered angles add up to a straight line  all the odd numbered angles add up to a straight line. And if you look at how the layers stack  you'll find that no matter how you stack folds and sheets  a sheet can never penetrate a fold. So that's four simple laws. That's all you need in origami. All of origami comes from that. And you'd think   Can four simple laws give rise to that kind of complexity   But indeed  the laws of quantum mechanics can be written down on a napkin  and yet they govern all of chemistry  all of life  all of history. If we obey these laws  we can do amazing things. So in origami  to obey these laws  we can take simple patterns    like this repeating pattern of folds  called textures    and by itself it's nothing. But if we follow the laws of origami  we can put these patterns into another fold that itself might be something very  very simple  but when we put it together  we get something a little different. This fish      scales    again  it is one uncut square  only folding. And if you don't want to fold     scales  you can back off and just do a few things  and add plates to the back of a turtle  or toes. Or you can ramp up and go up to    stars on a flag  with    stripes. And if you want to go really crazy        scales on a rattlesnake. And this guy's on display downstairs  so take a look if you get a chance. The most powerful tools in origami have related to how we get parts of creatures. And I can put it in this simple equation. We take an idea  combine it with a square  and you get an origami figure. What matters is what we mean by those symbols. And you might say   Can you really be that specific  I mean  a stag beetle    it's got two points for jaws  it's got antennae. Can you be that specific in the detail   And yeah  you really can. So how do we do that  Well  we break it down into a few smaller steps. So let me stretch out that equation. I start with my idea. I abstract it. What's the most abstract form  It's a stick figure. And from that stick figure  I somehow have to get to a folded shape that has a part for every bit of the subject  a flap for every leg. And then once I have that folded shape that we call the base  you can make the legs narrower  you can bend them  you can turn it into the finished shape. Now the first step  pretty easy. Take an idea  draw a stick figure. The last step is not so hard  but that middle step    going from the abstract description to the folded shape    that's hard. But that's the place where the mathematical ideas can get us over the hump. And I'm going to show you all how to do that so you can go out of here and fold something. But we're going to start small. This base has a lot of flaps in it. We're going to learn how to make one flap. How would you make a single flap  Take a square. Fold it in half  fold it in half  fold it again  until it gets long and narrow  and then we'll say at the end of that  that's a flap. I could use that for a leg  an arm  anything like that. What paper went into that flap  Well  if I unfold it and go back to the crease pattern  you can see that the upper left corner of that shape is the paper that went into the flap. So that's the flap  and all the rest of the paper's left over. I can use it for something else. Well  there are other ways of making a flap. There are other dimensions for flaps. If I make the flaps skinnier  I can use a bit less paper. If I make the flap as skinny as possible  I get to the limit of the minimum amount of paper needed. And you can see there  it needs a quarter circle of paper to make a flap. There's other ways of making flaps. If I put the flap on the edge  it uses a half circle of paper. And if I make the flap from the middle  it uses a full circle. So  no matter how I make a flap  it needs some part of a circular region of paper. So now we're ready to scale up. What if I want to make something that has a lot of flaps  What do I need  I need a lot of circles. And in the     s  origami artists discovered these principles and realized we could make arbitrarily complicated figures just by packing circles. And here's where the dead people start to help us out  because lots of people have studied the problem of packing circles. I can rely on that vast history of mathematicians and artists looking at disc packings and arrangements. And I can use those patterns now to create origami shapes. So we figured out these rules whereby you pack circles  you decorate the patterns of circles with lines according to more rules. That gives you the folds. Those folds fold into a base. You shape the base. You get a folded shape    in this case  a cockroach. And it's so simple. It's so simple that a computer could do it. And you say   Well  you know  how simple is that   But computers    you need to be able to describe things in very basic terms  and with this  we could. So I wrote a computer program a bunch of years ago called TreeMaker  and you can download it from my website. It's free. It runs on all the major platforms    even Windows. And you just draw a stick figure  and it calculates the crease pattern. It does the circle packing  calculates the crease pattern  and if you use that stick figure that I just showed    which you can kind of tell  it's a deer  it's got antlers    you'll get this crease pattern. And if you take this crease pattern  you fold on the dotted lines  you'll get a base that you can then shape into a deer  with exactly the crease pattern that you wanted. And if you want a different deer  not a white tailed deer  but you want a mule deer  or an elk  you change the packing  and you can do an elk. Or you could do a moose. Or  really  any other kind of deer. These techniques revolutionized this art. We found we could do insects  spiders  which are close  things with legs  things with legs and wings  things with legs and antennae. And if folding a single praying mantis from a single uncut square wasn't interesting enough  then you could do two praying mantises from a single uncut square. She's eating him. I call it  Snack Time.  And you can do more than just insects. This    you can put details  toes and claws. A grizzly bear has claws. This tree frog has toes. Actually  lots of people in origami now put toes into their models. Toes have become an origami meme  because everyone's doing it. You can make multiple subjects. So these are a couple of instrumentalists. The guitar player from a single square  the bass player from a single square. And if you say   Well  but the guitar  bass    that's not so hot. Do a little more complicated instrument.  Well  then you could do an organ. And what this has allowed is the creation of origami on demand. So now people can say   I want exactly this and this and this   and you can go out and fold it. And sometimes you create high art  and sometimes you pay the bills by doing some commercial work. But I want to show you some examples. Everything you'll see here  except the car  is origami. Just to show you  this really was folded paper. Computers made things move  but these were all real  folded objects that we made. And we can use this not just for visuals  but it turns out to be useful even in the real world. Surprisingly  origami and the structures that we've developed in origami turn out to have applications in medicine  in science  in space  in the body  consumer electronics and more. And I want to show you some of these examples. One of the earliest was this pattern  this folded pattern  studied by Koryo Miura  a Japanese engineer. He studied a folding pattern  and realized this could fold down into an extremely compact package that had a very simple opening and closing structure. And he used it to design this solar array. It's an artist's rendition  but it flew in a Japanese telescope in     . Now  there is actually a little origami in the James Webb Space Telescope  but it's very simple. The telescope  going up in space  it unfolds in two places. It folds in thirds. It's a very simple pattern    you wouldn't even call that origami. They certainly didn't need to talk to origami artists. But if you want to go higher and go larger than this  then you might need some origami. Engineers at Lawrence Livermore National Lab had an idea for a telescope much larger. They called it the Eyeglass. The design called for geosynchronous orbit        miles up      meter diameter lens. So  imagine a lens the size of a football field. There were two groups of people who were interested in this  planetary scientists  who want to look up  and then other people  who wanted to look down. Whether you look up or look down  how do you get it up in space  You've got to get it up there in a rocket. And rockets are small. So you have to make it smaller. How do you make a large sheet of glass smaller  Well  about the only way is to fold it up somehow. So you have to do something like this. This was a small model. Folded lens  you divide up the panels  you add flexures. But this pattern's not going to work to get something     meters down to a few meters. So the Livermore engineers  wanting to make use of the work of dead people  or perhaps live origamists  said   Let's see if someone else is doing this sort of thing.  So they looked into the origami community  we got in touch with them  and I started working with them. And we developed a pattern together that scales to arbitrarily large size  but that allows any flat ring or disc to fold down into a very neat  compact cylinder. And they adopted that for their first generation  which was not     meters    it was a five meter. But this is a five meter telescope    has about a quarter mile focal length. And it works perfectly on its test range  and it indeed folds up into a neat little bundle. Now  there is other origami in space. Japan Aerospace  Exploration  Agency flew a solar sail  and you can see here that the sail expands out  and you can still see the fold lines. The problem that's being solved here is something that needs to be big and sheet like at its destination  but needs to be small for the journey. And that works whether you're going into space  or whether you're just going into a body. And this example is the latter. This is a heart stent developed by Zhong You at Oxford University. It holds open a blocked artery when it gets to its destination  but it needs to be much smaller for the trip there  through your blood vessels. And this stent folds down using an origami pattern  based on a model called the water bomb base. Airbag designers also have the problem of getting flat sheets into a small space. And they want to do their design by simulation. So they need to figure out how  in a computer  to flatten an airbag. And the algorithms that we developed to do insects turned out to be the solution for airbags to do their simulation. And so they can do a simulation like this. Those are the origami creases forming  and now you can see the airbag inflate and find out  does it work  And that leads to a really interesting idea. You know  where did these things come from  Well  the heart stent came from that little blow up box that you might have learned in elementary school. It's the same pattern  called the water bomb base. The airbag flattening algorithm came from all the developments of circle packing and the mathematical theory that was really developed just to create insects    things with legs. The thing is  that this often happens in math and science. When you get math involved  problems that you solve for aesthetic value only  or to create something beautiful  turn around and turn out to have an application in the real world. And as weird and surprising as it may sound  origami may someday even save a life. Thanks. As a particle physicist  I study the elementary particles and how they interact on the most fundamental level. For most of my research career  I've been using accelerators  such as the electron accelerator at Stanford University  just up the road  to study things on the smallest scale. But more recently  I've been turning my attention to the universe on the largest scale. Because  as I'll explain to you  the questions on the smallest and the largest scale are actually very connected. So I'm going to tell you about our twenty first century view of the universe  what it's made of and what the big questions in the physical sciences are    at least some of the big questions. So  recently  we have realized that the ordinary matter in the universe    and by ordinary matter  I mean you  me  the planets  the stars  the galaxies    the ordinary matter makes up only a few percent of the content of the universe. Almost a quarter  or approximately a quarter of the matter in the universe  is stuff that's invisible. By invisible  I mean it doesn't absorb in the electromagnetic spectrum. It doesn't emit in the electromagnetic spectrum. It doesn't reflect. It doesn't interact with the electromagnetic spectrum  which is what we use to detect things. It doesn't interact at all. So how do we know it's there  We know it's there by its gravitational effects. In fact  this dark matter dominates the gravitational effects in the universe on a large scale  and I'll be telling you about the evidence for that. What about the rest of the pie  The rest of the pie is a very mysterious substance called dark energy. More about that later  OK. So for now  let's turn to the evidence for dark matter. In these galaxies  especially in a spiral galaxy like this  most of the mass of the stars is concentrated in the middle of the galaxy. This huge mass of all these stars keeps stars in circular orbits in the galaxy. So we have these stars going around in circles like this. As you can imagine  even if you know physics  this should be intuitive  OK    that stars that are closer to the mass in the middle will be rotating at a higher speed than those that are further out here  OK. So what you would expect is that if you measured the orbital speed of the stars  that they should be slower on the edges than on the inside. In other words  if we measured speed as a function of distance    this is the only time I'm going to show a graph  OK    we would expect that it goes down as the distance increases from the center of the galaxy. When those measurements are made  instead what we find is that the speed is basically constant  as a function of distance. If it's constant  that means that the stars out here are feeling the gravitational effects of matter that we do not see. In fact  this galaxy and every other galaxy appears to be embedded in a cloud of this invisible dark matter. And this cloud of matter is much more spherical than the galaxy themselves  and it extends over a much wider range than the galaxy. So we see the galaxy and fixate on that  but it's actually a cloud of dark matter that's dominating the structure and the dynamics of this galaxy. Galaxies themselves are not strewn randomly in space  they tend to cluster. And this is an example of a very  actually  famous cluster  the Coma cluster. And there are thousands of galaxies in this cluster. They're the white  fuzzy  elliptical things here. So these galaxy clusters    we take a snapshot now  we take a snapshot in a decade  it'll look identical. But these galaxies are actually moving at extremely high speeds. They're moving around in this gravitational potential well of this cluster  OK. So all of these galaxies are moving. We can measure the speeds of these galaxies  their orbital velocities  and figure out how much mass is in this cluster. And again  what we find is that there is much more mass there than can be accounted for by the galaxies that we see. Or if we look in other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum  we see that there's a lot of gas in this cluster  as well. But that cannot account for the mass either. In fact  there appears to be about ten times as much mass here in the form of this invisible or dark matter as there is in the ordinary matter  OK. It would be nice if we could see this dark matter a little bit more directly. I'm just putting this big  blue blob on there  OK  to try to remind you that it's there. Can we see it more visually  Yes  we can. And so let me lead you through how we can do this. So here's an observer  it could be an eye  it could be a telescope. And suppose there's a galaxy out here in the universe. How do we see that galaxy  A ray of light leaves the galaxy and travels through the universe for perhaps billions of years before it enters the telescope or your eye. Now  how do we deduce where the galaxy is  Well  we deduce it by the direction that the ray is traveling as it enters our eye  right  We say  the ray of light came this way  the galaxy must be there  OK. Now  suppose I put in the middle a cluster of galaxies    and don't forget the dark matter  OK. Now  if we consider a different ray of light  one going off like this  we now need to take into account what Einstein predicted when he developed general relativity. And that was that the gravitational field  due to mass  will deflect not only the trajectory of particles  but will deflect light itself. So this light ray will not continue in a straight line  but would rather bend and could end up going into our eye. Where will this observer see the galaxy  You can respond. Up  right  We extrapolate backwards and say the galaxy is up here. Is there any other ray of light that could make into the observer's eye from that galaxy  Yes  great. I see people going down like this. So a ray of light could go down  be bent up into the observer's eye  and the observer sees a ray of light here. Now  take into account the fact that we live in a three dimensional universe  OK  a three dimensional space. Are there any other rays of light that could make it into the eye  Yes  The rays would lie on a    I'd like to see    yeah  on a cone. So there's a whole ray of light    rays of light on a cone    that will all be bent by that cluster and make it into the observer's eye. If there is a cone of light coming into my eye  what do I see  A circle  a ring. It's called an Einstein ring. Einstein predicted that  OK. Now  it will only be a perfect ring if the source  the deflector and the eyeball  in this case  are all in a perfectly straight line. If they're slightly skewed  we'll see a different image. Now  you can do an experiment tonight over the reception  OK  to figure out what that image will look like. Because it turns out that there is a kind of lens that we can devise  that has the right shape to produce this kind of effect. We call this gravitational lensing. And so  this is your instrument  OK. But ignore the top part. It's the base that I want you to concentrate  OK. So  actually  at home  whenever we break a wineglass  I save the bottom  take it over to the machine shop. We shave it off  and I have a little gravitational lens  OK. So it's got the right shape to produce the lensing. And so the next thing you need to do in your experiment is grab a napkin. I grabbed a piece of graph paper    I'm a physicist.  Laughter  So  a napkin. Draw a little model galaxy in the middle. And now put the lens over the galaxy  and what you'll find is that you'll see a ring  an Einstein ring. Now  move the base off to the side  and the ring will split up into arcs  OK. And you can put it on top of any image. On the graph paper  you can see how all the lines on the graph paper have been distorted. And again  this is a kind of an accurate model of what happens with the gravitational lensing. OK  so the question is  do we see this in the sky  Do we see arcs in the sky when we look at  say  a cluster of galaxies  And the answer is yes. And so  here's an image from the Hubble Space Telescope. Many of the images you are seeing are earlier from the Hubble Space Telescope. Well  first of all  for the golden shape galaxies    those are the galaxies in the cluster. They're the ones that are embedded in that sea of dark matter that are causing the bending of the light to cause these optical illusions  or mirages  practically  of the background galaxies. So the streaks that you see  all these streaks  are actually distorted images of galaxies that are much further away. So what we can do  then  is based on how much distortion we see in those images  we can calculate how much mass there must be in this cluster. And it's an enormous amount of mass. And also  you can tell by eye  by looking at this  that these arcs are not centered on individual galaxies. They are centered on some more spread out structure  and that is the dark matter in which the cluster is embedded  OK. So this is the closest you can get to kind of seeing at least the effects of the dark matter with your naked eye. OK  so  a quick review then  to see that you're following. So the evidence that we have that a quarter of the universe is dark matter    this gravitationally attracting stuff    is that galaxies  the speed with which stars orbiting galaxies is much too large  it must be embedded in dark matter. The speed with which galaxies within clusters are orbiting is much too large  it must be embedded in dark matter. And we see these gravitational lensing effects  these distortions that say that  again  clusters are embedded in dark matter. OK. So now  let's turn to dark energy. So to understand the evidence for dark energy  we need to discuss something that Stephen Hawking referred to in the previous session. And that is the fact that space itself is expanding. So if we imagine a section of our infinite universe    and so I've put down four spiral galaxies  OK    and imagine that you put down a set of tape measures  so every line on here corresponds to a tape measure  horizontal or vertical  for measuring where things are. If you could do this  what you would find that with each passing day  each passing year  each passing billions of years  OK  the distance between galaxies is getting greater. And it's not because galaxies are moving away from each other through space. They're not necessarily moving through space. They're moving away from each other because space itself is getting bigger  OK. That's what the expansion of the universe or space means. So they're moving further apart. Now  what Stephen Hawking mentioned  as well  is that after the Big Bang  space expanded at a very rapid rate. But because gravitationally attracting matter is embedded in this space  it tends to slow down the expansion of the space  OK. So the expansion slows down with time. So  in the last century  OK  people debated about whether this expansion of space would continue forever  whether it would slow down  you know  will be slowing down  but continue forever  slow down and stop  asymptotically stop  or slow down  stop  and then reverse  so it starts to contract again. So a little over a decade ago  two groups of physicists and astronomers set out to measure the rate at which the expansion of space was slowing down  OK. By how much less is it expanding today  compared to  say  a couple of billion years ago  The startling answer to this question  OK  from these experiments  was that space is expanding at a faster rate today than it was a few billion years ago  OK. So the expansion of space is actually speeding up. This was a completely surprising result. There is no persuasive theoretical argument for why this should happen  OK. No one was predicting ahead of time this is what's going to be found. It was the opposite of what was expected. So we need something to be able to explain that. Now it turns out  in the mathematics  you can put it in as a term that's an energy  but it's a completely different type of energy from anything we've ever seen before. We call it dark energy  and it has this effect of causing space to expand. But we don't have a good motivation for putting it in there at this point  OK. So it's really unexplained as to why we need to put it in. Now  so at this point  then  what I want to really emphasize to you  is that  first of all  dark matter and dark energy are completely different things  OK. There are really two mysteries out there as to what makes up most of the universe  and they have very different effects. Dark matter  because it gravitationally attracts  it tends to encourage the growth of structure  OK. So clusters of galaxies will tend to form  because of all this gravitational attraction. Dark energy  on the other hand  is putting more and more space between the galaxies  makes it  the gravitational attraction between them decrease  and so it impedes the growth of structure. So by looking at things like clusters of galaxies  and how they    their number density  how many there are as a function of time    we can learn about how dark matter and dark energy compete against each other in structure forming. In terms of dark matter  I said that we don't have any  you know  really persuasive argument for dark energy. Do we have anything for dark matter  And the answer is yes. We have well motivated candidates for the dark matter. Now  what do I mean by well motivated  I mean that we have mathematically consistent theories that were actually introduced to explain a completely different phenomenon  OK  things that I haven't even talked about  that each predict the existence of a very weakly interacting  new particle. So  this is exactly what you want in physics  where a prediction comes out of a mathematically consistent theory that was actually developed for something else. But we don't know if either of those are actually the dark matter candidate  OK. One or both  who knows  Or it could be something completely different. Now  we look for these dark matter particles because  after all  they are here in the room  OK  and they didn't come in the door. They just pass through anything. They can come through the building  through the Earth    they're so non interacting. So one way to look for them is to build detectors that are extremely sensitive to a dark matter particle coming through and bumping it. So a crystal that will ring if that happens. So one of my colleagues up the road and his collaborators have built such a detector. And they've put it deep down in an iron mine in Minnesota  OK  deep under the ground  and in fact  in the last couple of days announced the most sensitive results so far. They haven't seen anything  OK  but it puts limits on what the mass and the interaction strength of these dark matter particles are. There's going to be a satellite telescope launched later this year and it will look towards the middle of the galaxy  to see if we can see dark matter particles annihilating and producing gamma rays that could be detected with this. The Large Hadron Collider  a particle physics accelerator  that we'll be turning on later this year. It is possible that dark matter particles might be produced at the Large Hadron Collider. Now  because they are so non interactive  they will actually escape the detector  so their signature will be missing energy  OK. Now  unfortunately  there is a lot of new physics whose signature could be missing energy  so it will be hard to tell the difference. And finally  for future endeavors  there are telescopes being designed specifically to address the questions of dark matter and dark energy    ground based telescopes  and there are three space based telescopes that are in competition right now to be launched to investigate dark matter and dark energy. So in terms of the big questions  what is dark matter  What is dark energy  The big questions facing physics. And I'm sure you have lots of questions  which I very much look forward to addressing over the next    hours  while I'm here. Thank you. Jambo  bonjour  zdravstvujtye  dayo  these are a few of the languages that I've spoken little bits of over the course of the last six weeks  as I've been to    countries I think I'm up to  on this crazy tour I've been doing  checking out various aspects of the project that we're doing. And I'm going to tell you a little bit about later on. And visiting some pretty incredible places  places like Mongolia  Cambodia  New Guinea  South Africa  Tanzania twice    I was here a month ago. And the opportunity to make a whirlwind tour of the world like that is utterly amazing  for lots of reasons. You see some incredible stuff. And you get to make these spot comparisons between people all around the globe. And the thing that you really take away from that  the kind of surface thing that you take away from it  is not that we're all one  although I'm going to tell you about that  but rather how different we are. There is so much diversity around the globe.       different languages spoken by six and a half billion people  all different colors  shapes  sizes. You walk down the street in any big city  you travel like that  and you are amazed at the diversity in the human species. How do we explain that diversity  Well  that's what I'm going to talk about today  is how we're using the tools of genetics  population genetics in particular  to tell us how we generated this diversity  and how long it took. Now  the problem of human diversity  like all big scientific questions    how do you explain something like that    can be broken down into sub questions. And you can ferret away at those little sub questions. First one is really a question of origins. Do we all share a common origin  in fact  And given that we do    and that's the assumption everybody  I think  in this room would make    when was that  When did we originate as a species  How long have we been divergent from each other  And the second question is related  but slightly different. If we do spring from a common source  how did we come to occupy every corner of the globe  and in the process generate all of this diversity  the different ways of life  the different appearances  the different languages around the world  Well  the question of origins  as with so many other questions in biology  seems to have been answered by Darwin over a century ago. In  The Descent of Man   he wrote   In each great region of the world  the living mammals are closely related to the extinct species of the same region. It's therefore probable that Africa was formerly inhabited by extinct apes closely allied to the gorilla and chimpanzee  and as these two species are now man's nearest allies  it's somewhat more probable that our early progenitors lived on the African continent than elsewhere.  So we're done  we can go home    finished the origin question. Well  not quite. Because Darwin was talking about our distant ancestry  our common ancestry with apes. And it is quite clear that apes originated on the African continent. Around    million years ago  they appear in the fossil record. Africa was actually disconnected from the other landmasses at that time  due to the vagaries of plate tectonics  floating around the Indian Ocean. Bumped into Eurasia around    million years ago  and then we had the first African exodus  as we call it. The apes that left at that time ended up in Southeast Asia  became the gibbons and the orangutans. And the ones that stayed on in Africa evolved into the gorillas  the chimpanzees and us. So  yes  if you're talking about our common ancestry with apes  it's very clear  by looking at the fossil record  we started off here. But that's not really the question I'm asking. I'm asking about our human ancestry  things that we would recognize as being like us if they were sitting here in the room. If they were peering over your shoulder  you wouldn't leap back  like that. What about our human ancestry  Because if we go far enough back  we share a common ancestry with every living thing on Earth. DNA ties us all together  so we share ancestry with barracuda and bacteria and mushrooms  if you go far enough back    over a billion years. What we're asking about though is human ancestry. How do we study that  Well  historically  it has been studied using the science of paleoanthropology. Digging things up out of the ground  and largely on the basis of morphology    the way things are shaped  often skull shape    saying   This looks a little bit more like us than that  so this must be my ancestor. This must be who I'm directly descended from.  The field of paleoanthropology  I'll argue  gives us lots of fascinating possibilities about our ancestry  but it doesn't give us the probabilities that we really want as scientists. What do I mean by that  You're looking at a great example here. These are three extinct species of hominids  potential human ancestors. All dug up just west of here in Olduvai Gorge  by the Leakey family. And they're all dating to roughly the same time. From left to right  we've got Homo erectus  Homo habilis  and Australopithecus    now called Paranthropus boisei  the robust australopithecine. Three extinct species  same place  same time. That means that not all three could be my direct ancestor. Which one of these guys am I actually related to  Possibilities about our ancestry  but not the probabilities that we're really looking for. Well  a different approach has been to look at morphology in humans using the only data that people really had at hand until quite recently    again  largely skull shape. The first person to do this systematically was Linnaeus  Carl von Linne  a Swedish botanist  who in the eighteenth century took it upon himself to categorize every living organism on the planet. You think you've got a tough job  And he did a pretty good job. He categorized about        species in  Systema Naturae.  He actually coined the term Homo sapiens    it means wise man in Latin. But looking around the world at the diversity of humans  he said   Well  you know  we seem to come in discreet sub species or categories.  And he talked about Africans and Americans and Asians and Europeans  and a blatantly racist category he termed  Monstrosus   which basically included all the people he didn't like  including imaginary folk like elves. It's easy to dismiss this as the perhaps well intentioned but ultimately benighted musings of an eighteenth century scientist working in the pre Darwinian era. Except  if you had taken physical anthropology as recently as    or    years ago  in many cases you would have learned basically that same classification of humanity. Human races that according to physical anthropologists of        years ago    Carlton Coon is the best example    had been diverging from each other    this was in the post Darwinian era    for over a million years  since the time of Homo erectus. But based on what data  Very little. Very little. Morphology and a lot of guesswork. Well  what I'm going to talk about today  what I'm going to talk about now is a new approach to this problem. Instead of going out and guessing about our ancestry  digging things up out of the ground  possible ancestors  and saying it on the basis of morphology    which we still don't completely understand  we don't know the genetic causes underlying this morphological variation    what we need to do is turn the problem on its head. Because what we're really asking is a genealogical problem  or a genealogical question. What we're trying to do is construct a family tree for everybody alive today. And as any genealogist will tell you    anybody have a member of the family  or maybe you have tried to construct a family tree  trace back in time  You start in the present  with relationships you're certain about. You and your siblings  you have a parent in common. You and your cousins share a grandparent in common. You gradually trace further and further back into the past  adding these ever more distant relationships. But eventually  no matter how good you are at digging up the church records  and all that stuff  you hit what the genealogists call a brick wall. A point beyond which you don't know anything else about your ancestors  and you enter this dark and mysterious realm we call history that we have to feel our way through with whispered guidance. Who were these people who came before  We have no written record. Well  actually  we do. Written in our DNA  in our genetic code    we have a historical document that takes us back in time to the very earliest days of our species. And that's what we study. Now  a quick primer on DNA. I suspect that not everybody in the audience is a geneticist. It is a very long  linear molecule  a coded version of how to make another copy of you. It's your blueprint. It's composed of four subunits  A  C  G and T  we call them. And it's the sequence of those subunits that defines that blueprint. How long is it  Well  it's billions of these subunits in length. A haploid genome    we actually have two copies of all of our chromosomes    a haploid genome is around  .  billion nucleotides in length. And the whole thing  if you add it all together  is over six billion nucleotides long. If you take all the DNA out of one cell in your body  and stretch it end to end  it's around two meters long. If you take all the DNA out of every cell in your body  and you stretch it end to end  it would reach from here to the moon and back  thousands of times. It's a lot of information. And so when you're copying this DNA molecule to pass it on  it's a pretty tough job. Imagine the longest book you can think of   War and Peace.  Now multiply it by    . And imagine copying that by hand. And you're working away until late at night  and you're very  very careful  and you're drinking coffee and you're paying attention  but  occasionally  when you're copying this by hand  you're going to make a little typo  a spelling mistake    substitute an I for an E  or a C for a T. Same thing happens to our DNA as it's being passed on through the generations. It doesn't happen very often. We have a proofreading mechanism built in. But when it does happen  and these changes get transmitted down through the generations  they become markers of descent. If you share a marker with someone  it means you share an ancestor at some point in the past  the person who first had that change in their DNA. And it's by looking at the pattern of genetic variation  the pattern of these markers in people all over the world  and assessing the relative ages when they occurred throughout our history  that we've been able to construct a family tree for everybody alive today. These are two pieces of DNA that we use quite widely in our work. Mitochondrial DNA  tracing a purely maternal line of descent. You get your mtDNA from your mother  and your mother's mother  all the way back to the very first woman. The Y chromosome  the piece of DNA that makes men men  traces a purely paternal line of descent. Everybody in this room  everybody in the world  falls into a lineage somewhere on these trees. Now  even though these are simplified versions of the real trees  they're still kind of complicated  so let's simplify them. Turn them on their sides  combine them so that they look like a tree with the root at the bottom and the branches going up. What's the take home message  Well  the thing that jumps out at you first is that the deepest lineages in our family trees are found within Africa  among Africans. That means that Africans have been accumulating this mutational diversity for longer. And what that means is that we originated in Africa. It's written in our DNA. Every piece of DNA we look at has greater diversity within Africa than outside of Africa. And at some point in the past  a sub group of Africans left the African continent to go out and populate the rest of the world. Now  how recently do we share this ancestry  Was it millions of years ago  which we might suspect by looking at all this incredible variation around the world  No  the DNA tells a story that's very clear. Within the last         years  we all share an ancestor  a single person    Mitochondrial Eve  you might have heard about her    in Africa  an African woman who gave rise to all the mitochondrial diversity in the world today. But what's even more amazing is that if you look at the Y chromosome side  the male side of the story  the Y chromosome Adam only lived around        years ago. That's only about       human generations  the blink of an eye in an evolutionary sense. That tells us we were all still living in Africa at that time. This was an African man who gave rise to all the Y chromosome diversity around the world. It's only within the last        years that we have started to generate this incredible diversity we see around the world. Such an amazing story. We're all effectively part of an extended African family. Now  that seems so recent. Why didn't we start to leave earlier  Why didn't Homo erectus evolve into separate species  or sub species rather  human races around the world  Why was it that we seem to have come out of Africa so recently  Well  that's a big question. These  why  questions  particularly in genetics and the study of history in general  are always the big ones  the ones that are tough to answer. And so when all else fails  talk about the weather. What was going on to the world's weather around        years ago  Well  we were going into the worst part of the last ice age. The last ice age started roughly         years ago. It went up and down  and it really started to accelerate around        years ago. Lots of evidence from sediment cores and the pollen types  oxygen isotopes and so on. We hit the last glacial maximum around        years ago  but basically  from        years on  things were getting really tough  getting very cold. The Northern Hemisphere had massive growing ice sheets. New York City  Chicago  Seattle  all under a sheet of ice. Most of Britain  all of Scandinavia  covered by ice several kilometers thick. Now  Africa is the most tropical continent on the planet    about    percent of it lies between Cancer and Capricorn    and there aren't a lot of glaciers here  except on the high mountains here in East Africa. So what was going on here  We weren't covered in ice in Africa. Rather  Africa was drying out at that time. This is a paleo climatological map of what Africa looked like between        and        years ago  reconstructed from all these pieces of evidence that I mentioned before. The reason for that is that ice actually sucks moisture out of the atmosphere. If you think about Antarctica  it's technically a desert  it gets so little precipitation. So the whole world was drying out. The sea levels were dropping. And Africa was turning to desert. The Sahara was much bigger then than it is now. And the human habitat was reduced to just a few small pockets  compared to what we have today. The evidence from genetic data is that the human population around this time  roughly        years ago  crashed to fewer than       individuals. We nearly went extinct. We were hanging on by our fingernails. And then something happened. A great illustration of it. Look at some stone tools. The ones on the left are from Africa  from around a million years ago. The ones on the right were made by Neanderthals  our distant cousins  not our direct ancestors  living in Europe  and they date from around        or        years ago. Now  at the risk of offending any paleoanthropologists or physical anthropologists in the audience  basically there's not a lot of change between these two stone tool groups. The ones on the left are pretty similar to the ones on the right. We are in a period of long cultural stasis from a million years ago until around        to        years ago. The tool styles don't change that much. The evidence is that the human way of life didn't change that much during that period. But then            thousand years ago  somewhere in that region  all hell breaks loose. Art makes its appearance. The stone tools become much more finely crafted. The evidence is that humans begin to specialize in particular prey species  at particular times of the year. The population size started to expand. Probably  according to what many linguists believe  fully modern language  syntactic language    subject  verb  object    that we use to convey complex ideas  like I'm doing now  appeared around that time. We became much more social. The social networks expanded. This change in behavior allowed us to survive these worsening conditions in Africa  and they allowed us to start to expand around the world. We've been talking at this conference about African success stories. Well  you want the ultimate African success story  Look in the mirror. You're it. The reason you're alive today is because of those changes in our brains that took place in Africa    probably somewhere in the region where we're sitting right now  around        thousand years ago    allowing us not only to survive in Africa  but to expand out of Africa. An early coastal migration along the south coast of Asia  leaving Africa around        years ago  reaching Australia very rapidly  by        years ago. A slightly later migration up into the Middle East. These would have been savannah hunters. So those of you who are going on one of the post conference tours  you'll get to see what a real savannah is like. And it's basically a meat locker. People who would have specialized in killing the animals  hunting the animals on those meat locker savannahs  moving up  following the grasslands into the Middle East around        years ago  during one of the rare wet phases in the Sahara. Migrating eastward  following the grasslands  because that's what they were adapted to live on. And when they reached Central Asia  they reached what was effectively a steppe super highway  a grassland super highway. The grasslands at that time    this was during the last ice age    stretched basically from Germany all the way over to Korea  and the entire continent was open to them. Entering Europe around        years ago  and finally  a small group migrating up through the worst weather imaginable  Siberia  inside the Arctic Circle  during the last ice age    temperature was at           even       perhaps    migrating into the Americas  ultimately reaching that final frontier. An amazing story  and it happened first in Africa. The changes that allowed us to do that  the evolution of this highly adaptable brain that we all carry around with us  allowing us to create novel cultures  allowing us to develop the diversity that we see on a whirlwind trip like the one I've just been on. Now  that story I just told you is literally a whirlwind tour of how we populated the world  the great Paleolithic wanderings of our species. And that's the story that I told a couple of years ago in my book   The Journey of Man   and a film that we made with the same title. And as we were finishing up that film    it was co produced with National Geographic    I started talking to the folks at NG about this work. And they got really excited about it. They liked the film  but they said   You know  we really see this as kind of the next wave in the study of human origins  where we all came from  using the tools of DNA to map the migrations around the world. You know  the study of human origins is kind of in our DNA  and we want to take it to the next level. What do you want to do next   Which is a great question to be asked by National Geographic. And I said   Well  you know  what I've sketched out here is just that. It is a very coarse sketch of how we migrated around the planet. And it's based on a few thousand people we've sampled from  you know  a handful of populations around the world. Studied a few genetic markers  and there are lots of gaps on this map. We've just connected the dots. What we need to do is increase our sample size by an order of magnitude or more    hundreds of thousands of DNA samples from people all over the world.  And that was the genesis of the Genographic Project. The project launched in April     . It has three core components. Obviously  science is a big part of it. The field research that we're doing around the world with indigenous peoples. People who have lived in the same location for a long period of time retain a connection to the place where they live that many of the rest of us have lost. So my ancestors come from all over northern Europe. I live in the Eastern Seaboard of North America when I'm not traveling. Where am I indigenous to  Nowhere really. My genes are all jumbled up. But there are people who retain that link to their ancestors that allows us to contextualize the DNA results. That's the focus of the field research  the centers that we've set up all over the world       of them  top population geneticists. But  in addition  we wanted to open up this study to anybody around the world. How often do you get to participate in a big scientific project  The Human Genome Project  or a Mars Rover mission. In this case  you actually can. You can go onto our website  Nationalgeographic.com genographic. You can order a kit. You can test your own DNA. And you can actually submit those results to the database  and tell us a little about your genealogical background  have the data analyzed as part of the scientific effort. Now  this is all a nonprofit enterprise  and so the money that we raise  after we cover the cost of doing the testing and making the kit components  gets plowed back into the project. The majority going to something we call the Legacy Fund. It's a charitable entity  basically a grant giving entity that gives money back to indigenous groups around the world for educational  cultural projects initiated by them. They apply to this fund in order to do various projects  and I'll show you a couple of examples. So how are we doing on the project  We've got about        samples collected from indigenous people around the world. The most amazing thing has been the interest on the part of the public          people have ordered these participation kits since we launched two years ago  which has raised around five million dollars  the majority of which  at least half  is going back into the Legacy Fund. We've just awarded the first Legacy Grants totaling around         dollars. Projects around the world    documenting oral poetry in Sierra Leone  preserving traditional weaving patterns in Gaza  language revitalization in Tajikistan  etc.  etc. So the project is going very  very well  and I urge you to check out the website and watch this space. Thank you very much. Let's just start by looking at some great photographs. This is an icon of National Geographic  an Afghan refugee taken by Steve McCurry. But the Harvard Lampoon is about to come out with a parody of National Geographic  and I shudder to think what they're going to do to this photograph. Oh  the wrath of Photoshop. This is a jet landing at San Francisco  by Bruce Dale. He mounted a camera on the tail. A poetic image for a story on Tolstoy  by Sam Abell. Pygmies in the DRC  by Randy Olson. I love this photograph because it reminds me of Degas' bronze sculptures of the little dancer. A polar bear swimming in the Arctic  by Paul Nicklen. Polar bears need ice to be able to move back and forth    they're not very good swimmers    and we know what's happening to the ice. These are camels moving across the Rift Valley in Africa  photographed by Chris Johns. Shot straight down  so these are the shadows of the camels. This is a rancher in Texas  by William Albert Allard  a great portraitist. And Jane Goodall  making her own special connection  photographed by Nick Nichols. This is a soap disco in Spain  photographed by David Alan Harvey. And David said that there was lot of weird stuff happening on the dance floor. But  hey  at least it's hygienic. These are sea lions in Australia doing their own dance  by David Doubilet. And this is a comet  captured by Dr. Euan Mason. And finally  the bow of the Titanic  without movie stars  photographed by Emory Kristof. Photography carries a power that holds up under the relentless swirl of today's saturated  media world  because photographs emulate the way that our mind freezes a significant moment. Here's an example. Four years ago  I was at the beach with my son  and he was learning how to swim in this relatively soft surf of the Delaware beaches. But I turned away for a moment  and he got caught into a riptide and started to be pulled out towards the jetty. I can stand here right now and see  as I go tearing into the water after him  the moments slowing down and freezing into this arrangement. I can see the rocks are over here. There's a wave about to crash onto him. I can see his hands reaching out  and I can see his face in terror  looking at me  saying   Help me  Dad.  I got him. The wave broke over us. We got back on shore  he was fine. We were a little bit rattled. But this flashbulb memory  as it's called  is when all the elements came together to define not just the event  but my emotional connection to it. And this is what a photograph taps into when it makes its own powerful connection to a viewer. Now I have to tell you  I was talking to Kyle last week about this  that I was going to tell this story. And he said   Oh  yeah  I remember that too  I remember my image of you was that you were up on the shore yelling at me.  I thought I was a hero. So  this represents    this is a cross sample of some remarkable images taken by some of the world's greatest photojournalists  working at the very top of their craft    except one. This photograph was taken by Dr. Euan Mason in New Zealand last year  and it was submitted and published in National Geographic. Last year  we added a section to our website called  Your Shot   where anyone can submit photographs for possible publication. And it has become a wild success  tapping into the enthusiast photography community. The quality of these amateur photographs can  at times  be amazing. And seeing this reinforces  for me  that every one of us has at least one or two great photographs in them. But to be a great photojournalist  you have to have more than just one or two great photographs in you. You've got to be able to make them all the time. But even more importantly  you need to know how to create a visual narrative. You need to know how to tell a story. So I'm going to share with you some coverages that I feel demonstrate the storytelling power of photography. Photographer Nick Nichols went to document a very small and relatively unknown wildlife sanctuary in Chad  called Zakouma. The original intent was to travel there and bring back a classic story of diverse species  of an exotic locale. And that is what Nick did  up to a point. This is a serval cat. He's actually taking his own picture  shot with what's called a camera trap. There's an infrared beam that's going across  and he has stepped into the beam and taken his photograph. These are baboons at a watering hole. Nick    the camera  again  an automatic camera took thousands of pictures of this. And Nick ended up with a lot of pictures of the rear ends of baboons. A lion having a late night snack    notice he's got a broken tooth. And a crocodile walks up a riverbank toward its den. I love this little bit of water that comes off the back of his tail. But the centerpiece species of Zakouma are the elephants. It's one of the largest intact herds in this part of Africa. Here's a photograph shot in moonlight  something that digital photography has made a big difference for. It was with the elephants that this story pivoted. Nick  along with researcher Dr. Michael Fay  collared the matriarch of the herd. They named her Annie  and they began tracking her movements. The herd was safe within the confines of the park  because of this dedicated group of park rangers. But once the annual rains began  the herd would begin migrating to feeding grounds outside the park. And that's when they ran into trouble. For outside the safety of the park were poachers  who would hunt them down only for the value of their ivory tusks. The matriarch that they were radio tracking  after weeks of moving back and forth  in and out of the park  came to a halt outside the park. Annie had been killed  along with    members of her herd. And they only came for the ivory. This is actually one of the rangers. They were able to chase off one of the poachers and recover this ivory  because they couldn't leave it there  because it's still valuable. But what Nick did was he brought back a story that went beyond the old school method of just straight   Isn't this an amazing world   And instead  created a story that touched our audiences deeply. Instead of just knowledge of this park  he created an understanding and an empathy for the elephants  the rangers and the many issues surrounding human wildlife conflicts. Now let's go over to India. Sometimes you can tell a broad story in a focused way. We were looking at the same issue that Richard Wurman touches upon in his new world population project. For the first time in history  more people live in urban  rather than rural  environments. And most of that growth is not in the cities  but in the slums that surround them. Jonas Bendiksen  a very energetic photographer  came to me and said   We need to document this  and here's my proposal. Let's go all over the world and photograph every single slum around the world.  And I said   Well  you know  that might be a bit ambitious for our budget.  So instead  what we did was we decided to  instead of going out and doing what would result in what we'd consider sort of a survey story    where you just go in and see just a little bit of everything    we put Jonas into Dharavi  which is part of Mumbai  India  and let him stay there  and really get into the heart and soul of this really major part of the city. What Jonas did was not just go and do a surface look at the awful conditions that exist in such places. He saw that this was a living and breathing and vital part of how the entire urban area functioned. By staying tightly focused in one place  Jonas tapped into the soul and the enduring human spirit that underlies this community. And he did it in a beautiful way. Sometimes  though  the only way to tell a story is with a sweeping picture. We teamed up underwater photographer Brian Skerry and photojournalist Randy Olson to document the depletion of the world's fisheries. We weren't the only ones to tackle this subject  but the photographs that Brian and Randy created are among the best to capture both the human and natural devastation of overfishing. Here  in a photo by Brian  a seemingly crucified shark is caught up in a gill net off of Baja. I've seen sort of OK pictures of bycatch  the animals accidentally scooped up while fishing for a specific species. But here  Brian captured a unique view by positioning himself underneath the boat when they threw the waste overboard. And Brian then went on to even greater risk to get this never before made photograph of a trawl net scraping the ocean bottom. Back on land  Randy Olson photographed a makeshift fish market in Africa  where the remains of filleted fish were sold to the locals  the main parts having already been sent to Europe. And here in China  Randy shot a jellyfish market. As prime food sources are depleted  the harvest goes deeper into the oceans and brings in more such sources of protein. This is called fishing down the food chain. But there are also glimmers of hope  and I think anytime we're doing a big  big story on this  we don't really want to go and just look at all the problems. We also want to look for solutions. Brian photographed a marine sanctuary in New Zealand  where commercial fishing had been banned    the result being that the overfished species have been restored  and with them a possible solution for sustainable fisheries. Photography can also compel us to confront issues that are potentially distressing and controversial. James Nachtwey  who was honored at last year's TED  took a look at the sweep of the medical system that is utilized to handle the American wounded coming out of Iraq. It is like a tube where a wounded soldier enters on one end and exits back home  on the other. Jim started in the battlefield. Here  a medical technician tends to a wounded soldier on the helicopter ride back to the field hospital. Here is in the field hospital. The soldier on the right has the name of his daughter tattooed across his chest  as a reminder of home. From here  the more severely wounded are transported back to Germany  where they meet up with their families for the first time. And then back to the States to recuperate at veterans' hospitals  such as here in Walter Reed. And finally  often fitted with high tech prosthesis  they exit the medical system and attempt to regain their pre war lives. Jim took what could have been a straight up medical science story and gave it a human dimension that touched our readers deeply. Now  these stories are great examples of how photography can be used to address some of our most important topics. But there are also times when photographers simply encounter things that are  when it comes down to it  just plain fun. Photographer Paul Nicklin traveled to Antarctica to shoot a story on leopard seals. They have been rarely photographed  partly because they are considered one of the most dangerous predators in the ocean. In fact  a year earlier  a researcher had been grabbed by one and pulled down to depth and killed. So you can imagine Paul was maybe a little bit hesitant about getting into the water. Now  what leopard seals do mostly is  they eat penguins. You know of  The March of the Penguins.  This is sort of the munch of the penguins. Here a penguin goes up to the edge and looks out to see if the coast is clear. And then everybody kind of runs out and goes out. But then Paul got in the water. And he said he was never really afraid of this. Well  this one female came up to him. She's probably    it's a shame you can't see it in the photograph  but she's    feet long. So  she is pretty significant in size. And Paul said he was never really afraid  because she was more curious about him than threatened. This mouthing behavior  on the right  was really her way of saying to him   Hey  look how big I am   Or you know   My  what big teeth you have.  Then Paul thinks that she simply took pity on him. To her  here was this big  goofy creature in the water that for some reason didn't seem to be interested in chasing penguins. So what she did was she started to bring penguins to him  alive  and put them in front of him. She dropped them off  and then they would swim away. She'd kind of look at him  like  What are you doing   Go back and get them  and then bring them back and drop them in front of him. And she did this over the course of a couple of days  until the point where she got so frustrated with him that she started putting them directly on top of his head. Which just resulted in a fantastic photograph. Eventually  though  Paul thinks that she just figured that he was never going to survive. This is her just puffing out  you know  snorting out in disgust. And lost interest with him  and went back to what she does best. Paul set out to photograph a relatively mysterious and unknown creature  and came back with not just a collection of photographs  but an amazing experience and a great story. It is these kinds of stories  ones that go beyond the immediate or just the superficial that demonstrate the power of photojournalism. I believe that photography can make a real connection to people  and can be employed as a positive agent for understanding the challenges and opportunities facing our world today. Thank you. My favorite topic is shortcuts. The master of shortcuts    it's  of course  nature. But I will demonstrate different ways to get rid of difficulties and go to the point  to find an answer probably much quicker than Arthur did. So  first  we violate the common sense  the logic. All of you  if you hold your hand like this     degrees    all of you. Not you. All of you  right  Palm up. If you do this  the common  the logic says you must turn the wrist. Do you agree  Good. But I will first teach you a method  how you can do it without moving the wrist  and then the shortcut. You can do it immediately  right  Hold the hand like this  palm up. Don't move the wrist. The wrist is    I doesn't speak very many  but I do the best  what I are. Right molded you say  with iron  That was a joke  actually  and I    OK. Hold the hand palm up. Do this  don't move the wrist. Over the heart  don't move the wrist. Forward  don't move the wrist. Up  don't move the wrist. Over the heart  don't move the wrist. And forward. Yeah. Now    logic  logically  you have got to this position from this  without moving the wrist. Now  the shortcut. But it was six moves. Now with one move. I start here  palm down  you can follow. And then look at me. Yeah   Laughter  One move. OK. So  that was the warming up. Now  I need an assistant. I talked to a nice girl before  Zoe. She has left. No  A big hand. Good. Nice. And you can sit over there. One item here was water  right  And I will give my tribute to water. I think it's enough with water for me. The other guys can talk about    cheers. Beer has about    there's a lot of water in beer. So  now I will demonstrate different ways of memorizing  control cards and so on. And I think I'll take off this one. I work with a special method to do it  quick. I work with precision    oh  sorry    control and a very powerful ... memory system  right  So  if    I have studied the poker. I like to gamble. Officially  I don't gamble but ... So  if we are    if we have five person  and I will do a five handed poker game. Now I will interact. So a different person all the time  so not the same person can answer. So we have an agreement. Which one shall have a good poker hand  Which number  One  two  three  four or five   Audience  Three.  Lennart Green  Three    good. And here  I had a mat here to make it a little    the critical moment is    sorry. If a card shark gathers the cards together  immediately when he    before he deals the card. Now  so I think  number three  I have arranged them in a full house. With queens and    it's OK    queens and tens. That's a challenge. I like this. I will explain later. One  two  three  four  five. I start with three queens. So here you see the contrast when I treat the cards. And two tens. Yeah. Thank you. But also the other hand is good  if all the other guys have good hands too. So these guys have actually a stronger hand    three aces and two kings. This guy beats them with four of a kind  or deuce    deuce. No reaction  That with even    OK  and this. These look in order  I'm probably    hopefully    yeah. Three  four  five  six  seven and ... But  of course  I will have the winning hand. Ten  jack  queen  king  ace. Yeah. So  good. So the hand that looks so good from the beginning  number three  at the end was actually the lowest hand. Such life. Right  So  please mix them. Now  if you are interested  I will demonstrate some underground techniques. Yes  I work with kind of estimation  shuffle tracking    ah  good. Impressive. Thank you. So  first  the first term is estimation. Here  I can estimate exactly how many cards are put between my royal flush. Of course  I can count the cards  but this is much quicker. Right  You agree. So here I have  actually    I know exactly where the cards are. So here  I can make a bet  and this is actually one of the points where I get my money. So here      jack  queen  king  ace. OK. Next is a term    I do it quick. I call this stealing. So here  I think I know about where the cards are. I will spread the cards and you'll say stop  when I point to them  right. Point  say stop. Zoe  Stop. LG  Here    you see some are missing  And that's the stealing cards  which I did. OK. Now  another term called shuffle tracking. Shuffle tracking means I keep track of the cards  even if another person shuffles. This is a little risky. So    because if you look  now  I can still see it. You agree  But if you square    square  and shuffle  and then a cut. So here  to follow my cards  I must look at the shuffle from the begin    ah  we are started together. It's OK  it's OK. Come to    no  no  no  no. I'm joking  yeah  Any style    yeah  good. Here I have to calculate  but actually  I don't like to calculate. I work direct with the right brain. If you pass the left brain  you have to take care of logic and common sense. Direct in the right brain  that's much better. And so    Arthur Benjamin did a little of the same thing. And if you work with  in the right atmosphere  with humor  you have    that's the password to the cosmic bank of knowledge  where you can find any solution of any problem. OK. Now  I drop the cards  and you say stop anyway  right  Not at the last card. Zoe  Stop. LG  Yeah. When I'm sober  I do this much quicker  but we will check. Ah  not in order  it    that was a mistake. No  I'm kidding. No  now and then I put in a mistake  just to emphasize how difficult it is. Right  Yeah  last night I forgot that. That was a mistake. But now I'm glad I remember it. So  this deck is bought here. Sorry. I have a little pad to make it a little softer. This deck is bought here in America. It's called  Bicycle.  And this deck is very flexible  but not so many people know  if you check  if you press at the right spots  you see how thin and flexible this deck is  right  Now  you can carry this in your wallet  so ... You don't see it  make no reaction  So  but here  and    is the camera getting too much  No. Yeah   Audience  It's getting too much.  LG  Pardon  But then  when we will have it back  you do this. But not too much. Then you have to push it down again. Here  please. If you push these heaps    everyone see    push them together so they are really interlaced  right  Yeah  good. Perfect. Just push them through  good. Thank you. And then  I will demonstrate a thing from Russian satellite  stealen    stolen  probably copied from America but we will see. Here    shortcuts. I talk about shortcuts. Now I go very quick through the deck and try to find some pattern. The new chaos theory is already old  right  But you know  I think you are familiar with fractals    the Mandelbrot spirals and all these things. And it's much easier to memorize cards in a pattern way  and not concentrate. If you concentrate and calculate  then you go to    then it's the left brain. But if you just look and talk in another language ... Yeah  great. I think I have it. So now  different persons  older  tap. Please name any card  anyone. Jack of spades. I think jack of spades is number    from the top. One  two  three  four  five  six  seven  eight  nine            . Yes  right. So    oh  jack of spades. You said spades   Audience  Yes.  LG  Ah. My fault. Don't applaud  this was clubs. So  jack of spades. I think ...           sorry    . One  two  three  four  five  six  seven  eight  nine                                                            ah      yes. It's the last. Now  I do it quicker  better. OK. Another person. Oh  I forgot  I shouldn't shuffle but I think       actually  my technique is to peek  all the time. When I lift the heap  I peek. You see  yeah  perfect. Three  four  five  six. Then I calculate    yeah  good. Another person  another card.  Audience  Seven of diamonds.  LG  Seven of diamonds. Perfect  my favorite  yeah  seven. So I will do it quick  very quick  but in slow motion  so you can follow. Seven of   Audience  Diamonds.  LG  Diamonds  good. I start here. Good  thank you. The thing I did    I peeked. I know where the card were  then I chose it. So another person  another card. Another person. LG  Pardon  LG  Ten of diamonds  yeah. I think I do it the same way. I like to  so I know where it is. Ten of diamonds. But now I do it the regular speed  right  Ten of diamonds. Good. Maybe you will cut  Lift. Excellent. So  thank you. Another person  another card. LG  Pardon   Audience  Five of clubs.  LG  Five of clubs. It's not the same person  even if it's the same spot. We can take some over there later. So now  I will drop the cards. And you'll say stop  anywhere. Got it  Five of clubs. Not the last. Yes  that's difficult to find a card here. We do it again. The person who said five of clubs say stop  when the cards are in the air  right  LG  Very good. OK. OK  I had to use a little force there. I think we save five of clubs. And now a card with a contrast of five of clubs. Excellent. I love that card. Here  I will do the most difficult thing. For example  you are sitting in Las Vegas  and you're betting  and you let the other guys peek this card by mistake. Feel  it's just the regular  one card. And now  when I lift this card  it shall be your card. What was your card  LG  Queen of  Queen of hearts. So that's a tough challenge  right  So here  I grab    you know this  Five of clubs ... and queen of hearts. Yes  This is a tough one  because here I must take advantage of    I switch it with the five of clubs. So  now a false count. Which card shall I use  Queen or five  Zoe  The queen. LG  Queen  yes. So  I use the queen  and here's five of clubs. The false count    and the number one  two  three  four  five  six  seven  eight    you say the same card all the time. Eight  nine    . This is a kind of optical deal  right  When I put one card at a table    look  it's not one card. It's    look  it's a bunch of cards that gives this impression. Yeah. Now some hard stuff. I think we keep the queen here  yes. Now  to the satellites things. This    oh sorry  don't look at the beam. My fault. This is high frequency laser  and it's enough with a fraction of a second to destroy the retina completely. Right  sorry  my    I should have mentioned that  yeah. But you can relax  because it takes half an hour before it works  so you have plenty of time to see my whole performance. Now  I put the laser here  and    now  when I deal the cards in the laser  I know where they are but    yes  Did the camera got it  No  They didn't  What happened  LG  OK  I'll take another group. Do the cameras see the cards now  No   Audience  No  they're all gone.  LG  But you see the hand. Ah  good  good  good. But now. So now  that was the reason  right  You see the cards  Yes. Yeah  good. Now       one guy laughed. So now  to find the queen  do it this way  take back the other one  take back the queen. Yeah  interesting  but a little dangerous. I liked it. Now  a little more difficult. Name    anyone  name  please  any suit. So here  here I have to peek  lots of cards. I think there are lots of    I don't know how many    but        spades in a deck  at least  right  So every time I lift the heap  I peek  right. Then I arrange them so I can get them quick. Perfect  excellent. So I start with the ace    yeah  ace. Ah  yeah    spades  Same mistake as before  right  So    I arrange the spades    the clubs. I try to do this right here. First  I take the spades. You see  I don't work with prestige  so always do mistakes. It doesn't matter to me. And now and then  I get some extra sympathy points  right  One  two  three  four    yes  the camera got it  Five  six  seven  eight    ah    nine      the jack  jack of spades  queen of    I like that laugh  yeah  Good. Queen. Wait  wait  wait    please take any card. Grab any one. Quick  quick  good. And we switch this to the king. Ace of diamonds. And now  look  ace of diamonds will guide. So I find ... king of spades. There was the place. And here is king of spades  correct  Yeah  OK. Now  a little more difficult thing. Maybe you think I have the cards in order already  so you help me to shuffle again. Another suit  please. LG  It was after the blindfold. I like this guy  yeah. OK. That should be my end effect  but OK. Armani    who said Armani  You  I drop the cards and you    which size  Which size  It's a piece of cake. I like challenges. Which size  Say stop.  Audience  Stop.  LG  Yeah  Armani. OK. Ah  this is tough. OK  a suit. I had clubs before  spades. Another suit.  Audience  Diamonds.  LG  Diamonds  perfect. So  in this case  I try to locate diamonds. I look at the cards  and OK. We try. Yeah. You help me. If I drop the card face up  like this  you reverse it. Zoe  OK. LG  OK  now. Do with both hands  and quick. Yes  good  good. I think we have it now. Yeah  good  good. So here  diamonds  hearts    no  diamonds. Good  good. Stop. Do you see the pattern  No  Now  Yes  yes  OK. I work with pattern. Oh sorry  I dropped one. Maybe it's important    yeah    nine of diamonds  OK. So now    I always ask  why do I put myself in this position  I have to figure out so many outs  when I miss some cards  but I love it. So now  I will do it. I will try to find the diamonds  but I will do it the hard way. It's too easy to do it right away  right  I think I will do it ... blindfolded. At this distance  it works immediately. Aargh  Duct tape. I look    shake the cards  so I don't. Go ahead. Yeah  good. I like the empathy. Empathy. But it was    did you hear  It was women's voice. Hear the guy    yeah  more  more  more. Yeah  good. Yeah. You can take the nostril too  because some guys think       some guys think I can peek through the nostril  so do more. Go  go. Right  Good. Satisfied  Looks good  like Batman. Ow  No  with dignity and elegance  right  But I like her  yeah. I said  be a little tough. And it was OK. One more  The last. OK. All right. Now you must agree that I'm    I must rely on other senses  right  I work with vibration. So  what was the card  Diamonds. Ah  I memorized hearts. So now I have to improvise again. Maybe I'll stand up. Half. Diamonds    I'll start with ace of diamonds. Just kidding  warming up    king of hearts. And I give you a diamonds  so they    so you put them here  in a nice row  right. And you can see  yeah  Good. Ace of diamonds  yes  Zoe  Yeah. LG  Good. Good. Two     Applause     thank you. I never ever miss two. This is interesting. Always I've found two  but the wrong color. Spades  sorry. And the deck is a gift to you after  so let the skepticals here  in this  examine them  right  Remind me. It's a gift. Two    and it was two of spades  right  Sorry  two of diamonds. I'll do it quick now. Three    three of diamonds. Yes  Four    I like challenges  yes. Yeah  good. Chris Anderson  You're peeking. LG  Pardon  CA  You're peeking. You just got to    this is a request from the lady in the back. Okay. Try that. LG  Yeah. Also listen. OK  now. This is maybe a little tough. We will try. Yes  Good  OK. So  how many cards  Five  Zoe  Four. LG  Four. Is five the next card  Zoe  Five of diamonds  yeah. LG  It's not here  Zoe  It's not there. LG  Oh. So here  all the cards are face down    you agree   Audience  Yes.  LG  Yes  You see that in the screen  And this is face up  and it's not at the bottom here. So next card will be    was it five  Zoe  Five. LG  Yeah    I will reverse it face up here. Yes  Zoe  Yeah. LG  Six    six with the thumb. Seven. Yeah  I do this. I know where it is  because I peeked before and then I do this. Right  Eight. If    and then nine  right  Yeah. Yesterday    the day before yesterday  I was in Vegas  and I used this actually. Nine  Yeah  Correct  No  Yes  Ah  good  good. Ten    once again  I love this Jonny Wayne move. Yeah. Jack    you  unclear  with Jack  Jack of diamonds  correct   Audience  No.  LG  Yes  And queen  Queen  with misdirection. Misdirection.  Applause  Yeah  And then  king  after exactly five seconds. Yeah. Five. Five seconds. One  two  three  four    mmm  Check it. Yes  CA  King of diamonds. LG  Ah  Good. Oh. Touch me  feel    ah  ah  you know  CA  Ladies and gentlemen  Lennart Green  LG  Okay  thank you. Dogs have interests. They have interest sniffing each other  chasing squirrels. And if we don't make that a reward in training  that will be a distraction. It's always sort of struck me as really a scary thought that if you see a dog in a park  and the owner is calling it  and the owner says  you know   Puppy  come here  come here   and the dog thinks   Hmm  interesting. I'm sniffing this other dog's rear end  the owner's calling.  It's a difficult choice  right  Rear end  owner. Rear end wins. I mean  you lose. You cannot compete with the environment  if you have an adolescent dog's brain. So  when we train  we're always trying to take into account the dog's point of view. Now  I'm here largely because there's kind of a rift in dog training at the moment that    on one side  we have people who think that you train a dog  number one  by making up rules  human rules. We don't take the dog's point of view into account. So the human says   You're going to act this way  damn it. We're going to force you to act against your will  to bend to our will.  Then  number two  we keep these rules a secret from the dog. And then number three  now we can punish the dog for breaking rules he didn't even know existed. So you get a little puppy  he comes. His only crime is he grew. When he was a little puppy  he puts his paws on your leg    you know  isn't that nice  And you go   Oh  there's a good boy.  You bend down  you pat him    you reward him for jumping up. His one mistake is he's a Tibetan mastiff  and a few months later  he weighs  you know     pounds. Every time he jumps up  he gets all sorts of abuse. I mean  it is really very  very scary the abuse that dogs get. So  this whole dominance issue    number one  what we get in dog training is this Mickey Mouse interpretation of a very complicated social system. And they take this stuff seriously. Male dogs are very serious about a hierarchy  because it prevents physical fights. Of course  female dogs  bitches  on the other hand  have several bitch amendments to male hierarchical rule. The number one is   I have it  you don't.  And what you will find is a very  very low ranking bitch will quite easily keep a bone away from a high ranking male. So  we get in dog training this notion of dominances  or of the alpha dog. I'm sure that you've heard this. Dogs get so abused. Dogs  horses and humans    these are the three species which are so abused in life. And the reason is built into their behavior    is to always come back and apologize. Like   Oh  I'm sorry you had to beat me. I'm really sorry  yes  it's my fault.  They are just so beatable  and that's why they get beaten. The poor puppy jumps up  you open the dog book  what does it say   Hold his front paws  squeeze his front paws  stamp on his hind feet  squirt him in the face with lemon juice  hit him on the head with a rolled up newspaper  knee him in the chest  flip him over backwards.  Because he grew  And because he's performing a behavior you've trained him to do  This is insanity. I ask owners   Well  how would you like the dog to greet you   And people say   Well  I don't know  to sit  I guess.  I said   Let's teach him to sit.  And then we give him a reason for sitting. Because the first stage is basically teaching a dog ESL. I could speak to you and say   Laytay chai  paisey  paisey.  Go on  something should happen now. Why aren't you responding  Oh  you don't speak Swahili. Well  I've got news for you. The dog doesn't speak English  or American  or Spanish  or French. So the first stage in training is to teach the dog ESL  English as a second language. And that's how we use the food lure in the hand  and we use food because we're dealing with owners. My wife doesn't need food    she's a great trainer  much better than I am. I don't need food  but the average owner says   Puppy  sit.  Or they go   Sit  sit  sit.  They're making a hand signal in front of the dog's rectum for some reason  like the dog has a third eye there    it's insane. You know   Sit  sit.  No  we go   Puppy  sit     boom  it's got it in six to    trials. Then we phase out the food as a lure  and now the dog knows that  sit  means sit  and you can actually communicate to a dog in a perfectly constructed English sentence.  Phoenix  come here  take this  and go to Jamie  please.  And I've taught her  Phoenix    come here    take this    go to  and the name of my son   Jamie.  And the dog can take a note  and I've got my own little search and rescue dog. He'll find Jamie wherever he is  you know  wherever kids are  crushing rocks by a stream or something  and take him a little message that says   Hey  dinner's ready. Come in for dinner.  So  at this point  the dog knows what we want it to do. Will it do it  Not necessarily  no. As I said  if he's in the park and there's a rear end to sniff  why come to the owner  The dog lives with you  the dog can get you any time. The dog can sniff your butt  if you like  when he wants to. At the moment  he's in the park  and you are competing with smells  and other dogs  and squirrels. So the second stage in training is to teach the dog to want to do what we want him to do  and this is very easy. We use the Premack principle. Basically  we follow a low frequency behavior    one the dog doesn't want to do    by a high frequency behavior  commonly known as a behavior problem  or a dog hobby    something the dog does like to do. That will then become a reward for the lower frequency behavior. So we go   sit   on the couch   sit   tummy rub   sit   look  I throw a tennis ball   sit   say hello to that other dog. Yes  we put  sniff butt  on queue.  Sit   sniff butt. So now all of these distractions that worked against training now become rewards that work for training. And what we're doing  in essence  is we're teaching the dog  kind of like    we're letting the dog think that the dog is training us. And I can imagine this dog  you know  speaking through the fence to  say  an Akita  saying   Wow  my owners  they are so incredibly easy to train. They're like Golden Retrievers. All I have to do is sit  and they do everything. They open doors  they drive my car  they massage me  they will throw tennis balls  they will cook for me and serve the food. It's like  if I just sit  that's my command. Then I have my own personal doorman  chauffeur  masseuse  chef and waiter.  And now the dog's really happy. And this  to me  is always what training is. So we really motivate the dog to want to do it  such that the need for punishment seldom comes up. Now we move to phase three  when now    there's times  you know  when daddy knows best. And I have a little sign on my fridge  and it says   Because I'm the daddy  that's why.  Sorry  no more explanation.  I'm the daddy  you're not. Sit.  And there's times  for example  if my son's friends leave the door open  the dogs have to know you don't step across this line. This is a life or death thing. You leave this  the sanctity of your house  and you could be hit on the street. So some things we have to let the dog know   You mustn't do this.  And so we have to enforce  but without force. People here get very confused about what a punishment is. They think a punishment is something nasty. I bet a lot of you do  right  You think it's something painful  or scary  or nasty. It doesn't have to be. There's several definitions of what a punishment is  but one definition  the most popular  is  a punishment is a stimulus that reduces the immediately preceding behavior  such that it's less likely to occur in the future. It does not have to be nasty  scary or painful. And I would say  if it doesn't have to be  then maybe it shouldn't be. I was working with a very dangerous dog about a year ago. And this was a dog that put both his owners in hospital  plus the brother in law  plus the child. And I only agreed to work with it if they promised it would stay in their house  and they never took it outside. The dog is actually euthanized now  but this was a dog I worked with for a while. A lot of the aggression happened around the kitchen  so while I was there    this was on the fourth visit    we did a four and a half hour down stay  with the dog on his mat. And he was kept there by the owner's calm insistence. When the dog would try to leave the mat  she would say   Rover  on the mat  on the mat  on the mat.  The dog broke his down stay    times in four and a half hours  while she cooked dinner  because we had a lot of aggression related towards food. The breaks got fewer and fewer. You see  the punishment was working. The behavior problem was going away. She never raised her voice. If she did  she would have got bitten. It's not a good dog you shout at. And a lot of my friends train really neat animals  grizzly bears    if you've ever seen a grizzly bear on the telly or in film  then it's a friend of mine who's trained it    killer whales. I love it because it wires you up. How are you going to reprimand a grizzly bear   Bad bear  bad bear   Voom  Your head now is     yards away  sailing through the air  OK  This is crazy. So  where do we go from here  We want a better way. Dogs deserve better. But for me  the reason for this actually has to do with dogs. It has to do with watching people train puppies  and realizing they have horrendous interaction skills  horrendous relationship skills. Not just with their puppy  but with the rest of the family at class. I mean  my all time classic is another  come here  one. You see someone in the park    and I'll cover my mic when I say this  because I don't want to wake you up    and there's the owner in the park  and their dog's over here  and they say   Rover  come here. Rover  come here. Rover  come here  you son of a bitch.  The dog says   I don't think so.  I mean  who in their right mind would think that a dog would want to approach them when they're screaming like that  Instead  the dog says   I know that tone. I know that tone. Previously  when I've approached  I've gotten punished there.  I was walking onto a plane    this  for me  was a pivotal moment in my career  and it really cemented what I wanted to do with this whole puppy training thing  the notion of how to teach puppies in a dog friendly way to want to do what we want to do  so we don't have to force them. You know  I puppy train my child. And the seminal moment was  I was getting on a plane in Dallas  and in row two was a father  I presume  and a young boy about five  kicking the back of the chair.  Johnny  don't do that.  Kick  kick  kick.  Johnny  don't do that.  Kick  kick  kick. I'm standing right here with my bag. The father leans over  grabs him like this and gives him ugly face. And ugly face is this    when you go face to face with a puppy or a child  you say   What are you doing  Now stop it  stop it  stop it   And I went   Oh my God  do I do something   That child has lost everything    that one of the two people he can trust in this world has absolutely pulled the rug from under his feet. And I thought   Do I tell this jerk to quit it   I thought   Ian  stay out of it  stay out of it  you know  walk on.  I walked to the back of the plane  I sat down  and a thought came to me. If that had been a dog  I would have laid him out. If he had kicked a dog  I would have punched him out. He kicked a child  grabs the child like this and I let it go. And this is what it's all about. These relationship skills are so easy. I mean  we as humans  our shallowness when we choose a life mate based on the three Cs    coat color  conformation  cuteness. You know  kind of like a little robot. This is how we go into a relationship  and it's hunky dory for a year. And then  a little behavior problem comes up. No different from the dog barking. The husband won't clear up his clothes  or the wife's always late for meetings  whatever it is  OK  And it then starts  and we get into this thing  and our personal feedback    there's two things about it. When you watch people interacting with animals or other people  there is very little feedback  it's too infrequent. And when it happens  it's bad  it's nasty. You see it's especially in families  especially with spouses  especially with children  especially with parents. You see it especially in the workplace  especially from boss to employee. It's as if there's some schadenfreude there  that we actually take delight in people getting things wrong  so that we can then moan and groan and bitch at them. And this  I would say  is the biggest human foible that we have. It really is. We take the good for granted  and we moan and groan at the bad. And I think this whole notion of these skills should be taught. You know  calculus is wonderful. When I was a kid  I was a calculus whiz. I don't understand a thing about it now  but I could do it as a kid. Geometry  fantastic. You know  quantum mechanics    these are cool things. But they don't save marriages and they don't raise children. And my look to the future is  and what I want to do with this doggy stuff  is to teach people that you know  your husband's just as easy to train. Probably easier    if you got a Rottie    much easier to train. Your kids are easy to train. All you've got to do is to watch them  to time sample the behavior  and say  every five minutes  you ask the question   Is it good  or is it bad   If it's good  say   That was really neat  thank you.  That is such a powerful training technique. This should be taught in schools. Relationships    how do you negotiate  How you do negotiate with your friend who wants your toy  You know  how to prepare you for your first relationship  How on earth about raising children  We think how we do it    one night in bed  we're pregnant  and then we're raising the most important thing in life  a child. No  this is what should be taught    the good living  the good habits  which are just as hard to break as bad habits. So  that would be my wish to the future. Ah  damn  I wanted to end exactly on time  but I got eight  seven  six  five  four  three  two    so thank you very much. That's my talk  thank you. I d like to dedicate this next song to Carmelo  who was put to sleep a couple of days ago  because he got too old. But apparently he was a very nice dog and he always let the cat sleep in the dog bed.    Dog panting noise  Heh  heh  heh  heh  heh  heh  heh  heh  heh  heh.     I'm just a'walking my dog  singing my song  strolling along.     Yeah  it's just me and my dog  catching some sun. We can't go wrong.     My life was lonely and blue.     Yeah  I was sad as a sailor      I was an angry 'un too.     Then there was you    appeared when I was entangled with youth and fear      and nerves jingle jangled  vermouth and beer were getting me mangled up.     But then I looked in your eyes     and I was no more a failure.     You looked so wacky and wise.     And I said   Lord  I'm happy  'cause I'm just a'walking my dog      catching some sun. We can't go wrong.      Yeah  it's just me and my dog  singing our song  strolling along.     'Cause I don't care about your hating and your doubt      and I don't care what the politicians spout.     If you need a companion  why  just go out to the pound      and find yourself a hound  and make that doggie proud      'cause that's what it's all about.      Dog panting noise  Heh  heh  heh  heh  heh  heh  heh  heh  heh  heh.     My life was tragic and sad.     I was the archetypal loser.     I was a pageant gone bad.     And then there was you    on time  and wagging your tail     in the cutest mime that you was in jail.     I said   Woof  be mine   and you gave a wail and then     I was no longer alone.     And I was no more a boozer.     We'll make the happiest home.     And I said   Lord  I'm happy  'cause I m just a'walking my dog      singing my song  strolling along.      Yeah  it's just me and my dog  catching some sun. We can't go wrong      'cause I don't care about your hating and your doubt      and I don t care what the politicians spout.     If you need a companion  why  just go out to the pound      and find yourself a hound  and make that doggie proud      'cause that's what it's all about      that's what it's all about      that's what it's all abou BOW WOW WOW WOW     that's what it's all about.      Dog panting noise  Heh  heh  heh  heh  heh.   Good dog  Thank you. Ninety nine percent of us have the dream of listeners. Not being the musicians    the listeners  right  And we crave one thing  even though we kind of don't know it all the time. We crave to be in the room with the musician the day it was recorded  the day it was played. And we go to live concerts  and we get that as much as we can. But then we listen to the other    percent of our stuff recorded. And it turns out the further back you go in history  the little rougher it sounds. And so we said  there's a solution to this. Let's separate the performance  as a thing  out from the recording  which was how it was made. You know  the thing with microphones in the room and all that day. But the performance itself was how the musicians worked their fingers  and what instruments they were using. And it's the data hidden inside the recording. In order to do this  it's a lot of hardware and software that runs in a very high resolution. And Yamaha makes an incredible thing called the Disklavier Pro that looks like a nice grand piano there. And you probably didn't realize it's going to do all these things    but full of solenoids  and fiber optics  and computers and all this kind of stuff. The highest resolution out of Japan. And this just didn't work until we could cross this line that says high definition. And we were able to cross this line  called the uncanny valley  in terms of    artificial intelligence terms. We have a process where we  you know  kind of put it into the computer and digitize it  and then a whole lot of analysis. And we look at every single note  and all the attributes of those notes  how hard they were struck  and how they were held down  and how you move the fingers. So we had to develop a whole new science of how you move your fingers. And  you know  it's a thing your piano teacher teaches you  but we never had a science behind these kinds of things. I'm going to start with Glenn Gould. He died    years ago this year  and was born    years ago this year. Was a beloved pianist  maybe the great cult pianist of the twentieth century. He just got tired of being in front of an audience  and felt like    a performing monkey was  in fact  his term. So he stepped back  and did nothing but the crafting of his work. And Gould's specialty was playing Bach. His maybe most famous recording was something called  The Goldberg Variations.  Bach only wrote themes and variations one time. He wrote some early pieces  but late in his life  in his mature period  he said   Here's a theme       variations.  In fact  the theme isn't even the melody  it's the bass line. And Gould recorded it in two major recordings that you may know about  one in mono  and one in stereo. And the one in mono  by the way  he used the pedal  and as he got older  he said   No  no  wait a minute. I'm going to get very scientific about this  and not use the pedal.  What I'd like you to hear live is the      version  and we'll play the first couple pieces of it. Glenn Gould      . How about that  So let me tell you a little bit how this was done. First of all  let me get you to the end step. This is    we have a fairly complex process that  you know  software and musicians and so on  but when we're all done  we know that the ear is the final arbiter. We can play the original in one ear  and a new recording in the other. So I'm going to do this for you right now  what you just heard. And in the right speaker is going to be the original recording  and the left speaker is going to be the new recording  actually of an instrument just like that one  and I'm going to play them together at the same time. That's the original.  Unclear  That's the two together. Before  Jurassic Park   there was no science for how skin hung off of muscle  right  So  in the video world  we've been able to invent  in our lifetimes  natural behavior. And this is kind of another example of putting a science behind natural behavior. And then you heard the original. Ultimately  I started with the experience. And the experience is  I want to be in the room and hear the musicians. Lots of you can afford to buy one of these. But  if not  there is now high definition surround sound. And I got to tell you  if you haven't heard high definition surround  go down to your audio dealer  your audiophile dealer. It's so involving compared to regular stereo. But if you don't have that  maybe you can listen on your headphones. And so on the same disk we have five recordings    Sony has five recordings. And you could listen in headphones with this thing called binaural recording. And it's a dummy head that sits in front of the instrument  and it's got microphones where the ears are. And when you put on headphones  and you listen to this  you're inside of Glenn Gould's body. And it is a chuckle until  you know  the musicians  who are musicians who play the piano  listen to this  say   I can't believe it  It's just what it's like to play the piano.  Except now you're inside Glenn Gould's body playing the piano  and it feels like your fingers are making the decisions and moving through the whole process. It's a game changer. Here's now something we know in spectacular quality. The whole process is very sensitive to temperature and humidity. What you heard today was not perfect. It's an amalgam of wood  and cast iron  and felt  and steel strings  and all these  and they're all amazingly sensitive to temperature and humidity. So when you go into the recording session  you get to stop after every piece and rebuild the piano if you need to. There's the whole action there  sitting  kind of  on the side  and the dummy head and our recording engineers standing around while we rebuild the piano. Without putting dates next to these things  step by step music will be turned into data  like every field that's occurred in the past    or    years. Audio has come very late to this game    I'm not talking about digitizing  and bits  and re mastering. I'm talking about turn it into the data that it was made from  which is how it was performed. And audio came very late because our ears are so hard to fool    they're high resolution  and they're wired straight to our emotions  and you can't trick them very easily. Your eyes are pretty happy with some color and movement  you know. All right  there's this episode of  Star Trek.  I get it    it was all just laid in for me yesterday there. The episode of  Star Trek  for me was James Daly played Methuselah    remember this one  And at some point he's dancing with his    and I won't ruin the episode for you  from     . Right  do you know where I'm going  And Nimoy  I'm sorry  Spock sits down at the piano  and he starts playing this Brahms waltz  and they all dance to it. And then Spock turns round  he goes   James  I know all of the Brahms waltzes  and I don't believe this is one of them in the category.  That's where I'm at. I want to hear the waltzes Brahms didn't write. I want to hear the pieces that Horowitz didn't play. But I believe we're on a path now  when we get to data  that we can distill styles  and templates  and formulas  and all these kinds of things  again  that you've seen happen in the computer graphics world. It's now coming in this world. The transition will be this one. It says right now  we think music is notes and how they're played. And I believe this is coming. Because what you've just heard was a computer playing data    no Glenn Gould in the room. But yet  it was human. And I believe you'll get to the next step  the real dream of listeners. Every time you listen to a recording today  every time you take out your iPod and whatever  every time you listen to it  it's the same thing    it's frozen. Wouldn't it be cool if every time you listened  it could be different  This morning  you're sadder  you want to hear your song  the same song  played sadder than you did yesterday. You want to hear it played by different musicians. You want to hear it in different rooms and whatever. We've seen all these  Star Treks   and they're all holodeck episodes as well. Every time I listen to that  I get goose bumps. It's so amazing  it's so exciting. Every time I listen to that recording it's like   Oh my God  I can't believe I'm in the same room. I can't believe this is happening.  It's a way better experience than whatever you're used to listening to  in whatever form. And lastly  I will wrap up with one minute of Art Tatum. So I've really overshot my budget here. We made a new recording of him playing in the Shrine Auditorium in September. It was a concert he recorded in the Shrine Auditorium in     . And I've got to tell you  we have this lab where we build and measure everything  back in Raleigh  North Carolina  and we flew out to Los Angeles. And as the president of the company  I didn't feel real comfortable about where we were. That's a real uncomfortable feeling  when all the equipment's come out and a whole Sony team  and people are going to be sitting there in the audience. And we put the piano on the sweet spot of the stage in the Shrine  which has not changed since       still seats       people. And on the sweet spot on the stage  Tatum starts playing ... and every note  every beat  every slur  every accent  every pedal was perfect  because he played it for that room on that day. And we captured all that data all over again. And I want you to hear that right now. And fortunately  it's right in here. This is an encore he used to do. It's one minute long. It's an Irish jig  and I want you to hear his humor. And that's just what the live audience did. So thank you very much  Michael  thank you for the opportunity. I have a tough job to do. You know  when I looked at the profile of the audience here  with their connotations and design  in all its forms  and with so much and so many people working on collaborative and networks  and so on  that I wanted to tell you  I wanted to build an argument for primary education in a very specific context. In order to do that in    minutes  I have to bring out four ideas    it's like four pieces of a puzzle. And if I succeed in doing that  maybe you would go back with the thought that you could build on  and perhaps help me do my work. The first piece of the puzzle is remoteness and the quality of education. Now  by remoteness  I mean two or three different kinds of things. Of course  remoteness in its normal sense  which means that as you go further and further away from an urban center  you get to remoter areas. What happens to education  The second  or a different kind of remoteness is that within the large metropolitan areas all over the world  you have pockets  like slums  or shantytowns  or poorer areas  which are socially and economically remote from the rest of the city  so it's us and them. What happens to education in that context  So keep both of those ideas of remoteness. We made a guess. The guess was that schools in remote areas do not have good enough teachers. If they do have  they cannot retain those teachers. They do not have good enough infrastructure. And if they had some infrastructure  they have difficulty maintaining it. But I wanted to check if this is true. So what I did last year was we hired a car  looked up on Google  found a route into northern India from New Delhi which  you know  which did not cross any big cities or any big metropolitan centers. Drove out about     kilometers  and wherever we found a school  administered a set of standard tests  and then took those test results and plotted them on a graph. The graph was interesting  although you need to consider it carefully. I mean  this is a very small sample  you should not generalize from it. But it was quite obvious  quite clear  that for this particular route that I had taken  the remoter the school was  the worse its results seemed to be. That seemed a little damning  and I tried to correlate it with things like infrastructure  or with the availability of electricity  and things like that. To my surprise  it did not correlate. It did not correlate with the size of classrooms. It did not correlate with the quality of the infrastructure. It did not correlate with the poverty levels. It did not correlate. But what happened was that when I administered a questionnaire to each of these schools  with one single question for the teachers    which was   Would you like to move to an urban  metropolitan area         percent of them said yes. And as you can see from that  they say yes just a little bit out of Delhi  and they say no when you hit the rich suburbs of Delhi    because  you know  those are relatively better off areas    and then from     kilometers out of Delhi  the answer is consistently yes. I would imagine that a teacher who comes or walks into class every day thinking that  I wish I was in some other school  probably has a deep impact on what happens to the results. So it looked as though teacher motivation and teacher migration was a powerfully correlated thing with what was happening in primary schools  as opposed to whether the children have enough to eat  and whether they are packed tightly into classrooms and that sort of thing. It appears that way. When you take education and technology  then I find in the literature that  you know  things like websites  collaborative environments    you've been listening to all that in the morning    it's always piloted first in the best schools  the best urban schools  and  according to me  biases the result. The literature    one part of it  the scientific literature    consistently blames ET as being over hyped and under performing. The teachers always say  well  it's fine  but it's too expensive for what it does. Because it's being piloted in a school where the students are already getting  let's say     percent of whatever they could do. You put in this new super duper technology  and now they get    percent. So the principal looks at it and says    percent for         dollars  Forget it. If you took the same technology and piloted it into one of those remote schools  where the score was    percent  and  let's say  took that up to    percent    that will be a completely different thing. So the relative change that ET  Educational Technology  would make  would be far greater at the bottom of the pyramid than at the top  but we seem to be doing it the other way about. So I came to this conclusion that ET should reach the underprivileged first  not the other way about. And finally came the question of  how do you tackle teacher perception  Whenever you go to a teacher and show them some technology  the teacher's first reaction is  you cannot replace a teacher with a machine    it's impossible. I don't know why it's impossible  but  even for a moment  if you did assume that it's impossible    I have a quotation from Sir Arthur C. Clarke  the science fiction writer whom I met in Colombo  and he said something which completely solves this problem. He said a teacher than can be replaced by a machine  should be. So  you know  it puts the teacher into a tough bind  you have to think. Anyway  so I'm proposing that an alternative primary education  whatever alternative you want  is required where schools don't exist  where schools are not good enough  where teachers are not available or where teachers are not good enough  for whatever reason. If you happen to live in a part of the world where none of this applies  then you don't need an alternative education. So far I haven't come across such an area  except for one case. I won't name the area  but somewhere in the world people said  we don't have this problem  because we have perfect teachers and perfect schools. There are such areas  but    anyway  I'd never heard that anywhere else. I'm going to talk about children and self organization  and a set of experiments which sort of led to this idea of what might an alternative education be like. They're called the hole in the wall experiments. I'll have to really rush through this. They're a set of experiments. The first one was done in New Delhi in     . And what we did over there was pretty much simple. I had an office in those days which bordered a slum  an urban slum  so there was a dividing wall between our office and the urban slum. They cut a hole inside that wall    which is how it has got the name hole in the wall    and put a pretty powerful PC into that hole  sort of embedded into the wall so that its monitor was sticking out at the other end  a touchpad similarly embedded into the wall  put it on high speed Internet  put the Internet Explorer there  put it on Altavista.com    in those days    and just left it there. And this is what we saw. So that was my office in IIT. Here's the hole in the wall. About eight hours later  we found this kid. To the right is this eight year old child who    and to his left is a six year old girl  who is not very tall. And what he was doing was  he was teaching her to browse. So it sort of raised more questions than it answered. Is this real  Does the language matter  because he's not supposed to know English  Will the computer last  or will they break it and steal it    and did anyone teach them  The last question is what everybody said  but you know  I mean  they must have poked their head over the wall and asked the people in your office  can you show me how to do it  and then somebody taught him. So I took the experiment out of Delhi and repeated it  this time in a city called Shivpuri in the center of India  where I was assured that nobody had ever taught anybody anything. So it was a warm day  and the hole in the wall was on that decrepit old building. This is the first kid who came there  he later on turned out to be a    year old school dropout. He came there and he started to fiddle around with the touchpad. Very quickly  he noticed that when he moves his finger on the touchpad something moves on the screen    and later on he told me   I have never seen a television where you can do something.  So he figured that out. It took him over two minutes to figure out that he was doing things to the television. And then  as he was doing that  he made an accidental click by hitting the touchpad    you'll see him do that. He did that  and the Internet Explorer changed page. Eight minutes later  he looked from his hand to the screen  and he was browsing  he was going back and forth. When that happened  he started calling all the neighborhood children  like  children would come and see what's happening over here. And by the evening of that day     children were all browsing. So eight minutes and an embedded computer seemed to be all that we needed there. So we thought that this is what was happening  that children in groups can self instruct themselves to use a computer and the Internet. But under what circumstances  At this time there was a    the main question was about English. People said  you know  you really ought to have this in Indian languages. So I said  have what  shall I translate the Internet into some Indian language  That's not possible. So  it has to be the other way about. But let's see  how do the children tackle the English language  I took the experiment out to northeastern India  to a village called Madantusi  where  for some reason  there was no English teacher  so the children had not learned English at all. And I built a similar hole in the wall. One big difference in the villages  as opposed to the urban slums  there were more girls than boys who came to the kiosk. In the urban slums  the girls tend to stay away. I left the computer there with lots of CDs    I didn't have any Internet    and came back three months later. So when I came back there  I found these two kids  eight  and    year olds  who were playing a game on the computer. And as soon as they saw me they said   We need a faster processor and a better mouse.  I was real surprised. You know  how on earth did they know all this  And they said   Well  we've picked it up from the CDs.  So I said   But how did you understand what's going on over there   So they said   Well  you've left this machine which talks only in English  so we had to learn English.  So then I measured  and they were using     English words with each other    mispronounced  but correct usage    words like exit  stop  find  save  that kind of thing  not only to do with the computer but in their day to day conversations. So  Madantusi seemed to show that language is not a barrier  in fact they may be able to teach themselves the language if they really wanted to. Finally  I got some funding to try this experiment out to see if these results are replicable  if they happen everywhere else. India is a good place to do such an experiment in  because we have all the ethnic diversities  all the    you know  the genetic diversity  all the racial diversities  and also all the socio economic diversities. So  I could actually choose samples to cover a cross section that would cover practically the whole world. So I did this for almost five years  and this experiment really took us all the way across the length and breadth of India. This is the Himalayas. Up in the north  very cold. I also had to check or invent an engineering design which would survive outdoors  and I was using regular  normal PCs  so I needed different climates  for which India is also great  because we have very cold  very hot  and so on. This is the desert to the west. Near the Pakistan border. And you see here a little clip of    one of these villages    the first thing that these children did was to find a website to teach themselves the English alphabet. Then to central India    very warm  moist  fishing villages  where humidity is a very big killer of electronics. So we had to solve all the problems we had without air conditioning and with very poor power  so most of the solutions that came out used little blasts of air put at the right places to keep the machines running. I want to just cut this short. We did this over and over again. This sequence is also nice. This is a small child  a six year old  telling his eldest sister what to do. And this happens very often with these computers  that the younger children are found teaching the older ones. What did we find  We found that six  to    year olds can self instruct in a connected environment  irrespective of anything that we could measure. So if they have access to the computer  they will teach themselves  including intelligence. I couldn't find a single correlation with anything  but it had to be in groups. And that may be of great  you know  interest to this group  because all of you are talking about groups. So here was the power of what a group of children can do  if you lift the adult intervention. Just a quick idea of the measurements. We took standard statistical techniques  so I'm going to not talk about that. But we got a clean learning curve  almost exactly the same as what you would get in a school. I'll leave it at that  because  I mean  it sort of says it all  doesn't it  What could they learn to do  Basic Windows functions  browsing  painting  chatting and email  games and educational material  music downloads  playing video. In short  what all of us do. And over     children will become computer literate and be able to do all of these things in six months with one computer. So  how do they do that  If you calculated the actual time of access  it would work out to minutes per day  so that's not how it's happening. What you have  actually  is there is one child operating the computer. And surrounding him are usually three other children  who are advising him on what they should do. If you test them  all four will get the same scores in whatever you ask them. Around these four are usually a group of about    children  who are also advising  usually wrongly  about everything that's going on on the computer. And all of them also will clear a test given on that subject. So they are learning as much by watching as they learn by doing. It seems counter intuitive to adult learning  but remember  eight year olds live in a society where most of the time they are told  don't do this  you know  don't touch the whiskey bottle. So what does the eight year old do  He observes very carefully how a whiskey bottle should be touched. And if you tested him  he would answer every question correctly on that topic. So  they seem to be able to acquire very quickly. So what was the conclusion over the six years of work  It was that primary education can happen on its own  or parts of it can happen on its own. It does not have to be imposed from the top downwards. It could perhaps be a self organizing system  so that was the second bit that I wanted to tell you  that children can self organize and attain an educational objective. The third piece was on values  and again  to put it very briefly  I conducted a test over     children spread across all over India  and asked them    I gave them about    different values oriented questions and simply asked them their opinions. We got all sorts of opinions. Yes  no or I don't know. I simply took those questions where I got    percent yeses and    percent noes    so I was able to get a collection of    such statements. These were areas where the children were clearly confused  because half said yes and half said no. A typical example being   Sometimes it is necessary to tell lies.  They don't have a way to determine which way to answer this question  perhaps none of us do. So I leave you with this third question. Can technology alter the acquisition of values  Finally  self organizing systems  about which  again  I won't say too much because you've been hearing all about it. Natural systems are all self organizing  galaxies  molecules  cells  organisms  societies    except for the debate about an intelligent designer. But at this point in time  as far as science goes  it's self organization. But other examples are traffic jams  stock market  society and disaster recovery  terrorism and insurgency. And you know about the Internet based self organizing systems. So here are my four sentences then. Remoteness affects the quality of education. Educational technology should be introduced into remote areas first  and other areas later. Values are acquired  doctrine and dogma are imposed    the two opposing mechanisms. And learning is most likely a self organizing system. If you put all the four together  then it gives    according to me    it gives us a goal  a vision  for educational technology. An educational technology and pedagogy that is digital  automatic  fault tolerant  minimally invasive  connected and self organized. As educationists  we have never asked for technology  we keep borrowing it. PowerPoint is supposed to be considered a great educational technology  but it was not meant for education  it was meant for making boardroom presentations. We borrowed it. Video conferencing. The personal computer itself. I think it's time that the educationists made their own specs  and I have such a set of specs. This is a brief look at that. And such a set of specs should produce the technology to address remoteness  values and violence. So I thought I'd give it a name    why don't we call it  outdoctrination.  And could this be a goal for educational technology in the future  So I want to leave that as a thought with you. Thank you. So what's image got do with it  And I must say  I think Emeka is trying to send a lot of subliminal messages  because I'm going to keep harping on some of the issues that have come up. But I'm going to try and do something different  and try and just close the loop with some of my personal stories  and try and put a face to a lot of the issues that we've been talking about. So  Africa is a complex continent full of contradictions  as you can see. We're not the only ones. And you know  it's amazing. I mean  we need a whole conference just devoted to telling the good stories about the continent. Just think about that  you know  And this is typically what we've been talking about  the role that the media plays in focusing just on the negative stuff. Now  why is that a problem  A typical disaster story  disease  corruption  poverty. And some of you might be standing here thinking  saying   OK  you know  Ory  you're Harvard educated  and all you privileged people come here  saying  'Forget the poor people. Let's focus on business and the markets  and whatever.'   And they're all   There's the    percent of Africans who really need help.  And I want to tell you that this is my story  OK  And it's the story of many of the Africans who are here. We start with poverty. I didn't grow up in the slums or anything that dire  but I know what it is to grow up without having money  or being able to support family. Euvin was talking about bellwether signs. The bellwether for whether our family was broke or not was breakfast. You know  when things were good  we had eggs and sausages. When things were bad  we had porridge. And like many African families  my parents could never save because they supported siblings  cousins  you know  their parents  and things were always dicey. Now  when I was born  they realized they had a pretty smart kid  and they didn't want me to go to the neighborhood school  which was free. And they adopted a very interesting approach to education  which was they were going to take me to a school that they can barely afford. So they took me to a private  Catholic  elementary school  which set the foundation for what ended up being my career. And what happened was  because they could afford it sometimes  sometimes not  I got kicked out pretty much every term. You know  someone would come in with a list of the people who haven't paid school fees  and when they started getting pretty strict  you had to leave  until your school fees could be paid. And I remember thinking  I mean  why don't these guys just take me to a cheap school  Because you know  as a kid you're embarrassed and you're sensitive  and everyone knows you guys don't have money. But they kept at it  and I now understand why they did what they did. They talk about corruption. In Kenya  we have an entrance exam to go into high school. And there's national schools  which are like the best schools  and provincial schools. My dream school at that time was Kenya High School  a national school. I missed the cutoff by one point. And I was so disappointed  and I was like   Oh my God  you know  what am I going to do   And my father said   OK  listen. Let's go and try and talk to the headmistress. You know  it's just one point. I mean  maybe she'll let you in if that slot's still there.  So we went to the school  and because we were nobodies  and because we didn't have privilege  and because my father didn't have the right last name  he was treated like dirt. And I sat and listened to the headmistress talk to him  saying  you know  who do you think you are  And  you know  you must be joking if you think you can get a slot. And I had gone to school with other girls  who were kids of politicians  and who had done much  much worse than I did  and they had slots there. And there's nothing worse than seeing your parent being humiliated in front of you  you know  And we left  and I swore to myself  and I was like   I'm never  ever going to have to beg for anything in my life.  They called me two weeks later  they're like  oh  yeah  you can come now. And I told them to stuff it. Final story  and I sort of have to speak quickly. Disease. My father  who I've been talking about  died of AIDS in     . He never told anyone that he had AIDS  his fear of the stigma was so strong. And I'm pretty much the one who figured it out  because I was a nerd. And I was in the States at the time  and they called me. He was very sick  the first time he got sick. And he had Cryptococcal meningitis. And so I went on to Google  Cryptococcal meningitis  you know. Because of doctor patient privilege  they couldn't really tell us what was going on. But they were like  you know  this is a long term thing. And when I went online and looked at the infectious    read about the disease  I pretty much realized what was going on. The first time he got sick  he recovered. But what happened was that he had to be on medication that  at that time    Diflucan  which in the States is used for yeast infections    cost    dollars a pill. He had to be on that pill for the rest of his life. You know  so money ran out. He got sick again. And up until that time  he had a friend who used to travel to India  and he used to import  bring him  could get him a generic version of it. And that kept him going. But the money ran out. He got sick again. He got sick on a Friday. At that time  there was only one bank that had ATMs in Kenya  and we could not get cash. The family couldn't get cash for him to start the treatment until Monday. The hospital put him on a water drip for three days. And finally  we figured  well  OK  we'd better just try and take him to a public hospital. At least he'll get treated while we try to figure out the money situation. And he died when the ambulance was coming to the hospital to take him. And  you know  now  imagine if    and I could go on and on    imagine if this is all you know about me. How would you look at me  With pity  you know. Sadness. And this is how you look at Africa. This is the damage it causes. You don't see the other side of me. You don't see the blogger  you don't see the Harvard educated lawyer  the vibrant person  you know  And I just wanted to personalize that. Because we talk about it in big terms  and you wonder  you know  so what  But it's damaging. And I'm not unique  right  Imagine if all you knew about William was the fact that he grew up in a poor village. And you didn't know about the windmill  you know  And I was just moved. I was actually crying during his presentation. He was like  I try and I make. I was like Nike should hire him  you know   Just do it   And this is  again  the point I'm trying to make. When you focus just on the disasters       we're ignoring the potential. So  what is to be done  First of all  Africans  we need to get better at telling our stories. We heard about that yesterday. We had some of them this morning. And this is an example  you know  blogging is one way of doing that. Afrigator is an aggregator of African blogs that was developed in South Africa. So we need to start getting better. If no one else will tell our stories  let's do it. And going back to the point I was trying to make  this is the Swahili Wikipedia. Swahili is spoken by about    million people in East Africa. It only has five contributors. Four of them are white males    non native speakers. The other person is    Ndesanjo  if you're here  stand up    is a Tanzanian   the  first Swahili blogger. He's the only African who's contributing to this. People  please. We can't whine and complain the West is doing this. What are we doing  Where are the rest of the Swahili speakers  Why are we not generating our own content  You know  it's not enough to complain. We need to act. Reuters now integrates African blogs into their coverage of Africa. So  that's a start  and we've heard of all their other initiatives. The cheetah generation. The aid approach  you know  is flawed. And after all the hoopla of Live    we're still not anywhere in the picture. No  you're not. But the point I'm trying to make  though  is that it's not enough for us to criticize. And for those of you in the diaspora who are struggling with where should I be  should I move back  should I stay  You know  just jump. The continent needs you. And I can't emphasize that enough  you know. I walked away from a job with one of the top firms in D.C.  Covington and Burling  six figures. With two paychecks  or three paychecks  I could solve a lot of my family's problems. But I walked away from that  because my passion was here  and because I wanted to do things that were fulfilling. And because I'm needed here  you know  I probably can win a prize for the most ways to use a Harvard Law School degree because of all the things I'm doing. One is because I'm pretty aggressive  and I try and find  you know  opportunities. But there is such a need  you know  I'm a corporate lawyer most of the time for an organization called Enablis that supports entrepreneurs in South Africa. We're now moving into East Africa. And we give them business development services  as well as financing loan and equity. I've also set up a project in Kenya  and what we do is we track the performance of Kenyan MPs. My partner  M  who's a tech guru  hacked WordPress. It costs us  like     dollars a month just for hosting. Everything else on there is a labor of love. We've manually entered all the data there. And you can get profiles of each MP  questions they've asked in parliament. We have a comment function  where people can ask their MPs questions. There are some MPs who participate  and come back and ask. And basically  we started this because we were tired of complaining about our politicians. You know  I believe that accountability stems from demand. You're not just going to be accountable out of the goodness of your heart. And we as Africans need to start challenging our leaders. What are they doing  You know  they're not going to change just out of nowhere. So we need new policies  we need    where's that coming from  you know  Another thing is that these leaders are a reflection of our society. We talk about African governments like they've been dropped from Mars  you know  They come from us. And what is it about our society that is generating leaders that we don't like  And how can we change that  So Mzalendo was one small way we thought we could start inspiring people to start holding their leaders accountable. Where do we go from here  I believe in the power of ideas. I believe in the power of sharing knowledge. And I'd ask all of you  when you leave here  please just share  and keep the ideas that you've gotten out of here going  because it can make a difference. The other thing I want to urge you to do is take an interest in the individual. I've had lots of conversations about things I think need to be happening in Africa. People are like   OK  if you don't do aid  I'm a bleeding heart liberal  what can I do   And when I talk about my ideas  they're like   BBut it's not scalable  you know. Give me something I can do with Paypal.  It's not that easy  you know  And sometimes just taking an interest in the individual  in the fellows you've met  and the businesspeople you've met  it can make a huge difference  especially in Africa  because usually the individual in Africa carries a lot of people behind them. Practically. I mean  when I was a first year student in law school  my mom's business had collapsed  so I was supporting her. My sister was struggling to get through undergrad. I was helping her pay her tuition. My cousin ran out of school fees  and she's really smart. I was paying her school fees. A cousin of mine died of AIDS  left an orphan  so we said  well  what are we going to do with her  You know  she's now my baby sister. And because of the opportunities that were afforded to me  I am able to lift all those people. So  don't underestimate that. An example. This man changed my life. He's a professor. He's now at Vanderbilt. He's an undergrad professor  Mitchell Seligson. And because of him  I got into Harvard Law School  because he took an interest. I was taking a class of his  and he was just like  this is an overeager student  which we don't normally get in the United States  because everyone else is cynical and jaded. He called me to his office and said   What do you want to do when you grow up   I said   I want to be a lawyer.  And he was like   Why  You know  we don't need another lawyer in the United States.  And he tried to talk me out of it  but it was like   OK  I know nothing about applying to law school  I'm poli sci Ph.D. But  you know  let's figure out what I need you to do  what I need to do to help you out.  It was like   Where do you want to go   And to me at that time university    I was at University of Pitts for undergrad  and that was like heaven  OK  because compared to what could have been in Kenya. So I'm like   Yeah  I'm just applying to Pitt for law school.  He was like   Why  You know  you're smart  you have all these things going for you.  And I'm like   Because I'm here and it's cheap  and you know  I kind of like Pittsburgh.  Like  that's the dumbest reason I've ever heard for applying to law school. And  you know  so he took me under his wing  and he encouraged me. And he said   Look  you can get into Harvard  you're that good  OK  And if they don't admit you  they're the ones who are messed up.  And he built me up  you know  And this is just an illustration. You can meet other individuals here. We just need a push. That's all I needed was a push to go to the next level. Basically  I want to end with my vision for Africa  you know  A gentleman spoke yesterday about the indignity of us having to leave the continent so that we can fulfill our potential. You know  my vision is that my daughter  and any other African child being born today  can be whoever they want to be here  without having to leave. And they can have the possibility of transcending the circumstances under which they were born. That's one thing you Americans take for granted  you know  That you can grow up  you know  not so good circumstances  and you can move. Just because you are born in rural Arkansas  whatever  that doesn't define who you are. For most Africans today  where you live  or where you were born  and the circumstances under which you were born  determine the rest of your life. I would like to see that change  and the change starts with us. And as Africans  we need to take responsibility for our continent. Thank you. Stephanie White  I'm going to let her introduce herself to everybody. Can you tell everybody your name  Einstein  Einstein. SW  This is Einstein. Can you tell everyone  hi   E  Hello. SW  That's nice. Can you be polite  E  Hi  sweetheart. SW  Much better. Well  Einstein is very honored to be here at TED       amongst all you modern day Einsteins. In fact  she's very excited. E  Woo. SW  Yeah. Since we've arrived  there's been a constant buzz about all the exciting speakers here for the conference. This morning we've heard a lot of whispers about Tom Reilly's wrap up on Saturday. Einstein  did you hear whispers  E   Squawks  SW  Yeah. Einstein's especially interested in Penelope's talk. A lot of her research goes on in caves  which can get pretty dusty. E  Achoo  SW  It could make her sneeze. But more importantly  her research could help Einstein find a cure for her never ending scratchy throat. Einstein   Coughs  SW  Yeah. Well  Bob Russell was telling us about his work on nanotubes in his research at the microscopic level. Well  that's really cool  but what Einstein's really hoping is that maybe he'll genetically engineer a five pound peanut. E  Oh  my God  My God  My God  SW  Yeah. She would get really  really excited. That is one big peanut. Since Einstein is a bird  she's very interested in things that fly. She thinks Burt Rutan is very impressive. E  Ooh. SW  Yeah. She especially likes his latest achievement  SpaceShipOne. Einstein  would you like to ride in Burt's spaceship  E   Spaceship noise  SW  Even if it doesn't have a laser  E   Laser noise  SW  Yeah  yeah. That was pretty funny  Einstein. Now  Einstein also thinks  you know  working in caves and travelling through space    it's all very dangerous jobs. It would be very dangerous if you fell down. E  Wheeeeeee   Splat  SW  Yeah. Little splat at the end there. Einstein  did that hurt  E  Ow  ow  ow. SW  Yeah. It's all a lot of hard work. E   Squawks  SW  Yeah. It can get a bird like Einstein frustrated. E   Squawks  SW  Yeah  it sure can. But when Einstein needs to relax from her job educating the public  she loves to take in the arts. If the children of the Uganda need another dance partner  Einstein could sure fit the bill  because she loves to dance. Can you get down  E   Bobbing head   Laughter  SW  Let's get down for everybody. Come on now. She's going to make me do it  too. Ooh  ooh. Einstein  Ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh. SW  Do your head now. E  Ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh. SW  Or maybe Sirena Huang would like to learn some arias on her violin  and Einstein can sing along with some opera  E   Operatic squawk  SW  Very good. Or maybe Stu just needs another backup singer  Einstein  can you also sing  I know  you need to get rid of that seed first. Can you sing  E  La  la. SW  There you go. And  of course  if all else fails  you can just run off and enjoy a fun fiesta. E   Squawks  SW  All right. Well  Einstein was pretty embarrassed to admit this earlier  but she was telling me backstage that she had a problem. E  What's the matter  SW  No  I don't have a problem. You have the problem  remember  You were saying that you were really embarrassed  because you're in love with a pirate  E  Yar. SW  There you go. And what do pirates like to drink  E  Beer. SW  Yeah  that's right. But you don't like to drink beer  Einstein. You like to drink water. E   Water sound  SW  Very good. Now  really  she is pretty nervous. Because one of her favorite folks from back home is here  and she's pretty nervous to meet him. She thinks Al Gore is a really good looking man. What do you say to a good looking man  E  Hey  baby. SW  And so do all the folks back home in Tennessee. E  Yee haw. SW  And since she's such a big fan  she knows that his birthday is coming up at the end of March. And we didn't think he'd be in town then  so Einstein wanted to do something special for him. So let's see if Einstein will sing  Happy Birthday  to Al Gore. Can you sing  Happy Birthday  to him  E  Happy birthday to you. SW  Again. E  Happy birthday to you. SW  Again. E  Happy birthday to you. SW  Big finish. E  Happy birthday to you. SW  Good job  Well  before we wrap it up  she would like to give a shout out to all our animal friends back at the Knoxville Zoo. Einstein  do you want to say  hi  to all the owls  E  Woo  woo  woo. SW  What about the other birds  E  Tweet  tweet  tweet. SW  And the penguin  E  Quack  quack  quack. SW  There we go. Let's get that one out of there. How about a chimpanzee  E  Ooh  ooh  ooh. Aah  aah  aah. SW  Very good. What about a wolf  E  Ooooowww. SW  And a pig  E  Oink  oink  oink. SW  And the rooster  E  Cock a doodle doo  SW  And how about those cats  E  Meow. SW  At the zoo we have big cats from the jungle. E  Grrrrr. SW  What about a skunk  E  Stinker. SW  She's a comedian. I suppose you think you're famous  Are you famous  E  Superstar. SW  Yeah. You are a superstar. Well  we would like to encourage all of you to do your part to help protect Einstein's animal friends  and to do your part to help protect their homes that they live  in . Now  Einstein does say it best when we ask her. Why do we want to protect your home  E  I'm special. SW  You are very special. What would you like to say to all these nice people  E  I love you. SW  That's good. Can you blow them a kiss  E   Kissing noise  SW  And what do you say when it's time to go  E  Goodbye. SW  Good job. Thank you all. So  people argue vigorously about the definition of life. They ask if it should have reproduction in it  or metabolism  or evolution. And I don't know the answer to that  so I'm not going to tell you. I will say that life involves computation. So this is a computer program. Booted up in a cell  the program would execute  and it could result in this person  or with a small change  it could result in this person  or another small change  this person  or with a larger change  this dog  or this tree  or this whale. So now  if you take this metaphor  of  genome as program seriously  you have to consider that Chris Anderson is a computer fabricated artifact  as is Jim Watson  Craig Venter  as are all of us. And in convincing yourself that this metaphor is true  there are lots of similarities between genetic programs and computer programs that could help to convince you. But one  to me  that's most compelling is the peculiar sensitivity to small changes that can make large changes in biological development    the output. A small mutation can take a two wing fly and make it a four wing fly. Or it could take a fly and put legs where its antennae should be. Or if you're familiar with  The Princess Bride   it could create a six fingered man. Now  a hallmark of computer programs is just this kind of sensitivity to small changes. If your bank account's one dollar  and you flip a single bit  you could end up with a thousand dollars. So these small changes are things that I think that    they indicate to us that a complicated computation in development is underlying these amplified  large changes. So now  all of this indicates that there are molecular programs underlying biology  and it shows the power of molecular programs    biology does. And what I want to do is write molecular programs  potentially to build technology. And there are a lot of people doing this  a lot of synthetic biologists doing this  like Craig Venter. And they concentrate on using cells. They're cell oriented. So my friends  molecular programmers  and I have a sort of biomolecule centric approach. We're interested in using DNA  RNA and protein  and building new languages for building things from the bottom up  using biomolecules  potentially having nothing to do with biology. So  these are all the machines in a cell. There's a camera. There's the solar panels of the cell  some switches that turn your genes on and off  the girders of the cell  motors that move your muscles. My little group of molecular programmers are trying to refashion all of these parts from DNA. We're not DNA zealots  but DNA is the cheapest  easiest to understand and easy to program material to do this. And as other things become easier to use    maybe protein    we'll work with those. If we succeed  what will molecular programming look like  You're going to sit in front of your computer. You're going to design something like a cell phone  and in a high level language  you'll describe that cell phone. Then you're going to have a compiler that's going to take that description and it's going to turn it into actual molecules that can be sent to a synthesizer and that synthesizer will pack those molecules into a seed. And what happens if you water and feed that seed appropriately  is it will do a developmental computation  a molecular computation  and it'll build an electronic computer. And if I haven't revealed my prejudices already  I think that life has been about molecular computers building electrochemical computers  building electronic computers  which together with electrochemical computers will build new molecular computers  which will build new electronic computers  and so forth. And if you buy all of this  and you think life is about computation  as I do  then you look at big questions through the eyes of a computer scientist. So one big question is  how does a baby know when to stop growing  And for molecular programming  the question is how does your cell phone know when to stop growing  Or how does a computer program know when to stop running  Or more to the point  how do you know if a program will ever stop  There are other questions like this  too. One of them is Craig Venter's question. Turns out I think he's actually a computer scientist. He asked  how big is the minimal genome that will give me a functioning microorganism  How few genes can I use  This is exactly analogous to the question  what's the smallest program I can write that will act exactly like Microsoft Word  And just as he's writing  you know  bacteria that will be smaller  he's writing genomes that will work  we could write smaller programs that would do what Microsoft Word does. But for molecular programming  our question is  how many molecules do we need to put in that seed to get a cell phone  What's the smallest number we can get away with  Now  these are big questions in computer science. These are all complexity questions  and computer science tells us that these are very hard questions. Almost    many of them are impossible. But for some tasks  we can start to answer them. So  I'm going to start asking those questions for the DNA structures I'm going to talk about next. So  this is normal DNA  what you think of as normal DNA. It's double stranded  it's a double helix  has the As  Ts  Cs and Gs that pair to hold the strands together. And I'm going to draw it like this sometimes  just so I don't scare you. We want to look at individual strands and not think about the double helix. When we synthesize it  it comes single stranded  so we can take the blue strand in one tube and make an orange strand in the other tube  and they're floppy when they're single stranded. You mix them together and they make a rigid double helix. Now for the last    years  Ned Seeman and a bunch of his descendants have worked very hard and made beautiful three dimensional structures using this kind of reaction of DNA strands coming together. But a lot of their approaches  though elegant  take a long time. They can take a couple of years  or it can be difficult to design. So I came up with a new method a couple of years ago I call DNA origami that's so easy you could do it at home in your kitchen and design the stuff on a laptop. But to do it  you need a long  single strand of DNA  which is technically very difficult to get. So  you can go to a natural source. You can look in this computer fabricated artifact  and he's got a double stranded genome    that's no good. You look in his intestines. There are billions of bacteria. They're no good either. Double strand again  but inside them  they're infected with a virus that has a nice  long  single stranded genome that we can fold like a piece of paper. And here's how we do it. This is part of that genome. We add a bunch of short  synthetic DNAs that I call staples. Each one has a left half that binds the long strand in one place  and a right half that binds it in a different place  and brings the long strand together like this. The net action of many of these on that long strand is to fold it into something like a rectangle. Now  we can't actually take a movie of this process  but Shawn Douglas at Harvard has made a nice visualization for us that begins with a long strand and has some short strands in it. And what happens is that we mix these strands together. We heat them up  we add a little bit of salt  we heat them up to almost boiling and cool them down  and as we cool them down  the short strands bind the long strands and start to form structure. And you can see a little bit of double helix forming there. When you look at DNA origami  you can see that what it really is  even though you think it's complicated  is a bunch of double helices that are parallel to each other  and they're held together by places where short strands go along one helix and then jump to another one. So there's a strand that goes like this  goes along one helix and binds    it jumps to another helix and comes back. That holds the long strand like this. Now  to show that we could make any shape or pattern that we wanted  I tried to make this shape. I wanted to fold DNA into something that goes up over the eye  down the nose  up the nose  around the forehead  back down and end in a little loop like this. And so  I thought  if this could work  anything could work. So I had the computer program design the short staples to do this. I ordered them  they came by FedEx. I mixed them up  heated them  cooled them down  and I got    billion little smiley faces floating around in a single drop of water. And each one of these is just one thousandth the width of a human hair  OK  So  they're all floating around in solution  and to look at them  you have to get them on a surface where they stick. So  you pour them out onto a surface and they start to stick to that surface  and we take a picture using an atomic force microscope. It's got a needle  like a record needle  that goes back and forth over the surface  bumps up and down  and feels the height of the first surface. It feels the DNA origami. There's the atomic force microscope working and you can see that the landing's a little rough. When you zoom in  they've got  you know  weak jaws that flip over their heads and some of their noses get punched out  but it's pretty good. You can zoom in and even see the extra little loop  this little nano goatee. Now  what's great about this is anybody can do this. And so  I got this in the mail about a year after I did this  unsolicited. Anyone know what this is  What is it  It's China  right  So  what happened is  a graduate student in China  Lulu Qian  did a great job. She wrote all her own software to design and built this DNA origami  a beautiful rendition of China  which even has Taiwan  and you can see it's sort of on the world's shortest leash  right  So  this works really well and you can make patterns as well as shapes  OK  And you can make a map of the Americas and spell DNA with DNA. And what's really neat about it    well  actually  this all looks like nano artwork  but it turns out that nano artwork is just what you need to make nano circuits. So  you can put circuit components on the staples  like a light bulb and a light switch. Let the thing assemble  and you'll get some kind of a circuit. And then you can maybe wash the DNA away and have the circuit left over. So  this is what some colleagues of mine at Caltech did. They took a DNA origami  organized some carbon nano tubes  made a little switch  you see here  wired it up  tested it and showed that it is indeed a switch. Now  this is just a single switch and you need half a billion for a computer  so we have a long way to go. But this is very promising because the origami can organize parts just one tenth the size of those in a normal computer. So it's very promising for making small computers. Now  I want to get back to that compiler. The DNA origami is a proof that that compiler actually works. So  you start with something in the computer. You get a high level description of the computer program  a high level description of the origami. You can compile it to molecules  send it to a synthesizer  and it actually works. And it turns out that a company has made a nice program that's much better than my code  which was kind of ugly  and will allow us to do this in a nice  visual  computer aided design way. So  now you can say  all right  why isn't DNA origami the end of the story  You have your molecular compiler  you can do whatever you want. The fact is that it does not scale. So if you want to build a human from DNA origami  the problem is  you need a long strand that's    trillion trillion bases long. That's three light years' worth of DNA  so we're not going to do this. We're going to turn to another technology  called algorithmic self assembly of tiles. It was started by Erik Winfree  and what it does  it has tiles that are a hundredth the size of a DNA origami. You zoom in  there are just four DNA strands and they have little single stranded bits on them that can bind to other tiles  if they match. And we like to draw these tiles as little squares. And if you look at their sticky ends  these little DNA bits  you can see that they actually form a checkerboard pattern. So  these tiles would make a complicated  self assembling checkerboard. And the point of this  if you didn't catch that  is that tiles are a kind of molecular program and they can output patterns. And a really amazing part of this is that any computer program can be translated into one of these tile programs    specifically  counting. So  you can come up with a set of tiles that when they come together  form a little binary counter rather than a checkerboard. So you can read off binary numbers five  six and seven. And in order to get these kinds of computations started right  you need some kind of input  a kind of seed. You can use DNA origami for that. You can encode the number    in the right hand side of a DNA origami  and when you add those tiles that count  they will start to count    they will read that    and they'll stop at   . So  what we've done is we've figured out a way to have a molecular program know when to stop going. It knows when to stop growing because it can count. It knows how big it is. So  that answers that sort of first question I was talking about. It doesn't tell us how babies do it  however. So now  we can use this counting to try and get at much bigger things than DNA origami could otherwise. Here's the DNA origami  and what we can do is we can write    on both edges of the DNA origami  and we can now use our watering can and water with tiles  and we can start growing tiles off of that and create a square. The counter serves as a template to fill in a square in the middle of this thing. So  what we've done is we've succeeded in making something much bigger than a DNA origami by combining DNA origami with tiles. And the neat thing about it is  is that it's also reprogrammable. You can just change a couple of the DNA strands in this binary representation and you'll get    rather than   . And if you do that  the origami's the same size  but the resulting square that you get is three times bigger. So  this sort of recapitulates what I was telling you about development. You have a very sensitive computer program where small changes    single  tiny  little mutations    can take something that made one size square and make something very much bigger. Now  this    using counting to compute and build these kinds of things by this kind of developmental process is something that also has bearing on Craig Venter's question. So  you can ask  how many DNA strands are required to build a square of a given size  If we wanted to make a square of size         or        if we used DNA origami alone  we would require a number of DNA strands that's the square of the size of that square  so we'd need             or a million DNA strands. That's really not affordable. But if we use a little computation    we use origami  plus some tiles that count    then we can get away with using          or     DNA strands. And so we can exponentially reduce the number of DNA strands we use  if we use counting  if we use a little bit of computation. And so computation is some very powerful way to reduce the number of molecules you need to build something  to reduce the size of the genome that you're building. And finally  I'm going to get back to that sort of crazy idea about computers building computers. If you look at the square that you build with the origami and some counters growing off it  the pattern that it has is exactly the pattern that you need to make a memory. So if you affix some wires and switches to those tiles    rather than to the staple strands  you affix them to the tiles    then they'll self assemble the somewhat complicated circuits  the demultiplexer circuits  that you need to address this memory. So you can actually make a complicated circuit using a little bit of computation. It's a molecular computer building an electronic computer. Now  you ask me  how far have we gotten down this path  Experimentally  this is what we've done in the last year. Here is a DNA origami rectangle  and here are some tiles growing from it. And you can see how they count. One  two  three  four  five  six  nine                . So it's got some errors  but at least it counts up. So  it turns out we actually had this idea nine years ago  and that's about the time constant for how long it takes to do these kinds of things  so I think we made a lot of progress. We've got ideas about how to fix these errors. And I think in the next five or    years  we'll make the kind of squares that I described and maybe even get to some of those self assembled circuits. So now  what do I want you to take away from this talk  I want you to remember that to create life's very diverse and complex forms  life uses computation to do that. And the computations that it uses  they're molecular computations  and in order to understand this and get a better handle on it  as Feynman said  you know  we need to build something to understand it. And so we are going to use molecules and refashion this thing  rebuild everything from the bottom up  using DNA in ways that nature never intended  using DNA origami  and DNA origami to seed this algorithmic self assembly. You know  so this is all very cool  but what I'd like you to take from the talk  hopefully from some of those big questions  is that this molecular programming isn't just about making gadgets. It's not just making about    it's making self assembled cell phones and circuits. What it's really about is taking computer science and looking at big questions in a new light  asking new versions of those big questions and trying to understand how biology can make such amazing things. Thank you. My mission in life since I was a kid was  and is  to take the rest of you into space. It's during our lifetime that we're going to take the Earth  take the people of Earth and transition off  permanently. And that's exciting. In fact  I think it is a moral imperative that we open the space frontier. You know  it's the first time that we're going to have a chance to have planetary redundancy  a chance to  if you would  back up the biosphere. And if you think about space  everything we hold of value on this planet    metals and minerals and real estate and energy    is in infinite quantities in space. In fact  the Earth is a crumb in a supermarket filled with resources. The analogy for me is Alaska. You know  we bought Alaska. We Americans bought Alaska in the     s. It's called Seward's folly. We valued it as the number of seal pelts we could kill. And then we discovered these things    gold and oil and fishing and timber    and it became  you know  a trillion dollar economy  and now we take our honeymoons there. The same thing will happen in space. We are on the verge of the greatest exploration that the human race has ever known. We explore for three reasons  the weakest of which is curiosity. You know  it's funded NASA's budget up until now. Some images from Mars      . In fact  I think in the next decade  without any question  we will discover life on Mars and find that it is literally ubiquitous under the soils and different parts of that planet. The stronger motivator  the much stronger motivator  is fear. It drove us to the moon. We    literally in fear    with the Soviet Union raced to the moon. And we have these huge rocks  you know  killer sized rocks in the hundreds of thousands or millions out there  and while the probability is very small  the impact  figured in literally  of one of these hitting the Earth is so huge that to spend a small fraction looking  searching  preparing to defend  is not unreasonable. And of course  the third motivator  one near and dear to my heart as an entrepreneur  is wealth. In fact  the greatest wealth. If you think about these other asteroids  there's a class of the nickel iron  which in platinum group metal markets alone are worth something like    trillion dollars  if you can go out and grab one of these rocks. My plan is to actually buy puts on the precious metal market  and then actually claim that I'm going to go out and get one. And that will fund the actual mission to go and get one. But fear  curiosity and greed have driven us. And for me  this is    I'm the short kid on the right. This was    my motivation was actually during Apollo. And Apollo was one of the greatest motivators ever. If you think about what happened at the turn of    early     s  on May     JFK said   We're going to go to the moon.  And people left their jobs and they went to obscure locations to go and be part of this amazing mission. And we knew nothing about going to space. We went from having literally put Alan Shepard in suborbital flight to going to the moon in eight years  and the average age of the people that got us there was    years old. They didn't know what couldn't be done. They had to make up everything. And that  my friend  is amazing motivation. This is Gene Cernan  a good friend of mine  saying   If I can go to the moon     this is the last human on the moon so far     nothing  nothing is impossible.  But of course  we've thought about the government always as the person taking us there. But I put forward here  the government is not going to get us there. The government is unable to take the risks required to open up this precious frontier. The shuttle is costing a billion dollars a launch. That's a pathetic number. It's unreasonable. We shouldn't be happy in standing for that. One of the things that we did with the Ansari X PRIZE was take the challenge on that risk is OK  you know. As we are going out there and taking on a new frontier  we should be allowed to risk. In fact  anyone who says we shouldn't  you know  just needs to be put aside  because  as we go forward  in fact  the greatest discoveries we will ever know is ahead of us. The entrepreneurs in the space business are the furry mammals  and clearly the industrial military complex    with Boeing and Lockheed and NASA    are the dinosaurs. The ability for us to access these resources to gain planetary redundancy    we can now gather all the information  the genetic codes  you know  everything stored on our databases  and back them up off the planet  in case there would be one of those disastrous situations. The difficulty is getting there  and clearly  the cost to orbit is key. Once you're in orbit  you are two thirds of the way  energetically  to anywhere    the moon  to Mars. And today  there's only three vehicles    the U.S. shuttle  the Russian Soyuz and the Chinese vehicle    that gets you there. Arguably  it's about     million dollars a person on the space shuttle. One of the companies I started  Space Adventures  will sell you a ticket. We've done two so far. We'll be announcing two more on the Soyuz to go up to the space station for    million dollars. But that's expensive and to understand what the potential is    it is expensive. But people are willing to pay that  You know  one    we have a very unique period in time today. For the first time ever  we have enough wealth concentrated in the hands of few individuals and the technology accessible that will allow us to really drive space exploration. But how cheap could it get  I want to give you the end point. We know       million dollars today  you can go and buy a ticket  but how cheap could it get  Let's go back to high school physics here. If you calculate the amount of potential energy  mgh  to take you and your spacesuit up to a couple hundred miles  and then you accelerate yourself to        miles per hour    remember  that one half MV squared    and you figure it out. It's about  .  gigajoules of energy. If you expended that over an hour  it's about  .  megawatts. If you go to one of Vijay's micro power sources  and they sell it to you for seven cents a kilowatt hour    anybody here fast in math  How much will it cost you and your spacesuit to go to orbit      bucks. That's the price improvement curve that    we need some breakthroughs in physics along the way  I'll grant you that. But guys  if history has taught us anything  it's that if you can imagine it  you will get there eventually. I have no question that the physics  the engineering to get us down to the point where all of us can afford orbital space flight is around the corner. The difficulty is that there needs to be a real marketplace to drive the investment. Today  the Boeings and the Lockheeds don't spend a dollar of their own money in R D. It's all government research dollars  and very few of those. And in fact  the large corporations  the governments  can't take the risk. So we need what I call an exothermic economic reaction in space. Today's commercial markets worldwide  global commercial launch market     to    launches per year. Number of commercial companies out there     to    companies. One per company. That's not it. There's only one marketplace  and I call them self loading carbon payloads. They come with their own money. They're easy to make. It's people. The Ansari X PRIZE was my solution  reading about Lindbergh for creating the vehicles to get us there. We offered    million dollars in cash for the first reusable ship  carry three people up to     kilometers  come back down  and within two weeks  make the trip again. Twenty six teams from seven countries entered the competition  spending between one to    million dollars each. And of course  we had beautiful SpaceShipOne  which made those two flights and won the competition. And I'd like to take you there  to that morning  for just a quick video. Richard Searfoss  Good luck. RS  We've got an altitude call of         feet. RS  So in my official capacity as the chief judge of the Ansari X PRIZE competition  I declare that Mojave Aerospace Ventures has indeed earned the Ansari X PRIZE. Peter Diamandis  Probably the most difficult thing that I had to do was raise the capital for this. It was literally impossible. We went    I went to          CEOs  CMOs. No one believed it was done. Everyone said   Oh  what does NASA think  Well  people are going to die  how can you possibly going to put this forward   I found a visionary family  the Ansari family  and Champ Car  and raised part of the money  but not the full    million. And what I ended up doing was going out to the insurance industry and buying a hole in one insurance policy. See  the insurance companies went to Boeing and Lockheed  and said   Are you going to compete   No.  Are you going to compete   No.  No one's going to win this thing.  So  they took a bet that no one would win by January of '    and I took a bet that someone would win. So    and the best thing is they paid off and the check didn't bounce. We've had a lot of accomplishments and it's been a tremendous success. One of the things I'm most happy about is that the SpaceShipOne is going to hang in Air and Space Museum  next to the Spirit of St. Louis and the Wright Flyer. Isn't that great   Applause  So a little bit about the future  steps to space  what's available for you. Today  you can go and experience weightless flights. By '    suborbital flights  the price tag for that  you know  on Virgin  is going to be about        . There are three or four other serious efforts that will bring the price down very rapidly  I think  to about        dollars for a suborbital flight. Orbital flights    we can take you to the space station. And then I truly believe  once a group is in orbit around the Earth    I know if they don't do it  I am    we're going to stockpile some fuel  make a beeline for the moon and grab some real estate. Quick moment for the designers in the audience. We spent    years getting FAA approval to do zero gravity flights. Here are some fun images. Here's Burt Rutan and my good friend Greg Meronek inside a zero gravity    people think a zero gravity room  there's a switch on there that turns it off    but it's actually parabolic flight of an airplane. And turns out   Up has just done a little commercial that's airing this month. If we can get the audio up  look for specially marked packages of Diet   Up. When you want the taste that won't weigh you down  the only way to go is up. PD  That was filmed inside our airplane  and so  you can now do this. We're based down in Florida. Let me talk about the other thing I'm excited about. The future of prizes. You know  prizes are a very old idea. I had the pleasure of borrowing from the Longitude Prize and the Orteig Prize that put Lindbergh forward. And we have made a decision in the X PRIZE Foundation to actually carry that concept forward into other technology areas  and we just took on a new mission statement   to bring about radical breakthroughs in space and other technologies for the benefit of humanity.  And this is something that we're very excited about. I showed this slide to Larry Page  who just joined our board. And you know  when you give to a nonprofit  you might have    cents on the dollar. If you have a matching grant  it's typically two or three to one. If you put up a prize  you can get literally a    to one leverage on your dollars. And that's huge. And then he turned around and said   Well  if you back a prize institute that runs a    prize  you get     to one.  I said   Well  that's great.  So  we have actually    are looking to turn the X PRIZE into a world class prize institute. This is what happens when you put up a prize  when you announce it and teams start to begin doing trials. You get publicity increase  and when it's won  publicity shoots through the roof    if it's properly managed    and that's part of the benefits to a sponsor. Then  when the prize is actually won  after it's moving  you get societal benefits  you know  new technology  new capability. And the benefit to the sponsors is the sum of the publicity and societal benefits over the long term. That's our value proposition in a prize. If you were going to go and try to create SpaceShipOne  or any kind of a new technology  you have to fund that from the beginning and maintain that funding with an uncertain outcome. It may or may not happen. But if you put up a prize  the beautiful thing is  you know  it's a very small maintenance fee  and you pay on success. Orteig didn't pay a dime out to the nine teams that went across    tried to go across the Atlantic  and we didn't pay a dime until someone won the Ansari X PRIZE. So  prizes work great. You know  innovators  the entrepreneurs out there  you know that when you're going for a goal  the first thing you have to do is believe that you can do it yourself. Then  you've got to  you know  face potential public ridicule of    that's a crazy idea  it'll never work. And then you have to convince others  so that they can  in fact  help you raise the funds  and then you've got to deal with the fact that you've got government bureaucracies and institutions that don't want you to move those things forward  and you have to deal with failures. What a prize does  what we've experienced a prize doing  is literally help to short circuit or support all of these things  because a prize credentials the idea that this is a good idea. Well  it must be a good idea. Someone's offering    million dollars to go and do this thing. And each of these areas was something that we found the Ansari X PRIZE helped short circuit these for innovation. So  as an organization  we put together a prize discovery process of how to come up with prizes and write the rules  and we're actually looking at creating prizes in a number of different categories. We're looking at attacking energy  environment  nanotechnology    and I'll talk about those more in a moment. And the way we're doing that is we're creating prize teams within the X PRIZE. We have a space prize team. We're going after an orbital prize. We are looking at a number of energy prizes. Craig Venter has just joined our board and we're doing a rapid genome sequencing prize with him  we'll be announcing later this fall  about    imagine being able to sequence anybody's DNA for under       dollars  revolutionize medicine. And clean water  education  medicine and even looking at social entrepreneurship. So my final slide here is  the most critical tool for solving humanity's grand challenges    it isn't technology  it isn't money  it's only one thing    it's the committed  passionate human mind. Well  good morning. You know  the computer and television both recently turned     and today I'd like to talk about their relationship. Despite their middle age  if you've been following the themes of this conference or the entertainment industry  it's pretty clear that one has been picking on the other. So it's about time that we talked about how the computer ambushed television  or why the invention of the atomic bomb unleashed forces that lead to the writers' strike. And it's not just what these are doing to each other  but it's what the audience thinks that really frames this matter. To get a sense of this  and it's been a theme we've talked about all week  I recently talked to a bunch of tweeners. I wrote on cards   television    radio    MySpace    Internet    PC.  And I said  just arrange these  from what's important to you and what's not  and then tell me why. Let's listen to what happens when they get to the portion of the discussion on television. because you can do a lot of other stuff with your free time than watch programs. Peter Hirshberg  Which is more fun  Internet or TV  Girls  Internet. Girl    I think we    the reasons  one of the reasons we put computer before TV is because nowadays  like  we have TV shows on the computer. Girl    And then you can download onto your iPod. PH  Would you like to be the president of a TV network  Girl    I wouldn't like it. Girl    That would be so stressful. Girl    No. PH  How come  Girl    Because they're going to lose all their money eventually. Girl    Like the stock market  it goes up and down and stuff. I think right now the computers will be at the top and everything will be kind of going down and stuff. PH  There's been an uneasy relationship between the TV business and the tech business  really ever since they both turned about   . We go through periods of enthrallment  followed by reactions in boardrooms  in the finance community best characterized as  what's the finance term  Ick pooey. Let me give you an example of this. The year is       and Warner buys Atari because video games are on the rise. The next year they march forward and they introduce Qube  the first interactive cable TV system  and the New York Times heralds this as telecommunications moving to the home  convergence  great things are happening. Everybody in the East Coast gets in the pictures    Citicorp  Penney  RCA    all getting into this big vision. By the way  this is about when I enter the picture. I'm going to do a summer internship at Time Warner. That summer I'm all    I'm at Warner that summer    I'm all excited to work on convergence  and then the bottom falls out. Doesn't work out too well for them  they lose money. And I had a happy brush with convergence until  kind of  Warner basically has to liquidate the whole thing. That's when I leave graduate school  and I can't work in New York on kind of entertainment and technology because I have to be exiled to California  where the remaining jobs are  almost to the sea  to go to work for Apple Computer. Warner  of course  writes off more than     million dollars. Four hundred million dollars  which was real money back in the '  s. But they were onto something and they got better at it. By the year       the process was perfected. They merged with AOL  and in just four years  managed to shed about     billion dollars of market capitalization  showing that they'd actually mastered the art of applying Moore's law of successive miniaturization to their balance sheet. Now  I think that one reason that the media and the entertainment communities  or the media community  is driven so crazy by the tech community is that tech folks talk differently. You know  for    years  we've talked about changing the world  about total transformation. For    years  it's been about hopes and fears and promises of a better world. And I got to thinking  you know  who else talks that way  And the answer is pretty clearly    it's people in religion and in politics. And so I realized that actually the tech world is best understood  not as a business cycle  but as a messianic movement. We promise something great  we evangelize it  we're going to change the world. It doesn't work out too well  and so we actually go back to the well and start all over again  as the people in New York and L.A. look on in absolute  morbid astonishment. But it's this irrational view of things that drives us on to the next thing. So  what I'd like to ask is  if the computer is becoming a principal tool of media and entertainment  how did we get here  I mean  how did a machine that was built for accounting and artillery morph into media  Of course  the first computer was built just after World War II to solve military problems  but things got really interesting just a couple of years later         with Whirlwind  built at MIT's Lincoln Lab. Jay Forrester was building this for the Navy  but you can't help but see that the creator of this machine had in mind a machine that might actually be a potential media star. So take a look at what happens when the foremost journalist of early television meets one of the foremost computer pioneers  and the computer begins to express itself. With considerable trepidation  we undertake to interview this new machine. Jay Forrester  Hello New York  this is Cambridge. And this is the oscilloscope of the Whirlwind electronic computer. Would you like if I used the machine  Journalist  Yes  of course. But I have an idea  Mr. Forrester. Since this computer was made in conjunction with the Office of Naval Research  why don't we switch down to the Pentagon in Washington and let the Navy's research chief  Admiral Bolster  give Whirlwind the workout  Calvin Bolster  Well  Ed  this problem concerns the Navy's Viking rocket. This rocket goes up     miles into the sky. Now  at the standard rate of fuel consumption  I would like to see the computer trace the flight path of this rocket and see how it can determine  at any instant  say at the end of    seconds  the amount of fuel remaining  and the velocity at that set instant. JF  Over on the left hand side  you will notice fuel consumption decreasing as the rocket takes off. And on the right hand side  there's a scale that shows the rocket's velocity. The rocket's position is shown by the trajectory that we're now looking at. And as it reaches the peak of its trajectory  the velocity  you will notice  has dropped off to a minimum. Then  as the rocket dives down  velocity picks up again toward a maximum velocity and the rocket hits the ground. How's that  Journalist  What about that  Admiral  CB  Looks very good to me. JF  And before leaving  we would like to show you another kind of mathematical problem that some of the boys have worked out in their spare time  in a less serious vein  for a Sunday afternoon.  Music  Journalist  Thank you very much indeed  Mr. Forrester and the MIT lab. PH  You know  so much was worked out  the first real time interaction  the video display  pointing a gun. It lead to the microcomputer  but unfortunately  it was too pricey for the Navy  and all of this would have been lost if it weren't for a happy coincidence. Enter the atomic bomb. We're threatened by the greatest weapon ever  and knowing a good thing when it sees it  the Air Force decides it needs the biggest computer ever to protect us. They adapt Whirlwind to a massive air defense system  deploy it all across the frozen north  and spend nearly three times as much on this computer as was spent on the Manhattan Project building the A Bomb in the first place. Talk about a shot in the arm for the computer industry. And you can imagine that the Air Force became a pretty good salesman. Here's their marketing video. before we could determine their tracks. And then it would be too late to act. We cannot afford to take that chance. It is to meet this threat that the Air Force has been developing SAGE  the Semi Automatic Ground Environment system  to strengthen our air defenses. This new computer  built to become the nerve center of a defense network  is able to perform all the complex mathematical problems involved in countering a mass enemy raid. It is provided with its own powerhouse containing large diesel driven generators  air conditioning equipment  and cooling towers required to cool the thousands of vacuum tubes in the computer. PH  You know  that one computer was huge. There's an interesting marketing lesson from it  which is basically  when you market a product  you can either say  this is going to be wonderful  it will make you feel better and enliven you. Or there's one other marketing proposition  if you don't use our product  you'll die. This is a really good example of that. This had the first pointing device. It was distributed  so it worked out    distributed computing and modems    so all these things could talk to each other. About    percent of all the nation's programmers were wrapped up in this thing  and it led to an awful lot of what we have today. It also used vacuum tubes. You saw how huge it was  and to give you a sense for this    because we've talked a lot about Moore's law and making things small at this conference  so let's talk about making things large. If we took Whirlwind and put it in a place that you all know  say  Century City  it would fit beautifully. You'd kind of have to take Century City out  but it could fit in there. But like  let's imagine we took the latest Pentium processor  the latest Core   Extreme  which is a four core processor that Intel's working on  it will be our laptop tomorrow. To build that  what we'd do with Whirlwind technology is we'd have to take up roughly from the    to Mulholland  and from the     to La Cienega just with those Whirlwinds. And then  the    nuclear power plants that it would take to provide the power would fill up the rest of Los Angeles. That's roughly a third more nuclear power than all of France creates. So  the next time they tell you they're on to something  clearly they're not. So    and we haven't even worked out the cooling needs. But it gives you the kind of power that people have  that the audience has  and the reasons these transformations are happening. All of this stuff starts moving into industry. DEC kind of reduces all this and makes the first mini computer. It shows up at places like MIT  and then a mutation happens. Spacewar  is built  the first computer game  and all of a sudden  interactivity and involvement and passion is worked out. Actually  many MIT students stayed up all night long working on this thing  and many of the principles of gaming today were worked out. DEC knew a good thing about wasting time. It shipped every one of its computers with that game. Meanwhile  as all of this is happening  by the mid '  s  the business model of traditional broadcasting and cinema has been busted completely. A new technology has confounded radio men and movie moguls and they're quite certain that television is about to do them in. In fact  despair is in the air. And a quote that sounds largely reminiscent from everything I've been reading all week. RCA had David Sarnoff  who basically commercialized radio  said this   I don't say that radio networks must die. Every effort has been made and will continue to be made to find a new pattern  new selling arrangements and new types of programs that may arrest the declining revenues. It may yet be possible to eke out a poor existence for radio  but I don't know how.  And of course  as the computer industry develops interactively  producers in the emerging TV business actually hit on the same idea. And they fake it. up on the set  you just get them out. First of all  get your Winky Dink kits out. Put out your Magic Window and your erasing glove  and rub it like this. That's the way we get some of the magic into it  boys and girls. Then take it and put it right up against the screen of your own television set  and rub it out from the center to the corners  like this. Make sure you keep your magic crayons handy  your Winky Dink crayons and your erasing glove  because you'll be using them during the show to draw like that. You all set  OK  let's get right to the first story about Dusty Man. Come on into the secret lab. PH  It was the dawn of interactive TV  and you may have noticed they wanted to sell you the Winky Dink kits. Those are the Winky Dink crayons. I know what you're saying.  Pete  I could use any ordinary open source crayon  why do I have to buy theirs   I assure you  that's not the case. Turns out they told us directly that these are the only crayons you should ever use with your Winky Dink Magic Window  other crayons may discolor or hurt the window. This proprietary principle of vendor lock in would go on to be perfected with great success as one of the enduring principles of windowing systems everywhere. It led to lawsuits    federal investigations  and lots of repercussions  and that's a scandal we won't discuss today. But we will discuss this scandal  because this man  Jack Berry  the host of  Winky Dink   went on to become the host of  Twenty One   one of the most important quiz shows ever. And it was rigged  and it became unraveled when this man  Charles van Doren  was outed after an unnatural winning streak  ending Berry's career. And actually  ending the career of a lot of people at CBS. It turns out there was a lot to learn about how this new medium worked. And    years ago  if you'd been at a meeting like this and were trying to understand the media  there was one prophet and only but one you wanted to hear from  Professor Marshall McLuhan. He actually understood something about a theme that we've been discussing all week. It's the role of the audience in an era of pervasive electronic communications. Here he is talking from the     s. of making the ad  then it's happy. It's like the old quiz shows. They were great TV because it gave the audience a role  something to do. They were horrified when they discovered they'd really been left out all the time because the shows were rigged. Now  then  this was a horrible misunderstanding of TV on the part of the programmers. PH  You know  McLuhan talked about the global village. If you substitute the word blogosphere  of the Internet today  it is very true that his understanding is probably very enlightening now. Let's listen in to him. in which you don't necessarily have harmony. You have extreme concern with everybody else's business and much involvement in everybody else's life. It's a sort of Ann Landers' column writ large. And it doesn't necessarily mean harmony and peace and quiet  but it does mean huge involvement in everybody else's affairs. And so the global village is as big as a planet  and as small as a village post office. PH  We'll talk a little bit more about him later. We're now right into the     s. It's the era of big business and data centers for computing. But all that was about to change. You know  the expression of technology reflects the people and the time of the culture it was built in. And when I say that code expresses our hopes and aspirations  it's not just a joke about messianism  it's actually what we do. But for this part of the story  I'd actually like to throw it to America's leading technology correspondent  John Markoff. in drugs  sex  rock 'n' roll and the anti war movement had to do with computing  Everything. It all happened within five miles of where I'm standing  at Stanford University  between      and     . In the midst of revolution in the streets and rock and roll concerts in the parks  a group of researchers led by people like John McCarthy  a computer scientist at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab  and Doug Engelbart  a computer scientist at SRI  changed the world. Engelbart came out of a pretty dry engineering culture  but while he was beginning to do his work  all of this stuff was bubbling on the mid peninsula. There was LSD leaking out of Kesey's Veterans' Hospital experiments and other areas around the campus  and there was music literally in the streets. The Grateful Dead was playing in the pizza parlors. People were leaving to go back to the land. There was the Vietnam War. There was black liberation. There was women's liberation. This was a remarkable place  at a remarkable time. And into that ferment came the microprocessor. I think it was that interaction that led to personal computing. They saw these tools that were controlled by the establishment as ones that could actually be liberated and put to use by these communities that they were trying to build. And most importantly  they had this ethos of sharing information. I think these ideas are difficult to understand  because when you're trapped in one paradigm  the next paradigm is always like a science fiction universe    it makes no sense. The stories were so compelling that I decided to write a book about them. The title of the book is   What the Dormouse Said  How the '  s Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer Industry.  The title was taken from the lyrics to a Jefferson Airplane song. The lyrics go   Remember what the dormouse said. Feed your head  feed your head  feed your head.   Music  PH  By this time  computing had kind of leapt into media territory  and in short order much of what we're doing today was imagined in Cambridge and Silicon Valley. Here's the Architecture Machine Group  the predecessor of the Media Lab  in     . Meanwhile  in California  we were trying to commercialize a lot of this stuff. HyperCard was the first program to introduce the public to hyperlinks  where you could randomly hook to any kind of picture  or piece of text  or data across a file system  and we had no way of explaining it. There was no metaphor. Was it a database  A prototyping tool  A scripted language  Heck  it was everything. So we ended up writing a marketing brochure. We asked a question about how the mind works  and we let our customers play the role of so many blind men filling out the elephant. A few years later  we then hit on the idea of explaining to people the secret of  how do you get the content you want  the way you want it and the easy way  Here's the Apple marketing video. to create a HyperCard interactive video. The most involved method is to go ahead and produce your own videodisc as well as build your own HyperCard stacks. By far the simplest method is to buy a pre made videodisc and HyperCard stacks from a commercial supplier. The method we illustrate in this video uses a pre made videodisc but creates custom HyperCard stacks. This method allows you to use existing videodisc materials in ways which suit your specific needs and interests. PH  I hope you realize how subversive that is. That's like a Dick Cheney speech. You think he's a nice balding guy  but he's just declared war on the content business. Find the commercial stuff  mash it up  tell the story your way. Now  as long as we confine this to the education market  and a personal matter between the computer and the file system  that's fine  but as you can see  it was about to leap out and upset Jack Valenti and a lot of other people. By the way  speaking of the filing system  it never occurred to us that these hyperlinks could go beyond the local area network. A few years later  Tim Berners Lee worked that out. It became a killer app of links  and today  of course  we call that the World Wide Web. Now  not only was I instrumental in helping Apple miss the Internet  but a couple of years later  I helped Bill Gates do the same thing. The year is      and he was working on a book and I was working on a video to help him kind of explain where we were all heading and how to popularize all this. We were plenty aware that we were messing with media  and on the surface  it looks like we predicted a lot of the right things  but we also missed an awful lot. Let's take a look. and TV dinners  ancient and modern wonders of the man made world all. Yet each pales to insignificance with the completion of that magnificent accomplishment of twenty first century technology  the Digital Superhighway. Once it was only a dream of technoids and a few long forgotten politicians. The Digital Highway arrived in America's living rooms late in the twentieth century. Let us recall the pioneers who made this technical marvel possible. The Digital Highway would follow the rutted trail first blazed by Alexander Graham Bell. Though some were incredulous ...

Narrator  Computers  once the unwieldy tools of accountants and other geeks  escaped the backrooms to enter the media fracas.

You know  you missed  we missed the Internet  the long tail  the role of the audience  open systems  social networks. It just goes to show how tough it is to come up with the right uses of media. Thomas Edison had the same problem. He wrote a list of what the phonograph might be good for when he invented it  and kind of only one of his ideas turned out to have been the right early idea. Well  you know where we're going on from here. We come into the era of the dotcom  the World Wide Web  and I don't need to tell you about that because we all went through that bubble together. But when we emerge from this and what we call Web  .   things actually are quite different. And I think it's the reason that TV's so challenged. If Internet one was about pages  now it's about people. It's a customer  it's an audience  it's a person who's participating. It's the formidable thing that is changing entertainment now. PH  In my own company  Technorati  we see something like        blog posts an hour come in. That's about       fresh  connective links across about     million blogs that are out there. And it's no wonder that as we head into the writers' strike  odd things happen. You know  it reminds me of that old saw in Hollywood  that a producer is anyone who knows a writer. I now think a network boss is anyone who has a cable modem. But it's not a joke. This is a real headline.  Websites attract striking writers  operators of sites like MyDamnChannel.com could benefit from labor disputes.  Meanwhile  you have the TV bloggers going out on strike  in sympathy with the television writers. And then you have TV Guide  a Fox property  which is about to sponsor the online video awards    but cancels it out of sympathy with traditional television  not appearing to gloat. To show you how schizophrenic this all is  here's the head of MySpace  or Fox Interactive  a News Corp company  being asked  well  with the writers' strike  isn't this going to hurt News Corp and help you online  there's an opportunity for more people to experience video on places like MySpace TV. PH  Oh  but then he remembers he works for Rupert Murdoch. as part of Fox Entertainment Group. Obviously  we hope that the strike is    that the issues are resolved as quickly as possible. PH  One of the great things that's going on here is the globalization of content really is happening. Here is a clip from a video  from a piece of animation that was written by a writer in Hollywood  animation worked out in Israel  farmed out to Croatia and India  and it's now an international series. in the months preceding the presidential primaries. Voice    You'll have to stay here in the safe house until we get word the terrorist threat is over. Voice    You mean we'll have to live here  together  Voices      and    With her  Voice    Well  there goes the neighborhood. PH  The company that created this  Aniboom  is an interesting example of where this is headed. Traditional TV animation costs  say  between        and        dollars a minute. They're producing things for between       and     dollars a minute. And they're offering their creators    percent of the back end  in a much more entrepreneurial manner. So  it's a different model. What the entertainment business is struggling with  the world of brands is figuring out. For example  Nike now understands that Nike Plus is not just a device in its shoe  it's a network to hook its customers together. And the head of marketing at Nike says   People are coming to our site an average of three times a week. We don't have to go to them.  Which means television advertising is down    percent for Nike. Or  as Nike's head of marketing says   We're not in the business of keeping media companies alive. We're in the business of connecting with consumers.  And media companies realize the audience is important also. Here's a man announcing the new Market Watch from Dow Jones  powered     percent by the user experience on the home page    user generated content married up with traditional content. It turns out you have a bigger audience and more interest if you hook up with them. Or  as Geoffrey Moore once told me  it's intellectual curiosity that's the trade that brands need in the age of the blogosphere. And I think this is beginning to happen in the entertainment business. One of my heroes is songwriter  Ally Willis  who just wrote  The Color Purple  and has been an R and    rhythm and blues writer  and this is what she said about where songwriting's going. Ally Willis  Where millions of collaborators wanted the song  because to look at them strictly as spam is missing what this medium is about. PH  So  to wrap up  I'd love to throw it back to Marshall McLuhan  who     years ago  was dealing with audiences that were going through just as much change  and I think that  today  traditional Hollywood and the writers are framing this perhaps in the way that it was being framed before. But I don't need to tell you this  let's throw it back to him. MM  The medium does things to people and they are always completely unaware of this. They don't really notice the new medium that is wrapping them up. They think of the old medium  because the old medium is always the content of the new medium  as movies tend to be the content of TV  and as books used to be the content  novels used to be the content of movies. And so every time a new medium arrives  the old medium is the content  and it is highly observable  highly noticeable  but the real  real roughing up and massaging is done by the new medium  and it is ignored. PH  I think it's a great time of enthrallment. There's been more raw DNA of communications and media thrown out there. Content is moving from shows to particles that are batted back and forth  and part of social communications  and I think this is going to be a time of great renaissance and opportunity. And whereas television may have gotten beat up  what's getting built is a really exciting new form of communication  and we kind of have the merger of the two industries and a new way of thinking to look at it. Thanks very much. I'm going to try and explain why it is that perhaps we don't understand as much as we think we do. I'd like to begin with four questions. This is not some sort of cultural thing for the time of year. That's an in joke  by the way. But these four questions  actually  are ones that people who even know quite a lot about science find quite hard. And they're questions that I've asked of science television producers  of audiences of science educators    so that's science teachers    and also of seven year olds  and I find that the seven year olds do marginally better than the other audiences  which is somewhat surprising. So the first question  and you might want to write this down  either on a bit of paper  physically  or a virtual piece of paper in your head. And  for viewers at home  you can try this as well. A little seed weighs next to nothing and a tree weighs a lot  right  I think we agree on that. Where does the tree get the stuff that makes up this chair  right  Where does all this stuff come from  And your next question is  can you light a little torch bulb with a battery  a bulb and one piece of wire  And would you be able to  kind of  draw a    you don't have to draw the diagram  but would you be able to draw the diagram  if you had to do it  Or would you just say  that's actually not possible  The third question is  why is it hotter in summer than in winter  I think we can probably agree that it is hotter in summer than in winter  but why  And finally  would you be able to    and you can sort of scribble it  if you like    scribble a plan diagram of the solar system  showing the shape of the planets' orbits  Would you be able to do that  And if you can  just scribble a pattern. OK. Now  children get their ideas not from teachers  as teachers often think  but actually from common sense  from experience of the world around them  from all the things that go on between them and their peers  and their carers  and their parents  and all of that. Experience. And one of the great experts in this field  of course  was  bless him  Cardinal Wolsey. Be very careful what you get into people's heads because it's virtually impossible to shift it afterwards  right  I'm not quite sure how he died  actually. Was he beheaded in the end  or hung  Now  those questions  which  of course  you've got right  and you haven't been conferring  and so on. And I    you know  normally  I would pick people out and humiliate  but maybe not in this instance. A little seed weighs a lot and  basically  all this stuff     percent of this stuff  came out of the air. Now  I guarantee that about    percent of you  or maybe it's fewer at TED  will have said it comes out of the ground. And some people  probably two of you  will come up and argue with me afterwards  and say that actually  it comes out of the ground. Now  if that was true  we'd have trucks going round the country  filling people's gardens in with soil  it'd be a fantastic business. But  actually  we don't do that. The mass of this comes out of the air. Now  I passed all my biology exams in Britain. I passed them really well  but I still came out of school thinking that that stuff came out of the ground. Second one  can you light a little torch bulb with a battery bulb and one piece of wire  Yes  you can  and I'll show you in a second how to do that. Now  I have some rather bad news  which is that I had a piece of video that I was about to show you  which unfortunately    the sound doesn't work in this room  so I'm going to describe to you  in true  Monty Python  fashion  what happens in the video. And in the video  a group of researchers go to MIT on graduation day. We chose MIT because  obviously  that's a very long way away from here  and you wouldn't mind too much  but it sort of works the same way in Britain and in the West Coast of the USA. And we asked them these questions  and we asked those questions of science graduates  and they couldn't answer them. And so  there's a whole lot of people saying   I'd be very surprised if you told me that this came out of the air. That's very surprising to me.  And those are science graduates. And we intercut it with   We are the premier science university in the world   because of British like hubris. And when we gave graduate engineers that question  they said it couldn't be done. And when we gave them a battery  and a piece of wire  and a bulb  and said   Can you do it   They couldn't do it. Right  And that's no different from Imperial College in London  by the way  it's not some sort of anti American thing going on. As if. Now  the reason this matters is we pay lots and lots of money for teaching people    we might as well get it right. And there are also some societal reasons why we might want people to understand what it is that's happening in photosynthesis. For example  one half of the carbon equation is how much we emit  and the other half of the carbon equation  as I'm very conscious as a trustee of Kew  is how much things soak up  and they soak up carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. That's what plants actually do for a living. And  for any Finnish people in the audience  this is a Finnish pun  we are  both literally and metaphorically  skating on thin ice if we don't understand that kind of thing. Now  here's how you do the battery and the bulb. It's so easy  isn't it  Of course  you all knew that. But if you haven't played with a battery and a bulb  if you've only seen a circuit diagram  you might not be able to do that  and that's one of the problems. So  why is it hotter in summer than in winter  We learn  as children  that you get closer to something that's hot  and it burns you. It's a very powerful bit of learning  and it happens pretty early on. By extension  we think to ourselves   Why it's hotter in summer than in winter must be because we're closer to the Sun.  I promise you that most of you will have got that. Oh  you're all shaking your heads  but only a few of you are shaking your heads very firmly. Other ones are kind of going like this. All right. It's hotter in summer than in winter because the rays from the Sun are spread out more  right  because of the tilt of the Earth. And if you think the tilt is tilting us closer  no  it isn't. The Sun is    million miles away  and we're tilting like this  right  It makes no odds. In fact  in the Northern Hemisphere  we're further from the Sun in summer  as it happens  but it makes no odds  the difference. OK  now  the scribble of the diagram of the solar system. If you believe  as most of you probably do  that it's hotter in summer than in winter because we're closer to the Sun  you must have drawn an ellipse. Right  That would explain it  right  Except  in your    you're nodding    now  in your ellipse  have you thought   Well  what happens during the night   Between Australia and here  right  they've got summer and we've got winter  and what    does the Earth kind of rush towards the Sun at night  and then rush back again  I mean  it's a very strange thing going on  and we hold these two models in our head  of what's right and what isn't right  and we do that  as human beings  in all sorts of fields. So  here's Copernicus' view of what the solar system looked like as a plan. That's pretty much what you should have on your piece of paper. Right  And this is NASA's view. They're stunningly similar. I hope you notice the coincidence here. What would you do if you knew that people had this misconception  right  in their heads  of elliptical orbits caused by our experiences as children  What sort of diagram would you show them of the solar system  to show that it's not really like that  You'd show them something like this  wouldn't you  It's a plan  looking down from above. But  no  look what I found in the textbooks. That's what you show people  right  These are from textbooks  from websites  educational websites    and almost anything you pick up is like that. And the reason it's like that is because it's dead boring to have a load of concentric circles  whereas that's much more exciting  to look at something at that angle  isn't it  Right  And by doing it at that angle  if you've got that misconception in your head  then that two dimensional representation of a three dimensional thing will be ellipses. So you've    it's crap  isn't it really  As we say. So  these mental models    we look for evidence that reinforces our models. We do this  of course  with matters of race  and politics  and everything else  and we do it in science as well. So we look  just look    and scientists do it  constantly    we look for evidence that reinforces our models  and some folks are just all too able and willing to provide the evidence that reinforces the models. So  being I'm in the United States  I'll have a dig at the Europeans. These are examples of what I would say is bad practice in science teaching centers. These pictures are from La Villette in France and the welcome wing of the Science Museum in London. And  if you look at the  kind of the way these things are constructed  there's a lot of mediation by glass  and it's very blue  and kind of professional    in that way that  you know  Woody Allen comes up from under the sheets in that scene in  Annie Hall   and said   God  that's so professional.  And that you don't    there's no passion in it  and it's not hands on  right  and  you know  pun intended. Whereas good interpretation    I'll use an example from nearby    is San Francisco Exploratorium  where all the things that    the demonstrations  and so on  are made out of everyday objects that children can understand  it's very hands on  and they can engage with  and experiment with. And I know that if the graduates at MIT and in the Imperial College in London had had the battery and the wire and the bit of stuff  and you know  been able to do it  they would have learned how it actually works  rather than thinking that they follow circuit diagrams and can't do it. So good interpretation is more about things that are bodged and stuffed and of my world  right  And things that    where there isn't an extra barrier of a piece of glass or machined titanium  and it all looks fantastic  OK  And the Exploratorium does that really  really well. And it's amateur  but amateur in the best sense  in other words  the root of the word being of love and passion. So  children are not empty vessels  OK  So  as  Monty Python  would have it  this is a bit Lord Privy Seal to say so  but this is    children are not empty vessels. They come with their own ideas and their own theories  and unless you work with those  then you won't be able to shift them  right  And I probably haven't shifted your ideas of how the world and universe operates  either. But this applies  equally  to matters of trying to sell new technology. For example  we are  in Britain  we're trying to do a digital switchover of the whole population into digital technology  for television . And it's one of the difficult things is that when people have preconceptions of how it all works  it's quite difficult to shift those. So we're not empty vessels  the mental models that we have as children persist into adulthood. Poor teaching actually does more harm than good. In this country and in Britain  magnetism is understood better by children before they've been to school than afterwards  OK  Same for gravity  two concepts  so it's    which is quite humbling  as a  you know  if you're a teacher  and you look before and after  that's quite worrying. They do worse in tests afterwards  after the teaching. And we collude. We design tests  or at least in Britain  so that people pass them. Right  And governments do very well. They pat themselves on the back. OK  We collude  and actually if you    if someone had designed a test for me when I was doing my biology exams  to really understand  to see whether I'd understood more than just kind of putting starch and iodine together and seeing it go blue  and really understood that plants took their mass out of the air  then I might have done better at science. So the most important thing is to get people to articulate their models. Your homework is    you know  how does an aircraft's wing create lift  An obvious question  and you'll have an answer now in your heads. And the second question to that then is  ensure you've explained how it is that planes can fly upside down. Ah ha  right. Second question is  why is the sea blue  All right  And you've all got an idea in your head of the answer. So  why is it blue on cloudy days  Ah  see. I've always wanted to say that in this country. Finally  my plea to you is to allow yourselves  and your children  and anyone you know  to kind of fiddle with stuff  because it's by fiddling with things that you  you know  you complement your other learning. It's not a replacement  it's just part of learning that's important. Thank you very much. Now    oh  oh yeah  go on then  go on. Good afternoon  good evening  whatever. We can go  jambo  guten Abend  bonsoir  but we can also ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh. That is the call that chimpanzees make before they go to sleep in the evening. You hear it going from one side of the valley to the other  from one group of nests to the next. And I want to pick up with my talk this evening from where Zeray left off yesterday. He was talking about this amazing  three year old Australopithecine child  Selam. And we've also been hearing about the history  the family tree  of mankind through DNA genetic profiling. And it was a paleontologist  the late Louis Leakey  who actually set me on the path for studying chimpanzees. And it was pretty extraordinary  way back then. It's kind of commonplace now  but his argument was    because he'd been searching for the fossilized remains of early humans in Africa. And you can tell an awful lot about what those beings looked like from the fossils  from the shape of the muscle attachments  something about the way they lived from the various artifacts found with them. But what about how they behaved  That's what he wanted to know. And of course  behavior doesn't fossilize. He argued    and it's now a fairly common theory    that if we found behavior patterns similar or the same in our closest living relatives  the great apes  and humans today  then maybe those behaviors were present in the ape like  human like ancestor some seven million years ago. And therefore  perhaps we had brought those characteristics with us from that ancient  ancient past. Well  if you look in textbooks today that deal with human evolution  you very often find people speculating about how early humans may have behaved  based on the behavior of chimpanzees. They are more like us than any other living creature  and we've heard about that during this TED Conference. So it remains for me to comment on the ways in which chimpanzees are so like us  in certain aspects of their behavior. Every chimpanzee has his or her own personality. Of course  I gave them names. They can live to be    years or more  although we think most of them probably don't make it to    in the wild. Mr. Wurzel. The female has her first baby when she's    or   . Thereafter  she has one baby only every five or six years  a long period of childhood dependency when the child is nursing  sleeping with the mother at night  and riding on her back. And we believe that this long period of childhood is important for chimpanzees  just as it is for us  in relation to learning. As the brain becomes ever more complex during evolution in different forms of animals  so we find that learning plays an ever more important role in an individual's life history. And young chimpanzees spend a lot of time watching what their elders do. We know now that they're capable of imitating behaviors that they see. And we believe that it's in this way that the different tool using behaviors    that have now been seen in all the different chimpanzee populations studied in Africa    how these are passed from one generation to the next  through observation  imitation and practice  so that we can describe these tool using behaviors as primitive culture. Chimpanzees don't have a spoken language. We've talked about that. They do have a very rich repertoire of postures and gestures  many of which are similar  or even identical  to ours and formed in the same context. Greeting chimpanzees embracing. They also kiss  hold hands  pat one another on the back. And they swagger and they throw rocks. In chimpanzee society  we find many  many examples of compassion  precursors to love and true altruism. Unfortunately  they  like us  have a dark side to their nature. They're capable of extreme brutality  even a kind of primitive war. And these really aggressive behaviors  for the most part  are directed against individuals of the neighboring social group. They are very territorially aggressive. Chimpanzees  I believe  more than any other living creature  have helped us to understand that  after all  there is no sharp line between humans and the rest of the animal kingdom. It's a very blurry line  and it's getting more blurry all the time as we make even more observations. The study that I began in      is still continuing to this day. And these chimpanzees  living their complex social lives in the wild  have helped    more than anything else    to make us realize we are part of  and not separated from  the amazing animals with whom we share the planet. So it's pretty sad to find that chimpanzees  like so many other creatures around the world  are losing their habitats. This is just one photograph from the air  and it shows you the forested highlands of Gombe. And it was when I flew over the whole area  about    years ago  and realized that outside the park  this forest  which in      had stretched almost unbroken along the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika  which is where the tiny     square mile Gombe National Park lies  that a question came to my mind.  How can we even try to save these famous chimpanzees  when the people living around the National Park are struggling to survive   More people are living there than the land could possibly support. The numbers increased by refugees pouring in from Burundi and over the lake from Congo. And very poor people    they couldn't afford to buy food from elsewhere. This led to a program  which we call TACARE. It's a very holistic way of improving the lives of the people living in the villages around the park. It started small with    villages. It's now in   . There isn't time to go into it  but it's including things like tree nurseries  methods of farming most suitable to this now very degraded  almost desert like land up in these mountains. Ways of controlling  preventing soil erosion. Ways of reclaiming overused farmland  so that within two years they can again be productive. Working to help the villagers obtain fresh water from wells. Perhaps build some schoolrooms. Most important of all  I believe  is working with small groups of women  providing them with opportunities for micro credit loans. And we've got  as is the case around the world  about    percent of all loans returned. Empowering women  working with education  providing scholarships for girls so they can finish secondary school  in the clear understanding that  all around the world  as women's education improves  family size drops. We provide information about family planning and about HIV AIDS. And as a result of this program  something's happening for conservation. What's happening for conservation is that the farmers living in these    villages  instead of looking on us as a bunch of white people coming to study a whole bunch of monkeys    and by the way  many of the staff are now Tanzanian    but when we began the TACARE program  it was a Tanzanian team going into the villages. It was a Tanzanian team talking to the villagers  asking what they were interested in. Were they interested in conservation  Absolutely not. They were interested in health  they were interested in education. And as time went on  and as their situation began to improve  they began to understand ever more about the need for conservation. They began to understand that as the upper levels of the hills were denuded of trees  so you've got this terrible soil erosion and mudslides. Today  we are developing what we call the Greater Gombe Ecosystem. This is an area way outside the National Park  stretching out into all these very degraded lands. And as these villages have a better standard of life  they are actually agreeing to put between    percent and    percent of their land in the highlands aside  so that once again  as the trees grow back  the chimpanzees will have leafy corridors through which they can travel to interact    as they must for genetic viability    with other remnant groups outside the National Park. So TACARE is a success. We're replicating it in other parts of Africa  around other wilderness areas which are faced with extreme population pressure. The problems in Africa  however  as we've been discussing for the whole of these first couple of days of TED  are major problems. There is a great deal of poverty. And when you get large numbers of people living in land that is not that fertile  particularly when you cut down trees  and you leave the soil open to the wind for erosion  as desperate populations cut down more and more trees  so that they can try and grow food for themselves and their families  what's going to happen  Something's got to give. And the other problems    in not only Africa  but the rest of the developing world and  indeed  everywhere    what are we doing to our planet  You know  the famous scientist  E. O. Wilson said that if every person on this planet attains the standard of living of the average European or American  we need three new planets. Today  they are saying four. But we don't have them. We've got one. And what's happened  I mean  the question here is  here we are  arguably the most intelligent being that's ever walked planet Earth  with this extraordinary brain  capable of the kind of technology that is so well illustrated by these TED Conferences  and yet we're destroying the only home we have. The indigenous people around the world  before they made a major decision  used to sit around and ask themselves   How does this decision affect our people seven generations ahead   Today  major decisions    and I'm not particularly talking about Africa here  but the developed world    major decisions involving millions of dollars  and millions of people  are often based on   How will this affect the next shareholders' meeting   And these decisions affect Africa. As I began traveling around Africa talking about the problems faced by chimpanzees and their vanishing forests  I realized more and more how so many of Africa's problems could be laid at the door of previous colonial exploitation. So I began traveling outside Africa  talking in Europe  talking in the United States  going to Asia. And everywhere there were these terrible problems. And you know the kind I'm talking about. I'm talking about pollution. The air that we breathe that often poisons us. The earth is poisoning our foods. The water    water is perhaps one of the most crucial issues that we're going to face in this century    and everywhere water is being polluted by agricultural  industrial and household chemicals that still are being sprayed around the world  seemingly with the inability to profit from past experience. The mangroves are being cut down  the effects of things like the tsunami get worse. We've talked about the soil erosion. We have the reckless burning of fossil fuels along with other greenhouse gasses  so called  leading to climate change. Finally  all around the world  people have begun to believe that there is something going on very wrong with our climate. All around the world climates are mixed up. And it's the poor people who are affected worse. It's Africa that already is affected. In many parts of sub Saharan Africa  the droughts are so much worse. And when the rain does come  it so often leads to flooding and added distress  and the cycle of poverty and hunger and disease. And the numbers of people living in an area that the land cannot support  who are too poor to buy food  who can't move away because the whole land is degraded. And so you get desertification    creeping  creeping  creeping    as the last of the trees are cut down. And this kind of thing is not just in Africa. It's all over the world. So it wasn't surprising to me that as I was traveling around the world I met so many young people who seemed to have lost hope. We seem to have lost wisdom  the wisdom of the indigenous people. I asked a question.  Why   Well  do you think there could be some kind of disconnect between this extraordinarily clever brain  the kind of brain that the TED technologies exemplify  and the human heart  Talking about it in the non scientific term  in terms of love and compassion. Is there some disconnect  And these young people  when I talk to them  basically they were either depressed or apathetic  or bitter and angry. And they said more or less the same thing   We feel this way because we feel you've compromised our future and there's nothing we can do about it.  We have compromised their future. I've got three little grandchildren  and every time I look at them and I think how we've harmed this beautiful planet since I was their age  I feel this desperation. And that led to this program we call Roots and Shoots  which began right here in Tanzania and has now spread to    countries around the world. It's symbolic. Roots make a firm foundation. Shoots seem tiny  to reach the sun they can break through a brick wall. See the brick wall as all these problems we've inflicted on the planet  environmental and social. It's a message of hope. Hundreds and thousands of young people around the world can break through and can make this a better world for all living things. The most important message of Roots and Shoots  every single one of us makes a difference  every single day. We have a choice. Every one of us in this room  we have a choice as to what kind of difference we want to make. The very poor have no choice. It's up to us to change things so that the poor have choice as well. The Roots and Shoots groups all choose three projects. It depends on how old they are  and which country  whether they're in a city or rural  as to what kinds of projects. But basically  we have programs now from preschool right through university  with more and more adults starting their own Roots and Shoots groups. And every group chooses  between them  three different kinds of project to make this a better world  recognizing that all these different problems are interconnected and impinge on each other. So one of their projects will be to help their own human community. And then  if they're able  they may raise money to help communities in other parts of the world. One of their projects will be to help animals    not just wildlife  domestic animals as well. And one of their projects will be to help the environment that we all share. And woven throughout all of this is a message of learning to live in peace and harmony within ourselves  in our families  in our communities  between nations  between cultures  between religions and between us and the natural world. We need the natural world. We cannot go on destroying it at the rate we are. We not do have more than this one planet. Just picking one or two of the projects right here in Africa that the Roots and Shoots groups are doing  one or two projects only    in Tanzania  in Uganda  Kenya  South Africa  Congo Brazzaville  Sierra Leone  Cameroon and other groups. And as I say  it's in    countries around the world. Of course  they're planting trees. They're growing organic vegetables. They're working in the refugee camps  with chickens and selling the eggs for a little amount of money  or just using them to feed their families  and feeling a sense of pride and empowerment  because they're no longer helpless and depending on others with their vegetables and their chickens. It's being used in Uganda to give some psychological help to ex child soldiers. Doing projects like this is bringing them out of themselves. Once again  they're useful members of society. We have this program in prisons as well. So  there's no time for more Roots and Shoots now. But    oh  they're also working on HIV AIDS. That's a very important component of Roots and Shoots  with older kids talking to younger ones. And unwanted pregnancies and things like that  which young people listen to better from other youth  rather than adults. Hope. That's the question I get asked as I'm going around the world   Jane  you've seen so many terrible things  you've seen your chimpanzees decrease in number from about one million  at the turn of the century  to no more than         now  and the same with so many other animals. Forests disappearing  deserts where once there was forest. Do you really have hope   Well  yes. You can't come to a conference like TED and not have hope  can you  And of course  there's hope. One is this amazing human brain. And I mean  think of the technologies. And I've just been so thrilled  finally  to come to people talking about compost latrines. It's one of my hobbyhorses. We just flush all this water down the lavatory  it's terrible. And then talking about renewable energy    desperately important. Do we care about the planet for our children  How many of us have children or grandchildren  nieces  nephews  Do we care about their future  And if we care about their future  we  as the elite around the world  we can do something about it. We can make choices as to how we live each day. What we buy. What we wear. And choose to make these choices with the question  how will this affect the environment around me  How will it affect the life of my child when he or she grows up  Or my grandchild  or whatever it is. So the human brain  coupled with the human heart  and we join hands around the world. And that's what TED is helping so well with  and Google who help us  and Esri are helping us with mapping in Gombe National Park. All of these technologies we can use. Now let's link them  and it's beginning to happen  isn't it  You've heard about it this afternoon. It's beginning to happen. This change  this change. To see change that we must have if we care about the future. And the next reason for hope    nature is amazingly resilient. You can take an area that's absolutely destroyed  with time and perhaps some help it can regenerate. And an example is the TACARE program. I told you  where a seemingly dead tree stump    if you stop hacking them for firewood  which you don't need to because you have wood lots  then in five years you can have a    foot tree. And animals  almost on the brink of extinction  can be given a second chance. That's my next book. It's inspiring. And it brings me to my last category of hope  and we've heard about this so much in the last two days  this indomitable human spirit. This determination of people  the resilience of the human spirit  So that people who you would think would be battered by poverty  or disease  or whatever  can pull themselves up out of it  sometimes with a helping hand  and take their part in society  and take their part in changing the world. And just to think of one or two people out of Africa who are just really inspiring. We could make a very long list  but obviously Nelson Mandela  emerging from    years of hard physical labor     years of imprisonment  with this amazing ability to forgive  so that he could lead his nation out the evil regime of apartheid without a bloodbath. Ken Saro Wiwa  in Nigeria  who took on the giant oil companies  and although people around the world tried their best  was executed. People like this are so inspirational. People like this are the role models we need for young Africans. And we need some environmental role models as well  and I've been hearing some of them today. So I'm really grateful for this opportunity to share this message again  with everyone at TED. And I hope that some of us can get together and talk about some of these things  especially the Roots and Shoots program. And just a last word on that    the young woman who's running this entire conference center  I met her today. She came up so excited  with her certificate. She was  in  Roots and Shoots. She was in the leadership in Dar es Salaam. She said it's helped her to do what she's doing. And it was very  very exciting for me to meet her and see just one example of how young people  when they are empowered  given the opportunity to take action  to make the world a better place  truly are our hope for tomorrow. Thank you. So  a big question that we're facing now and have been for quite a number of years now  are we at risk of a nuclear attack  Now  there's a bigger question that's probably actually more important than that  is the notion of permanently eliminating the possibility of a nuclear attack  eliminating the threat altogether. And I would like to make a case to you that over the years since we first developed atomic weaponry  until this very moment  we've actually lived in a dangerous nuclear world that's characterized by two phases  which I'm going to go through with you right now. First of all  we started off the nuclear age in     . The United States had developed a couple of atomic weapons through the Manhattan Project  and the idea was very straightforward  we would use the power of the atom to end the atrocities and the horror of this unending World War II that we'd been involved in in Europe and in the Pacific. And in       we were the only nuclear power. We had a few nuclear weapons  two of which we dropped on Japan  in Hiroshima  a few days later in Nagasaki  in August       killing about         people between those two. And for a few years  we were the only nuclear power on Earth. But by       the Soviet Union had decided it was unacceptable to have us as the only nuclear power  and they began to match what the United States had developed. And from      to      was an extraordinary time of a buildup of a nuclear arsenal that no one could possibly have imagined back in the     s. So by         each of those red bombs up here is equivalent of a thousands warheads    the world had        nuclear warheads  and seven members of something that came to be known as the  nuclear club.  And it was an extraordinary time  and I am going to go through some of the mentality that we    that Americans and the rest of the world were experiencing. But I want to just point out to you that    percent of the nuclear weapons at any particular time since         going forward  of course    were part of the arsenals of the United States and the Soviet Union. After       and before the break up of the Soviet Union  we began to disarm from a nuclear point of view. We began to counter proliferate  and we dropped the number of nuclear warheads in the world to about a total of       . It's a very difficult number to deal with  because what we've done is we've quote unquote  decommissioned  some of the warheads. They're still probably usable. They could be  re commissioned   but the way they count things  which is very complicated  we think we have about a third of the nuclear weapons we had before. But we also  in that period of time  added two more members to the nuclear club  Pakistan and North Korea. So we stand today with a still fully armed nuclear arsenal among many countries around the world  but a very different set of circumstances. So I'm going to talk about a nuclear threat story in two chapters. Chapter one is      to       when the Soviet Union broke up  and what we were dealing with  at that point and through those years  was a superpowers' nuclear arms race. It was characterized by a nation versus nation  very fragile standoff. And basically  we lived for all those years  and some might argue that we still do  in a situation of being on the brink  literally  of an apocalyptic  planetary calamity. It's incredible that we actually lived through all that. We were totally dependent during those years on this amazing acronym  which is MAD. It stands for mutually assured destruction. So it meant if you attacked us  we would attack you virtually simultaneously  and the end result would be a destruction of your country and mine. So the threat of my own destruction kept me from launching a nuclear attack on you. That's the way we lived. And the danger of that  of course  is that a misreading of a radar screen could actually cause a counter launch  even though the first country had not actually launched anything. During this chapter one  there was a high level of public awareness about the potential of nuclear catastrophe  and an indelible image was implanted in our collective minds that  in fact  a nuclear holocaust would be absolutely globally destructive and could  in some ways  mean the end of civilization as we know it. So this was chapter one. Now the odd thing is that even though we knew that there would be that kind of civilization obliteration  we engaged in America in a series    and in fact  in the Soviet Union    in a series of response planning. It was absolutely incredible. So premise one is we'd be destroying the world  and then premise two is  why don't we get prepared for it  So what we offered ourselves was a collection of things. I'm just going to go skim through a few things  just to jog your memories. If you're born after       this is just    consider this entertainment  otherwise it's memory lane. This was Bert the Turtle.  Video  This was basically an attempt to teach our schoolchildren that if we did get engaged in a nuclear confrontation and atomic war  then we wanted our school children to kind of basically duck and cover. That was the principle. You    there would be a nuclear conflagration about to hit us  and if you get under your desk  things would be OK. I didn't do all that well in psychiatry in medical school  but I was interested  and I think this was seriously delusional. Secondly  we told people to go down in their basements and build a fallout shelter. Maybe it would be a study when we weren't having an atomic war  or you could use it as a TV room  or  as many teenagers found out  a very  very safe place for a little privacy with your girlfriend. And actually    so there are multiple uses of the bomb shelters. Or you could buy a prefabricated bomb shelter that you could simply bury in the ground. Now  the bomb shelters at that point    let's say you bought a prefab one    it would be a few hundred dollars  maybe up to      if you got a fancy one. Yet  what percentage of Americans do you think ever had a bomb shelter in their house  What percentage lived in a house with a bomb shelter  Less than two percent. About  .  percent of the population  as far as anyone knows  did anything  either making a space in their basement or actually building a bomb shelter. Many buildings  public buildings  around the country    this is New York City    had these little civil defense signs  and the idea was that you would run into one of these shelters and be safe from the nuclear weaponry. And one of the greatest governmental delusions of all time was something that happened in the early days of the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  as we now know  and are well aware of their behaviors from Katrina. Here is their first big public announcement. They would propose    actually there were about six volumes written on this    a crisis relocation plan that was dependent upon the United States having three to four days warning that the Soviets were going to attack us. So the goal was to evacuate the target cities. We would move people out of the target cities into the countryside. And I'm telling you  I actually testified at the Senate about the absolute ludicrous idea that we would actually evacuate  and actually have three or four days' warning. It was just completely off the wall. Turns out that they had another idea behind it  even though this was    they were telling the public it was to save us. The idea was that we would force the Soviets to re target their nuclear weapons    very expensive    and potentially double their arsenal  to not only take out the original site  but take out sites where people were going. This was what apparently  as it turns out  was behind all this. It was just really  really frightening. The main point here is we were dealing with a complete disconnect from reality. The civil defense programs were disconnected from the reality of what we'd see in all out nuclear war. So organizations like Physicians for Social Responsibility  around       started saying this a lot publicly. They would do a bombing run. They'd go to your city  and they'd say   Here's a map of your city. Here's what's going to happen if we get a nuclear hit.  So no possibility of medical response to  or meaningful preparedness for all out nuclear war. So we had to prevent nuclear war if we expected to survive. This disconnect was never actually resolved. And what happened was    when we get in to chapter two of the nuclear threat era  which started back in     . Chapter two starts in     . When the Soviet Union broke up  we effectively lost that adversary as a potential attacker of the United States  for the most part. It's not completely gone. I'm going to come back to that. But from      through the present time  emphasized by the attacks of       the idea of an all out nuclear war has diminished and the idea of a single event  act of nuclear terrorism is what we have instead. Although the scenario has changed very considerably  the fact is that we haven't changed our mental image of what a nuclear war means. So I'm going to tell you what the implications of that are in just a second. So  what is a nuclear terror threat  And there's four key ingredients to describing that. First thing is that the global nuclear weapons  in the stockpiles that I showed you in those original maps  happen to be not uniformly secure. And it's particularly not secure in the former Soviet Union  now in Russia. There are many  many sites where warheads are stored and  in fact  lots of sites where fissionable materials  like highly enriched uranium and plutonium  are absolutely not safe. They're available to be bought  stolen  whatever. They're acquirable  let me put it that way. From      through       the International Atomic Energy Agency documented     cases of nuclear theft     of which involved highly enriched uranium or plutonium  the key ingredients to make a nuclear weapon. The global stockpile of highly enriched uranium is about        at the low end  to about       metric tons. More than     megatons of this is stored in particularly insecure Russian facilities. How much of that do you think it would take to actually build a    kiloton bomb  Well  you need about    pounds of it. So  what I'd like to show you is what it would take to hold    pounds of highly enriched uranium. This is not a product placement. It's just    in fact  if I was Coca Cola  I'd be pretty distressed about this       but basically  this is it. This is what you would need to steal or buy out of that     metric ton stockpile that's relatively insecure to create the type of bomb that was used in Hiroshima. Now you might want to look at plutonium as another fissionable material that you might use in a bomb. That    you'd need    to    pounds of plutonium. Now  plutonium     to    pounds  this. This is enough plutonium to create a Nagasaki size atomic weapon. Now this situation  already I    you know  I don't really like thinking about this  although somehow I got myself a job where I have to think about it. So the point is that we're very  very insecure in terms of developing this material. The second thing is  what about the know how  And there's a lot of controversy about whether terror organizations have the know how to actually make a nuclear weapon. Well  there's a lot of know how out there. There's an unbelievable amount of know how out there. There's detailed information on how to assemble a nuclear weapon from parts. There's books about how to build a nuclear bomb. There are plans for how to create a terror farm where you could actually manufacture and develop all the components and assemble it. All of this information is relatively available. If you have an undergraduate degree in physics  I would suggest    although I don't  so maybe it's not even true    but something close to that would allow you  with the information that's currently available  to actually build a nuclear weapon. The third element of the nuclear terror threat is that  who would actually do such a thing  Well  what we're seeing now is a level of terrorism that involves individuals who are highly organized. They are very dedicated and committed. They are stateless. Somebody once said  Al Qaeda does not have a return address  so if they attack us with a nuclear weapon  what's the response  and to whom is the response  And they're retaliation proof. Since there is no real retribution possible that would make any difference  since there are people willing to actually give up their lives in order to do a lot of damage to us  it becomes apparent that the whole notion of this mutually assured destruction would not work. Here is Sulaiman Abu Ghaith  and Sulaiman was a key lieutenant of Osama Bin Laden. He wrote many  many times statements to this effect   we have the right to kill four million Americans  two million of whom should be children.  And we don't have to go overseas to find people willing to do harm  for whatever their reasons. McVeigh and Nichols  and the Oklahoma City attack in the     s was a good example of homegrown terrorists. What if they had gotten their hands on a nuclear weapon  The fourth element is that the high value U.S. targets are accessible  soft and plentiful. This would be a talk for another day  but the level of the preparedness that the United States has achieved since      of '   is unbelievably inadequate. What you saw after Katrina is a very good indicator of how little prepared the United States is for any kind of major attack. Seven million ship cargo containers come into the United States every year. Five to seven percent only are inspected    five to seven percent. This is Alexander Lebed  who was a general that worked with Yeltsin  who talked about  and presented to Congress  this idea that the Russians had developed    these suitcase bombs. They were very low yield     .  to one kiloton  Hiroshima was around    kilotons    but enough to do an unbelievable amount of damage. And Lebed came to the United States and told us that many  many    more than    of the suitcase bombs were actually not accountable. And they look like this. They're basically very simple arrangements. You put the elements into a suitcase. It becomes very portable. The suitcase can be conveniently dropped in your trunk of your car. You take it wherever you want to take it  and you can detonate it. You don't want to build a suitcase bomb  and you happen to get one of those insecure nuclear warheads that exist. This is the size of the  Little Boy  bomb that was dropped at Hiroshima. It was  .  feet long  weighed       pounds. You go down to your local rent a truck and for    bucks or so  you rent a truck that's got the right capacity  and you take your bomb  you put it in the truck and you're ready to go. It could happen. But what it would mean and who would survive  You can't get an exact number for that kind of probability  but what I'm trying to say is that we have all the elements of that happening. Anybody who dismisses the thought of a nuclear weapon being used by a terrorist is kidding themselves. I think there's a lot of people in the intelligence community    a lot of people who deal with this work in general think it's almost inevitable  unless we do certain things to really try to defuse the risk  like better interdiction  better prevention  better fixing  you know  better screening of cargo containers that are coming into the country and so forth. There's a lot that can be done to make us a lot safer. At this particular moment  we actually could end up seeing a nuclear detonation in one of our cities. I don't think we would see an all out nuclear war any time soon  although even that is not completely off the table. There's still enough nuclear weapons in the arsenals of the superpowers to destroy the Earth many  many times over. There are flash points in India and Pakistan  in the Middle East  in North Korea  other places where the use of nuclear weapons  while initially locally  could very rapidly go into a situation where we'd be facing all out nuclear war. It's very unsettling. Here we go. OK. I'm back in my truck  and we drove over the Brooklyn Bridge. We're coming down  and we bring that truck that you just saw somewhere in here  in the Financial District. This is a    kiloton bomb  slightly smaller than was used in Hiroshima. And I want to just conclude this by just giving you some information. I think     news you could use  kind of concept here. So  first of all  this would be horrific beyond anything we can possibly imagine. This is the ultimate. And if you're in the half mile radius of where this bomb went off  you have a    percent chance of not making it. If you're right where the bomb went off  you will be vaporized. And that's    I'm just telling you  this is not good. You assume that. Two mile radius  you have a    percent chance of being killed  and up to about eight miles away    now I'm talking about killed instantly    somewhere between a    and    percent chance of getting killed. The thing about this is that the experience of the nuclear detonation is    first of all  tens of millions of degrees Fahrenheit at the core here  where it goes off  and an extraordinary amount of energy in the form of heat  acute radiation and blast effects. An enormous hurricane like wind  and destruction of buildings almost totally  within this yellow circle here. And what I'm going to focus on  as I come to conclusion here  is that  what happens to you if you're in here  Well  if we're talking about the old days of an all out nuclear attack  you  up here  are as dead as the people here. So it was a moot point. My point now  though  is that there is a lot that we could do for you who are in here  if you've survived the initial blast. You have  when the blast goes off    and by the way  if it ever comes up  don't look at it. If you look at it  you're going to be blind  either temporarily or permanently. So if there's any way that you can avoid  like  avert your eyes  that would be a good thing. If you find yourself alive  but you're in the vicinity of a nuclear weapon  you have    that's gone off    you have    to    minutes  depending on the size and exactly where it went off  to get out of the way before a lethal amount of radiation comes straight down from the mushroom cloud that goes up. In that    to    minutes  all you have to do    and I mean this seriously    is go about a mile away from the blast. And what happens is    this is    I'm going to show you now some fallout plumes. Within    minutes  it comes straight down. Within    hours  lethal radiation is going out with prevailing winds  and it's mostly in this particular direction    it's going northeast. And if you're in this vicinity  you've got to get away. So you're feeling the wind    and there's tremendous wind now that you're going to be feeling    and you want to go perpendicular to the wind  not upwind or downwind . if you are in fact able to see where the blast was in front of you. You've got to get out of there. If you don't get out of there  you're going to be exposed to lethal radiation in very short order. If you can't get out of there  we want you to go into a shelter and stay there. Now  in a shelter in an urban area means you have to be either in a basement as deep as possible  or you have to be on a floor    on a high floor    if it's a ground burst explosion  which it would be  higher than the ninth floor. So you have to be tenth floor or higher  or in the basement. But basically  you've got to get out of town as quickly as possible. And if you do that  you actually can survive a nuclear blast. Over the next few days to a week  there will be a radiation cloud  again  going with the wind  and settling down for another    or    miles out    in this case  over Long Island. And if you're in the direct fallout zone here  you really have to either be sheltered or you have to get out of there  and that's clear. But if you are sheltered  you can actually survive. The difference between knowing information of what you're going to do personally  and not knowing information  can save your life  and it could mean the difference between         to         fatalities from something like this and half a million to         fatalities. So  response planning in the twenty first century is both possible and is essential. But in       there isn't one single American city that has done effective plans to deal with a nuclear detonation disaster. Part of the problem is that the emergency planners themselves  personally  are overwhelmed psychologically by the thought of nuclear catastrophe. They are paralyzed. You say  nuclear  to them  and they're thinking   Oh my God  we're all gone. What's the point  It's futile.  And we're trying to tell them   It's not futile. We can change the survival rates by doing some commonsensical things.  So the goal here is to minimize fatalities. And I just want to leave you with the personal points that I think you might be interested in. The key to surviving a nuclear blast is getting out  and not going into harm's way. That's basically all we're going to be talking about here. And the farther you are away in distance  the longer it is in time from the initial blast  and the more separation between you and the outside atmosphere  the better. So separation    hopefully with dirt or concrete  or being in a basement    distance and time is what will save you. So here's what you do. First of all  as I said  don't stare at the light flash  if you can. I don't know you could possibly resist doing that. But let's assume  theoretically  you want to do that. You want to keep your mouth open  so your eardrums don't burst from the pressures. If you're very close to what happened  you actually do have to duck and cover  like Bert told you  Bert the Turtle. And you want to get under something so that you're not injured or killed by objects  if that's at all possible. You want to get away from the initial fallout mushroom cloud  I said  in just a few minutes. And shelter and place. You want to move  only  crosswind for  .  miles. You know  if you're out there and you see buildings horribly destroyed and down in that direction  less destroyed here  then you know that it was over there  the blast  and you're going this way  as long as you're going crosswise to the wind. Once you're out and evacuating  you want to keep as much of your skin  your mouth and nose covered  as long as that covering doesn't impede you moving and getting out of there. And finally  you want to get decontaminated as soon as possible. And if you're wearing clothing  you've taken off your clothing  you're going to get showered down some place and remove the radiation that would be    the radioactive material that might be on you. And then you want to stay in shelter for    to    hours minimum  but you're going to wait hopefully    you'll have your little wind up  battery less radio  and you'll be waiting for people to tell you when it's safe to go outside. That's what you need to do. In conclusion  nuclear war is less likely than before  but by no means out of the question  and it's not survivable. Nuclear terrorism is possible    it may be probable    but is survivable. And this is Jack Geiger  who's one of the heroes of the U.S. public health community. And Jack said the only way to deal with nuclear anything  whether it's war or terrorism  is abolition of nuclear weapons. And you want something to work on once you've fixed global warming  I urge you to think about the fact that we have to do something about this unacceptable  inhumane reality of nuclear weapons in our world. Now  this is my favorite civil defense slide  and I       I don't want to be indelicate  but this    he's no longer in office. We don't really care  OK. This was sent to me by somebody who is an aficionado of civil defense procedures  but the fact of the matter is that America's gone through a very hard time. We've not been focused  we've not done what we had to do  and now we're facing the potential of bad  hell on Earth. Thank you. We really need to put the best we have to offer within reach of our children. If we don't do that  we're going to get the generation we deserve. They're going to learn from whatever it is they have around them. And we  as now the elite  parents  librarians  professionals  whatever it is  a bunch of our activities are  in fact  in trying to get the best we have to offer within reach of those around us  or as broadly as we can. I'm going to start and end this talk with a couple things that are carved in stone. One is what's on the Boston Public Library. Carved above their door is   Free to All.  It's kind of an inspiring statement  and I'll go back at the end of this. I'm a librarian  and what I'm trying to do is bring all of the works of knowledge to as many people as want to read it. And the idea of using technology is perfect for us. I think we have the opportunity to one up the Greeks. It's not easy to one up the Greeks. But with the industriousness of the Egyptians  they were able to build the Library of Alexandria    the idea of a copy of every book of all the peoples of the world. The problem was you actually had to go to Alexandria to go to it. On the other hand  if you did  then great things happened. I think we can one up the Greeks and achieve something. And I'm going to try to argue only one point today  that universal access to all knowledge is within our grasp. So if I'm successful  then you'll actually come away thinking  yeah  we could actually achieve the great vision of everything ever published  everything that was ever meant for distribution  available to anybody in the world that's ever wanted to have access to it. Yes  there's issues about how money should be distributed  and that's still being refigured out. But I'd say there's plenty of money  and there's plenty of demand  so we can actually achieve that. But I'm going to go over the technological  social and sort of where are we as a whole  trying to get to that particular vision. And the way I'm going to try to do this is do it like the Amazon.com website  the books  music  video and just go step    media type by media type  just go and say  all right  how're we doing on this  So if we start with books  you know  sort of where are we  Well  first you have to  as an engineer  scope the problem. How big is it  If you wanted to put all of the published works online so that anybody could have it available  well  how big a problem is it  Well  we don't really know  but the largest print library in the world is the Library of Congress. It's    million volumes     million volumes. It is  by far and away  the largest print library in the world. And a book  if you had a book  is about a megabyte  so    you know  if you had it in Microsoft Word. So a megabyte     million megabytes is    terabytes    it goes mega   giga   tera .    terabytes.    terabytes fits in a computer system that's about this big  on spinning Linux drives  and it costs about        dollars. So for the cost of a house    or around here  a garage    you can put  you can have spinning all of the words in the Library of Congress. That's pretty neat. Then the question is  what do you get  You know  is it worth trying to get there  Do you actually want it online  Some of the first things that people do is they make book readers that allow you to search inside the books  and that's kind of fun. And you can download these things  and look around them in new and different ways. And you can get at them remotely  if you happen to have a laptop. There's starting to be some of these sort of page turn y interfaces that look a whole lot like books in certain ways  and you can search them  make little tabs  and it's kind of cute    still very book like    on your laptop. But I don't know  reading things on a laptop    whenever I pull up my laptop  it always feels like work. I think that's one of the reasons why the Kindle is so great. I don't have to feel like I'm at work to read a Kindle. It's starting to be a little bit more specified. But I have to say that there's older technologies that I tend to like. I like the physical book. And I think we can go and use our technology to go and digitize things  put them on the Net  and then download  print them and bind them  and end up with books again. And we sort of said  well  how hard is this  And it turns out to not be very hard. We actually went off to make a bookmobile. And a bookmobile    the size of a van with a satellite dish  a printer  binder and cutter  and kids make their own books. It costs about three dollars to download  print and bind a normal  old book. And they actually come out kind of nice looking. You can actually get really good looking books for on the order of one penny per page  sort of the parts cost for doing this. So the idea of    this technology actually may end up putting books back in people's hands again. There are some other bookmobiles running around. This is Eric Eldred making books at Walden Pond    Thoreau's works. This is just before he got kicked out by the Parks Services  for competing with the bookstore there. In India  they've got another couple bookmobiles running around. And this is the opening day at the Library of Alexandria  the new Library of Alexandria  in Egypt. It was quite popularly attended. And kids starting to make their own books  and a happy kid with the first book that he's ever owned. So the idea of being able to use this technology to end up with paper where I can handle sort of sounds a little retro  but I think it still has its place. And being from the Silicon Valley  sort of utopian sort of world  we thought  if we can make this technology work in rural Uganda  we might have something. So we actually got some funding from the World Bank to try it out. And we found in about    days we could go and take a couple folks from Silicon Valley  fly them to Uganda  buy a car  set up the first Internet connection at the National Library of Uganda  figure out what they wanted  and get a program going making books in rural Uganda. And it actually    so technologically  it works. What we found out of this is we didn't have the right books. So the books were in the library. We could get it to people  if they're digitized  but we didn't know how to quite get them digitized. Everybody thought the answer is  send things to India and China. And so we've tried that  and I'll go over that in a moment. There are some newer technologies for delivering that have happened that are actually quite exciting as well. One is a print on demand machine that looks like a Rube Goldberg machine. We have one of these things now. It's completely cool. It's all conveyor belt  and it makes a book. And it's called the  Espresso Book Machine   and in about    minutes  you can press a button and make a book. Something else I'm quite excited about in this particular domain  beyond these sort of kiosk y things where you can get books on demand  is some of these new little screens that are coming out. And one of my favorites in this is the      laptop. And I don't mean to steal any thunder here  but we've gone and used one of these things to be an e book reader. So here's one of the beta units and you can    it actually turns out to be a really good looking e book reader. And we have a quick hack that we did to try to put one of our books on it  and it turns out that     dots per inch means that you can put scanned books on them that look really good. At     dots per inch  it's kind of the equivalent of a     dot print laser printer. We're in good enough shape. You actually can go and read scanned books quite easily. So the idea of electronic books is starting to come about. But how do you go about doing all this scanning  So we thought  okay  well  let's try out this send books to India thing. And there was a project with  funded by the National Science Foundation    sent a bunch of scanners  and the American libraries were supposed to send books. Well  they didn't. They didn't want to send their books. So we bought         books and sent them to India. And then we learned why you don't want to send books to India. The lesson we learned out of this is  scan your own books. If you really care about books  you're going to scan them better  especially if they're valuable books. If they're new books and you can just  you know  butcher them  because you could just buy another one  that's not such a big deal in terms of doing high quality scanning. But do things that you love. But the Indians have been scanning a lot of their own books    about         now    doing very well. The Chinese did over a million  and the Egyptians are about       . But we sent    thought  OK  if we're going to need to do this  let's do it in library. How do we go and do this  and how do we get it down so that it's a cost point that we could afford  And we sort of picked the price point of    cents a page. If it's basically the cost of xeroxing to basically digitize  OCR  package it up  make it so that you could download  print and bind it    the whole shebang    we would have achieved something. So we started out trying to figure out. How do we get to    cents  And we tried these robot things  and they worked pretty well    sort of these auto page turning things. If we can have Mars Rovers  you'd think you could turn pages. But it actually turns out to be pretty hard to turn pages  and the volume isn't there. So anyway    so we ended up making our own book scanner  and with two digital  high grade  professional digital cameras  controlled museum lighting  so even if it's a black and white book  you can go and get the proper intonation. So you basically do a beautiful  respectful job. This is not a fax  this is    the idea is to do a beautiful job as you're going through these libraries. And we've been able to achieve    cents a page if we run things in volume. This is what it looks like at the University of Toronto. And actually  it turns out to  you know  pay a living wage. People seem to love it. Yes  it's a little boring  but some people kind of get into the Zen of it. And especially if it's kind of interesting books that you care about  in languages that you can read. We actually have been able to do a pretty good job of this  at getting    cents a page. So    cents a page      pages in your average book     dollars a book. The Library of Congress  if you did the whole darn thing       million books    is about     million dollars  right  But a million books  I think  actually would be a pretty good start  and that would cost    million dollars. That's not that big a bill. And what we've been able to do is get into libraries. We've now got eight of these scanning centers in three countries  and libraries are up for having their books scanned. The Getty here is moving their books to the UCLA  which is where we have one these scanning centers  and scanning their out of copyright books  which is fabulous. So we're starting to get the institutional responsibility. The thing we're missing is the    cents. If we can get the    cents  all the rest of it flows. We've scanned about         books. Now we're scanning about        books a month  and it's starting to gear up another factor of two from there. So all in all  that's going very well. And we're starting to move out of the just out of copyright into the out of print world. So I think of    we're kind of going from the out of copyright  library stuff  and Amazon.com is coming from the in print world. And I think we'll meet in the middle some place  and have the classic thing that you have  which is a publishing system and a library system working in parallel. And so we're starting up a program to do out of print works  but loaning them. Exactly what loaning means  I'm not quite sure. But anyway  loaning out of print works from the Boston Public Library  the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute and a few other libraries that are starting to participate in this program  to try out this model of where does a library stop and where does the bookstore take over. So all in all  it's possible to do this in large scale. We're also going back over microfilm and getting that online. So  we can do    cents a page  we're going        books a month and we've got about         books online  counting all the other projects that are starting to add in. So what I wanted to argue is  books are within our grasp. The idea of taking on the whole ball of wax is not that big a deal. Yes  it costs tens of millions  low hundreds of millions  but one time shot and we've got basically the history of printed literature online. And then  there's business model issues about how to try to effectively market it and get it to people. But it is within our grasp  technologically and law wise  at least for the out of print and out of copyright  we suggest  to be able to get the whole darn thing online. Now let's go for audio  and I'm going to go through these. So how much is there  Well  as best we can tell  there are about two to three million disks having been published    so   s  long playing records and CDs    or at least that's the largest archives of published materials we've been able to sort of point at. It costs about    dollars a piece to go and take a disk and put it online  if you're doing things in volume. But we've found that the rights issues are really quite thorny. This is a fairly heavily litigated area  so we've found that there are niches in the music world that aren't served terribly well by the classic commercial publishing system. And we've been starting to make these available by going and offering shelf space on the Net. In the United States  it doesn't cost you to give something away. Right  If you give something to a charity or to the public  you get a pat on the back and a tax donation    except on the Net  where you can go broke. If you put up a video of your garage band  and it starts getting heavily accessed  you can lose your guitars or your house. This doesn't make any sense. So we've offered unlimited storage  unlimited bandwidth  forever  for free  to anybody that has something to share that belongs in a library. And we've been getting a lot of takers. One is the rock 'n' rollers. The rock 'n' rollers had a tradition of sharing  as long as nobody made any money. You could    concert recordings  it's not the commercial recordings  but concert recordings  started by the Grateful Dead. And we get about two or three bands a day signing up. They give permission  and we get about    or    concerts a day. We have about        concerts  everything the Grateful Dead ever did  up on the Net  so that people can see it and listen to this material. So audio is possible to put up  but the rights issues are really pretty thorny. We've got a lot of collections now    a couple hundred thousand items    and it's growing over time. Moving images  if you think of theatrical releases  there are not that many of them. As best we can tell  there are about         to         movies ever that are really meant for a large scale theatrical distribution. It's just not that many. But half of those were Indian. But anyway  it's doable  but we've only found about a thousand of these things that    to be out of copyright. So we've digitized those and made those available. But we've found that there's lots of other types of movies that haven't really seen the light of day    archival films. We've found  also  a lot of political films  a lot of amateur films  all sorts of things that are basically needing a home  a permanent home. So we've been starting to make these available and it's grown to be very popular. We're not quite a YouTube. We tended towards longer term things and also things that people can reuse and make into new movies  which has just been great fun. Television comes quite a bit larger. We started recording    channels of television    hours a day. It's sort of the biggest TiVo box you've ever seen. It's about a petabyte  so far  of worldwide television    Russian  Chinese  Japanese  Iraqi  Al Jazeera  BBC  CNN  ABC  CBS  NBC       hours a day. We only put one week up  which is mostly for cost reasons  which is the       sort of from          . For one week  what did the world see  CNN was saying that Palestinians were dancing in the streets. Were they  Let's look at the Palestinian television and find out. How can we have critical thinking without being able to quote and being able to compare what happened in the past  And television is dreadfully unrecorded and unquotable  except by Jon Stewart  who does a fabulous job. So anyway  television is  I would suggest  within our grasp. So    dollars per video hour  and also about     dollars to     dollars per celluloid hour  we're able to go and get materials online very inexpensively and have them up on the Net. And we've got  now  a lot of these materials. So we've got about         pieces up there. So books  music  video  software. There's only        titles of it. Mostly the issues there are legal issues and breaking copy protections. But we've worked through some of those  but we've still got real problems in Washington. Well  we're best known as the World Wide Web. We've been archiving the World Wide Web since     . We take a snapshot of every website and all of the pages on it  every two months. And actually  it's really been pioneered by Alexa Internet  which donates this collection to the Internet Archive. And it's been growing along for the last    years  and it's a fantastic resource. And we've made a Wayback Machine that you can then go and see old websites kind of the way they were. If you go and search on something    this is Google.com  the different versions of it that we have  this is what it looks like when it was an alpha release  and this is what it looked like at Stanford. So anyway  you've got basically an idea of where things came from. Mostly  people want to see their old stuff out of this. If there's one thing that we want to learn from the Library of Alexandria version one  which is probably best known for burning  is  don't just have one copy. So we've started to    we've made another copy of all of this and we actually put it back in the Library of Alexandria. So this is a picture of the Internet Archive at the Library of Alexandria. And we now have also another copy building up in Amsterdam. So  we should put it in the San Andreas Fault Line in San Francisco  flood zone in Amsterdam and in the Middle East. Right  so anyway ... so we're hedging our bets here. If we go and put it in a couple more places  I think we'll be in good shape. There's a political and social question out of this. Is all of this  as we go digital  is it going to be public or private  There's some large companies that have seen this vision  that are doing large scale digitization  but they're locking up the public domain. The question is  is that the world that we really want to live in  What's the role of the public versus the private as things go forward  How do we go and have a world where we both have libraries and publishing in the future  just as we basically benefited as we were growing up  So universal access to all knowledge    I think it can be one of the greatest achievements of humankind  like the man on the moon  or the Gutenberg Bible  or the Library of Alexandria. It could be something that we're remembered for  for millennia  for having achieved. And as I said before  I'll end with something that's carved above the door of the Carnegie Library. Carnegie    one of the great capitalists of this country    carved above his legacy   Free to the People.  Thank you very much. David Gallo  This is Bill Lange. I'm Dave Gallo. And we're going to tell you some stories from the sea here in video. We've got some of the most incredible video of Titanic that's ever been seen  and we're not going to show you any of it. The truth of the matter is that the Titanic    even though it's breaking all sorts of box office records    it's not the most exciting story from the sea. And the problem  I think  is that we take the ocean for granted. When you think about it  the oceans are    percent of the planet. Most of the planet is ocean water. The average depth is about two miles. Part of the problem  I think  is we stand at the beach  or we see images like this of the ocean  and you look out at this great big blue expanse  and it's shimmering and it's moving and there's waves and there's surf and there's tides  but you have no idea for what lies in there. And in the oceans  there are the longest mountain ranges on the planet. Most of the animals are in the oceans. Most of the earthquakes and volcanoes are in the sea  at the bottom of the sea. The biodiversity and the biodensity in the ocean is higher  in places  than it is in the rainforests. It's mostly unexplored  and yet there are beautiful sights like this that captivate us and make us become familiar with it. But when you're standing at the beach  I want you to think that you're standing at the edge of a very unfamiliar world. We have to have a very special technology to get into that unfamiliar world. We use the submarine Alvin and we use cameras  and the cameras are something that Bill Lange has developed with the help of Sony. Marcel Proust said   The true voyage of discovery is not so much in seeking new landscapes as in having new eyes.  People that have partnered with us have given us new eyes  not only on what exists    the new landscapes at the bottom of the sea    but also how we think about life on the planet itself. Here's a jelly. It's one of my favorites  because it's got all sorts of working parts. This turns out to be the longest creature in the oceans. It gets up to about     feet long. But see all those different working things  I love that kind of stuff. It's got these fishing lures on the bottom. They're going up and down. It's got tentacles dangling  swirling around like that. It's a colonial animal. These are all individual animals banding together to make this one creature. And it's got these jet thrusters up in front that it'll use in a moment  and a little light. If you take all the big fish and schooling fish and all that  put them on one side of the scale  put all the jelly type of animals on the other side  those guys win hands down. Most of the biomass in the ocean is made out of creatures like this. Here's the X wing death jelly. The bioluminescence    they use the lights for attracting mates and attracting prey and communicating. We couldn't begin to show you our archival stuff from the jellies. They come in all different sizes and shapes. Bill Lange  We tend to forget about the fact that the ocean is miles deep on average  and that we're real familiar with the animals that are in the first     or     feet  but we're not familiar with what exists from there all the way down to the bottom. And these are the types of animals that live in that three dimensional space  that micro gravity environment that we really haven't explored. You hear about giant squid and things like that  but some of these animals get up to be approximately          feet long. They're very little understood. DG  This is one of them  another one of our favorites  because it's a little octopod. You can actually see through his head. And here he is  flapping with his ears and very gracefully going up. We see those at all depths and even at the greatest depths. They go from a couple of inches to a couple of feet. They come right up to the submarine    they'll put their eyes right up to the window and peek inside the sub. This is really a world within a world  and we're going to show you two. In this case  we're passing down through the mid ocean and we see creatures like this. This is kind of like an undersea rooster. This guy  that looks incredibly formal  in a way. And then one of my favorites. What a face  This is basically scientific data that you're looking at. It's footage that we've collected for scientific purposes. And that's one of the things that Bill's been doing  is providing scientists with this first view of animals like this  in the world where they belong. They don't catch them in a net. They're actually looking at them down in that world. We're going to take a joystick  sit in front of our computer  on the Earth  and press the joystick forward  and fly around the planet. We're going to look at the mid ocean ridge  a        mile long mountain range. The average depth at the top of it is about a mile and a half. And we're over the Atlantic    that's the ridge right there    but we're going to go across the Caribbean  Central America  and end up against the Pacific  nine degrees north. We make maps of these mountain ranges with sound  with sonar  and this is one of those mountain ranges. We're coming around a cliff here on the right. The height of these mountains on either side of this valley is greater than the Alps in most cases. And there's tens of thousands of those mountains out there that haven't been mapped yet. This is a volcanic ridge. We're getting down further and further in scale. And eventually  we can come up with something like this. This is an icon of our robot  Jason  it's called. And you can sit in a room like this  with a joystick and a headset  and drive a robot like that around the bottom of the ocean in real time. One of the things we're trying to do at Woods Hole with our partners is to bring this virtual world    this world  this unexplored region    back to the laboratory. Because we see it in bits and pieces right now. We see it either as sound  or we see it as video  or we see it as photographs  or we see it as chemical sensors  but we never have yet put it all together into one interesting picture. Here's where Bill's cameras really do shine. This is what's called a hydrothermal vent. And what you're seeing here is a cloud of densely packed  hydrogen sulfide rich water coming out of a volcanic axis on the sea floor. Gets up to          degrees F  somewhere in that range. So that's all water under the sea    a mile and a half  two miles  three miles down. And we knew it was volcanic back in the '  s  '  s. And then we had some hint that these things existed all along the axis of it  because if you've got volcanism  water's going to get down from the sea into cracks in the sea floor  come in contact with magma  and come shooting out hot. We weren't really aware that it would be so rich with sulfides  hydrogen sulfides. We didn't have any idea about these things  which we call chimneys. This is one of these hydrothermal vents. Six hundred degree F water coming out of the Earth. On either side of us are mountain ranges that are higher than the Alps  so the setting here is very dramatic. BL  The white material is a type of bacteria that thrives at     degrees C. DG  I think that's one of the greatest stories right now that we're seeing from the bottom of the sea  is that the first thing we see coming out of the sea floor after a volcanic eruption is bacteria. And we started to wonder for a long time  how did it all get down there  What we find out now is that it's probably coming from inside the Earth. Not only is it coming out of the Earth    so  biogenesis made from volcanic activity    but that bacteria supports these colonies of life. The pressure here is       pounds per square inch. A mile and a half from the surface to two miles to three miles    no sun has ever gotten down here. All the energy to support these life forms is coming from inside the Earth    so  chemosynthesis. And you can see how dense the population is. These are called tube worms. BL  These worms have no digestive system. They have no mouth. But they have two types of gill structures. One for extracting oxygen out of the deep sea water  another one which houses this chemosynthetic bacteria  which takes the hydrothermal fluid    that hot water that you saw coming out of the bottom    and converts that into simple sugars that the tube worm can digest. DG  You can see  here's a crab that lives down there. He's managed to grab a tip of these worms. Now  they normally retract as soon as a crab touches them. Oh  Good going. So  as soon as a crab touches them  they retract down into their shells  just like your fingernails. There's a whole story being played out here that we're just now beginning to have some idea of because of this new camera technology. BL  These worms live in a real temperature extreme. Their foot is at about     degrees C and their head is out at three degrees C  so it's like having your hand in boiling water and your foot in freezing water. That's how they like to live. DG  This is a female of this kind of worm. And here's a male. You watch. It doesn't take long before two guys here    this one and one that will show up over here    start to fight. Everything you see is played out in the pitch black of the deep sea. There are never any lights there  except the lights that we bring. Here they go. On one of the last dive series  we counted     species in these areas        were new  new species. BL  One of the big problems is that for the biologists working at these sites  it's rather difficult to collect these animals. And they disintegrate on the way up  so the imagery is critical for the science. DG  Two octopods at about two miles depth. This pressure thing really amazes me    that these animals can exist there at a depth with pressure enough to crush the Titanic like an empty Pepsi can. What we saw up till now was from the Pacific. This is from the Atlantic. Even greater depth. You can see this shrimp is harassing this poor little guy here  and he'll bat it away with his claw. Whack  And the same thing's going on over here. What they're getting at is that    on the back of this crab    the foodstuff here is this very strange bacteria that lives on the backs of all these animals. And what these shrimp are trying to do is actually harvest the bacteria from the backs of these animals. And the crabs don't like it at all. These long filaments that you see on the back of the crab are actually created by the product of that bacteria. So  the bacteria grows hair on the crab. On the back  you see this again. The red dot is the laser light of the submarine Alvin to give us an idea about how far away we are from the vents. Those are all shrimp. You see the hot water over here  here and here  coming out. They're clinging to a rock face and actually scraping bacteria off that rock face. Here's a tiny  little vent that's come out of the side of that pillar. Those pillars get up to several stories. So here  you've got this valley with this incredible alien landscape of pillars and hot springs and volcanic eruptions and earthquakes  inhabited by these very strange animals that live only on chemical energy coming out of the ground. They don't need the sun at all. BL  You see this white V shaped mark on the back of the shrimp  It's actually a light sensing organ. It's how they find the hydrothermal vents. The vents are emitting a black body radiation    an IR signature    and so they're able to find these vents at considerable distances. DG  All this stuff is happening along that        mile long mountain range that we're calling the ribbon of life  because just even today  as we speak  there's life being generated there from volcanic activity. This is the first time we've ever tried this any place. We're going to try to show you high definition from the Pacific. We're moving up one of these pillars. This one's several stories tall. In it  you'll see that it's a habitat for a lot of different animals. There's a funny kind of hot plate here  with vent water coming out of it. So all of these are individual homes for worms. Now here's a closer view of that community. Here's crabs here  worms here. There are smaller animals crawling around. Here's pagoda structures. I think this is the neatest looking thing. I just can't get over this    that you've got these little chimneys sitting here smoking away. This stuff is toxic as hell  by the way. You could never get a permit to dump this in the ocean  and it's coming out all from it. It's unbelievable. It's basically sulfuric acid  and it's being just dumped out  at incredible rates. And animals are thriving    and we probably came from here. That's probably where we evolved from. BL  This bacteria that we've been talking about turns out to be the most simplest form of life found. There are a number of groups that are proposing that life evolved at these vent sites. Although the vent sites are short lived    an individual site may last only    years or so    as an ecosystem they've been stable for millions    well  billions    of years. DG  It works too well. You see there're some fish inside here as well. There's a fish sitting here. Here's a crab with his claw right at the end of that tube worm  waiting for that worm to stick his head out. BL  The biologists right now cannot explain why these animals are so active. The worms are growing inches per week  DG  I already said that this site  from a human perspective  is toxic as hell. Not only that  but on top    the lifeblood    that plumbing system turns off every year or so. Their plumbing system turns off  so the sites have to move. And then there's earthquakes  and then volcanic eruptions  on the order of one every five years  that completely wipes the area out. Despite that  these animals grow back in about a year's time. You're talking about biodensities and biodiversity  again  higher than the rainforest that just springs back to life. Is it sensitive  Yes. Is it fragile  No  it's not really very fragile. I'll end up with saying one thing. There's a story in the sea  in the waters of the sea  in the sediments and the rocks of the sea floor. It's an incredible story. What we see when we look back in time  in those sediments and rocks  is a record of Earth history. Everything on this planet    everything    works by cycles and rhythms. The continents move apart. They come back together. Oceans come and go. Mountains come and go. Glaciers come and go. El Nino comes and goes. It's not a disaster  it's rhythmic. What we're learning now  it's almost like a symphony. It's just like music    it really is just like music. And what we're learning now is that you can't listen to a five billion year long symphony  get to today and say   Stop  We want tomorrow's note to be the same as it was today.  It's absurd. It's just absurd. So  what we've got to learn now is to find out where this planet's going at all these different scales and work with it. Learn to manage it. The concept of preservation is futile. Conservation's tougher  but we can probably get there. Thank you very much. Thank you. When I knew I was going to come to speak to you  I thought   I gotta call my mother.  I have a little Cuban mother    she's about that big. Four feet. Nothing larger than the sum of her figurative parts. You still with me   Laughter  I called her up.  Hello  how're you doing  baby    Hey  ma  I got to talk to you.   You're talking to me already. What's the matter   I said   I've got to talk to a bunch of nice people.   You're always talking to nice people  except when you went to the White House.   Ma  don't start   And I told her I was coming to TED  and she said   What's the problem   And I said   Well  I'm not sure.  I said   I have to talk to them about stories. It's 'Technology  Entertainment and Design.'  And she said   Well  you design a story when you make it up  it's entertainment when you tell it  and you're going to use a microphone.  I said   You're a peach  ma. Pop there    What's the matter  The pearls of wisdom leaping from my lips like lemmings is no good for you   Then my pop got on there. My pop  he's one of the old souls  you know    old Cuban man from Camaguey. Camaguey is a province in Cuba. He's from Florida. He was born there in     . He grew up in a bohio of dirt floors  and the structure was the kind used by the Tainos  our old Arawak ancestors. My father is at once quick witted  wickedly funny  and then poignancy turns on a dime and leaves you breathless.  Papi  help.   I already heard your mother. I think she's right.   After what I just told you   My whole life  my father's been there. So we talked for a few minutes  and he said   Why don't you tell them what you believe   I love that  but we don't have the time. Good storytelling is crafting a story that someone wants to listen to. Great story is the art of letting go. So I'm going to tell you a little story. Remember  this tradition comes to us not from the mists of Avalon  back in time  but further still  before we were scratching out these stories on papyrus  or we were doing the pictographs on walls in moist  damp caves. Back then  we had an urge  a need  to tell the story. When Lexus wants to sell you a car  they're telling you a story. Have you been watching the commercials  Because every one of us has this desire  for once    just once    to tell our story and have it heard. There are stories you tell from stages. There's stories that you may tell in a small group of people with some good wine. And there's stories you tell late at night to a friend  maybe once in your life. And then there are stories that we whisper into a Stygian darkness. I'm not telling you that story. I'm telling you this one. It's called   You're Going to Miss Me.  It's about human connection. My Cuban mother  which I just briefly introduced you to in that short character sketch  came to the United States one thousand years ago. I was born in       I forget  and I came to this country with them in the aftermath of the Cuban revolution. We went from Havana  Cuba to Decatur  Georgia. And Decatur  Georgia's a small Southern town. And in that little Southern town  I grew up  and grew up hearing these stories. But this story only happened a few years ago. I called my mom. It was a Saturday morning. And I was calling about how to make ajiaco. It's a Cuban meal. It's delicious. It's savory. It makes spit froth in the little corners of your mouth    is that enough  It makes your armpits juicy  you know  That kind of food  yeah. This is the sensory part of the program  people. I called my mother  and she said   Carmen  I need you to come  please. I need to go to the mall  and you know your father now  he takes a nap in the afternoon  and I got to go. I got an errand to run.  Let me parenthetically pause here and tell you    Esther  my mother  had stopped driving several years ago  to the collective relief of the entire city of Atlanta. Any vehicular outing with that woman from the time I was a young child  guys  naturally included flashing  blue lights. But she'd become adept at dodging the boys in blue  and when she did meet them  oh  she had wonderful  well  rapport.  Ma'am  did you know that was a light you just ran    You don't speak English    No.  But eventually  every dog has its day  and she ended up in traffic court  where she bartered with the judge for a discount. There's a historical marker. But now she was a septuagenarian  she'd stopped driving. And that meant that everyone in the family had to sign up to take her to have her hair dyed  you know  that peculiar color of blue that matches her polyester pants suit  you know  same color as the Buick. Anybody  All right. Little picks on the legs  where she does her needlepoint  and leaves little loops. Rockports    they're for this. That's why they call them that. This is her ensemble. And this is the woman that wants me to come on a Saturday morning when I have a lot to do  but it doesn't take long because Cuban guilt is a weighty thing. I'm not going political on you but ... And so  I go to my mother's. I show up. She's in the carport. Of course  they have a carport. The kind with the corrugated roof  you know. The Buick's parked outside  and she's jingling  jangling a pair of keys.  I got a surprise for you  baby    We taking your car    Not we  I.  And she reaches into her pocket and pulls out a catastrophe. Somebody's storytelling. Interactive art. You can talk to me. Oh  a driver's license  a perfectly valid driver's license. Issued  evidently  by the DMV in her own county of Gwinnett. Blithering fucking idiots. I said   Is that thing real    I think so.   Can you even see    I guess I must.   Oh  Jesus.  She gets into the car    she's sitting on two phone books. I can't even make this part up because she's that tiny. She's engineered an umbrella so she can    bam     slam the door. Her daughter  me  the village idiot with the ice cream cone in the middle of her forehead  is still standing there  slack jawed.  You coming  You no coming    Oh  my God.  I said   OK  fine. Does pop know you're driving    Are you kidding me    How are you doing it    He's got to sleep sometime.  And so we left my father fast asleep  because I knew he'd kill me if I let her go by herself  and we get in the car. Puts it in reverse. Fifty five out of the driveway  in reverse. I am buckling in seatbelts from the front. I'm yanking them in from the back. I'm doing double knots. I mean  I've got a mouth as dry as the Kalahari Desert. I've got a white knuckle grip on the door. You know what I'm talking about  And she's whistling  and finally I do the kind of birth breathing    you know  that one  Only a couple of women are going uh huh  uh huh  uh huh. Right. And I said   Ma  would you slow down   Because now she's picked up the Highway      the perimeter around Atlanta  which encompasses now    there's seven lanes  she's on all of them  y'all. I said   Ma  pick a lane    They give you seven lanes  they expect you to use them.  And there she goes  right. I don't believe for a minute she has been out and not been stopped. So  I think  hey  we can talk. It'll be a diversion. It'll help my breathing. It'll do something for my pulse  maybe.  Mommy  I know you have been stopped.   No  no  what you talking about    You have a license. How long have you been driving    Four or five days.   Yeah. And you haven't been stopped    I did not get a ticket.  I said   Yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  but come on  come on  come on.   OK  so I stopped at a light and there's a guy  you know  in the back.   Would this guy have  like  a blue uniform and a terrified look on his face    You weren't there  don't start.   Come on. You got a ticket    No.  She explained   The man     I have to tell you as she did  because it loses something if I don't  you know     he come to the window  and he does a thing like this  which tells me he's pretty old  you know. So I look up and I'm thinking  maybe he's still going to think I'm kind of cute.   Ma  are you still doing that    If it works  it works  baby. So  I say  'Perdon  yo no hablo ingles.' Well  wouldn't you know  he had been in Honduras for the Peace Corps.  So he's talking to her  and at some point she says   Then  you know  it was it. That was it. It was done.   Yeah  What  He gave you a ticket  He didn't give you a ticket  What    No  I look up  and the light  she change.  You should be terrified. Now  I don't know if she's toying with me  kind of like a cat batting back a mouse  batting back a mouse    left paw  right paw  left paw  right paw    but by now  we've reached the mall. Now  you have all been at a mall during the holidays  yes  Talk to me. Yes. Yes. You can say yes. Audience  Yes. Carmen Agra Deedy  All right  then you know that you have now entered parking lot purgatory  praying to that saint of perpetual availability that as you join that serpentine line of cars crawling along  some guy's going to turn on the brake lights just as you pull up behind him. But that doesn't happen most of the time  right  So  first I say   Ma  why are we here    You mean  like  in the car    No  don't    why are we here today  It's Saturday. It's the holidays.   Because I have to exchange your father's underwear.  Now  see  this is the kind of Machiavellian thinking  that you really have to    you know  in my mind  it's a rabbit's warren  this woman's mind. Do I want to walk in  because unless I have Ariadne's thread to anchor    enough metaphors for you     somewhere  I may not get out. But you know.  Why do we have to take pop's underwear back now  And why  What is wrong with his underwear    It will upset you.   It won't upset me. Why  What  Is something wrong with him    No  no  no. The only thing with him is  he's an idiot. I sent him to the store  which was my first mistake  and he went to buy underwear  and he bought the grippers  and he's supposed to buy the boxers.   Why    I read it on the Intersnet. You cannot have children.   Oh  my God   Olivia  Huh  Huh  By now  we have now crawled another four feet  and my mother finally says to me   I knew it  I knew it. I'm an immigrant. We make a space. What I tell you  Right there.  And she points out the passenger window  and I look out  and three    three    aisles down   Look  the Chevy.  You want to laugh  but you don't know    you're that politically corrected  have you noticed  Correct the other direction now  it's OK.  Look  the Chevy    he's coming this way.   Mama  mama  mama  wait  wait  wait. The Chevy is three aisles away.  She looks at me like I'm her  you know  her moron child  the cretin  the one she's got to speak to very slowly and distinctly.  I know that  honey. Get out of the car and go stand in the parking space till I get there.  OK  I want a vote. Come on  come on. No  no. How many of you once in your    you were a kid  you were an adult    you stood in a parking space to hold it for someone  See  we're a secret club with a secret handshake. And years of therapy later  we're doing great. We're doing great. We're doing fine. Well  I stood up to her. This is    you know  you'd think by now I'm    and still holding  I said   No way  ma  you have embarrassed me my entire life.  Of course  her comeback is   When have I embarrassed you   And she's still talking while she puts the car in park  hits the emergency brake  opens the door  and with a spryness astounding in a woman her age  she jumps out of the car  knocks out the phone books  and then she walks around    she's carrying her cheap Kmart purse with her    around the front of the car. She has amazing land speed for a woman her age  too. Before I know it  she has skiddled across the parking lot and in between the cars  and people behind me  with that kind of usual religious charity that the holidays bring us  wah wah wah wah.  I'm coming.  Italian hand signals follow. I scoot over. I close the door. I leave the phone books. This is new and fast  just so you    are you still with us  We'll wait for the slow ones. OK. I start  and this is where a child says to me    and the story doesn't work if I tell you about her before  because this is my laconic child. A brevity  brevity of everything with this child. You know  she eats small portions. Language is something to be meted out in small phonemes  you know    just little hmm  hmm hmm. She carries a mean spiral notebook and a pen. She wields great power. She listens  because that's what people who tell stories do first. But she pauses occasionally and says   How do you spell that  What year  OK.  When she writes the expose in about    years  don't believe a word of it. But this is my daughter  Lauren  my remarkable daughter  my borderline Asperger's kid. Bless you  Dr. Watson. She says   Ma  you got to look   Now  when this kid says I got to look  you know. But it isn't like I haven't seen this crime scene before. I grew up with this woman. I said   Lauren  you know what  give me a play by play. I can't.   No  mama  you got to look.  I got to look. You got to look. Don't you want to look  There she is. I look in bewildered awe  she's standing  those Rockports slightly apart  but grounded. She's holding out that cheap Kmart purse  and she is wielding it. She's holding back tons of steel with the sheer force of her little personality  in that crone ish voice  saying things like   Back it up  buddy  No  it's reserved   Ready  Brace yourselves. Here it comes.  No  my daughter  she's coming in the Buick. Honey  sit up so they can see you.  Oh  Jesus. Oh  Jesus. I finally come    and now  it's the South. I don't know what part of the country you live in. I think we all secretly love stories. We all secretly want our blankie and our Boo Bear. We want to curl up and say   Tell it to me  tell it to me. Come on  honey  tell it to me.  But in the South  we love a good story. People have pulled aside  I mean  they've come out of that queue line  they have popped their trunks  pulled out lawn chairs and cool drinks. Bets are placed.  I'm with the little lady. Damn   And she's bringing me in with a slight salsa movement. She is  after all  Cuban. I'm thinking   Accelerator  break. Accelerator  break.  Like you've never thought that in your life  Right  Yeah. I pull in. I put the car in park. Engine's still running    mine  not the car. I jump out next to her going   Don't you move    I'm not going anywhere.  She's got front seat in a Greek tragedy. I come out  and there's Esther. She's hugging the purse.  Que   Which means  what   and so much more.  Ma  have you no shame  People are watching us all around   right  Now  some of them you've got to make up  people. Secret of the trade. Guess what  Some of these stories I sculpt a little  here and there. Some  they're just right there  right there. Put them right there. She says this to me. After I say    let me refresh you     have you no shame    No. I gave it up with pantyhose    they're both too binding.  Yeah  you can clap  but then you're about    seconds from the end. I'm about to snap like a brittle twig  when suddenly someone taps me on the shoulder. Intrepid soul. I'm thinking   This is my kid. How dare she  She jumped out of that car.  That's OK  because my mother yells at me  I yell at her. It's a beautiful hierarchy  and it works. I turn around  but it's not a child. It's a young woman  a little taller than I  pale green  amused eyes. With her is a young man    husband  brother  lover  it's not my job. And she says   Pardon me  ma'am     that's how we talk down there     is that your mother   I said   No  I follow little old women around parking lots to see if they'll stop. Yes  it's my mother   The boy  now  he says.  Well  what my sister meant     they look at each other  it's a knowing glance     God  she's crazy   I said   Spanish   and the young girl and the young boy say   No  no  honey  we just want to know one more thing.  I said   Look  please  let me take care of her  OK  because I know her  and believe me  she's like a small atomic weapon  you know  you just want to handle her really gingerly.  And the girl goes   I know  but  I mean  I swear to God  she reminds us of our mother.  I almost miss it. He turns to her on the heel of his shoe. It's a half whisper   God  I miss her.  They turn then  shoulder to shoulder  and walk away  lost in their own reverie. Memories of some maddening woman who was the luck of their DNA draw. And I turn to Esther  who's rocking on those 'ports  and says   You know what  honey    What  ma    I'm going to drive you crazy probably for about        more years  if you're lucky  but after that  honey  you're going to miss me.   SHIT  This is arguably the back end of the design of animals. But the reason I put this up here is because when I was in Africa last year  my wife and I were driving around  we had this wonderful guide  who showed us something that surprised both of us  and it was very revealing in terms of the fascination that comes with the design of animals. It turns out that in about the     s  the missionaries came to Africa to spread the word of Christianity  to teach English to the natives. And they brought blackboards and chalk. And I'd like you to imagine that that's a blackboard  and I just used some chalk on there. And they brought quite a bit of this stuff. But over the years  the blackboards were fine  but they ran out of chalk. And this is a real crisis for them. And that's where the hyena comes in. The hyena is probably the most perfectly designed scavenging animal in the world. It strip mines carcasses  and it has amazing teeth  because it enables the hyena to essentially eat bones. Now  the end product of that action is up on the board here. What the missionaries would do is  they'd walk around and they'd pick up hyena shit. And the incredible thing about hyena shit is  it makes great chalk. That's not what I'm here to talk about  but it is a fascinating aspect of animal design. What I'm here to talk about is the camel. When I started talking to Richard about what I was going to speak about  I had recently come back from Jordan  where I had an amazing experience with a camel. And we were in the desert. Richard Wurman  That's the end  Keith Bellows  Yeah  yeah. We were in the desert  in Wadi Rum  in a small Jeep. There were four of us  two Bedouin drivers. You can just imagine  this expanse is an ocean of sand      degrees  one water bottle. And we were driving in what they told us was their very  very best Jeep. Didn't look like it to me. And as we started to go through the desert  the Jeep broke down. The guys got out  they put the hood up  they started working under the hood  got it going again. About a hundred yards  it broke down. This went on about     times  we were getting more and more alarmed  we were also getting deeper and deeper into the desert. And eventually  our worst nightmare happened  they flooded the engine. And they said   Ah  no problem  We just get out and walk.  And we said   We get out and walk   One water bottle  remember  guys  four people. And they said   Yeah  yeah  we'll walk. We'll find some camels.  We got out and walked  and sure enough  about half a mile  we came over the crest of this hill  and there was a huge gathering of Bedouin with their camels. The guy went up and started dickering  and    dollars later  we had four camels. They went down like elevators  we got on them. They went back up  and the Bedouin  each Bedouin  four of them  got behind each of the camels with a little whip. And they started slashing away at the back of the camels  and they started galloping. And if you've ever been on a camel  it is a very  very uncomfortable ride. There's also one other aspect about these camels. About every    steps  they lean back and try to take a chunk out of your leg. So we kept on going  and this camel kept on trying to take a chunk out of my leg. And eventually  three miles later  we arrived at our destination  where a Jeep was supposed to meet us. And the camels come down again like elevators  we sort of clumsily get off  and they  obviously  try to take another chunk out of my leg. And I've developed a very wonderful relationship with this creature by this point  and I've realized that this is a mean son of a bitch. And much meaner  by the way  than the Bedouin who greeted me and tried to sell me one of his    daughters to take back to the States. So as we talked  Richard and I  I said   You know  maybe I should bring a camel. It's the best designed animal in the world.  He went   Nah. I don't think we want to be bringing a camel.  And you should be really glad we decided not to bring the camel. So I did the next best thing. I went to the Washington Zoo. Richard said   I want you to get up close and personal with this camel. I want you to inspect its mouth  look at its teeth. Go underneath it. Go above it. Go around it. Pull its tail up  take a look in there. I want you to get as close to that camel as you possibly can.  So  I got a National Geographic film crew. We went down there  and I took one look at this camel. It is a       pound creature who is in rut. Now  if you've ever seen a       pound camel in rut  it is a scary  scary thing to behold. And if Richard thought I was getting in the ring with that camel  someone was smoking Bedouin high grade. So we got as close to it as possible  and I'm going to share this. Chris  if you want to roll this film. Then I'm going to show you a little bit more about the design of camels. Do you want to roll the film  with the TED National Geographic Camel Investigation Unit. I'm here to look at the ultimate desert machine. Keith Bellows  And you'll note I started chewing gum because I was around this camel all day. See  now he's getting a little overexcited. So we'll need to be very careful around him. Don't let him get you. Now  you can see copious amounts of saliva in there. I always called myself the unstable stable boy. Their nose  you can see his nose is flared right now. When they're in rut  they're similar to seals in the way  like  a seal has to open its nose to breathe. And they're similar. They have to consciously open their nose. KB  Ears  SK  They are small. But they have excellent hearing. But not big  for instance  in zebras  they have a huge ear that's very mobile  so they can actually turn them both around. And they use them in the same way we use our binocular vision. They use that to pinpoint sound. The desert's extremely windy as well as being very cold. So not only do they have the very long eyelashes  but there's the secondary    I guess you'd call it the  unclear  or whatever. It's this hair that's above the eyes  and below it  it's longer. Most people think that the humps store water. They don't. They store fat. Now  I'm not a chemist  but basically what happens is the fat is oxidized by their breathing. And that will turn it into actually usable water. Like a lot of predators  they walk on their toes. But there's a big fat pad in there that squishes out. They're like sun shoes  but  you know  with sand. Hooves  They don't have traditional hooves  but they do have one  like  big nail. You can't really see too clear. The fur's kind of grown over. But they use their tails a lot  especially in rut. He will urinate and spin his tail to spread the urine around and make him more attractive. I don't know why that would be  but it works for them. So  what the hell. Now  they will also defecate in certain areas. Generally  they poop wherever they want to  but during their rut  they will defecate in perimeter areas. I don't know if you've read or heard about the sub sonic sounds from elephants  you know what I mean  like   Br r r   These big  big rumbling sounds. He will do the same thing. You can actually see  right here  it will vibrate. We weigh our animals. Unfortunately  he's a very aggressive animal  so he's actually destroyed some of the scales. We had these big things that I weigh the bison on  for instance. I'm guessing that he's at least       pounds. But I would put him closer to      . He's basically a walking mulch pile. We're kind of like buds  but I'm also a male as well. KB  He sees you as competition  Senior Keeper  Yeah  exactly. And it makes him very dangerous at this time of year. Don't even think about it. Don't think about it  But now  we're going to meet. Out  Out  Out  No. Out  KB  What I didn't show you was  you got that swinging thing going  Well  and you're glad I didn't show you this. One of the other things about the camel's beautiful design is that its penis points backwards. That way the camel can dip its tail in the stream  and just whacker the entire area around him. And that's how he really marks his territory. Now  what you also didn't see was that    and you may have noticed in the pen beside him and  by the way  the camel's name is Suki. In the pen beside him is Jasmine. Jasmine has been his mate for some time. But on this particular occasion  it was very  very clear that as horny as Suki was  Jasmine was having none of it. And so we started thinking. Well  if poor old Suki is in search of a mate  what would Suki do to find the perfect mate  I'm going to show you another film. But before I do  I just want to mention that this animal truly is a sort of the SUV of the sand  the ship of the desert. It's so vital to the inhabitants of the areas in which the camel is found  largely Mongolia and Sahara  that there are     words in Arabic to describe the camel. And if this is a creature that was designed by committee  it's certainly been like no committee I've ever been on. So here's what Suki would do in search of a mate. Can you roll it  please  Camel seeking camel Lusty beast desires attractive and sincere mate. I'm seven feet        lbs.  with brown hair and eyes  long legs    and I'm very well ... hung. I'm TED Camel. The perfect desert machine. I'm smartly designed. Eyelashes that keep out sand and a third eyelash that works like a windshield wiper. A distinguished nose    with nostrils lined to filter out sand and dust and a groove that catches moisture. Amazingly full lips    that allow me to eat practically anything that grows. Callouses on my knees that let me kneel comfortably. Leathery chest pads that beat the heat. Short fur that keeps my skin cool. Long legs that allow heat to escape. And my hump  Ogden Nash once wrote   The camel has a single hump  the dromedary two  or else the other way around. I'm never sure. Are you   Here's a hint  Bactarian. Dromedary. My hump contains up to    lbs. of fat  but doesn't store H O. I'm built to last. I'm the go to animal when the oasis is dry. I usually won't sweat until my body reaches      F  enough to fry an egg. I'm able to lose     of my weight without dying. I'll drink   to   gallons of water a day. But go without for more than a month. I'm powerful. Able to pack up to     lbs. of cargo. Outrun a horse    And cover    miles on a good day. Camelot. Jackie O. once said that traveling by camel made riding an elephant seem like taking a jet plane. Yet my large  soft feet allow me to navigate sand. I'm a good provider  too. Bedouins call the camel the Gift of God. No surprise. Tents and rugs are made of my hair. My dried bones are prized as a sort of ivory. My dung is burned as fuel. My milk is used for cheese.  Camels are like angels   a Bedouin once said. Thank you. I just want to leave you with one last thought  which is probably the most important thing to take away. Humans  the animal  are pretty lucky creatures because  by and large  we really don't have to adapt to our environment  we adapt our environment to us. And we've seen that repeatedly through this conference  not just this year  but in past years. But this creature that you've just seen ultimately adapts  and keeps adapting and adapting. I think when you look at the animal kingdom  that is one of the most remarkable things. It doesn't have an environment that adapts to it  it has to adapt to the environment. Ricky  thank you very much for having me. RW  That's terrific. Thank you. My thing with school lunch is  it's a social justice issue. I'm the Director of Nutrition Services for the Berkeley Unified School District. I have    employees and    locations        kids. I'm doing       meals a day and I've been doing it for two years  trying to change how we feed kids in America. And that's what I want to talk to you a little bit about today. These are some of my kids with a salad bar. I put salad bars in all of our schools when I got there. Everyone says it couldn't be done. Little kids couldn't eat off the salad bar  big kids would spit in it    neither happened. When I took over this  I tried to really figure out  like  what my vision would be. How do we really change children's relationship to food  And I'll tell you why we need to change it  but we absolutely have to change it. And what I came to understand is  we needed to teach children the symbiotic relationship between a healthy planet  healthy food and healthy kids. And that if we don't do that  the antithesis  although we've heard otherwise  is we're really going to become extinct  because we're feeding our children to death. That's my premise. We're seeing sick kids get sicker and sicker. And the reason this is happening  by and large  is because of our food system and the way the government commodifies food  the way the government oversees our food  the way the USDA puts food on kids' plates that's unhealthy  and allows unhealthy food into schools. And by    tacitly  all of us send our kids  or grandchildren  or nieces  or nephews  to school and tell them to learn  you know  learn what's in those schools. And when you feed these kids bad food  that's what they're learning. So that's really what this is all about. The way we got here is because of big agribusiness. We now live in a country where most of us don't decide  by and large  what we eat. We see big businesses  Monsanto and DuPont  who brought out Agent Orange and stain resistant carpet. They control    percent of the commercially produced seeds in our country. These are       companies control much of what's in our grocery stores  much of what people eat. And that's really  really a problem. So when I started thinking about these issues and how I was going to change what kids ate  I really started focusing on what we would teach them. And the very first thing was about regional food    trying to eat food from within our region. And clearly  with what's going on with fossil fuel usage  or when    as the fossil fuel is going away  as oil hits its peak oil  you know  we really have to start thinking about whether or not we should  or could  be moving food       miles before we eat it. So we talked to kids about that  and we really start to feed kids regional food. And then we talk about organic food. Now  most school districts can't really afford organic food  but we  as a nation  have to start thinking about consuming  growing and feeding our children food that's not chock full of chemicals. We can't keep feeding our kids pesticides and herbicides and antibiotics and hormones. We can't keep doing that. You know  it doesn't work. And the results of that are kids getting sick. One of my big soapboxes right now is antibiotics. Seventy percent of all antibiotics consumed in America is consumed in animal husbandry. We are feeding our kids antibiotics in beef and other animal protein every day. Seventy percent    it's unbelievable. And the result of it is  we have diseases. We have things like E. coli that we can't fix  that we can't make kids better when they get sick. And  you know  certainly antibiotics have been over prescribed  but it's an issue in the food supply. One of my favorite facts is that U.S. agriculture uses  .  billion pounds of pesticides every year. That means every one of us  and our children  consumes what would equal a five pound bag    those bags you have at home. If I had one here and ripped it open  and that pile I would have on the floor is what we consume and feed our children every year because of what goes into our food supply  because of the way we consume produce in America. The USDA allows these antibiotics  these hormones and these pesticides in our food supply  and the USDA paid for this ad in Time magazine. Okay  we could talk about Rachel Carson and DDT  but we know it wasn't good for you and me. And that is what the USDA allows in our food supply. And that has to change  you know. The USDA cannot be seen as the be all and end all of what we feed our kids and what's allowed. We cannot believe that they have our best interests at heart. The antithesis of this whole thing is sustainable food. That's what I really try and get people to understand. I really try and teach it to kids. I think it's the most important. It's consuming food in a way in which we'll still have a planet  in which kids will grow up to be healthy  and which really tries to mitigate all the negative impacts we're seeing. It really is just a new idea. I mean  people toss around sustainability  but we have to figure out what sustainability is. In less than     years  you know  just in a few generations  we've gone from being        being     percent     percent farmers to less than   percent of farmers. We now live in a country that has more prisoners than farmers     .  million prisoners   .  million farmers. And we spend        dollars on average a year keeping a prisoner in prison  and school districts spend     dollars a year feeding a child. It's no wonder  you know  we have criminals. And what's happening is  we're getting sick. We're getting sick and our kids are getting sick. It is about what we feed them. What goes in is what we are. We really are what we eat. And if we continue down this path  if we continue to feed kids bad food  if we continue not to teach them what good food is  what's going to happen  You know  what is going to happen  What's going to happen to our whole medical system  What's going to happen is  we're going to have kids that have a life less long than our own. The CDC  the Center for Disease Control  has said  of the children born in the year         those seven  and eight year olds today    one out of every three Caucasians  one out of every two African Americans and Hispanics are going to have diabetes in their lifetime. And if that's not enough  they've gone on to say  most before they graduate high school. This means that    or    percent of all school aged children could be insulin dependent within a decade. Within a decade. What's going to happen  Well  the CDC has gone further to say that those children born in the year      could be the first generation in our country's history to die at a younger age than their parents. And it's because of what we feed them. Because eight year olds don't get to decide    and if they do  you should be in therapy. You know  we are responsible for what kids eat. But oops  maybe they're responsible for what kids eat. Big companies spend    billion dollars a year marketing non nutrient foods to kids.    billion dollars a year.        ads most kids see. They spend     dollars for every one dollar        dollars marketing foods that kids shouldn't eat for every one dollar marketing healthy  nutritious food. The result of which is kids think they're going to die if they don't have chicken nuggets. You know that everybody thinks they should be eating more  and more  and more. This is the USDA portion size  that little  tiny thing. And the one over there  that's bigger than my head  is what McDonald's and Burger King and those big companies think we should eat. And why can they serve that much  Why can we have    cent Big Gulps and    cent double burgers  It's because of the way the government commodifies food  and the cheap corn and cheap soy that are pushed into our food supply that makes these non nutrient foods really  really cheap. Which is why I say it's a social justice issue. Now  I said I'm doing this in Berkeley  and you might think   Oh  Berkeley. Of course you can do it in Berkeley.  Well  this is the food I found    months ago. This is not even food. This is the stuff we were feeding our kids  Extremo Burritos  corn dogs  pizza pockets  grilled cheese sandwiches. Everything came in plastic  in cardboard. The only kitchen tools my staff had was a box cutter. The only working piece of equipment in my kitchen was a can crusher  because if it didn't come in a can  it came frozen in a box. The USDA allows this. The USDA allows all of this stuff. In case you can't tell  that's  like  pink Danish and some kind of cupcakes. Chicken nuggets  Tater Tots  chocolate milk with high fructose  canned fruit cocktail    a reimbursable meal. That's what the government says is okay to feed our kids. It ain't okay. You know what  It is not okay. And we  all of us  have to understand that this is about us  that we can make a difference here. Now I don't know if any of you out there invented chicken nuggets  but I'm sure you're rich if you did. But whoever decided that a chicken should look like a heart  a giraffe  a star  Well  Tyson did  because there's no chicken in the chicken. And that they could figure it out  that we could sell this stuff to kids. You know  what's wrong with teaching kids that chicken looks like chicken  But this is what most schools serve. In fact  this may be what a lot of parents serve  as opposed to    this is what we try and serve. We really need to change this whole paradigm with kids and food. We really have to teach children that chicken is not a giraffe. You know  that vegetables are actually colorful  that they have flavor  that carrots grow in the ground  that strawberries grow in the ground. There's not a strawberry tree or a carrot bush. You know  we have to change the way we teach kids about these things. There's a lot of stuff we can do. There's a lot of schools doing farm to school programs. There's a lot of schools actually getting fresh food into schools. Now  in Berkeley  we've gone totally fresh. We have no high fructose corn syrup  no trans fats  no processed foods. We're cooking from scratch every day. We have    percent of our    thank you       percent of our stuff is organic and local. We cook. Those are my hands. I get up at   a.m. every day and go cook the food for the kids  because this is what we need to do. We can't keep serving kids processed crap  full of chemicals  and expect these are going to be healthy citizens. You're not going to get the next generation  or the generation after  to be able to think like this if they're not nourished. If they're eating chemicals all the time  they're not going to be able to think. They're not going to be smart. You know what  They're just going to be sick. Now one of the things that    what happened when I went into Berkeley is I realized that  you know  this was all pretty amazing to people  very  very different  and I needed to market it. I came up with these calendars that I sent home to every parent. And these calendars really started to lay out my program. Now I'm in charge of all the cooking classes and all the gardening classes in our school district. So this is a typical menu. This is what we're serving this week at the schools. And you see these recipes on the side  Those are the recipes that the kids learn in my cooking classes. They do tastings of these ingredients in the gardening classes. They also may be growing them. And we serve them in the cafeterias. If we're going to change children's relationship to food  it's delicious  nutritious food in the cafeterias  hands on experience    you're looking in cooking and gardening classes    and academic curriculum to tie it all together. Now you've probably garnered that I don't love the USDA  and I don't have any idea what to do with their pyramid  this upside down pyramid with a rainbow over the top  I don't know. You know  run up into the end of the rainbow  I don't know what you do with it. So  I came up with my own. This is available on my website in English and Spanish  and it's a visual way to talk to kids about food. The really tiny hamburger  the really big vegetables. We have to start changing this. We have to make kids understand that their food choices make a big difference. We have cooking classes    we have cooking classrooms in our schools. And why this is so important is that we now have grown a generation  maybe two  of kids where one out of every four meals is eaten in fast food  one of every four meals is eaten in a car and one out of every last four meals is eaten in front of a TV or computer. What are kids learning  Where is the family time  Where is socialization  Where is discussion  Where is learning to talk  You know  we have to change it. I work with kids a lot. These are kids I work with in Harlem. EATWISE    Enlightened and Aware Teens Who Inspire Smart Eating. We have to teach kids that Coke and Pop Tarts aren't breakfast. We have to teach kids that if they're on a diet of refined sugar  they go up and down  just like if they're on a diet of crack. And we have to pull it all together. We have composting in all of our schools. We have recycling in all of our schools. You know  the things that we maybe do at home and think are so important  we have to teach kids about in school. It has to be so much a part of them that they really get it. Because  you know what  many of us are sort of at the end of our careers  and we need to be giving these kids    these young kids  the next generation    the tools to save themselves and save the planet. One of the things I do a lot is public private partnerships. I work with private companies who are willing to do R   D with me  who are willing to do distribution for me  who are really willing to work to go into schools. Schools are underfunded. Most schools in America spend less than       dollars a year teaching a child. That comes down to under five dollars an hour. Most of you spend        dollars an hour for babysitters when you have them. So we're spending less than   dollars an hour on the educational system. And if we're going to change it  and change how we feed kids  we really have to rethink that. So  public and private partnerships  advocacy groups  working with foundations. In our school district  the way we afford this is our school district allocates .   percent of the general fund towards nutrition services. And I think if every school district allocated a half to one percent  we could start to really fix this program. We really need to change it. It's going to take more money. Of course  it's not all about food  it's also about kids getting exercise. And one of the simple things we can do is put recess before lunch. It's sort of this  duh  thing. You know  if you have kids coming into lunch and all they're going to do when they get out of lunch is go to have recess  you see them just throw away their lunch so they can run outside. And then  at one in the afternoon  they're totally crashing. These are your children and grandchildren that are totally melting down when you pick them up  because they haven't had lunch. So if the only thing they'd have to do after lunch is go to class  believe me  they're going to sit there and eat their lunch. We need to    we need to educate. We need to educate the kids. We need to educate the staff. I had    employees. Two were supposed to be cooks    none could. And  you know  I'm not that better off now. But we really have to educate. We have to get academic institutions to start thinking about ways to teach people how to cook again  because  of course  they don't    because we've had this processed food in schools and institutions for so long. We need    minute lunches    most schools have    minute lunches    and lunches that are time appropriate. There was just a big study done  and so many schools are starting lunch at nine and    in the morning. That is not lunchtime. You know  it's crazy. It's crazy what we're doing. And just remember  at very least tacitly  this is what we're teaching children as what they should be doing. I think if we're going to fix this  one of the things we have to do is really change how we have oversight over the National School Lunch Program. Instead of the National School Lunch Program being under the USDA  I think it should be under CDC. If we started to think about food and how we feed our kids as a health initiative  and we started thinking about food as health  then I think we wouldn't have corn dogs as lunch. Okay  Finance     on this  and this    I'm sort of wrapping it up with this finance piece  because I think this is something we all have to understand. The National School Lunch Program spends   billion dollars feeding    million children a year. That number probably needs to double. People say   Oh my God  where are we going to get   billion   In this country  we're spending     billion dollars a year on fast food. We spend     billion dollars a year on diet aids. We spend    billion dollars on vegetables  which is why we need all the diet aids. We spend     billion dollars a year on diet related illness today  with nine percent of our kids having type   diabetes.     billion. So you know what  when we talk about needing   billion more  it's not a lot. That   billion comes down to two dollars and    cents    that's what the government allocates for lunch. Most school districts spend two thirds of that on payroll and overhead. That means we spend less than a dollar a day on food for kids in schools    most schools     to    cents. In L.A.  it's    cents. So we're spending less than a dollar  OK  on lunch. Now I don't know about you  but I go to Starbucks and Pete's and places like that  and venti latte in San Francisco is five dollars. One gourmet coffee  one  is more    we spend more on than we are spending to feed kids for an entire week in our schools. You know what  We should be ashamed. We  as a country  should be ashamed at that. The richest country. In our country  it's the kids that need it the most  who get this really  really lousy food. It's the kids who have parents and grandparents and uncles and aunts that can't even afford to pay for school lunch that gets this food. And those are the same kids who are going to be getting sick. Those are the same kids who we should be taking care of. We can all make a difference. That every single one of us  whether we have children  whether we care about children  whether we have nieces or nephews  or anything    that we can make a difference. Whether you sit down and eat a meal with your kids  whether you take your kids  or grandchildren  or nieces and nephews shopping to a farmers' market. Just do tastings with them. Sit down and care. And on the macro level  we're in what seems to be a    month presidential campaign  and of all the things we're asking all of these potential leaders  what about asking for the health of our children  Thank you. Suppose that two American friends are traveling together in Italy. They go to see Michelangelo's  David   and when they finally come face to face with the statue  they both freeze dead in their tracks. The first guy    we'll call him Adam    is transfixed by the beauty of the perfect human form. The second guy    we'll call him Bill    is transfixed by embarrassment  at staring at the thing there in the center. So here's my question for you  which one of these two guys was more likely to have voted for George Bush  which for Al Gore  I don't need a show of hands because we all have the same political stereotypes. We all know that it's Bill. And in this case  the stereotype corresponds to reality. It really is a fact that liberals are much higher than conservatives on a major personality trait called openness to experience. People who are high in openness to experience just crave novelty  variety  diversity  new ideas  travel. People low on it like things that are familiar  that are safe and dependable. If you know about this trait  you can understand a lot of puzzles about human behavior. You can understand why artists are so different from accountants. You can actually predict what kinds of books they like to read  what kinds of places they like to travel to  and what kinds of food they like to eat. Once you understand this trait  you can understand why anybody would eat at Applebee's  but not anybody that you know. This trait also tells us a lot about politics. The main researcher of this trait  Robert McCrae says that   Open individuals have an affinity for liberal  progressive  left wing political views     they like a society which is open and changing     whereas closed individuals prefer conservative  traditional  right wing views.  This trait also tells us a lot about the kinds of groups people join. So here's the description of a group I found on the Web. What kinds of people would join a global community welcoming people from every discipline and culture  who seek a deeper understanding of the world  and who hope to turn that understanding into a better future for us all  This is from some guy named Ted. Well  let's see now  if openness predicts who becomes liberal  and openness predicts who becomes a TEDster  then might we predict that most TEDsters are liberal  Let's find out. I'm going to ask you to raise your hand  whether you are liberal  left of center    on social issues  we're talking about  primarily    or conservative  and I'll give a third option  because I know there are a number of libertarians in the audience. So  right now  please raise your hand    down in the simulcast rooms  too  let's let everybody see who's here    please raise your hand if you would say that you are liberal or left of center. Please raise your hand high right now. OK. Please raise your hand if you'd say you're libertarian. OK  about a    two dozen. And please raise your hand if you'd say you are right of center or conservative. One  two  three  four  five    about eight or   . OK. This is a bit of a problem. Because if our goal is to understand the world  to seek a deeper understanding of the world  our general lack of moral diversity here is going to make it harder. Because when people all share values  when people all share morals  they become a team  and once you engage the psychology of teams  it shuts down open minded thinking. When the liberal team loses  as it did in       and as it almost did in       we comfort ourselves. We try to explain why half of America voted for the other team. We think they must be blinded by religion  or by simple stupidity. So  if you think that half of America votes Republican because they are blinded in this way  then my message to you is that you're trapped in a moral matrix  in a particular moral matrix. And by the matrix  I mean literally the matrix  like the movie  The Matrix.  But I'm here today to give you a choice. You can either take the blue pill and stick to your comforting delusions  or you can take the red pill  learn some moral psychology and step outside the moral matrix. Now  because I know    OK  I assume that answers my question. I was going to ask you which one you picked  but no need. You're all high in openness to experience  and besides  it looks like it might even taste good  and you're all epicures. So anyway  let's go with the red pill. Let's study some moral psychology and see where it takes us. Let's start at the beginning. What is morality and where does it come from  The worst idea in all of psychology is the idea that the mind is a blank slate at birth. Developmental psychology has shown that kids come into the world already knowing so much about the physical and social worlds  and programmed to make it really easy for them to learn certain things and hard to learn others. The best definition of innateness I've ever seen    this just clarifies so many things for me    is from the brain scientist Gary Marcus. He says   The initial organization of the brain does not depend that much on experience. Nature provides a first draft  which experience then revises. Built in doesn't mean unmalleable  it means organized in advance of experience.  OK  so what's on the first draft of the moral mind  To find out  my colleague  Craig Joseph  and I read through the literature on anthropology  on culture variation in morality and also on evolutionary psychology  looking for matches. What are the sorts of things that people talk about across disciplines  That you find across cultures and even across species  We found five    five best matches  which we call the five foundations of morality. The first one is harm care. We're all mammals here  we all have a lot of neural and hormonal programming that makes us really bond with others  care for others  feel compassion for others  especially the weak and vulnerable. It gives us very strong feelings about those who cause harm. This moral foundation underlies about    percent of the moral statements I've heard here at TED. The second foundation is fairness reciprocity. There's actually ambiguous evidence as to whether you find reciprocity in other animals  but the evidence for people could not be clearer. This Norman Rockwell painting is called  The Golden Rule   and we heard about this from Karen Armstrong  of course  as the foundation of so many religions. That second foundation underlies the other    percent of the moral statements I've heard here at TED. The third foundation is in group loyalty. You do find groups in the animal kingdom    you do find cooperative groups    but these groups are always either very small or they're all siblings. It's only among humans that you find very large groups of people who are able to cooperate  join together into groups  but in this case  groups that are united to fight other groups. This probably comes from our long history of tribal living  of tribal psychology. And this tribal psychology is so deeply pleasurable that even when we don't have tribes  we go ahead and make them  because it's fun. Sports is to war as pornography is to sex. We get to exercise some ancient  ancient drives. The fourth foundation is authority respect. Here you see submissive gestures from two members of very closely related species. But authority in humans is not so closely based on power and brutality  as it is in other primates. It's based on more voluntary deference  and even elements of love  at times. The fifth foundation is purity sanctity. This painting is called  The Allegory Of Chastity   but purity's not just about suppressing female sexuality. It's about any kind of ideology  any kind of idea that tells you that you can attain virtue by controlling what you do with your body  by controlling what you put into your body. And while the political right may moralize sex much more  the political left is really doing a lot of it with food. Food is becoming extremely moralized nowadays  and a lot of it is ideas about purity  about what you're willing to touch  or put into your body. I believe these are the five best candidates for what's written on the first draft of the moral mind. I think this is what we come with  at least a preparedness to learn all of these things. But as my son  Max  grows up in a liberal college town  how is this first draft going to get revised  And how will it end up being different from a kid born    miles south of us in Lynchburg  Virginia  To think about culture variation  let's try a different metaphor. If there really are five systems at work in the mind    five sources of intuitions and emotions    then we can think of the moral mind as being like one of those audio equalizers that has five channels  where you can set it to a different setting on every channel. And my colleagues  Brian Nosek and Jesse Graham  and I  made a questionnaire  which we put up on the Web at www.YourMorals.org. And so far         people have taken this questionnaire  and you can too. Here are the results. Here are the results from about        American citizens. On the left  I've plotted the scores for liberals  on the right  those for conservatives  in the middle  the moderates. The blue line shows you people's responses on the average of all the harm questions. So  as you see  people care about harm and care issues. They give high endorsement of these sorts of statements all across the board  but as you also see  liberals care about it a little more than conservatives    the line slopes down. Same story for fairness. But look at the other three lines. For liberals  the scores are very low. Liberals are basically saying   No  this is not morality. In group  authority  purity    this stuff has nothing to do with morality. I reject it.  But as people get more conservative  the values rise. We can say that liberals have a kind of a two channel  or two foundation morality. Conservatives have more of a five foundation  or five channel morality. We find this in every country we look at. Here's the data for       Canadians. I'll just flip through a few other slides. The U.K.  Australia  New Zealand  Western Europe  Eastern Europe  Latin America  the Middle East  East Asia and South Asia. Notice also that on all of these graphs  the slope is steeper on in group  authority  purity. Which shows that within any country  the disagreement isn't over harm and fairness. Everybody    I mean  we debate over what's fair    but everybody agrees that harm and fairness matter. Moral arguments within cultures are especially about issues of in group  authority  purity. This effect is so robust that we find it no matter how we ask the question. In one recent study  we asked people to suppose you're about to get a dog. You picked a particular breed  you learned some new information about the breed. Suppose you learn that this particular breed is independent minded  and relates to its owner as a friend and an equal  Well  if you are a liberal  you say   Hey  that's great   Because liberals like to say   Fetch  please.  But if you're conservative  that's not so attractive. If you're conservative  and you learn that a dog's extremely loyal to its home and family  and doesn't warm up quickly to strangers  for conservatives  well  loyalty is good    dogs ought to be loyal. But to a liberal  it sounds like this dog is running for the Republican nomination. So  you might say  OK  there are these differences between liberals and conservatives  but what makes those three other foundations moral  Aren't those just the foundations of xenophobia and authoritarianism and Puritanism  What makes them moral  The answer  I think  is contained in this incredible triptych from Hieronymus Bosch   The Garden of Earthly Delights.  In the first panel  we see the moment of creation. All is ordered  all is beautiful  all the people and animals are doing what they're supposed to be doing  where they're supposed to be. But then  given the way of the world  things change. We get every person doing whatever he wants  with every aperture of every other person and every other animal. Some of you might recognize this as the '  s. But the '  s inevitably gives way to the '  s  where the cuttings of the apertures hurt a little bit more. Of course  Bosch called this hell. So this triptych  these three panels portray the timeless truth that order tends to decay. The truth of social entropy. But lest you think this is just some part of the Christian imagination where Christians have this weird problem with pleasure  here's the same story  the same progression  told in a paper that was published in Nature a few years ago  in which Ernst Fehr and Simon Gachter had people play a commons dilemma. A game in which you give people money  and then  on each round of the game  they can put money into a common pot  and then the experimenter doubles what's in there  and then it's all divided among the players. So it's a really nice analog for all sorts of environmental issues  where we're asking people to make a sacrifice and they themselves don't really benefit from their own sacrifice. But you really want everybody else to sacrifice  but everybody has a temptation to a free ride. And what happens is that  at first  people start off reasonably cooperative    and this is all played anonymously. On the first round  people give about half of the money that they can. But they quickly see   You know what  other people aren't doing so much though. I don't want to be a sucker. I'm not going to cooperate.  And so cooperation quickly decays from reasonably good  down to close to zero. But then    and here's the trick    Fehr and Gachter said  on the seventh round  they told people   You know what  New rule. If you want to give some of your own money to punish people who aren't contributing  you can do that.  And as soon as people heard about the punishment issue going on  cooperation shoots up. It shoots up and it keeps going up. There's a lot of research showing that to solve cooperative problems  it really helps. It's not enough to just appeal to people's good motives. It really helps to have some sort of punishment. Even if it's just shame or embarrassment or gossip  you need some sort of punishment to bring people  when they're in large groups  to cooperate. There's even some recent research suggesting that religion    priming God  making people think about God    often  in some situations  leads to more cooperative  more pro social behavior. Some people think that religion is an adaptation evolved both by cultural and biological evolution to make groups to cohere  in part for the purpose of trusting each other  and then being more effective at competing with other groups. I think that's probably right  although this is a controversial issue. But I'm particularly interested in religion  and the origin of religion  and in what it does to us and for us. Because I think that the greatest wonder in the world is not the Grand Canyon. The Grand Canyon is really simple. It's just a lot of rock  and then a lot of water and wind  and a lot of time  and you get the Grand Canyon. It's not that complicated. This is what's really complicated  that there were people living in places like the Grand Canyon  cooperating with each other  or on the savannahs of Africa  or on the frozen shores of Alaska  and then some of these villages grew into the mighty cities of Babylon  and Rome  and Tenochtitlan. How did this happen  This is an absolute miracle  much harder to explain than the Grand Canyon. The answer  I think  is that they used every tool in the toolbox. It took all of our moral psychology to create these cooperative groups. Yes  you do need to be concerned about harm  you do need a psychology of justice. But it really helps to organize a group if you can have sub groups  and if those sub groups have some internal structure  and if you have some ideology that tells people to suppress their carnality  to pursue higher  nobler ends. And now we get to the crux of the disagreement between liberals and conservatives. Because liberals reject three of these foundations. They say  No  let's celebrate diversity  not common in group membership.  They say   Let's question authority.  And they say   Keep your laws off my body.  Liberals have very noble motives for doing this. Traditional authority  traditional morality can be quite repressive  and restrictive to those at the bottom  to women  to people that don't fit in. So liberals speak for the weak and oppressed. They want change and justice  even at the risk of chaos. This guy's shirt says   Stop bitching  start a revolution.  If you're high in openness to experience  revolution is good  it's change  it's fun. Conservatives  on the other hand  speak for institutions and traditions. They want order  even at some cost to those at the bottom. The great conservative insight is that order is really hard to achieve. It's really precious  and it's really easy to lose. So as Edmund Burke said   The restraints on men  as well as their liberties  are to be reckoned among their rights.  This was after the chaos of the French Revolution. So once you see this    once you see that liberals and conservatives both have something to contribute  that they form a balance on change versus stability    then I think the way is open to step outside the moral matrix. This is the great insight that all the Asian religions have attained. Think about yin and yang. Yin and yang aren't enemies. Yin and yang don't hate each other. Yin and yang are both necessary  like night and day  for the functioning of the world. You find the same thing in Hinduism. There are many high gods in Hinduism. Two of them are Vishnu  the preserver  and Shiva  the destroyer. This image actually is both of those gods sharing the same body. You have the markings of Vishnu on the left  so we could think of Vishnu as the conservative god. You have the markings of Shiva on the right  Shiva's the liberal god. And they work together. You find the same thing in Buddhism. These two stanzas contain  I think  the deepest insights that have ever been attained into moral psychology. From the Zen master Seng ts'an   If you want the truth to stand clear before you  never be for or against. The struggle between for and against is the mind's worst disease.  Now unfortunately  it's a disease that has been caught by many of the world's leaders. But before you feel superior to George Bush  before you throw a stone  ask yourself  do you accept this  Do you accept stepping out of the battle of good and evil  Can you be not for or against anything  So  what's the point  What should you do  Well  if you take the greatest insights from ancient Asian philosophies and religions  and you combine them with the latest research on moral psychology  I think you come to these conclusions  that our righteous minds were designed by evolution to unite us into teams  to divide us against other teams and then to blind us to the truth. So what should you do  Am I telling you to not strive  Am I telling you to embrace Seng ts'an and stop  stop with this struggle of for and against  No  absolutely not. I'm not saying that. This is an amazing group of people who are doing so much  using so much of their talent  their brilliance  their energy  their money  to make the world a better place  to fight    to fight wrongs  to solve problems. But as we learned from Samantha Power  in her story about Sergio Vieira de Mello  you can't just go charging in  saying   You're wrong  and I'm right.  Because  as we just heard  everybody thinks they are right. A lot of the problems we have to solve are problems that require us to change other people. And if you want to change other people  a much better way to do it is to first understand who we are    understand our moral psychology  understand that we all think we're right    and then step out  even if it's just for a moment  step out    check in with Seng ts'an. Step out of the moral matrix  just try to see it as a struggle playing out  in which everybody does think they're right  and everybody  at least  has some reasons    even if you disagree with them    everybody has some reasons for what they're doing. Step out. And if you do that  that's the essential move to cultivate moral humility  to get yourself out of this self righteousness  which is the normal human condition. Think about the Dalai Lama. Think about the enormous moral authority of the Dalai Lama    and it comes from his moral humility. So I think the point    the point of my talk  and I think the point of TED    is that this is a group that is passionately engaged in the pursuit of changing the world for the better. People here are passionately engaged in trying to make the world a better place. But there is also a passionate commitment to the truth. And so I think that the answer is to use that passionate commitment to the truth to try to turn it into a better future for us all. Thank you. I think it'll be a relief to some people and a disappointment to others that I'm not going to talk about vaginas today. I began  The Vagina Monologues  because I was worried about vaginas. I'm very worried today about this notion  this world  this prevailing kind of force of security. I see this word  hear this word  feel this word everywhere. Real security  security checks  security watch  security clearance. Why has all this focus on security made me feel so much more insecure  What does anyone mean when they talk about real security  And why have we  as Americans particularly  become a nation that strives for security above all else  In fact  I think that security is elusive. It's impossible. We all die. We all get old. We all get sick. People leave us. People change us. Nothing is secure. And that's actually the good news. This is  of course  unless your whole life is about being secure. I think that when that is the focus of your life  these are the things that happen. You can't travel very far or venture too far outside a certain circle. You can't allow too many conflicting ideas into your mind at one time  as they might confuse you or challenge you. You can't open yourself to new experiences  new people  new ways of doing things    they might take you off course. You can't not know who you are  so you cling to hard matter identity. You become a Christian  Muslim  Jew. You're an Indian  Egyptian  Italian  American. You're a heterosexual or a homosexual  or you never have sex. Or at least  that's what you say when you identify yourself. You become part of an  us.  In order to be secure  you defend against  them.  You cling to your land because it is your secure place. You must fight anyone who encroaches upon it. You become your nation. You become your religion. You become whatever it is that will freeze you  numb you and protect you from doubt or change. But all this does  actually  is shut down your mind. In reality  it does not really make you safer. I was in Sri Lanka  for example  three days after the tsunami  and I was standing on the beaches and it was absolutely clear that  in a matter of five minutes  a    foot wave could rise up and desecrate a people  a population and lives. All this striving for security  in fact  has made you much more insecure because now you have to watch out all the time. There are people not like you    people who you now call enemies. You have places you cannot go  thoughts you cannot think  worlds that you can no longer inhabit. And so you spend your days fighting things off  defending your territory and becoming more entrenched in your fundamental thinking. Your days become devoted to protecting yourself. This becomes your mission. That is all you do. Ideas get shorter. They become sound bytes. There are evildoers and saints  criminals and victims. There are those who  if they're not with us  are against us. It gets easier to hurt people because you do not feel what's inside them. It gets easier to lock them up  force them to be naked  humiliate them  occupy them  invade them and kill them  because they are only obstacles now to your security. In six years  I've had the extraordinary privilege through V Day  a global movement against  violence against  women  to travel probably to    countries  and spend a great deal of time in different portions. I've met women and men all over this planet  who through various circumstances    war  poverty  racism  multiple forms of violence    have never known security  or have had their illusion of security forever devastated. I've spent time with women in Afghanistan under the Taliban  who were essentially brutalized and censored. I've been in Bosnian refugee camps. I was with women in Pakistan who have had their faces melted off with acid. I've been with girls all across America who were date raped  or raped by their best friends when they were drugged one night. One of the amazing things that I've discovered in my travels is that there is this emerging species. I loved when he was talking about this other world that's right next to this world. I've discovered these people  who  in V Day world  we call Vagina Warriors. These particular people  rather than getting AK   s  or weapons of mass destruction  or machetes  in the spirit of the warrior  have gone into the center  the heart of pain  of loss. They have grieved it  they have died into it  and allowed and encouraged poison to turn into medicine. They have used the fuel of their pain to begin to redirect that energy towards another mission and another trajectory. These warriors now devote themselves and their lives to making sure what happened to them doesn't happen to anyone else. There are thousands if not millions of them on the planet. I venture there are many in this room. They have a fierceness and a freedom that I believe is the bedrock of a new paradigm. They have broken out of the existing frame of victim and perpetrator. Their own personal security is not their end goal  and because of that  because  rather than worrying about security  because the transformation of suffering is their end goal  I actually believe they are creating real safety and a whole new idea of security. I want to talk about a few of these people that I've met. Tomorrow  I am going to Cairo  and I'm so moved that I will be with women in Cairo who are V Day women  who are opening the first safe house for battered women in the Middle East. That will happen because women in Cairo made a decision to stand up and put themselves on the line  and talk about the degree of violence that is happening in Egypt  and were willing to be attacked and criticized. And through their work over the last years  this is not only happening that this house is opening  but it's being supported by many factions of the society who never would have supported it. Women in Uganda this year  who put on  The Vagina Monologues  during V Day  actually evoked the wrath of the government. And  I love this story so much. There was a cabinet meeting and a meeting of the presidents to talk about whether  Vaginas  could come to Uganda. And in this meeting    it went on for weeks in the press  two weeks where there was huge discussion. The government finally made a decision that  The Vagina Monologues  could not be performed in Uganda. But the amazing news was that because they had stood up  these women  and because they had been willing to risk their security  it began a discussion that not only happened in Uganda  but all of Africa. As a result  this production  which had already sold out  every single person in that     seat audience  except for    people  made a decision to keep the money. They raised        dollars on a production that never occurred. There's a young woman named Carrie Rethlefsen in Minnesota. She's a high school student. She had seen  The Vagina Monologues  and she was really moved. And as a result  she wore an  I heart my vagina  button to her high school in Minnesota. She was basically threatened to be expelled from school. They told her she couldn't love her vagina in high school  that it was not a legal thing  that it was not a moral thing  that it was not a good thing. So she really struggled with this  what to do  because she was a senior and she was doing well in her school and she was threatened expulsion. So what she did is she got all her friends together    I believe it was          students all wore  I love my vagina  T shirts  and the boys wore  I love her vagina  T shirts to school. Now this seems like a fairly  you know  frivolous  but what happened as a result of that  is that that school now is forming a sex education class. It's beginning to talk about sex  it's beginning to look at why it would be wrong for a young high school girl to talk about her vagina publicly or to say that she loved her vagina publicly. I know I've talked about Agnes here before  but I want to give you an update on Agnes. I met Agnes three years ago in the Rift Valley. When she was a young girl  she had been mutilated against her will. That mutilation of her clitoris had actually obviously impacted her life and changed it in a way that was devastating. She made a decision not to go and get a razor or a glass shard  but to devote her life to stopping that happening to other girls. For eight years  she walked through the Rift Valley. She had this amazing box that she carried and it had a torso of a woman's body in it  a half a torso  and she would teach people  everywhere she went  what a healthy vagina looked like and what a mutilated vagina looked like. In the years that she walked  she educated parents  mothers  fathers. She saved       girls from being cut. When V Day met her  we asked her how we could support her and she said   Well  if you got me a Jeep  I could get around a lot faster.  So  we bought her a Jeep. In the year she had the Jeep  she saved       girls from being cut. So  we said  what else could we do  She said   If you help me get money  I could open a house.  Three years ago  Agnes opened a safe house in Africa to stop mutilation. When she began her mission eight years ago  she was reviled  she was detested  she was completely slandered in her community. I am proud to tell you that six months ago  she was elected the deputy mayor of Narok. I think what I'm trying to say here is that if your end goal is security  and if that's all you're focusing on  what ends up happening is that you create not only more insecurity in other people  but you make yourself far more insecure. Real security is contemplating death  not pretending it doesn't exist. Not running from loss  but entering grief  surrendering to sorrow. Real security is not knowing something  when you don't know it. Real security is hungering for connection rather than power. It cannot be bought or arranged or made with bombs. It is deeper  it is a process  it is acute awareness that we are all utterly inter bended  and one action by one being in one tiny town has consequences everywhere. Real security is not only being able to tolerate mystery  complexity  ambiguity  but hungering for them and only trusting a situation when they are present. Something happened when I began traveling in V Day  eight years ago. I got lost. I remember being on a plane going from Kenya to South Africa  and I had no idea where I was. I didn't know where I was going  where I'd come from  and I panicked. I had a total anxiety attack. And then I suddenly realized that it absolutely didn't matter where I was going  or where I had come from because we are all essentially permanently displaced people. All of us are refugees. We come from somewhere and we are hopefully traveling all the time  moving towards a new place. Freedom means I may not be identified as any one group  but that I can visit and find myself in every group. It does not mean that I don't have values or beliefs  but it does mean I am not hardened around them. I do not use them as weapons. In the shared future  it will be just that  shared. The end goal will  be  becoming vulnerable  realizing the place of our connection to one another  rather than becoming secure  in control and alone. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  And how are you doing  Are you exhausted  On a typical day  do you wake up with hope or gloom  Eve Ensler  You know  I think Carl Jung once said that in order to survive the twentieth century  we have to live with two existing thoughts  opposite thoughts  at the same time. And I think part of what I'm learning in this process is that one must allow oneself to feel grief. And I think as long as I keep grieving  and weeping  and then moving on  I'm fine. When I start to pretend that what I'm seeing isn't impacting me  and isn't changing my heart  then I get in trouble. Because when you spend a lot of time going from place to place  country to country  and city to city  the degree to which women  for example  are violated  and the epidemic of it  and the kind of ordinariness of it  is so devastating to one's soul that you have to take the time  or I have to take the time now  to process that. CA  There are a lot of causes out there in the world that have been talked about  you know  poverty  sickness and so on. You spent eight years on this one. Why this one  EE  I think that if you think about women  women are the primary resource of the planet. They give birth  we come from them  they are mothers  they are visionaries  they are the future. If you think that the U.N. now says that one out of three women on the planet will be raped or beaten in their lifetime  we're talking about the desecration of the primary resource of the planet  we're talking about the place where we come from  we're talking about parenting. Imagine that you've been raped and you're bringing up a boy child. How does it impact your ability to work  or envision a future  or thrive  as opposed to just survive  What I believe is if we could figure out how to make women safe and honor women  it would be parallel or equal to honoring life itself. Good morning. My name is David Rose. I am a serial entrepreneur turned serial investor. And by the use of pitching PowerPoints to VCs  I have personally raised tens of millions of dollars from VCs through PowerPoint pitches. And then  turning round to the other side of the equation  I have personally supervised the investment of tens of millions of dollars into companies who have been pitching me with PowerPoint presentations. So I think it's safe to say I know a little bit about the process of pitching. So  the very first question that you've all got to figure out is  what is the single most important thing that a VC is looking for when you come to them pitching your new business idea  And there are obviously all kinds of things. There are business models  and there are financials  and there are markets and there is that. Overall  of all the things that you have to do  what is the single most important thing the VC is going to be investing in  Somebody  What  David S. Rose  People  You  That's it    you are the person. And so therefore  the entire purpose of a VC pitch is to convince them that you are the entrepreneur in whom they are going to invest their money and make a lot of money in return. Now  how do you do this  You can't just walk up and say  you know   Hi  I'm a really good guy  and a good girl  and you should really invest in me.  Right  So  in the course of your VC pitch  you have a very few minutes  and most VC pitches    most angel pitches are about    minutes  most VC pitches should be less than half an hour. People's attention span after    minutes begins to drop off  tests have shown. So in that    minutes  or    minutes  or five minutes  you have to convey a whole bunch of different characteristics. You actually have to convey about    different characteristics while you're standing up there. What's the single most important thing you've got to convey  What  DSR  Boy  oh boy  oh boy  And that's a straight line we got right over there. And I didn't even prompt him. You're right  integrity. Because that's the key thing. I would much rather invest in somebody    you know  take a chance on somebody    who I know is straight than somebody where there's any possible question of  you know  who are they looking out for  and what's going on. So the most important thing is integrity. And what's the second most important thing after integrity  Let's see if you can get this one. DSR  Close enough  Passion. Right  so here you want    entrepreneurs by definition are people who are leaving something else  starting a new world over here  creating and putting their lifeblood into this kind of thing. You've got to convey passion. If you're not passionate about your own company  why on Earth should anyone else be passionate  Why should they put more money into your company  if you're not passionate about it  So  integrity and passion  the single most important things out there. Then there are a whole panoply of other things that you've got to do  to wrap up in this package that you're presenting to a VC. Experience. You've got to be able to say   Hey  you know  I've done this before.  And  done this before  is starting an enterprise and creating value  and taking something from beginning to end. So that's why VCs love to fund serial entrepreneurs. Because even if you didn't do it right the first time  you've learned the lessons  which are going to stand you in very good stead the next time. And now along with that  along with the experience of starting an enterprise  or running something    and it doesn't have to be a business. It can be in an organization at school  it can be a not for profit. But they want experience in creating an organization. Next up is knowledge. If you're telling me you're going to be the great developer of the map of the human genome  you'd better know what a human genome is. I mean  I want you to have domain expertise. So I don't want somebody who's saying   Hey  I've got a great idea in a business I know nothing about. I don't know who the players are. I don't know what the market is like.  So you've got to know your market. You've got to know your area. And then you have to have the skills that it takes to get a company going. And those skills include everything from technical skills  if it's a technology business  to marketing  and sales  and management  and so on. But  you know  not everybody has all these skills. There are very few people who have the full set of skills that it takes to run a company. So what else do you require  Well  leadership. You've got to be able to convince us that you either have developed a team that has all those factors in it  or else you can. And you have the charisma and the management style and the ability to get people to follow your lead  to inspire them  to motivate them to be part of your team. All right  then  having done all that  what else do I want to know as a VC  I want to know that you have commitment. That you are going to be here to the end. I want you to say  or I want you to convey  that you are going to die if you have to  with your very last breath  with your fingernails scratching as they drag you out. You're going to keep my money alive and you're going to make more money out of it. So I don't want somebody who's going to cut and run at the first opportunity. Because bad things happen. There's never been an angel  or a venture funded company where bad things didn't happen. So I want to know that you're committed to be there to the very end. You've got to have vision. You've got to be able to see where this is going. I don't want another  me too  product. I want somebody who knows  who can change the world out there. But on top of that  I also need realism. Because I need to know that you know that while changing the world is great  it doesn't always happen. And before you get to change the world  bad things are going to take place. And you've got to be able to deal with that. And you have to have rational projections and stuff. And then finally  you're asking for my money  not just because it's my money  but because it's me. You need to be coachable. So I need to know that you have the ability to listen. We've had a lot of experience. People who are VCs or angels investing in you have had experience and they'd like to know that you want to hear that experience. Okay  so how do you convey all these    things in    minutes without saying any more  You can't say   Hey  I've got high integrity  invest in me   Right  You've got to do a whole pitch that conveys this without conveying it. So think about your pitch as a timeline. It starts off  you walk in the door. They know nothing at all  whatsoever  about you. And you can take them on an emotional    all pitches  or all sales presentations  are emotional at some level. You can go up  you can go down  right  And it goes from beginning to end. You walk in the door. So the first thing you've got to do    the overall  you know  arc of your presentation    it's got to start like a rocket. You've got maybe    seconds    between    and    seconds  depending on how long the pitch is    to get their attention. In my case   I've invested. I have got tens of millions of dollars from PowerPoint pitches. I have invested tens of millions of dollars.  That's it    that should get you right there. This can be a factor  and everybody can be saying it's counterintuitive. It can be a story  it can be experience. But you've got to grab their emotional attention  focused on you  within that first few seconds. And then from there  you've got to take them on a very solid  steady  upward path  right from beginning to end. And everything has got to be reinforcing this. And you've got to get better  and better  and better  and better. And it's revving up to the very end  and then at the very end you've got to    boom     knock them out of the park. You want to be able to get them to such an emotional high that they are ready to write you a check  throw money at you  right there before you leave. Okay  so how do you do that  Well  first of all  logical progression. Any time you go backwards  any time you skip a step    imagine walking up a staircase where some of the treads are missing  or the heights are different heights. You stop  you've got to figure it out. You want a nice logical progression. Start with telling them what the market is. Why are you going to do X  Y or Z. And then you've got to tell me how you're going to do it  and what it is you're going to do. How you're going to do it. And the whole    it's got to flow from beginning to end. You've also got to let me know that there are touchstones. You want to tie in to the rest of the world out there. So  for example  if you reference companies I've heard of  or basic items in your business  I want to know about them. Things that I can relate to  validators  or anything that tells me somebody else has approved this  or there's outside validation. It can be sales  it can be you've got an award for something  it can be  people have done it before  it can be your beta tests are going great. Whatever. I want to know validation  that you're telling me not just what you're telling me  but that somebody else    or something else out there    says this makes sense. And then  because I'm looking for the upside here  I've got to have believable upside. And that's two parts. It's got to be upside  and it's got to be believable. The upside means that if you're telling me that you're going to be out there  five years out  making a million dollars a year    hmm. That's not really upside. Telling me you're going to be out there making a billion dollars a year    that's not believable. So it's got to be both sides. On the other hand  there are a lot of things that drive me down  take the emotional level down  and you've got to recover from those. And those  for example  are anything you tell me that I know is not true.  We have no competition. There's nobody else who's ever made a widget like this.  Odds are I probably know somebody who has made a widget. And the minute you tell me that    boom  You know  I discount half of what you're saying from then on. Anything that makes me think. Anything that I don't understand  where I have to make the leap myself  in my own head  is going to stop the flow of the presentation. So  you've got to take me through like a sixth grader    dub  dub  dub  dub  dub    but without patronizing me. And it's a very tricky path to do it. But if you can do it  it works really  really well. Anything that's inconsistent within the concept of your thing. If you tell me sales of X  Y or Z are    million dollars  and the next slide  or five slides later  they're five million dollars. Well  one may have been gross sales  one may have been net sales  but I want to know that all the numbers make sense together. And then finally  anything that's an error  or a typo  or a stupid mistake  or a line that's in the wrong place. That shows me that    if you can't even do a presentation  how the heck can you run a company  So this all feeds in together. All right  so the best way to do this stuff is to look at our betters  look at people who have done this before. So let's look at the most successful technology executive in the business and see how a presentation goes. Bill Gates' PowerPoint presentation over here. Here's Gates doing a thing for Windows. Is this the way you should do a PowerPoint presentation  What do you think  No. Who do you think we should look at as our role model  Oh  isn't that funny  There's another great one over here. Yes  OK  Steve Jobs. You want absolute    this is the Zen of presentation  right  Here he is. One little guy  black jeans and stuff  on a totally empty stage. What are you focusing on  You're focusing on him  This is Steve Jobs. So  you know  our great    these wonderful long bullet points  a whole list of things  you know    good  No  they're not. The long bullet points are bad. What's good  Short  short bullet points. But you know what  Even better than short bullet points are no bullet points. Just give me the headline over here. And you know what  How many bullet points or headlines does Steve Jobs use  Basically none. What do you do  Best of all  images. Just a simple image. I looked at the image    a picture's worth a thousand words. You look at the image and you see that  and you drop the whole thing. And then  you come back to me. And you're focused on me and why I'm such a great guy  and why you want to invest in me. And why this whole thing makes sense. So with that said  we only have a very  very short time. So let's run through the things you've got to include in your presentation. Well  first of all  start out. None of these big  long titled slides with blah  blah  blah  blah  blah  blah and I'm presenting to so and so  such and such a date. I know the day  I know who I am  I know you're presenting. I don't need all that. Just give me your company logo. I look at the logo  and it sort of ties it to my brain. And then I come back to you. I'm focused on you  OK  You do that  you give me your quick    second or    second intro  grab my attention. And then you want to give me a quick business overview. This is not a five minute pitch. This is  you know  two sentences.  We build widgets for the X  Y  Z market.  Or   We sell services to help somebody do X.  You know  whatever. And that is like the picture on the outside of a jigsaw puzzle box. That lets me know the context. It gives me the armature for the whole thing you're going to be going through. And it lets me put everything else in relation to something you've already told me. So there you go    walk me through  show me who your management team is. It's helpful that you've had experience and you've done this kind of thing before. And I want to know the market    the size of the market. Why is this market worth getting at over here  I want to know your product  and that's very important. Now  this is not a product pitch  not a sales pitch. I don't want to know all the ins and outs  and the gazuntas and the yaddas and stuff. I just want to know    what the heck is it  If it's a website  show me a screenshot of your website. You know  don't do a live demo. No  never do a live demo. Do a canned demo  or do something that lets me know why people are going to buy whatever it is. Then I want to know    now that I know what you're selling  tell me how you make money on it. For every X you sell  you get Y  you do your services of Z. I want to know what the business model is on a sort of per unit basis  or for the actual product that you're selling. I want to know who you're selling this thing to  in terms of customers. And I want to know if you have any relationships that are going to be special to help you. Whether you have a distribution relationship with somebody  you know  you have a producing partner. Or  you know  again  validation. This helps to say you're bigger than just one little thing over here. But then  everybody has competition. There has never been a company that doesn't have competition. Even if the competition is the old way of doing something. I want to know exactly what your competition is  and then that will help me judge how you fit into the whole operation over here. But then  I want to know how you're special. If I know what your competition does  how are you going to prevent your competition from eating your lunch over here  And then all this ties into the financial overview. And you have to have    you can't do a VC pitch without giving me your financials. I want to know three and  you know  a year or two back  or as long as you've been in existence. And I want to know three or four or five years forward. Five is a bit much. Probably four is rational. And I want to know how that business model that you showed me on a product basis is going to translate into a company model. And  you know  how many widgets are you going to sell  You're making X amount per widget. I want to know what the driver is. We're going to have       customers this year  and        next year. And our revenues are going to go this  that and the other thing. And so that gives me the whole picture for the next several years into which I'm investing. And I want to know how the money you're going to get from me is going to help you get there. You're going to open an offshore plant in China  you're going to spend it all on sales and marketing  you're going to go to Tahiti  or whatever out there. But then comes the ask. This is where you tell me how much you actually want to get. You're looking for   million    at what kind of valuation  Two million at        . What's the money in so far  Who invested  I hope you invested personally. Because I'm following on. If you can't invest in your own thing  why should I invest in it  So I like to know if you have friends and family  or angel investors in there  or you've had more VCs before. What's the capital structure up until this point  And then finally  having done all that  you've now told me the whole thing  so now you've got to bring it back to that conclusion. This is that rocket going up. So hopefully everything has been positive  positive  positive  more positive. And everything  everything you say clicks with me  and it all makes sense. And I'm thinking   This is really  really great.  And then you take me back to your logo. Just your logo on the screen. And I look at the logo    okay  good. Now I come back to you. Nothing else to look at  right  And now  you've got to wrap it up and tie it up here. You've got to give me the final  you know    boom     the final pitch that's going to send me into space. Now  in the process of doing this over here  how do you remember the sequences and doers  You've noticed here that I'm not looking at the screen  right  The screen is  actually  in this room  is set up so it's in front of me. So  I couldn't even see if I wanted to. So now  how do I know what's going on here  Well  I've got a laptop in front of me  but you're looking at me. And you're looking at this. What do you think I'm looking at  You think that I'm looking at that  No  I'm looking actually at a special version of PowerPoint over here  which shows me the slides ahead  the slides behind  my notes from here  so I can see what's going on. PowerPoint has this built into every copy of PowerPoint that's shipped. If you use Apple's Keynote  it's got an even better version in Keynote. And then there's another program  called Ovation  you can get from Adobe  that they just bought last summer. Which actually helps you run the whole timers  and it lets you figure out what's going on. So  here's my wrap up to take you to the moon  right  David's    I usually do a top     we don't have time for top   s. So David's top five presentation tips. Number one  always use presenter mode  or Ovation  or presenter tools  because it lets you know exactly where you're going. It helps you pace yourself  it gives you a timer so we end on time and the whole bit. Number four  always use remote control. Have you seen me touch the computer  No  you haven't. Why not  Because I'm using remote control over here. Always use remote control. Number three  the handouts you give are not your presentation. If you follow my suggestions  you're going to have a very spare  very Zen like presentation  which is great for conveying who you are and getting people emotionally involved. But it's not really good as a handout. You want to have a handout that gives a lot more information  because the handout has to stand without you over here. Number three  don't read your speech. Can you imagine   Well  you should invest in my company because it's really good.  It doesn't work  right  Don't read your speech. And the number one presentation tip  never  ever look at the screen. You're making a connection with your audience over here  and you always want to do a one on one connection. The screen should come up visually behind you  and supplement what you're doing instead of replace you. And that is how to pitch to a VC. If you ask people about what part of psychology do they think is hard  and you say   Well  what about thinking and emotions   Most people will say   Emotions are terribly hard. They're incredibly complex. They can't    I have no idea of how they work. But thinking is really very straightforward  it's just sort of some kind of logical reasoning  or something. But that's not the hard part.  So here's a list of problems that come up. One nice problem is  what do we do about health  The other day  I was reading something  and the person said probably the largest single cause of disease is handshaking in the West. And there was a little study about people who don't handshake  and comparing them with ones who do handshake. And I haven't the foggiest idea of where you find the ones that don't handshake  because they must be hiding. And the people who avoid that have    percent less infectious disease or something. Or maybe it was    and a quarter percent. So if you really want to solve the problem of epidemics and so forth  let's start with that. And since I got that idea  I've had to shake hundreds of hands. And I think the only way to avoid it is to have some horrible visible disease  and then you don't have to explain. Education  how do we improve education  Well  the single best way is to get them to understand that what they're being told is a whole lot of nonsense. And then  of course  you have to do something about how to moderate that  so that anybody can    so they'll listen to you. Pollution  energy shortage  environmental diversity  poverty. How do we make stable societies  Longevity. Okay  there're lots of problems to worry about. Anyway  the question I think people should talk about    and it's absolutely taboo    is  how many people should there be  And I think it should be about     million or maybe     million. And then notice that a great many of these problems disappear. If you had     million people properly spread out  then if there's some garbage  you throw it away  preferably where you can't see it  and it will rot. Or you throw it into the ocean and some fish will benefit from it. The problem is  how many people should there be  And it's a sort of choice we have to make. Most people are about    inches high or more  and there's these cube laws. So if you make them this big  by using nanotechnology  I suppose       then you could have a thousand times as many. That would solve the problem  but I don't see anybody doing any research on making people smaller. Now  it's nice to reduce the population  but a lot of people want to have children. And there's one solution that's probably only a few years off. You know you have    chromosomes. If you're lucky  you've got    from each parent. Sometimes you get an extra one or drop one out  but    so you can skip the grandparent and great grandparent stage and go right to the great great grandparent. And you have    people and you give them a scanner  or whatever you need  and they look at their chromosomes and each of them says which one he likes best  or she    no reason to have just two sexes any more  even. So each child has    parents  and I suppose you could let each group of    parents have    children. Wouldn't that be enough  And then the children would get plenty of support  and nurturing  and mentoring  and the world population would decline very rapidly and everybody would be totally happy. Timesharing is a little further off in the future. And there's this great novel that Arthur Clarke wrote twice  called  Against the Fall of Night  and  The City and the Stars.  They're both wonderful and largely the same  except that computers happened in between. And Arthur was looking at this old book  and he said   Well  that was wrong. The future must have some computers.  So in the second version of it  there are     billion or       billion people on Earth  but they're all stored on hard disks or floppies  or whatever they have in the future. And you let a few million of them out at a time. A person comes out  they live for a thousand years doing whatever they do  and then  when it's time to go back for a billion years    or a million  I forget  the numbers don't matter    but there really aren't very many people on Earth at a time. And you get to think about yourself and your memories  and before you go back into suspension  you edit your memories and you change your personality and so forth. The plot of the book is that there's not enough diversity  so that the people who designed the city make sure that every now and then an entirely new person is created. And in the novel  a particular one named Alvin is created. And he says  maybe this isn't the best way  and wrecks the whole system. I don't think the solutions that I proposed are good enough or smart enough. I think the big problem is that we're not smart enough to understand which of the problems we're facing are good enough. Therefore  we have to build super intelligent machines like HAL. As you remember  at some point in the book for         HAL realizes that the universe is too big  and grand  and profound for those really stupid astronauts. If you contrast HAL's behavior with the triviality of the people on the spaceship  you can see what's written between the lines. Well  what are we going to do about that  We could get smarter. I think that we're pretty smart  as compared to chimpanzees  but we're not smart enough to deal with the colossal problems that we face  either in abstract mathematics or in figuring out economies  or balancing the world around. So one thing we can do is live longer. And nobody knows how hard that is  but we'll probably find out in a few years. You see  there's two forks in the road. We know that people live twice as long as chimpanzees almost  and nobody lives more than     years  for reasons that aren't very well understood. But lots of people now live to    or      unless they shake hands too much or something like that. And so maybe if we lived     years  we could accumulate enough skills and knowledge to solve some problems. So that's one way of going about it. And as I said  we don't know how hard that is. It might be    after all  most other mammals live half as long as the chimpanzee  so we're sort of three and a half or four times  have four times the longevity of most mammals. And in the case of the primates  we have almost the same genes. We only differ from chimpanzees  in the present state of knowledge  which is absolute hogwash  maybe by just a few hundred genes. What I think is that the gene counters don't know what they're doing yet. And whatever you do  don't read anything about genetics that's published within your lifetime  or something. The stuff has a very short half life  same with brain science. And so it might be that if we just fix four or five genes  we can live     years. Or it might be that it's just    or     and I doubt that it's several hundred. So this is something that people will be discussing and lots of ethicists    you know  an ethicist is somebody who sees something wrong with whatever you have in mind. And it's very hard to find an ethicist who considers any change worth making  because he says  what about the consequences  And  of course  we're not responsible for the consequences of what we're doing now  are we  Like all this complaint about clones. And yet two random people will mate and have this child  and both of them have some pretty rotten genes  and the child is likely to come out to be average. Which  by chimpanzee standards  is very good indeed. If we do have longevity  then we'll have to face the population growth problem anyway. Because if people live     or       years  then we can't let them have a child more than about once every     or       years. And so there won't be any workforce. And one of the things Laurie Garrett pointed out  and others have  is that a society that doesn't have people of working age is in real trouble. And things are going to get worse  because there's nobody to educate the children or to feed the old. And when I'm talking about a long lifetime  of course  I don't want somebody who's     years old to be like our image of what a     year old is    which is dead  actually. You know  there's about     different parts of the brain which seem to have different functions. Nobody knows how most of them work in detail  but we do know that there're lots of different things in there. And they don't always work together. I like Freud's theory that most of them are cancelling each other out. And so if you think of yourself as a sort of city with a hundred resources  then  when you're afraid  for example  you may discard your long range goals  but you may think deeply and focus on exactly how to achieve that particular goal. You throw everything else away. You become a monomaniac    all you care about is not stepping out on that platform. And when you're hungry  food becomes more attractive  and so forth. So I see emotions as highly evolved subsets of your capability. Emotion is not something added to thought. An emotional state is what you get when you remove     or     of your normally available resources. So thinking of emotions as the opposite of    as something less than thinking is immensely productive. And I hope  in the next few years  to show that this will lead to smart machines. And I guess I better skip all the rest of this  which are some details on how we might make those smart machines and       and the main idea is in fact that the core of a really smart machine is one that recognizes that a certain kind of problem is facing you. This is a problem of such and such a type  and therefore there's a certain way or ways of thinking that are good for that problem. So I think the future  main problem of psychology is to classify types of predicaments  types of situations  types of obstacles and also to classify available and possible ways to think and pair them up. So you see  it's almost like a Pavlovian    we lost the first hundred years of psychology by really trivial theories  where you say  how do people learn how to react to a situation  What I'm saying is  after we go through a lot of levels  including designing a huge  messy system with thousands of ports  we'll end up again with the central problem of psychology. Saying  not what are the situations  but what are the kinds of problems and what are the kinds of strategies  how do you learn them  how do you connect them up  how does a really creative person invent a new way of thinking out of the available resources and so forth. So  I think in the next    years  if we can get rid of all of the traditional approaches to artificial intelligence  like neural nets and genetic algorithms and rule based systems  and just turn our sights a little bit higher to say  can we make a system that can use all those things for the right kind of problem  Some problems are good for neural nets  we know that others  neural nets are hopeless on them. Genetic algorithms are great for certain things  I suspect I know what they're bad at  and I won't tell you. Thank you. Philosophers  dramatists  theologians have grappled with this question for centuries  what makes people go wrong  Interestingly  I asked this question when I was a little kid. I grew up in the South Bronx  inner city ghetto in New York  and I was surrounded by evil  as all kids are who grew up in an inner city. And I had friends who were really good kids  who lived out the Dr. Jekyll Mr. Hyde scenario    Robert Louis Stevenson. That is  they took drugs  got in trouble  went to jail. Some got killed  and some did it without drug assistance. So when I read Robert Louis Stevenson  that wasn't fiction. The only question is  what was in the juice  And more importantly  that line between good and evil    which privileged people like to think is fixed and impermeable  with them on the good side  the others on the bad side    I knew that line was movable  and it was permeable. Good people could be seduced across that line  and under good and some rare circumstances  bad kids could recover with help  with reform  with rehabilitation. So I want to begin with this wonderful illusion by  Dutch  artist M.C. Escher. If you look at it and focus on the white  what you see is a world full of angels. But let's look more deeply  and as we do  what appears is the demons  the devils in the world. That tells us several things. One  the world is  was  will always be filled with good and evil  because good and evil is the yin and yang of the human condition. It tells me something else. If you remember  God's favorite angel was Lucifer. Apparently  Lucifer means  the light.  It also means  the morning star   in some scripture. And apparently  he disobeyed God  and that's the ultimate disobedience to authority. And when he did  Michael  the archangel  was sent to kick him out of heaven along with the other fallen angels. And so Lucifer descends into hell  becomes Satan  becomes the devil  and the force of evil in the universe begins. Paradoxically  it was God who created hell as a place to store evil. He didn't do a good job of keeping it there though. So  this arc of the cosmic transformation of God's favorite angel into the Devil  for me  sets the context for understanding human beings who are transformed from good  ordinary people into perpetrators of evil. So the Lucifer effect  although it focuses on the negatives    the negatives that people can become  not the negatives that people are    leads me to a psychological definition. Evil is the exercise of power. And that's the key  it's about power. To intentionally harm people psychologically  to hurt people physically  to destroy people mortally  or ideas  and to commit crimes against humanity. If you Google  evil   a word that should surely have withered by now  you come up with     million hits in a third of a second. A few years ago    I am sure all of you were shocked  as I was  with the revelation of American soldiers abusing prisoners in a strange place in a controversial war  Abu Ghraib in Iraq. And these were men and women who were putting prisoners through unbelievable humiliation. I was shocked  but I wasn't surprised  because I had seen those same visual parallels when I was the prison superintendent of the Stanford Prison Study. Immediately the Bush administration military said what  What all administrations say when there's a scandal   Don't blame us. It's not the system. It's the few bad apples  the few rogue soldiers.  My hypothesis is  American soldiers are good  usually. Maybe it was the barrel that was bad. But how am I going to deal with that hypothesis  I became an expert witness for one of the guards  Sergeant Chip Frederick  and in that position  I had access to the dozen investigative reports. I had access to him. I could study him  have him come to my home  get to know him  do psychological analysis to see  was he a good apple or bad apple. And thirdly  I had access to all of the       pictures that these soldiers took. These pictures are of a violent or sexual nature. All of them come from the cameras of American soldiers. Because everybody has a digital camera or cell phone camera  they took pictures of everything  more than      . And what I've done is I organized them into various categories. But these are by United States military police  army reservists. They are not soldiers prepared for this mission at all. And it all happened in a single place  Tier   A  on the night shift. Why  Tier   A was the center for military intelligence. It was the interrogation hold. The CIA was there. Interrogators from Titan Corporation  all there  and they're getting no information about the insurgency. So they're going to put pressure on these soldiers  military police  to cross the line  give them permission to break the will of the enemy  to prepare them for interrogation  to soften them up  to take the gloves off. Those are the euphemisms  and this is how it was interpreted. Let's go down to that dungeon.  Abu Ghraib Iraq Prison Abuses      Military Police Guards' Photos   The following images include nudity and graphic depictions of violence  So  pretty horrific. That's one of the visual illustrations of evil. And it should not have escaped you that the reason I paired the prisoner with his arms out with Leonardo da Vinci's ode to humanity is that that prisoner was mentally ill. That prisoner covered himself with shit every day  they had to roll him in dirt so he wouldn't stink. But the guards ended up calling him  Shit Boy.  What was he doing in that prison rather than in some mental institution  In any event  here's former Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld. He comes down and says   I want to know  who is responsible  Who are the bad apples   Well  that's a bad question. You have to reframe it and ask   What is responsible    What  could be the who of people  but it could also be the what of the situation  and obviously that's wrongheaded. How do psychologists try to understand such transformations of human character  if you believe that they were good soldiers before they went down to that dungeon  There are three ways. The main way is called dispositional. We look at what's inside of the person  the bad apples. This is the foundation of all of social science  the foundation of religion  the foundation of war. Social psychologists like me come along and say   Yeah  people are the actors on the stage  but you'll have to be aware of the situation. Who are the cast of characters  What's the costume  Is there a stage director   And so we're interested in what are the external factors around the individual    the bad barrel  Social scientists stop there and they miss the big point that I discovered when I became an expert witness for Abu Ghraib. The power is in the system. The system creates the situation that corrupts the individuals  and the system is the legal  political  economic  cultural background. And this is where the power is of the bad barrel makers. If you want to change a person  change the situation. And to change it  you've got to know where the power is  in the system. So the Lucifer effect involves understanding human character transformations with these three factors. And it's a dynamic interplay. What do the people bring into the situation  What does the situation bring out of them  And what is the system that creates and maintains that situation  My recent book   The Lucifer Effect   is about  how do you understand how good people turn evil  And it has a lot of detail about what I'm going to talk about today. So Dr. Z's  Lucifer Effect   although it focuses on evil  really is a celebration of the human mind's infinite capacity to make any of us kind or cruel  caring or indifferent  creative or destructive  and it makes some of us villains. And the good news that I'm going to hopefully come to at the end is that it makes some of us heroes. This wonderful cartoon in the New Yorker summarizes my whole talk   I'm neither a good cop nor a bad cop  Jerome. Like yourself  I'm a complex amalgam of positive and negative personality traits that emerge or not  depending on the circumstances.  There's a study some of you think you know about  but very few people have ever read the story. You watched the movie. This is Stanley Milgram  little Jewish kid from the Bronx  and he asked the question   Could the Holocaust happen here  now   People say   No  that's Nazi Germany  Hitler  you know  that's     .  He said   Yeah  but suppose Hitler asked you  'Would you electrocute a stranger ' 'No way  I'm a good person.'  He said   Why don't we put you in a situation and give you a chance to see what you would do   And so what he did was he tested       ordinary people.     New Haven  Connecticut      Bridgeport. And the ad said   Psychologists want to understand memory. We want to improve people's memory  because it is the key to success.  OK   We're going to give you five bucks    four dollars for your time. We don't want college students. We want men between    and   .  In the later studies  they ran women. Ordinary people  barbers  clerks  white collar people. So  you go down  one of you will be a learner  one will be a teacher. The learner's a genial  middle aged guy. He gets tied up to the shock apparatus in another room. The learner could be middle aged  could be as young as   . And one of you is told by the authority  the guy in the lab coat   Your job as teacher is to give him material to learn. Gets it right  reward. Gets it wrong  you press a button on the shock box. The first button is    volts. He doesn't even feel it.  That's the key. All evil starts with    volts. And then the next step is another    volts. The problem is  at the end of the line  it's     volts. And as you go along  the guy is screaming   I've got a heart condition  I'm out of here   You're a good person. You complain.  Sir  who will be responsible if something happens to him   The experimenter says   Don't worry  I will be responsible. Continue  teacher.  And the question is  who would go all the way to     volts  You should notice here  when it gets up to      it says   Danger. Severe Shock.  When it gets up to here  there's  XXX     the pornography of power. So Milgram asks    psychiatrists   What percent of American citizens would go to the end   They said only one percent. Because that's sadistic behavior  and we know  psychiatry knows  only one percent of Americans are sadistic. OK. Here's the data. They could not be more wrong. Two thirds go all the way to     volts. This was just one study. Milgram did more than    studies. And look at this. In study     where you see somebody like you go all the way     percent go all the way. In study five  if you see people rebel     percent rebel. What about women  Study       no different than men. So Milgram is quantifying evil as the willingness of people to blindly obey authority  to go all the way to     volts. And it's like a dial on human nature. A dial in a sense that you can make almost everybody totally obedient  down to the majority  down to none. What are the external parallels  For all research is artificial. What's the validity in the real world      American citizens committed suicide or were murdered by family and friends in Guyana jungle in       because they were blindly obedient to this guy  their pastor    not their priest    their pastor  Reverend Jim Jones. He persuaded them to commit mass suicide. And so  he's the modern Lucifer effect  a man of God who becomes the Angel of Death. Milgram's study is all about individual authority to control people. Most of the time  we are in institutions  so the Stanford Prison Study is a study of the power of institutions to influence individual behavior. Interestingly  Stanley Milgram and I were in the same high school class in James Monroe in the Bronx      . I did this study with my graduate students  especially Craig Haney    and it also began work with an ad. We had a cheap  little ad  but we wanted college students for a study of prison life.    people volunteered  took personality tests. We did interviews. Picked two dozen  the most normal  the most healthy. Randomly assigned them to be prisoner and guard. So on day one  we knew we had good apples. I'm going to put them in a bad situation. And secondly  we know there's no difference between the boys who will be guards and those who will be prisoners. To the prisoners  we said   Wait at home. The study will begin Sunday.  We didn't tell them that the city police were going to come and do realistic arrests.  Day    Student  A police car pulls up in front  and a cop comes to the front door  and knocks  and says he's looking for me. So they  right there  you know  they took me out the door  they put my hands against the car. It was a real cop car  it was a real policeman  and there were real neighbors in the street  who didn't know that this was an experiment. And there was cameras all around and neighbors all around. They put me in the car  then they drove me around Palo Alto. They took me to the basement of the police station. Then they put me in a cell. I was the first one to be picked up  so they put me in a cell  which was just like a room with a door with bars on it. You could tell it wasn't a real jail. They locked me in there  in this degrading little outfit. They were taking this experiment too seriously. Here are the prisoners  who are going to be dehumanized  they'll become numbers. Here are the guards with the symbols of power and anonymity. Guards get prisoners to clean the toilet bowls out with their bare hands  to do other humiliating tasks. They strip them naked. They sexually taunt them. They begin to do degrading activities  like having them simulate sodomy. You saw simulating fellatio in soldiers in Abu Ghraib. My guards did it in five days. The stress reaction was so extreme that normal kids we picked because they were healthy had breakdowns within    hours. The study ended after six days  because it was out of control. Five kids had emotional breakdowns. Does it make a difference if warriors go to battle changing their appearance or not  If they're anonymous  how do they treat their victims  In some cultures  they go to war without changing their appearance. In others  they paint themselves like  Lord of the Flies.  In some  they wear masks. In many  soldiers are anonymous in uniform. So this anthropologist  John Watson  found    cultures that had two bits of data. Do they change their appearance    . Do they kill  torture  mutilate    . If they don't change their appearance  only one of eight kills  tortures or mutilates. The key is in the red zone. If they change their appearance     of       that's    percent    kill  torture  mutilate. And that's the power of anonymity. So what are the seven social processes that grease the slippery slope of evil  Mindlessly taking the first small step. Dehumanization of others. De individuation of self. Diffusion of personal responsibility. Blind obedience to authority. Uncritical conformity to group norms. Passive tolerance of evil through inaction  or indifference. And it happens when you're in a new or unfamiliar situation. Your habitual response patterns don't work. Your personality and morality are disengaged.  Nothing is easier than to denounce the evildoer  nothing more difficult than understanding him   Dostoyevsky. Understanding is not excusing. Psychology is not excuse ology. So social and psychological research reveals how ordinary  good people can be transformed without the drugs. You don't need it. You just need the social psychological processes. Real world parallels  Compare this with this. James Schlesinger    I'm going to end with this    says   Psychologists have attempted to understand how and why individuals and groups who usually act humanely can sometimes act otherwise in certain circumstances.  That's the Lucifer effect. And he goes on to say   The landmark Stanford study provides a cautionary tale for all military operations.  If you give people power without oversight  it's a prescription for abuse. They knew that  and let that happen. So another report  an investigative report by General Fay  says the system is guilty. In this report  he says it was the environment that created Abu Ghraib  by leadership failures that contributed to the occurrence of such abuse  and because it remained undiscovered by higher authorities for a long period of time. Those abuses went on for three months. Who was watching the store  The answer is nobody  I think on purpose. He gave the guards permission to do those things  and they knew nobody was ever going to come down to that dungeon. So you need a paradigm shift in all of these areas. The shift is away from the medical model that focuses only on the individual. The shift is toward a public health model that recognizes situational and systemic vectors of disease. Bullying is a disease. Prejudice is a disease. Violence is a disease. Since the Inquisition  we've been dealing with problems at the individual level. It doesn't work. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn says   The line between good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being.  That means that line is not out there. That's a decision that you have to make  a personal thing. So I want to end very quickly on a positive note. Heroism as the antidote to evil  by promoting the heroic imagination  especially in our kids  in our educational system. We want kids to think   I'm a hero in waiting  waiting for the right situation to come along  and I will act heroically. My whole life  I'm now going to focus away from evil    that I've been in since I was a kid    to understanding heroes. Banality of heroism. It's ordinary people who do heroic deeds. It's the counterpoint to Hannah Arendt's  Banality of Evil.  Our traditional societal heroes are wrong  because they are the exceptions. They organize their life around this. That's why we know their names. Our kids' heroes are also wrong models for them  because they have supernatural talents. We want our kids to realize most heroes are everyday people  and the heroic act is unusual. This is Joe Darby. He was the one that stopped those abuses you saw  because when he saw those images  he turned them over to a senior investigating officer. He was a low level private  and that stopped it. Was he a hero  No. They had to put him in hiding  because people wanted to kill him  and then his mother and his wife. For three years  they were in hiding. This is the woman who stopped the Stanford Prison Study. When I said it got out of control  I was the prison superintendent. I didn't know it was out of control. I was totally indifferent. She saw that madhouse and said   You know what  it's terrible what you're doing to those boys. They're not prisoners nor guards  they're boys  and you are responsible.  And I ended the study the next day. The good news is I married her the next year. I just came to my senses  obviously. So situations have the power to do  three things . But the point is  this is the same situation that can inflame the hostile imagination in some of us  that makes us perpetrators of evil  can inspire the heroic imagination in others. It's the same situation and you're on one side or the other. Most people are guilty of the evil of inaction  because your mother said   Don't get involved. Mind your own business.  And you have to say   Mama  humanity is my business.  So the psychology of heroism is    we're going to end in a moment    how do we encourage children in new hero courses  that I'm working on with Matt Langdon    he has a hero workshop    to develop this heroic imagination  this self labeling   I am a hero in waiting   and teach them skills. To be a hero  you have to learn to be a deviant  because you're always going against the conformity of the group. Heroes are ordinary people whose social actions are extraordinary. Who act. The key to heroism is two things. You have to act when other people are passive. B  You have to act socio centrically  not egocentrically. And I want to end with a known story about Wesley Autrey  New York subway hero. Fifty year old African American construction worker standing on a subway. A white guy falls on the tracks. The subway train is coming. There's    people there. You know what  They freeze. He's got a reason not to get involved. He's black  the guy's white  and he's got two kids. Instead  he gives his kids to a stranger  jumps on the tracks  puts the guy between the tracks  lays on him  the subway goes over him. Wesley and the guy       and a half inches height. The train clearance is    inches. A half an inch would have taken his head off. And he said   I did what anyone could do   no big deal to jump on the tracks. And the moral imperative is  I did what everyone should do.  And so one day  you will be in a new situation. Take path one  you're going to be a perpetrator of evil. Evil  meaning you're going to be Arthur Andersen. You're going to cheat  or you're going to allow bullying. Path two  you become guilty of the evil of passive inaction. Path three  you become a hero. The point is  are we ready to take the path to celebrating ordinary heroes  waiting for the right situation to come along to put heroic imagination into action  Because it may only happen once in your life  and when you pass it by  you'll always know  I could have been a hero and I let it pass me by. So the point is thinking it and then doing it. So I want to thank you. Thank you. Let's oppose the power of evil systems at home and abroad  and let's focus on the positive. Advocate for respect of personal dignity  for justice and peace  which sadly our administration has not been doing. Thanks so much. Hi. I'm here to talk to you about the importance of praise  admiration and thank you  and having it be specific and genuine. And the way I got interested in this was  I noticed in myself  when I was growing up  and until about a few years ago  that I would want to say thank you to someone  I would want to praise them  I would want to take in their praise of me and I'd just stop it. And I asked myself  why  I felt shy  I felt embarrassed. And then my question became  am I the only one who does this  So  I decided to investigate. I'm fortunate enough to work in the rehab facility  so I get to see people who are facing life and death with addiction. And sometimes it comes down to something as simple as  their core wound is their father died without ever saying he's proud of them. But then  they hear from all the family and friends that the father told everybody else that he was proud of him  but he never told the son. It's because he didn't know that his son needed to hear it. So my question is  why don't we ask for the things that we need  I know a gentleman  married for    years  who's longing to hear his wife say   Thank you for being the breadwinner  so I can stay home with the kids   but won't ask. I know a woman who's good at this. She  once a week  meets with her husband and says   I'd really like you to thank me for all these things I did in the house and with the kids.  And he goes   Oh  this is great  this is great.  And praise really does have to be genuine  but she takes responsibility for that. And a friend of mine  April  who I've had since kindergarten  she thanks her children for doing their chores. And she said   Why wouldn't I thank it  even though they're supposed to do it   So  the question is  why was I blocking it  Why were other people blocking it  Why can I say   I'll take my steak medium rare  I need size six shoes   but I won't say   Would you praise me this way   And it's because I'm giving you critical data about me. I'm telling you where I'm insecure. I'm telling you where I need your help. And I'm treating you  my inner circle  like you're the enemy. Because what can you do with that data  You could neglect me. You could abuse it. Or you could actually meet my need. And I took my bike into the bike store   I love this    same bike  and they'd do something called  truing  the wheels. The guy said   You know  when you true the wheels  it's going to make the bike so much better.  I get the same bike back  and they've taken all the little warps out of those same wheels I've had for two and a half years  and my bike is like new. So  I'm going to challenge all of you. I want you to true your wheels  be honest about the praise that you need to hear. What do you need to hear  Go home to your wife    go ask her  what does she need  Go home to your husband    what does he need  Go home and ask those questions  and then help the people around you. And it's simple. And why should we care about this  We talk about world peace. How can we have world peace with different cultures  different languages  I think it starts household by household  under the same roof. So  let's make it right in our own backyard. And I want to thank all of you in the audience for being great husbands  great mothers  friends  daughters  sons. And maybe somebody's never said that to you  but you've done a really  really good job. And thank you for being here  just showing up and changing the world with your ideas. Thank you. I'm a  or was  or kind of am a toy designer. And before I was a toy designer  oh  I was a mime  a street mime  actually. And then I was an entertainer  I guess. And before that  I was a silversmith  and before that  I was    I was out of the house at about    and a half  and I never wound up going into college. I didn't really    I didn't see the point at the time. I do now  after learning about all the quantum stuff. It's really cool. Anyway  I wanted to show you a little bit about the world of toy design  at least from my small aperture of the world. This is a video I made when I first started doing toy design. I'm in my garage  making weird stuff. And then you go to these toy companies and there's some guy across the table  and he goes   Pass. Pass. Pass.  You know  you think it's so cool  but they    anyway  I made this little tape that I'd always show when I go in. This is the name of my company  Giving Toys. So I used to work at Mattel  actually. And after I left Mattel  I started all these hamburger makers  and then got the license to make the maker. So this is a hamburger maker that you take the peanut butter and stuff and you put it in there  and it makes    and this is a French fry maker  little  tiny food you can eat. I beat up the pasta maker to make that. Then this is a McNugget maker  I think. This  now that's the McNugget maker  and this is a    this is my oldest daughter making a McApple Pie. And let's see  you can make the pie and cinnamon and sugar  and then you eat  and you eat  and you eat  and you    she's about     pounds now. No  she's not  she's beautiful. This is how they looked when they came out at the end. These are a    this is like a    million dollar line. And it got me through some    I didn't make any royalties on this  but it got me through. Next is a compilation of a bunch of stuff. That was a missile foam launcher that didn't get sold. This is a squishy head  for no apparent reason. This is some effects that I did for  Wig  Rattle and Roll.  That was a robot eye thing controlling it in the back. That paid the rent for about a month. This is a walking Barbie    I said   Oh  this is it   And they go   Oh  that's really nice   and out it goes. So this is some fighting robots. I thought everyone would want these. They fight  they get back up  you know  Wouldn't this be cool  And they made it into a toy  and then they dropped it like a hot rock. They're pretty cool. This is a   we're doing some flight testing on my little pug  seeing if this can really grab. It does pretty good. I'm using little phone connectors to make them so they can spin. It's how they  see  have those album things    kids don't know what they are. This is a clay maker. You know  I said    I went to Play Doh  and said   Look  I can animate this.  They said   Don't talk to us about Play Doh.  And then  I made a Lego animator. I thought  this would be so great  And you know  Lego    don't take Legos to Lego. That's the answer. They know everything about it. Then I started doing animatronics. I loved dinosaurs. I used to be in the film business  kind of  and actually  Nicholas Negroponte saw this when I was  like      and anyway  so then they said   No  you have to make two and they have to fight.  You know  how    why would a kid want a dinosaur  This is me using  unclear  or   D Studio  back in the '  s. That's David Letterman. You can see how old this stuff is. That's my youngest cousin. This is a segment called   Dangerous Toys You Won't See at Christmas.  We had my first saw blade launcher and we had a flamethrower chair. My career basically peaked here. And in the back are foam core cutouts of the people who couldn't make it to the show. This is MEK going through a windshield wiper motor. So this is a    I used to kind of be an actor. And I'm really not very good at it. But the    this is a guy named Dr. Yatz  who would take toys apart and show kids about engineering. And you can see the massively parallel processing Nintendos there. And over to the left is a view master of the CD ROM. And a guy named Stan Reznikov did this as a pilot. This is a    you can see the little window there. You can actually see the Steadicam with a bubble on the bottom. You see the keyboard strapped to my wrist. Way ahead of my time here. Narrator  I love toys  Caleb Chung  That's all I wanted to say there. I love toys. OK  so  so that was a  that was the first kind of a    that was the first batch of products. Most of them did not go. You get one out of     one out of    products. And every now and then  we do something like a  you know  an automated hair wrap machine  you know  that tangles your hair and pulls your scalp out  and    and we'd make some money on that  you know. And we'd give it out. But eventually  we left L.A.  and we moved to Idaho  where there was actually a lot of peace and quiet. And I started working on this project    oh  I have to tell you about this real quick. Throughout this whole thing  making toys  I think there is a real correlation with innovation and art and science. There's some kind of a blend that happens that allows  you know  to find innovation. And I tried to sum this up in some kind of symbol that means something  to me anyway. And so  art and science have a kind of dynamic balance  that's where I think innovation happens. And actually  this is  to me  how I can come up with great ideas. But it's not how you actually get leverage. Actually  you have to put a circle around that  and call it business. And those three together  I think  give you leverage in the world. But moving on. So  this is a quick tale I'm going to tell. This is the Furby tale. As he said  I was co inventor of the Furby. I did the body and creature    well  you'll see. So by way of showing you this  you can kind of get an understanding of what it is to  hopefully  try to create robotic life forms  or technology that has an emotional connection with the user. So this is my family. This is my wife  Christi  and Abby  and Melissa  and my    year old now  Emily  who was just a pack of trouble. All right  there's that robot again. I came out of the movie business  as I said  and I said  let's make these animatronic robots. Let's make these things. And so I've always had a big interest in this. This one actually didn't go anywhere  but I got my feet wet doing this. This is a smaller one  and I have a little moving torso on there. A little  tiny guy walks along. More servo drives  lots of servo hacking  lots of mechanical stuff. There's another one. He actually has skeletor legs  I think  he's wearing there. Oh  this is a little pony  little pony    very cute little thing. The point of showing these is I've always been interested in little artificial life pieces. So the challenge was    I worked for Microsoft for a little bit  working on the Microsoft Barney. And this is a    you know  the purple dinosaur with kind of bloat wear. And  you know  they had lots  just lots of stuff in there that you didn't need  I thought. And then Microsoft can just fill a  you know  a warehouse full of this stuff and see if they sell. So it's a really strange business model compared to coming from a toy company. But anyway  a friend of mine and I  Dave Hampton  decided to see if we could do like a single cell organism. What's the fewest pieces we could use to make a little life form  And that's our little  thirty cent Mabuchi motor. And so  I have all these design books  like I'm sure many of you have. And throughout the books    this is the first page on Furby    I have kind of the art and science. I have the why over here  and the how over there. I try to do a lot of philosophy  a lot of thinking about all of these projects. Because they're not just  bing  ideas  you have to really dig deep in these things. So there's some real pseudo code over here  and getting the idea of different kind of drives  things like that. And originally  Furby only had two eyes and some batteries on the bottom. And then we said  well  you're going to feed him  and he needs to talk  and it got more complicated. And then I had to figure out how I'm going to use that one motor to make the eyes move  and the ears move  and the body to move  and the mouth to move. And  you know  I want to make it blink and do all that at the same time. Well  I came up with this kind of linear expression thing with these cams and feedback. And that worked pretty well. Then I started to get a little more realistic and I have to start drawing the stuff. And there's my  note to self  at the top   lots of engineering.  So that turned out to be a little more than true. There's my first exploded view and all the little pieces and the little worm drive and all that stuff. And then I've got to start building it  so this is the real thing. I get up and start cutting my finger and gluing things together. And that's my little workshop. And there's the first little cam that drove Furby. And there's Furby on the half shell. You can see the little BB in the box is my tilt sensor. I just basically gnawed all this stuff out of plastic. So there's the back of his head with a billion holes in it. And there I am. I'm done. There's my little Furby. No  it's a little robot on heroin or something  I think. So right now  you see  I love little robots. So my wife says   Well  you may like it  but nobody else will.  So she comes to the rescue. This is my wife Christi  who is just  you know  my muse and my partner for eternity here. And she does drawings  right  She's an actual  you know  artist. And she starts doing all these different drawings and does color patterns and coloring books. And I like the guy with the cigar at the bottom there. He didn't test so well  but I like him. And then she started doing these other images. At that time  Beanie Babies was a big hit  and we thought  we'll do a bunch of different ones. So here's a little pink one  a little pouf on his head. And here's    this didn't do so well in testing either  I don't know why. There's my favorite  Demon Furby. That was a good one. Anyway  finally settled on kind of this kind of a look  little poufy body  a little imaginary character. And there he is  a little bush baby on    caught in the headlights there. I actually went to Toys R Us  got a little furry cat  ripped it apart and made this. And since then  every time I come home from Toys R Us with dolls or something  they disappear from my desk and they get hidden in the house. I have three girls and they just  they    it's like a rescue animal thing they're going there. So  a little tether coming off  it's just a control for the Fur's mouth and his eyes. It's just a little server control and I made a little video going   Hi  my name's Furby  and I'm good   you know  and then I'd reach my hand. He'd    you can tickle him. When I put my hand up   Ha  ha  ha  ha  and that's how we sold him. And Hasbro actually said  I meant Tiger Electronics at the time  said   Yeah  we want to do this. We have  you know     weeks or something to Toy Fair  and we're going to hire you guys to do this.  And so Dave and I got working. Mostly me  because it was all mechanics at this point. So now I have to really figure out all kinds of stuff I don't know how to do. And I started working with Solid Works and a whole other group to do that. And we started    this was way back before there was really much SLA going on  not a lot of rapid prototyping. We certainly didn't have the money to do this. They only paid me  like  a little bit of money to do this  so I had to call a friend of a friend who was running the GM prototype plant  SLA plant  that was down. And they said   Yeah  well  we'll run them.  So they ran all the shells for us  which was nice of them. And the cams I got cut at Hewlett Packard. We snuck in on the weekend. And so we just had a disc of the files. But they have a closed system  so you couldn't print the things out on the machine. So we actually printed them out on clear and taped them on the monitors. And on the weekend we ran the parts for that. So this is how they come out close to the end. And then they looked like little Garfields there. Eight months later    you may remember this  this was a    total  total  total chaos. For a while  they were making two million Furbys a month. They actually wound up doing about    million Furbys. I    it's unbelievable how    I don't know how that can be. And Hasbro made about  you know  a billion and a half dollars. And I just a little bit on each one. So full circle    why do I do this  Why do you  you know  try to do this stuff  And it's  of course  for your kids. And there's my youngest daughter with her Furbys. And she still actually has those. So I kind of retired  and we're already living in paradise up in Boise  on a river  you know. So and then I started another company called Toy Innovation and we did some projects with Mattel with actually with a lady who's here  Ivy Ross  and we did Miracle Moves Baby  made it in Wired magazine  did a bunch of other stuff. And then I started another company. We did a little hand held device for teens that could hook up to the Internet  won  Best Innovations  at CES  but really I kind of slowed down and said  OK  I just ... After a while  I had this old tape of this dinosaur  and I gave it to this guy  and this other guy saw it  and then people started to want to do it. And they said they'd spend all this time. So I said   OK  let's try to do this dinosaur project.  The crazy idea is we're going to try to clone a dinosaur as much as we can with today's technology. And it's not really    but as close as we can do. And we're going to try to really pull this off  intentfully try to make something that seems like it's alive. Not a robot that kind of does  but let's really go for it. So I picked a Camarasaurus  because the Camarasaurus was the most abundant of the sauropods in North America. And you could actually find full fossil evidence of these. That's a juvenile. And so we actually went in. There's a book called  Walking on Eggshells   where they found actual sauropod skin in Patagonia. And the picture from the book  so when I    I told the sculptor to use this bump pattern  whatever you can to copy that. Very  very obsessive. There's a kind of truncated Camarasaurus skeleton  but the geometry's correct. And then I went in  and measured all the geometry because I figured  hey  biomimicry. If I do it kind of right  it might move kind of like the real thing. So there's the motor. And about this time  you know  all these other people are starting to help. Here's an example of what we did with the skull. There's the skull  there's my drawing of a skull. There's kind of the skin version of the soft tissue. There's the mechanism that would go in there  kind of a Geneva drive. There's some Solid Works versions of it. Here's some SLA parts of the same thing. And then  these are really crude pieces. We were just doing some tests here. There's the skull  pretty much the same shape as the Camarasaurus. There's a photorealistic eye behind a lens. And there's kind of the first exploded view  or see through view. There's the first SLA version  and it already kind of has the feel  it has kind of a cuteness already. And the thing about blending science and art in this multidisciplinary stuff is you can do a robot  and then you go back and do the shape  and then you go back and forth. The servos in the front legs  we had to shape those like muscles. They had to fit within the envelope. There was a tremendous amount of work to get all that working right. All the neck and the tail are cable  so it moves smoothly and organically. And then  of course  you're not done yet. You have to get the look for the skin. The skin's a whole another thing  probably the hardest part. So you hire artists  and you try to get the look and feel of the character. Now  this is not    we're character designers  right  And we're still trying to keep with the real character. So  now you go back and you cover the whole thing with clay. Now you start doing the sculpture for this. And you can see we got a guy from    who's just a fanatic about dinosaurs to do the sculpting for us  down to the spoon shaped teeth and everything. And then more sculpting  and then more sculpting  and then more sculpting  and then more sculpting. And then  four years and    million dollars later  we have a little Pleo. John  do you want to bring him up  John Sosoka is our CTO  and is really the man that's done most of the work with our    person company. I'd like to give John a hand. He never gets recognition. This is John Sosoka. So  thank you  John  thank you  and get back to work  all right  man  All right       no  it's very painful  so       these are little Pleos and you can probably see them. This    I on purpose    they go through life stages. So when you first get them  they're babies. And you    more you have them  kind of the older they get  and they kind of learn through their behavior. So this one  this one's actually asleep  and    hang on. Pleo  wake up. Pleo  come on. So this guy's listening to my voice here. But they have    sensors all over their body. They have seven processors  they have    motors  they have    but you don't care  do you  They're just cute  right  That's the idea  that's the idea. So you see    hey  come on. Hey  did you feel that  There's something big and loud over here. Hey. That's good  wake up  wake up  wake up. Yeah  they're like kids  you know. You  yeah  yeah. Okay  he's hungry. I'll show you what he's been doing for  for four years. Here  here  here. Have some money  Pleo. There you go. That's what the investors think  that it's just       right  right. So they're really sweet little guys. And we're hoping that    you know  our belief is that humans need to feel empathy towards things in order to be more human. And we think we can help that out by having little creatures that you can love. Now these are not robots  they're kind of lovebots  you know. They do change over time. But mostly they evoke a feeling of caring. And we have a    I have a little something here. Now I do want to say that  you know  Ugobe is not there yet. We've just opened the door  and it's for all of you to step through it. We did include some things that are hopefully useful. Excuse me  Pleo. They    he has a USB and he has a SD card  so it's completely open architecture. So anyone can plug him     Applause     thank you. This is John over here. Anyone can take Pleo and they can totally redo his personality. You can make him bipolar  or as someone said  a    you can change his homeostatic drives  or whatever you want to call them. Kids can just drag and drop  put in new sounds. We    actually  it's very hard to keep people from doing this. We have one animator who's taken it and he's done a take on the Budweiser beer commercial  and they're going   Whassup   you know  You    so it's    yes  he likes that. So they're a handful. We hope you get one. I don't know what I'm missing to say  but as a last thing  I'd like to say is that if we continue along this path  we are designing our children's best friends. And there's a lot of social responsibility in that. That's why Pleo's soft and gentle and loving. And so I just    I hope we all dream well. Thank you. A year ago  I spoke to you about a book that I was just in the process of completing  that has come out in the interim  and I would like to talk to you today about some of the controversies that that book inspired. The book is called  The Blank Slate   based on the popular idea that the human mind is a blank slate  and that all of its structure comes from socialization  culture  parenting  experience. The  blank slate  was an influential idea in the   th century. Here are a few quotes indicating that   Man has no nature   from the historian Jose Ortega y Gasset   Man has no instincts   from the anthropologist Ashley Montagu   The human brain is capable of a full range of behaviors and predisposed to none   from the late scientist Stephen Jay Gould. There are a number of reasons to doubt that the human mind is a blank slate  and some of them just come from common sense. As many people have told me over the years  anyone who's had more than one child knows that kids come into the world with certain temperaments and talents  it doesn't all come from the outside. Oh  and anyone who has both a child and a house pet has surely noticed that the child  exposed to speech  will acquire a human language  whereas the house pet won't  presumably because of some innate different between them. And anyone who's ever been in a heterosexual relationship knows that the minds of men and the minds of women are not indistinguishable. There are also  I think  increasing results from the scientific study of humans that  indeed  we're not born blank slates. One of them  from anthropology  is the study of human universals. If you've ever taken anthropology  you know that it's a    kind of an occupational pleasure of anthropologists to show how exotic other cultures can be  and that there are places out there where  supposedly  everything is the opposite to the way it is here. But if you instead look at what is common to the world's cultures  you find that there is an enormously rich set of behaviors and emotions and ways of construing the world that can be found in all of the world's       odd cultures. The anthropologist Donald Brown has tried to list them all  and they range from aesthetics  affection and age statuses all the way down to weaning  weapons  weather  attempts to control  the color white and a worldview. Also  genetics and neuroscience are increasingly showing that the brain is intricately structured. This is a recent study by the neurobiologist Paul Thompson and his colleagues in which they    using MRI    measured the distribution of gray matter    that is  the outer layer of the cortex    in a large sample of pairs of people. They coded correlations in the thickness of gray matter in different parts of the brain using a false color scheme  in which no difference is coded as purple  and any color other than purple indicates a statistically significant correlation. Well  this is what happens when you pair people up at random. By definition  two people picked at random can't have correlations in the distribution of gray matter in the cortex. This is what happens in people who share half of their DNA    fraternal twins. And as you can see  large amounts of the brain are not purple  showing that if one person has a thicker bit of cortex in that region  so does his fraternal twin. And here's what happens if you get a pair of people who share all their DNA    namely  clones or identical twins. And you can see huge areas of cortex where there are massive correlations in the distribution of gray matter. Now  these aren't just differences in anatomy  like the shape of your ear lobes  but they have consequences in thought and behavior that are well illustrated in this famous cartoon by Charles Addams   Separated at birth  the Mallifert twins meet accidentally.  As you can see  there are two inventors with identical contraptions in their lap  meeting in the waiting room of a patent attorney. Now  the cartoon is not such an exaggeration  because studies of identical twins who were separated at birth and then tested in adulthood show that they have astonishing similarities. And this happens in every pair of identical twins separated at birth ever studied    but much less so with fraternal twins separated at birth. My favorite example is a pair of twins  one of whom was brought up as a Catholic in a Nazi family in Germany  the other brought up in a Jewish family in Trinidad. When they walked into the lab in Minnesota  they were wearing identical navy blue shirts with epaulettes  both of them liked to dip buttered toast in coffee  both of them kept rubber bands around their wrists  both of them flushed the toilet before using it as well as after  and both of them liked to surprise people by sneezing in crowded elevators to watch them jump. Now    the story might seem to good to be true  but when you administer batteries of psychological tests  you get the same results    namely  identical twins separated at birth show quite astonishing similarities. Now  given both the common sense and scientific data calling the doctrine of the blank slate into question  why should it have been such an appealing notion  Well  there are a number of political reasons why people have found it congenial. The foremost is that if we're blank slates  then  by definition  we are equal  because zero equals zero equals zero. But if something is written on the slate  then some people could have more of it than others  and according to this line of thinking  that would justify discrimination and inequality. Another political fear of human nature is that if we are blank slates  we can perfect mankind    the age old dream of the perfectibility of our species through social engineering. Whereas  if we're born with certain instincts  then perhaps some of them might condemn us to selfishness  prejudice and violence. Well  in the book  I argue that these are  in fact  non sequiturs. And just to make a long story short  first of all  the concept of fairness is not the same as the concept of sameness. And so when Thomas Jefferson wrote in the Declaration of Independence   We hold these truths to be self evident  that all men are created equal   he did not mean  We hold these truths to be self evident  that all men are clones.  Rather  that all men are equal in terms of their rights  and that every person ought to be treated as an individual  and not prejudged by the statistics of particular groups that they may belong to. Also  even if we were born with certain ignoble motives  they don't automatically lead to ignoble behavior. That is because the human mind is a complex system with many parts  and some of them can inhibit others. For example  there's excellent reason to believe that virtually all humans are born with a moral sense  and that we have cognitive abilities that allow us to profit from the lessons of history. So even if people did have impulses towards selfishness or greed  that's not the only thing in the skull  and there are other parts of the mind that can counteract them. In the book  I go over controversies such as this one  and a number of other hot buttons  hot zones  Chernobyls  third rails  and so on    including the arts  cloning  crime  free will  education  evolution  gender differences  God  homosexuality  infanticide  inequality  Marxism  morality  Nazism  parenting  politics  race  rape  religion  resource depletion  social engineering  technological risk and war. And needless to say  there were certain risks in taking on these subjects. When I wrote a first draft of the book  I circulated it to a number of colleagues for comments  and here are some of the reactions that I got   Better get a security camera for your house.   Don't expect to get any more awards  job offers or positions in scholarly societies.   Tell your publisher not to list your hometown in your author bio.   Do you have tenure   Well  the book came out in October  and nothing terrible has happened. I    I like    There was indeed reason to be nervous  and there were moments in which I did feel nervous  knowing the history of what has happened to people who've taken controversial stands or discovered disquieting findings in the behavioral sciences. There are many cases  some of which I talk about in the book  of people who have been slandered  called Nazis  physically assaulted  threatened with criminal prosecution for stumbling across or arguing about controversial findings. And you never know when you're going to come across one of these booby traps. My favorite example is a pair of psychologists who did research on left handers  and published some data showing that left handers are  on average  more susceptible to disease  more prone to accidents and have a shorter lifespan. It's not clear  by the way  since then  whether that is an accurate generalization  but the data at the time seemed to support that. Well  pretty soon they were barraged with enraged letters  death threats  ban on the topic in a number of scientific journals  coming from irate left handers and their advocates  and they were literally afraid to open their mail because of the venom and vituperation that they had inadvertently inspired. Well  the night is young  but the book has been out for half a year  and nothing terrible has happened. None of the dire professional consequences has taken place    I haven't been exiled from the city of Cambridge. But what I wanted to talk about are two of these hot buttons that have aroused the strongest response in the    odd reviews that The Blank Slate has received. I'll just put that list up for a few seconds  and see if you can guess which two    I would estimate that probably two of these topics inspired probably    percent of the reaction in the various reviews and radio interviews. It's not violence and war  it's not race  it's not gender  it's not Marxism  it's not Nazism. They are  the arts and parenting. So let me tell you what aroused such irate responses  and I'll let you decide if whether they    the claims are really that outrageous. Let me start with the arts. I note that among the long list of human universals that I presented a few slides ago are art. There is no society ever discovered in the remotest corner of the world that has not had something that we would consider the arts. Visual arts    decoration of surfaces and bodies    appears to be a human universal. The telling of stories  music  dance  poetry    found in all cultures  and many of the motifs and themes that give us pleasure in the arts can be found in all human societies  a preference for symmetrical forms  the use of repetition and variation  even things as specific as the fact that in poetry all over the world  you have lines that are very close to three seconds long  separated by pauses. Now  on the other hand  in the second half of the   th century  the arts are frequently said to be in decline. And I have a collection  probably    or    headlines  from highbrow magazines deploring the fact that the arts are in decline in our time. I'll give you a couple of representative quotes   We can assert with some confidence that our own period is one of decline  that the standards of culture are lower than they were    years ago  and that the evidences of this decline are visible in every department of human activity.  That's a quote from T. S. Eliot  a little more than    years ago. And a more recent one   The possibility of sustaining high culture in our time is becoming increasing problematical. Serious book stores are losing their franchise  nonprofit theaters are surviving primarily by commercializing their repertory  symphony orchestras are diluting their programs  public television is increasing its dependence on reruns of British sitcoms  classical radio stations are dwindling  museums are resorting to blockbuster shows  dance is dying.  That's from Robert Brustein  the famous drama critic and director  in The New Republic about five years ago. Well  in fact  the arts are not in decline. I don't think this will as a surprise to anyone in this room  but by any standard they have never been flourishing to a greater extent. There are  of course  entirely new art forms and new media  many of which you've heard over these few days. By any economic standard  the demand for art of all forms is skyrocketing  as you can tell from the price of opera tickets  by the number of books sold  by the number of books published  the number of musical titles released  the number of new albums and so on. The only grain of truth to this complaint that the arts are in decline come from three spheres. One of them is in elite art since the     s    say  the kinds of works performed by major symphony orchestras  where most of the repertory is before       or the works shown in major galleries and prestigious museums. In literary criticism and analysis  probably    or    years ago  literary critics were a kind of cultural hero  now they're kind of a national joke. And the humanities and arts programs in the universities  which by many measures  indeed are in decline. Students are staying away in droves  universities are disinvesting in the arts and humanities. Well  here's a diagnosis. They didn't ask me  but by their own admission  they need all the help that they can get. And I would like to suggest that it's not a coincidence that this supposed decline in the elite arts and criticism occurred in the same point in history in which there was a widespread denial of human nature. A famous quotation can be found    if you look on the web  you can find it in literally scores of English core syllabuses     In or about December       human nature changed.  A paraphrase of a quote by Virginia Woolf  and there's some debate as to what she actually meant by that. But it's very clear  looking at these syllabuses  that    it's used now as a way of saying that all forms of appreciation of art that were in place for centuries  or millennia  in the   th century were discarded. The beauty and pleasure in art    probably a human universal    were    began to be considered saccharine  or kitsch  or commercial. Barnett Newman had a famous quote that  the impulse of modern art is the desire to destroy beauty     which was considered bourgeois or tacky. And here's just one example. I mean  this is perhaps a representative example of the visual depiction of the female form in the   th century  here is a representative example of the depiction of the female form in the   th century. And  as you can see  there    something has changed in the way the elite arts appeal to the senses. Indeed  in movements of modernism and post modernism  there was visual art without beauty  literature without narrative and plot  poetry without meter and rhyme  architecture and planning without ornament  human scale  green space and natural light  music without melody and rhythm  and criticism without clarity  attention to aesthetics and insight into the human condition. Let me give just you an example to back up that last statement. But here  there    one of the most famous literary English scholars of our time is the Berkeley professor  Judith Butler. And here is an example of one of her analyses   The move from a structuralist account in which capital is understood to structure social relations in relatively homologous ways to a view of hegemony in which power relations are subject to repetition  convergence and rearticulation brought the question of temporality into the thinking of structure  and marked a shift from the form of Althusserian theory that takes structural totalities as theoretical objects ...  Well  you get the idea. By the way  this is one sentence    you can actually parse it. Well  the argument in  The Blank Slate  was that elite art and criticism in the   th century  although not the arts in general  have disdained beauty  pleasure  clarity  insight and style. People are staying away from elite art and criticism. What a puzzle    I wonder why. Well  this turned out to be probably the most controversial claim in the book. Someone asked me whether I stuck it in in order to deflect ire from discussions of gender and Nazism and race and so on. I won't comment on that. But it certainly inspired an energetic reaction from many university professors. Well  the other hot button is parenting. And the starting point is the    for that discussion was the fact that we have all been subject to the advice of the parenting industrial complex. Now  here is    here is a representative quote from a besieged mother   I'm overwhelmed with parenting advice. I'm supposed to do lots of physical activity with my kids so I can instill in them a physical fitness habit so they'll grow up to be healthy adults. And I'm supposed to do all kinds of intellectual play so they'll grow up smart. And there are all kinds of play    clay for finger dexterity  word games for reading success  large motor play  small motor play. I feel like I could devote my life to figuring out what to play with my kids.  I think anyone who's recently been a parent can sympathize with this mother. Well  here's some sobering facts about parenting. Most studies of parenting on which this advice is based are useless. They're useless because they don't control for heritability. They measure some correlation between what the parents do  how the children turn out and assume a causal relation  that the parenting shaped the child. Parents who talk a lot to their kids have kids who grow up to be articulate  parents who spank their kids have kids who grow up to be violent and so on. And very few of them control for the possibility that parents pass on genes for    that increase the chances a child will be articulate or violent and so on. Until the studies are redone with adoptive children  who provide an environment but not genes to their kids  we have no way of knowing whether these conclusions are valid. The genetically controlled studies have some sobering results. Remember the Mallifert twins  separated at birth  then they meet in the patent office    remarkably similar. Well  what would have happened if the Mallifert twins had grown up together  You might think  well  then they'd be even more similar  because not only would they share their genes  but they would also share their environment. That would make them super similar  right  Wrong. Identical twins  or any siblings  who are separated at birth are no less similar than if they had grown up together. Everything that happens to you in a given home over all of those years appears to leave no permanent stamp on your personality or intellect. A complementary finding  from a completely different methodology  is that adopted siblings reared together    the mirror image of identical twins reared apart  they share their parents  their home  their neighborhood  don't share their genes    end up not similar at all. OK    two different bodies of research with a similar finding. What it suggests is that children are shaped not by their parents over the long run  but in part    only in part    by their genes  in part by their culture    the culture of the country at large and the children's own culture  namely their peer group    as we heard from Jill Sobule earlier today  that's what kids care about    and  to a very large extent  larger than most people are prepared to acknowledge  by chance  chance events in the wiring of the brain in utero  chance events as you live your life. So let me conclude with just a remark to bring it back to the theme of choices. I think that the sciences of human nature    behavioral genetics  evolutionary psychology  neuroscience  cognitive science    are going to  increasingly in the years to come  upset various dogmas  careers and deeply held political belief systems. And that presents us with a choice. The choice is whether certain facts about humans  or topics  are to be considered taboos  forbidden knowledge  where we shouldn't go there because no good can come from it  or whether we should explore them honestly. I have my own answer to that question  which comes from a great artist of the   th century  Anton Chekhov  who said   Man will become better when you show him what he is like.  And I think that the argument can't be put any more eloquently than that. Thank you very much. What I want to tell you about today is how I see robots invading our lives at multiple levels  over multiple timescales. And when I look out in the future  I can't imagine a world      years from now  where we don't have robots everywhere. Assuming    despite all the dire predictions from many people about our future    assuming we're still around  I can't imagine the world not being populated with robots. And then the question is  well  if they're going to be here in     years  are they going to be everywhere sooner than that  Are they going to be around in    years  Yeah  I think that's pretty likely    there's going to be lots of robots everywhere. And in fact I think that's going to be a lot sooner than that. I think we're sort of on the cusp of robots becoming common  and I think we're sort of around      or      in personal computer years  where the first few robots are starting to appear. Computers sort of came around through games and toys. And you know  the first computer most people had in the house may have been a computer to play Pong  a little microprocessor embedded  and then other games that came after that. And we're starting to see that same sort of thing with robots  LEGO Mindstorms  Furbies    who here    did anyone here have a Furby  Yeah  there's    million of them sold worldwide. They are pretty common. And they're a little tiny robot  a simple robot with some sensors  a little bit of processing actuation. On the right there is another robot doll  who you could get a couple of years ago. And just as in the early days  when there was a lot of sort of amateur interaction over computers  you can now get various hacking kits  how to hack books. And on the left there is a platform from Evolution Robotics  where you put a PC on  and you program this thing with a GUI to wander around your house and do various stuff. And then there's a higher price point sort of robot toys    the Sony Aibo. And on the right there  is one that the NEC developed  the PaPeRo  which I don't think they're going to release. But nevertheless  those sorts of things are out there. And we've seen  over the last two or three years  lawn mowing robots  Husqvarna on the bottom  Friendly Robotics on top there  an Israeli company. And then in the last    months or so we've started to see a bunch of home cleaning robots appear. The top left one is a very nice home cleaning robot from a company called Dyson  in the U.K. Except it was so expensive          dollars    they didn't release it. But at the bottom left  you see Electrolux  which is on sale. Another one from Karcher. At the bottom right is one that I built in my lab about    years ago  and we finally turned that into a product. And let me just show you that. We're going to give this away I think  Chris said  after the talk. This is a robot that you can go out and buy  and that will clean up your floor. And it starts off sort of just going around in ever increasing circles. If it hits something    you people see that  Now it's doing wall following  it's following around my feet to clean up around me. Let's see  let's    oh  who stole my Rice Krispies  They stole my Rice Krispies  Don't worry  relax  no  relax  it's a robot  it's smart  See  the three year old kids  they don't worry about it. It's grown ups that get really upset. We'll just put some crap here. Okay. I don't know if you see    so  I put a bunch of Rice Krispies there  I put some pennies  let's just shoot it at that  see if it cleans up. Yeah  OK. So    we'll leave that for later. Part of the trick was building a better cleaning mechanism  actually  the intelligence on board was fairly simple. And that's true with a lot of robots. We've all  I think  become  sort of computational chauvinists  and think that computation is everything  but the mechanics still matter. Here's another robot  the PackBot  that we've been building for a bunch of years. It's a military surveillance robot  to go in ahead of troops    looking at caves  for instance. But we had to make it fairly robust  much more robust than the robots we build in our labs. On board that robot is a PC running Linux. It can withstand a    G shock. The robot has local intelligence  it can flip itself over  can get itself into communication range  can go upstairs by itself  et cetera. Okay  so it's doing local navigation there. A soldier gives it a command to go upstairs  and it does. That was not a controlled descent. Now it's going to head off. And the big breakthrough for these robots  really  was September   th. We had the robots down at the World Trade Center late that evening. Couldn't do a lot in the main rubble pile  things were just too    there was nothing left to do. But we did go into all the surrounding buildings that had been evacuated  and searched for possible survivors in the buildings that were too dangerous to go into. Let's run this video. Reporter  ...battlefield companions are helping to reduce the combat risks. Nick Robertson has that story. Rodney Brooks  Can we have another one of these  Okay  good. So  this is a corporal who had seen a robot two weeks previously. He's sending robots into caves  looking at what's going on. The robot's being totally autonomous. The worst thing that's happened in the cave so far was one of the robots fell down ten meters. So one year ago  the US military didn't have these robots. Now they're on active duty in Afghanistan every day. And that's one of the reasons they say a robot invasion is happening. There's a sea change happening in how    where technology's going. Thanks. And over the next couple of months  we're going to be sending robots in production down producing oil wells to get that last few years of oil out of the ground. Very hostile environments       C         PSI. Autonomous robots going down  doing this sort of work. But robots like this  they're a little hard to program. How  in the future  are we going to program our robots and make them easier to use  And I want to actually use a robot here    a robot named Chris    stand up. Yeah. Okay. Come over here. Now notice  he thinks robots have to be a bit stiff. He sort of does that. But I'm going to    Chris Anderson  I'm just British. RB  Oh. I'm going to show this robot a task. It's a very complex task. Now notice  he nodded there  he was giving me some indication he was understanding the flow of communication. And if I'd said something completely bizarre he would have looked askance at me  and regulated the conversation. So now I brought this up in front of him. I'd looked at his eyes  and I saw his eyes looked at this bottle top. And I'm doing this task here  and he's checking up. His eyes are going back and forth up to me  to see what I'm looking at    so we've got shared attention. And so I do this task  and he looks  and he looks to me to see what's happening next. And now I'll give him the bottle  and we'll see if he can do the task. Can you do that  Okay. He's pretty good. Yeah. Good  good  good. I didn't show you how to do that. Now see if you can put it back together. And he thinks a robot has to be really slow. Good robot  that's good. So we saw a bunch of things there. We saw when we're interacting  we're trying to show someone how to do something  we direct their visual attention. The other thing communicates their internal state to us  whether he's understanding or not  regulates a social interaction. There was shared attention looking at the same sort of thing  and recognizing socially communicated reinforcement at the end. And we've been trying to put that into our lab robots because we think this is how you're going to want to interact with robots in the future. I just want to show you one technical diagram here. The most important thing for building a robot that you can interact with socially is its visual attention system. Because what it pays attention to is what it's seeing and interacting with  and what you're understanding what it's doing. So in the videos I'm about to show you  you're going to see a visual attention system on a robot which has    it looks for skin tone in HSV space  so it works across all human colorings. It looks for highly saturated colors  from toys. And it looks for things that move around. And it weights those together into an attention window  and it looks for the highest scoring place    the stuff where the most interesting stuff is happening    and that is what its eyes then segue to. And it looks right at that. At the same time  some top down sort of stuff  might decide that it's lonely and look for skin tone  or might decide that it's bored and look for a toy to play with. And so these weights change. And over here on the right  this is what we call the Steven Spielberg memorial module. Did people see the movie  AI    Audience  Yes.  RB  Yeah  it was really bad  but    remember  especially when Haley Joel Osment  the little robot  looked at the blue fairy for       years without taking his eyes off it  Well  this gets rid of that  because this is a habituation Gaussian that gets negative  and more and more intense as it looks at one thing. And it gets bored  so it will then look away at something else. So  once you've got that    and here's a robot  here's Kismet  looking around for a toy. You can tell what it's looking at. You can estimate its gaze direction from those eyeballs covering its camera  and you can tell when it's actually seeing the toy. And it's got a little bit of an emotional response here. But it's still going to pay attention if something more significant comes into its field of view    such as Cynthia Breazeal  the builder of this robot  from the right. It sees her  pays attention to her. Kismet has an underlying  three dimensional emotional space  a vector space  of where it is emotionally. And at different places in that space  it expresses    can we have the volume on here  Can you hear that now  out there   Audience  Yeah.  Kismet  Do you really think so  Do you really think so  Do you really think so  RB  So it's expressing its emotion through its face and the prosody in its voice. And when I was dealing with my robot over here  Chris  the robot  was measuring the prosody in my voice  and so we have the robot measure prosody for four basic messages that mothers give their children pre linguistically. Here we've got naive subjects praising the robot  Voice  Nice robot. You're such a cute little robot. RB  And the robot's reacting appropriately. Voice  ...very good  Kismet. Voice  Look at my smile. RB  It smiles. She imitates the smile. This happens a lot. These are naive subjects. Here we asked them to get the robot's attention and indicate when they have the robot's attention. Voice  Hey  Kismet  ah  there it is. RB  So she realizes she has the robot's attention. Voice  Kismet  do you like the toy  Oh. RB  Now  here they're asked to prohibit the robot  and this first woman really pushes the robot into an emotional corner. Voice  No. No. You're not to do that. No. Not appropriate. No. No. RB  I'm going to leave it at that. We put that together. Then we put in turn taking. When we talk to someone  we talk. Then we sort of raise our eyebrows  move our eyes  give the other person the idea it's their turn to talk. And then they talk  and then we pass the baton back and forth between each other. So we put this in the robot. We got a bunch of naive subjects in  we didn't tell them anything about the robot  sat them down in front of the robot and said  talk to the robot. Now what they didn't know was  the robot wasn't understanding a word they said  and that the robot wasn't speaking English. It was just saying random English phonemes. And I want you to watch carefully  at the beginning of this  where this person  Ritchie  who happened to talk to the robot for    minutes       says   I want to show you something. I want to show you my watch.  And he brings the watch center  into the robot's field of vision  points to it  gives it a motion cue  and the robot looks at the watch quite successfully. We don't know whether he understood or not that the robot    Notice the turn taking. Ritchie  OK  I want to show you something. OK  this is a watch that my girlfriend gave me. Robot  Oh  cool. Ritchie  Yeah  look  it's got a little blue light in it too. I almost lost it this week. RB  So it's making eye contact with him  following his eyes. Ritchie  Can you do the same thing  Robot  Yeah  sure. RB  And they successfully have that sort of communication. And here's another aspect of the sorts of things that Chris and I were doing. This is another robot  Cog. They first make eye contact  and then  when Christie looks over at this toy  the robot estimates her gaze direction and looks at the same thing that she's looking at. So we're going to see more and more of this sort of robot over the next few years in labs. But then the big questions  two big questions that people ask me are  if we make these robots more and more human like  will we accept them  will we    will they need rights eventually  And the other question people ask me is  will they want to take over  And on the first    you know  this has been a very Hollywood theme with lots of movies. You probably recognize these characters here    where in each of these cases  the robots want more respect. Well  do you ever need to give robots respect  They're just machines  after all. But I think  you know  we have to accept that we are just machines. After all  that's certainly what modern molecular biology says about us. You don't see a description of how  you know  Molecule A  you know  comes up and docks with this other molecule. And it's moving forward  you know  propelled by various charges  and then the soul steps in and tweaks those molecules so that they connect. It's all mechanistic. We are mechanism. If we are machines  then in principle at least  we should be able to build machines out of other stuff  which are just as alive as we are. But I think for us to admit that  we have to give up on our special ness  in a certain way. And we've had the retreat from special ness under the barrage of science and technology many times over the last few hundred years  at least.     years ago we had to give up the idea that we are the center of the universe when the earth started to go around the sun      years ago  with Darwin  we had to give up the idea we were different from animals. And to imagine    you know  it's always hard for us. Recently we've been battered with the idea that maybe we didn't even have our own creation event  here on earth  which people didn't like much. And then the human genome said  maybe we only have        genes. And that was really    people didn't like that  we've got more genes than that. We don't like to give up our special ness  so  you know  having the idea that robots could really have emotions  or that robots could be living creatures    I think is going to be hard for us to accept. But we're going to come to accept it over the next    years or so. And the second question is  will the machines want to take over  And here the standard scenario is that we create these things  they grow  we nurture them  they learn a lot from us  and then they start to decide that we're pretty boring  slow. They want to take over from us. And for those of you that have teenagers  you know what that's like. But Hollywood extends it to the robots. And the question is  you know  will someone accidentally build a robot that takes over from us  And that's sort of like this lone guy in the backyard  you know     I accidentally built a    .  I don't think that's going to happen. And I don't think       I don't think we're going to deliberately build robots that we're uncomfortable with. We'll    you know  they're not going to have a super bad robot. Before that has to come to be a mildly bad robot  and before that a not so bad robot. And we're just not going to let it go that way. So  I think I'm going to leave it at that  the robots are coming  we don't have too much to worry about  it's going to be a lot of fun  and I hope you all enjoy the journey over the next    years. I was here about four years ago  talking about the relationship of design and happiness. At the very end of it  I showed a list under that title. I learned very few things in addition since but made a whole number of them into projects since. These are inflatable monkeys in every city in Scotland   Everybody always thinks they are right.  They were combined in the media.  Drugs are fun in the beginning but become a drag later on.  We're doing changing media. This is a projection that can see the viewer as the viewer walks by. You can't help but actually ripping that spider web apart. All of these things are pieces of graphic design. We do them for our clients. They are commissioned. I would never have the money to actually pay for the installment or pay for all the billboards or the production of these  so there's always a client attached to them. These are        coat hangers in a street that's lined with fashion stores.  Worrying solves nothing.   Money does not make me happy  appeared first as double page spreads in a magazine. The printer lost the file  didn't tell us. When the magazine    actually  when I got the subscription    it was    following pages. It said   Money does does make me happy.  And a friend of mine in Austria felt so sorry for me that he talked the largest casino owner in Linz into letting us wrap his building. So this is the big pedestrian zone in Linz. It just says  Money   and if you look down the side street  it says   does not make me happy.  We had a show that just came down last week in New York. We steamed up the windows permanently  and every hour we had a different designer come in and write these things that they've learned into the steam in the window. Everybody participated    Milton Glaser  Massimo Vignelli. Singapore was quite in discussion. This is a little spot that we filmed there that's to be displayed on the large JumboTrons in Singapore. And  of course  it's one that's dear to my heart  because all of these sentiments    some banal  some a bit more profound    all originally had come out of my diary. And I do go often into the diary and check if I wanted to change something about the situation. If it's    see it for a long enough time  I actually do something about it. And the very last one is a billboard. This is our roof in New York  the roof of the studio. This is newsprint plus stencils that lie on the newsprint. We let that lie around in the sun. As you all know  newsprint yellows significantly in the sun. After a week  we took the stencils and the leaves off  shipped the newsprints to Lisbon to a very sunny spot  so on day one the billboard said   Complaining is silly. Either act or forget.  Three days later it faded  and a week later  no more complaining anywhere. Thank you so much. I want to argue to you that in fact  politics and religion  which are the two primary factors    not the sole  but overwhelmingly  the primary factors    which are driving towards a war which looks extremely likely    bordering on the inevitable at this point  whether one is in favor of that or not    that politics and religion are  in fact  themselves better conceptualized as kinds of technology  and subject to kinds of questions that we regularly consider in the space of conceptual design. Here's what I mean. Politics and    let's focus on the political system in particular question here  which is the system of democracy. Democracy  as a type of politics  is a technology for the control and deployment of power. You can deploy power in a wide range of ways. The famous ones    despotism is a good one  anarchy is a way to not deploy the power in any organized way  to do it in a radically diffused fashion  and democracy is a set of technologies  which have the effect of  in principle  diffusing the power source to a large number of people and then re concentrating it in a smaller group of people who govern  and who themselves are  in principle  authorized to govern by virtue of what the broader public has done. Now  consider religion    in this case Islam  which is the religion that  in some direct sense  can be said to be precipitating what we're about to enter. Let me say parenthetically why I think that's the case  because I think it's a potentially controversial statement. I would put it in the following equation  no       no war. At the beginning of the Bush administration  when President Bush  now President Bush  was running for president  he made it very clear that he was not interested in intervening broadly in the world. In fact  the trend was for disengagement with the rest of the world. That's why we heard about the backing away from the Kyoto protocol  for example. After       the tables were turned. And the president decided  with his advisors  to undertake some kind of an active intervention in the world around us. That began with Afghanistan  and when Afghanistan went extremely smoothly and quickly  a decision was made through the technology of democracy    again  notice  not a perfect technology    but through the technology of democracy that this administration was going to push in the direction of another war    this time  a war in Iraq. Now  the reason I begin by saying  no       no war  is that we have to acknowledge that Islam  as interpreted by a very  very small  extremely radical group of people  was a precipitating cause of the      attacks    the precipitating cause of the      attacks    and as a consequence  at one degree of remove  the precipitating cause of the coming war that we're about to be engaged in. And I would add that bin Laden and his followers are consciously devoted to the goal of creating a conflict between democracy  or at least capitalist democracy  on the one hand  and the world of Islam as they see and define it. Now  how is Islam a technology in this conceptual apparatus  Well  it's a technology for  first  salvation in its most basic sense. It's meant to be a mechanism for construing the universe in a way that will bring about the salvation of the individual believer  but it's also meant by the Islamists    and I use that term to mean people who believe that Islam    they follow the slogan  Islam is the answer to a wide range of questions  whether they're social  or political  or personal  or spiritual. Within the sphere of people who have that view  and it's a large number of people in the Muslim world who disagree with bin Laden in his application  but agree that Islam is the answer. Islam represents a way of engaging the world through which one can achieve certain desirable goals. And the goals from the perspective of Muslims are  in principle  peace  justice and equality  but on terms that correspond to traditional Muslim teachings. Now  I don't want to leave a misimpression by identifying either of these propositions    rather  either of these phenomena  democracy or Islam    as technologies. I don't want to suggest that they are a single thing that you can point to. And I think a good way to prove this is simply to demonstrate to you what my thought process was when deciding what to put on the wall behind me when I spoke. And I ran immediately into a conceptual problem  you can't show a picture of democracy. You can show a slogan  or a symbol  or a sign that stands for democracy. You can show the Capitol    I had the same problem when I was designing the cover of my forthcoming book  in fact    what do you put on the cover to show democracy  And the same problem with respect to Islam. You can show a mosque  or you can show worshippers  but there's not a straightforward way of depicting Islam. That's because these are the kinds of concepts that are not susceptible to easy representation. Now  it follows from that  that they're deeply contestable. It follows from that that all of the people in the world who say that they are Muslims can  in principle  subscribe to a wide range of different interpretations of what Islam really is  and the same is true of democracy. In other words  unlike the word hope  which one could look up in a dictionary and derive origins for  and  perhaps  reach some kind of a consensual use analysis  these are essentially contested concepts. They're ideas about which people disagree in the deepest possible sense. And as a consequence of this disagreement  it's very  very difficult for anyone to say   I have the right version of Islam.  You know  post       we were treated to the amazing phenomenon of George W. Bush saying   Islam means peace.  Well  so says George W. Bush. Other people would say it means something else. Some people would say that Islam means submission. Other people would say it means an acknowledgement or recognition of God's sovereignty. There are a wide range of different things that Islam can mean. And ostensibly  the same is true of democracy. Some people say that democracy consists basically in elections. Other people say no  that's not enough  there have to be basic liberal rights  free speech  free press  equality of citizens. These are contested points  and it's impossible to answer them by saying   Ah ha  I looked in the right place  and I found out what these concepts mean.  Now  if Islam and democracy are at present in a moment of great confrontation  what does that mean  Well  you could fit it into a range of different interpretative frameworks. You could begin with the one that we began with a couple of days ago  which was fear. Fear is not an implausible reaction with a war just around the corner and with a very  very high likelihood that many  many people are going to die as a consequence of this confrontation    a confrontation which many  many people in the Muslim world do not want  many  many people in the American democracy do not want  many people elsewhere in the world do not want  but which nonetheless is favored by a large enough number of people    at least in the relevant space  which is the United States    to actually go forward. So fear is not a crazy response at all. And I think that that's  in fact  probably the first appropriate response. What I want to suggest to you  though  in the next couple of minutes is that there's also a hopeful response to this. And the hopeful response derives from recognizing that Islam and democracy are technologies. And by virtue of being technologies  they're manipulable. And they're manipulable in ways that can produce some extremely positive outcomes. What do I have in mind  Well  all over the Muslim world there are people who take Islam deeply seriously  people who care about Islam  for whom it's a source either of faith  or of civilization  or of deep values  or just a source of powerful personal identity  who think and are saying loudly that Islam and democracy are in fact not in conflict  but are in fact deeply compatible. And these Muslims    and it's the vast majority of Muslims    disagree profoundly with bin Laden's approach  profoundly. And they furthermore think overwhelmingly    again one can't speak of every person  but overwhelmingly  and one can find this by reading any of the sources that they have produced  and they're all over the Internet and in all sorts of languages    one can see that they're saying that their concern in their own countries is primarily to free up themselves to have choice in the spheres of personal life  in the sphere of economics  in the sphere of politics  and  yes  in the sphere of religion  which is itself closely regulated in most of the Muslim world. And many of these Muslims further say that their disagreement with the United States is that it  in the past and still in the present  has sided with autocratic rulers in the Muslim world in order to promote America's short term interests. Now  during the Cold War  that may have been a defensible position for the United States to take. That's an academic question. It may be that there was a great war to be fought between West and East  and it was necessary on the axis of democracy against communism. And it was necessary in some way for these to contradict each other  and as a consequence you have to make friends wherever you can get them. But now that the Cold War is over  there's nearly universal consensus in the Muslim world    and pretty close to the same here in the United States  if you talk to people and ask them    that in principle  there's no reason that democracy and Islam cannot co exist. And we see this among activist  practical Muslims  like the Muslims who are presently the elected  parliamentary  democratic government of Turkey  who are behaving pragmatically  not ideologically  who are promoting their own religious values  who are elected by their own people because they were perceived as honest and sincere because of their religious values  but who do not think that Islam and a democratic system of governance are fundamentally incompatible. Now  you may say  but surely  what we've seen on television about Saudi Islam convinces us that it can't possibly be compatible with what we consider the core of democracy    namely  free political choice  basic liberty and basic equality. But I'm here to tell you that technologies are more malleable than that. I'm here to tell you that many  many Muslims believe    the vast majority  in fact    in fact I think I would go so far as to say that many Muslims in Saudi Arabia believe that the core values of Islam  namely acknowledgement of God's sovereignty and basic human equality before God  are themselves compatible with liberty  equality and free political choice. And there are Muslims  many Muslims out there  who are saying precisely this. And they're making this argument wherever they're permitted to make it. But their governments  needless to say  are relatively threatened by this. And for the most part try to stop them from making this argument. So  for example  a group of young activists in Egypt try to form a party known as the Center Party  which advocated the compatibility of Islam and democracy. They weren't even allowed to form a party. They were actually blocked from even forming a party under the political system there. Why  Because they would have done extraordinarily well. In the most recent elections in the Muslim world    which are those in Pakistan  those in Morocco and those in Turkey    in each case  people who present themselves to the electorate as Islamic democrats were far and away the most successful vote getters every place they were allowed to run freely. So in Morocco  for example  they finished third in the political race but they were only allowed to contest half the seats. So had they contested a larger number of the seats  they would have done even better. Now what I want to suggest to you is that the reason for hope in this case is that we are on the edge of a real transformation in the Muslim world. And that's a transformation in which many sincerely believing Muslims    who care very  very deeply about their traditions  who do not want to compromise those values    believe  through the malleability of the technology of democracy and the malleability and synthetic capability of the technology of Islam  that these two ideas can work together. Now what would that look like  What does it mean to say that there's an Islamic democracy  Well  one thing is  it's not going to look identical to democracy as we know it in the United States. That may be a good thing  in light of some of the criticisms we've heard today    for example  in the regulatory context    of what democracy produces. It will also not look exactly the way either the people in this room  or Muslims out in the rest of the world    I don't mean to imply there aren't Muslims here  there probably are    conceptualize Islam. It will be transformative of Islam as well. And as a result of this convergence  this synthetic attempt to make sense of these two ideas together  there's a real possibility that  instead of a clash of Islamic civilization    if there is such a thing    and democratic civilization    if there is such a thing    we'll in fact have close compatibility. Now  I began with the war because it's the elephant in the room  and you can't pretend that there isn't about to be a war if you're talking about these issues. The war has tremendous risks for the model that I'm describing because it's very possible that as a consequence of a war  many Muslims will conclude that the United States is not the kind of place that they want to emulate with respect to its forms of political government. On the other hand  there's a further possibility that many Americans  swept up in the fever of a war  will say  and feel  and think that Islam is the enemy somehow    that Islam ought to be construed as the enemy. And even though  for political tactical reasons  the president has been very  very good about saying that Islam is not the enemy  nonetheless  there's a natural impulse when one enters war to think of the other side as an enemy. And one furthermore has the impulse to generalize  as much as possible  in defining who that enemy is. So the risks are very great. On the other hand  the capacities for positive results in the aftermath of a war are also not to be underestimated  even by  and I would say especially by  people who are deeply skeptical about whether we should go to war in the first place. Those who oppose the war ought to realize that if a war happens  it cannot be the right strategy  either pragmatically  or spiritually  or morally  to say after the war   Well  let's let it all run itself out  and play out however it wants to play out  because we opposed the war in the first place.  That's not the way human circumstances operate. You face the circumstances you have in front of you and you go forward. Well  what I'm here to say then is  for people who are skeptical about the war  it's especially important to recognize that in the aftermath of the war there is a possibility for the government of the United States and the Muslim peoples with whom it interacts to create real forms of government that are truly democratic and also truly Islamic. And it is crucial    it is crucial in a practical  activist way    for people who care about these issues to make sure that within the technology of democracy  in this system  they exercise their preferences  their choices and their voices to encourage that outcome. That's a hopeful message  but it's a message that's hopeful only if you understand it as incurring serious obligation for all of us. And I think that we are capable of taking on that obligation  but only if we put what we can into it. And if we do  then I don't think that the hope will be unwarranted altogether. Thanks. Aside from keeping the rain out and producing some usable space  architecture is nothing but a special effects machine that delights and disturbs the senses. Our work is across media. The work comes in all shapes and sizes. It's small and large. This is an ashtray  a water glass. From urban planning and master planning to theater and all sorts of stuff. The thing that all the work has in common is that it challenges the assumptions about conventions of space. And these are everyday conventions  conventions that are so obvious that we are blinded by their familiarity. And I've assembled a sampling of work that all share a kind of productive nihilism that's used in the service of creating a particular special effect. And that is something like nothing  or something next to nothing. It's done through a form of subtraction or obstruction or interference in a world that we naturally sleepwalk through. This is an image that won us a competition for an exhibition pavilion for the Swiss Expo      on Lake Neuchatel  near Geneva. And we wanted to use the water not only as a context  but as a primary building material. We wanted to make an architecture of atmosphere. So  no walls  no roof  no purpose    just a mass of atomized water  a big cloud. And this proposal was a reaction to the over saturation of emergent technologies in recent national and world expositions  which feeds  or has been feeding  our insatiable appetite for visual stimulation with an ever greater digital virtuosity. High definition  in our opinion  has become the new orthodoxy. And we ask the question  can we use technology  high technology  to make an expo pavilion that's decidedly low definition  that also challenges the conventions of space and skin  and rethinks our dependence on vision  So this is how we sought to do it. Water's pumped from the lake and is filtered and shot as a fine mist through an array of high pressure fog nozzles         of them. And a weather station is on the structure. It reads the shifting conditions of temperature  humidity  wind direction  wind speed  dew point  and it processes this data in a central computer that calibrates the degree of water pressure and distribution of water throughout. And it's a responsive system that's trained on actual weather. So  this is just in construction  and there's a tensegrity structure. It's about     feet wide  the size of a football field  and it sits on just four very delicate columns. These are the fog nozzles  the interface  and basically the system is kind of reading the real weather  and producing kind of semi artificial and real weather. So  we're very interested in creating weather. I don't know why. Now  here we go  one side  the outside and then from the inside of the space you can see what the quality of the space was. Unlike entering any normal space  entering Blur is like stepping into a habitable medium. It's formless  featureless  depthless  scaleless  massless  purposeless and dimensionless. All references are erased  leaving only an optical whiteout and white noise of the pulsing nozzles. So  this is an exhibition pavilion where there is absolutely nothing to see and nothing to do. And we pride ourselves    it's a spectacular anti spectacle in which all the conventions of spectacle are turned on their head. So  the audience is dispersed  focused attention and dramatic build up and climax are all replaced by a kind of attenuated attention that's sustained by a sense of apprehension caused by the fog. And this is very much like how the Victorian novel used fog in this way. So here the world is put out of focus  while our visual dependence is put into focus. The public  you know  once disoriented can actually ascend to the angel deck above and then just come down under those lips into the water bar. So  all the waters of the world are served there  so we thought that  you know  after being at the water and moving through the water and breathing the water  you could also drink this building. And so it is sort of a theme  but it goes a little bit  you know  deeper than that. We really wanted to bring out our absolute dependence on this master sense  and maybe share our kind of sensibility with our other senses. You know  when we did this project it was a kind of tough sell  because the Swiss said   Well  why are we going to spend  you know     million dollars producing an effect that we already have in natural abundance that we hate   And  you know  we thought    well  we tried to convince them. And in the end  you know  they adapted this as a national icon that came to represent Swiss doubt  which we    you know  it was kind of a meaning machine that everybody kind of laid on their own meanings off of. Anyway  it's a temporary structure that was ultimately destroyed  and so it's now a memory of an apparition  actually  but it continues to live in edible form. And this is the highest honor to be bestowed upon an architect in Switzerland    to have a chocolate bar. Anyway  moving along. So in the '  s and '  s  we were mostly known for independent work  such as installation artist  architect  commissioned projects by museums and non for profit organizations. And we did a lot of media work  also a lot of experimental theater projects. In       the Whitney mounted a retrospective of our work that featured a lot of this work from the '  s and '  s. However  the work itself resisted the very nature of a retrospective  and this is just some of the stuff that was in the show. This was a piece on tourism in the United States. This is  Soft Sell  for   nd Street. This was something done at the Cartier Foundation.  Master Slave  at the MOMA  the project series  a piece called  Parasite.  And so there were many  many of these kinds of projects. Anyway  they gave us the whole fourth floor  and  you know  the problem of the retrospective was something we were very uncomfortable with. It's a kind of invention of the museum that's supposed to bring a kind of cohesive understanding to the public of a body of work. And our work doesn't really resolve itself into a body in any way at all. And one of the recurring themes  by the way  that in the work was a kind of hostility toward the museum itself  and asking about the conventions of the museum  like the wall  the white wall. So  what you see here is basically a plan of many installations that were put there. And we actually had to install white walls to separate these pieces  which didn't belong together. But these white walls became a kind of target and weapon at the same time. We used the wall to partition the    installations of the project and produce a kind of acoustic and visual separation. And what you see is    actually  the red dotted line shows the track of this performing element  which was a new piece that created    that we created for the    which was a robotic drill  basically  that went all the way around  cruised the museum  went all around the walls and did a lot of damage. So  the drill was mounted on this robotic arm. We worked with  by the way  Honeybee Robotics. This is the brain. Honeybee Robotics designed the Mars Driller  and it was really very much fun to work with them. They weren't doing their primary work  which was for the government  while they were helping us with this. In any case  the way it works is that an intelligent navigator basically maps the entire surface of these walls. So  unfolded it's about     linear feet. And it randomly generates points within a three dimensional matrix. It selects a point  it guides the drill to that point  it pierces the dry wall  leaving a half inch hole before traveling to the next location. Initially these holes were lone blemishes  and as the exhibition continued the walls became increasingly perforated. So eventually holes on both sides of the wall aligned  opening views from gallery to gallery. Clusters of holes randomly opened up sections of wall. And so this was a three month performance piece in which the wall was made into kind of an increasingly unstable element. And also the acoustic separation was destroyed. Also the visual separation. And there was also this constant background groan  which was very annoying. And this is one of the blackout spaces where there's a video piece that became totally not useful. So rather than securing a neutral background for the artworks on display  the wall now actively competed for attention. And this acoustical nuisance and visual nuisance basically exposed the discomfort of the work to this encompassing nature of the retrospective. It was really great when it started to break up all of the curatorial text. Moving along to a project that we finished about a year ago. It's the ICA    the Institute of Contemporary Art    in Boston  which is on the waterfront. And there's not enough time to really introduce the building  but I'll simply say that the building negotiates between this outwardly focused nature of the site    you know  it's a really great waterfront site in Boston    and this contradictory other desire to have an inwardly focused museum. So  the nature of the building is that it looks at looking    I mean that's its primary objective  both its program and its architectural conceit. The building incorporates the site  but it dispenses it in very small doses in the way that the museum is choreographed. So  you come in and you're basically squeezed by the theater  by the belly of the theater  into this very compressed space where the view is turned off. Then you come up in this glass elevator right near the curtain wall. This elevator's about the size of a New York City studio apartment. And then  this is a view going up  and then you could come into the theater  which can actually deny the view or open it up and become a backdrop. And many musicians choose to use the theater glass walls totally open. The view is denied in the galleries where we receive just natural light  and then exposed again in the north gallery with a panoramic view. The original intention of this space  which was unfortunately never realized  was to use lenticular glass which allowed only a kind of perpendicular view out. In this very narrow space that connects east and west galleries the intention was really to not get a climax  but to have the view stalk you  so the view would open up as you walked from one end to the other. This was eliminated because the view was too good  and the mayor said   No  we just want this open.  The architect lost here. But culminating    and that's where this hooks into the theme of my little talk    is this Mediatheque  which is suspended from the cantilevered portion of the building. So this is an    foot cantilever    it's quite substantial. So  it's already sticking out into space enough  and then from that is this  is this small area called the Mediatheque. The Mediatheque has something like    stations where the public can get onto the server and look at digital artworks or also curated artworks off the web. And this was really a kind of very important part of this building  and here is a point where architecture    this is like technology free    architecture is only a framing device  it only edits the harbor view  the industrial harbor just through its walls  its floors and its ceiling  to only expose the water itself  the texture of water  much like a hypnotic effect created by electronic snow or a lava lamp or something like that. And here is where we really felt that there was a great convergence of the technological and the natural in the project. But there is just no information  it's just    it's just hypnosis. Moving along to Lincoln Center. These are the guys that did the project in the first place     years ago. We're taking over now  doing work that ranges in scale from small scale repairs to major renovations and major facility expansions. But we're doing it with a lot less testosterone. This is the extent of the work that's to be completed by     . And for the purposes of this talk  I wanted to isolate just a part of a project that's even a part of a project that touches a little bit on this theme of architectural special effects  and it happens to be our current obsession  and it plays a little bit with the purging and adding of distraction. It's Alice Tully Hall  and it's tucked under the Juilliard Building and descends several levels under the street. So  this is the entrance to Tully Hall as it used to be  before the renovation  which we just started. And we asked ourselves  why couldn't it be exhibitionistic  like the Met  or like some of the other buildings at Lincoln Center  And one of the things that we were asked to do was give it a street identity  expand the lobbies and make it visually accessible. And this building  which is just naturally hermetic  we stripped. We basically did a striptease  architectural striptease  where we're framing with this kind of canopy    the underside of three levels of expansion of Juilliard  about        square feet    cutting it to the angle of Broadway  and then exposing  using that canopy to frame Tully Hall. Before and after shot.  Applause  Wait a minute  it's just in that state  we have a long way to go. But what I wanted to do was take a couple of seconds that I have left to just talk about the hall itself  which is kind of where we're really doing a massive amount of work. So  the hall is a multi purpose hall. The clients have asked us to produce a great chamber music hall. Now  that's really tough to do with a hall that has       seats. Chamber and the notion of chamber has to do with salons and small scale performances. They asked us to bring an intimacy. How do you bring an intimacy into a hall  Intimacy for us means a lot of different things. It means acoustic intimacy and it means visual intimacy. One thing is that the subway is running and rumbling right under the hall. Another thing that could be fixed is the shape of the hall. It's like a coffin  it basically sends all the sound  like a gutter ball effect  down the aisles. The walls are made of absorptive surface  half absorptive  half reflective  which is not very good for concert sound. This is Avery Fisher Hall  but the notion of junk    visual junk    was very  very important to us  to get rid of visual noise. Because we can't eliminate a single seat  the architecture is restricted to    inches. So it's a very  very thin architecture. First we do a kind of partial box and box separation  to take away the distraction of the subway noise. Next we wrap the entire hall    almost like this Olivetti keyboard    with a material  with a wood material that basically covers all the surfaces  wall  ceiling  floor  stage  steps  everything  boxes. But it's acoustically engineered to focus the sound into the house and back to the stage. And here's an acoustic shelf. Looking up the hall. Just a section of the stage. Just everything is lined  it incorporates    every single thing that you could possibly imagine is tucked into this high performance skin. But one more added feature. So now that we've stripped the hall of all visual distraction  everything that prevents this intimacy which is supposed to connect the house  the audience  with the performers  we add one little detail  one piece of architectural excess  a special effect  lighting. We very strongly believe that the theatrics of a concert hall is as much in the space of intermission and the space of arrival as it is when the concert starts. So what we wanted to do was produce this effect  this lighting effect  which made us have to bioengineer the wood walls. And what it entails is the use of resin  of this very thick resin with a veneer of the same kind of wood that's used throughout the hall  in a kind of seamless continuity that wraps the hall in light  like a belt of light  rather than separating  like a proscenium would separate the audience from performers  it connects audience with players. And this is a mockup that is in Salt Lake City that gives you a sense of what this is going to look like in full scale. And this is a guy from Salt Lake City  this is what they look like out there. And for us  I mean it's really kind of a very strange thing  but the moments in the hall that the buzz kind of dies down when the audience is waiting for the performance to begin  very similar to the parting of curtains or the raising of a chandelier  the walls will just exude this glow  temporarily stealing attention from the stage. And this is Tully in construction now. I have no ending to say  except that I'm a couple of minutes over. Thank you very much. I was a student in the '  s  a time of social upheaval and questioning  and    on a personal level    an awakening sense of idealism. The war in Vietnam was raging  the Civil Rights movement was under way and pictures had a powerful influence on me. Our political and military leaders were telling us one thing and photographers were telling us another. I believed the photographers and so did millions of other Americans. Their images fuelled resistance to the war and to racism. They not only recorded history    they helped change the course of history. Their pictures became part of our collective consciousness and  as consciousness evolved into a shared sense of conscience  change became not only possible  but inevitable. It puts a human face on issues which  from afar  can appear abstract or ideological or monumental in their global impact. What happens at ground level  far from the halls of power  happens to ordinary citizens one by one. And I understood that documentary photography has the ability to interpret events from their point of view. It gives a voice to those who otherwise would not have a voice. My TED wish. There s a vital story that needs to be told and I wish for TED to help me gain access to it and then to help me come up with innovative and exciting ways to use news photography in the digital era. Thank you very much.     . .      The story breaks.      I have been a witness  and these pictures are my testimony.      South Africa     This is happening now.

I grew up in Northern Ireland  right up in the very  very north end of it there  where it's absolutely freezing cold. This was me running around in the back garden mid summer. I couldn't pick a career. In Ireland the obvious choice is the military  but to be honest it actually kind of sucks. My mother wanted me to be a dentist. But the problem was that people kept blowing everything up. So I actually went to school in Belfast  which was where all the action happened. And this was a pretty common sight. The school I went to was pretty boring. They forced us to learn things like Latin. The school teachers weren't having much fun  the sports were very dirty or very painful. So I cleverly chose rowing  which I got very good at. And I was actually rowing for my school here until this fateful day  and I flipped over right in front of the entire school. And that was the finishing post right there. So this was extremely embarrassing. But our school at that time got a grant from the government  and they got an incredible computer    the research machine  DZ    and they left the programming manuals lying around. And so students like myself with nothing to do  we would learn how to program it. Also around this time  at home  this was the computer that people were buying. It was called the Sinclair ZX  . This was a  K computer  and you'd buy your programs on cassette tape. Actually I'm just going to pause for one second  because I heard that there's a prerequisite to speak here at TED    you had to have a picture of yourself from the old days with big hair. So I brought a picture with big hair. I just want to get that out of the way. So after the Sinclair ZX   came along the very cleverly named Sinclair ZX  . And    you see the picture at the bottom  There's a picture of a guy doing homework with his son. That's what they thought they had built it for. The reality is we got the programming manual and we started making games for it. We were programming in BASIC  which is a pretty awful language for games  so we ended up learning Assembly language so we could really take control of the hardware. This is the guy that invented it  Sir Clive Sinclair  and he's showing his machine. You had this same thing in America  it was called the Timex Sinclair    . To play a game in those days you had to have an imagination to believe that you were really playing  Battlestar Galactica.  The graphics were just horrible. You had to have an even better imagination to play this game   Death Rider.  But of course the scientists couldn't help themselves. They started making their own video games. This is one of my favorite ones here  where they have rabbit breeding  so males choose the lucky rabbit. It was around this time we went from  K to   K  which was quite the leap. And if you're wondering how much   K is  this eBay logo here is   K. And in that amount of memory someone programmed a full flight simulation program. And that's what it looked like. I spent ages flying this flight simulator  and I honestly believed I could fly airplanes by the end of it. Here's Clive Sinclair now launching his color computer. He's recognized as being the father of video games in Europe. He's a multi millionaire  and I think that's why he's smiling in this photograph. So I went on for the next    years or so making a lot of different games. Some of the highlights were things like  The Terminator    Aladdin   the  Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles.  Because I was from the United Kingdom  they thought the word ninja was a little too mean for children  so they decided to call it hero instead. I personally preferred the Spanish version  which was  Tortugas Ninja.  That was much better. Then the last game I did was based on trying to get the video game industry and Hollywood to actually work together on something    instead of licensing from each other  to actually work. Now  Chris did ask me to bring some statistics with me  so I've done that. The video game industry in      became a    billion dollar business. It grows every year. Last year was the biggest year. By       we're going to kick the butt of the music industry. By       we're going to hit    billion.    percent of gamers are female. So there's a lot more female gamers than people are really aware. The average age of gamers  Well  obviously it's for children  right  Well  no  actually it's    years old. And interestingly  the people who buy the most games are   . So    is our target audience. All video games are violent. Of course the newspapers love to beat on this. But    percent of games don't have any mature content whatsoever  so it's just not true. Online gaming statistics. I brought some stuff on  World of Warcraft.  It's  .  million players. It makes about    million bucks a month in subscriptions. It costs    bucks just to install it on your computer  making the publisher about another     million. The game costs about    million dollars to make  so basically it pays for itself in about a month. A player in a game called  Project Entropia  actually bought his own island for        dollars. You have to remember that this is not a real island. He didn't actually buy anything  just some data. But he got great terms on it. This purchase included mining and hunting rights  ownership of all land on the island  and a castle with no furniture included. This market is now estimated at over     million dollars annually. And what's interesting about it is the market was actually created by the gamers themselves. They found clever ways to trade items and to sell their accounts to each other so that they could make money while they were playing their games. I dove onto eBay a couple of days ago just to see what was gong on  typed in World of Warcraft  got       items. I liked this one the best  a level    Warlock with lots of epics for         dollars. It's like that guy obviously had some pain while making it. So as far as popularity of games  what do you think these people are doing here  It turns out they're actually in Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles listening to the L.A. Philharmonic playing video game music. That's what the show looks like. You would expect it to be cheesy  but it's not. It's very  very epic and a very beautiful concert. And the people that went there absolutely loved it. What do you think these people are doing  They're actually bringing their computers so they can play games against each other. And this is happening in every city around the world. This is happening in your local cities too  you're probably just not aware of it. Now  Chris told me that you had a timeline video a few years ago here just to show how video game graphics have been improving. I wanted to update that video and give you a new look at it. But what I want you to do is to try to understand it. We're on this curve  and the graphics are getting so ridiculously better. And I'm going to show you up to maybe     . But I want you to try and think about what games could look like    years from now. So we're going to start that video. Video  Throughout human history people have played games. As man's intellect and technology have evolved so too have the games he plays. David Perry  The thing again I want you to think about is  don't look at these graphics and think of that's the way it is. Think about that's where we are right now  and the curve that we're on means that this is going to continue to get better. This is an example of the kind of graphics you need to be able to draw if you wanted to get a job in the video game industry today. You need to be really an incredible artist. And once we get enough of those guys  we're going to want more fantasy artists that can create places we've never been to before  or characters that we've just never seen before. So the obvious thing for me to talk about today is graphics and audio. But if you were to go to a game developers conference  what they're all talking about is emotion  purpose  meaning  understanding and feeling. You'll hear about talks like  can a video game make you cry  And these are the kind of topics we really actually care about. I came across a student who's absolutely excellent at expressing himself  and this student agreed that he would not show his video to anybody until you here at TED had seen it. So I'd like to play this video. So this is a student's opinion on what his experience of games are. Video  I  like many of you  live somewhere between reality and video games. Some part of me    a true living  breathing person    has become programmed  electronic and virtual. The boundary of my brain that divides real from fantasy has finally begun to crumble. I'm a video game addict and this is my story. In the year of my birth the Nintendo Entertainment System also went into development. I played in the backyard  learned to read  and even ate some of my vegetables. Most of my childhood was spent playing with Legos. But as was the case for most of my generation  I spent a lot of time in front of the TV. Mr. Rogers  Walt Disney  Nick Junior  and roughly half a million commercials have undoubtedly left their mark on me. When my parents bought my sister and I our first Nintendo  whatever inherent addictive quality this early interactive electronic entertainment possessed quickly took hold of me. At some point something clicked. With the combination of simple  interactive stories and the warmth of the TV set  my simple    bit Nintendo became more than just an escape. It became an alternate existence  my virtual reality. I'm a video game addict  and it's not because of a certain number of hours I have spent playing  or nights I have gone without sleep to finish the next level. It is because I have had life altering experiences in virtual space  and video games had begun to erode my own understanding of what is real and what is not. I'm addicted  because even though I know I'm losing my grip on reality  I still crave more. From an early age I learned to invest myself emotionally in what unfolded before me on screen. Today  after    years of watching TV geared to make me emotional  even a decent insurance commercial can bring tears to my eyes. I am just one of a new generation that is growing up. A generation who may experience much more meaning through video games than they will through the real world. Video games are nearing an evolutionary leap  a point where game worlds will look and feel just as real as the films we see in theatres  or the news we watch on TV. And while my sense of free will in these virtual worlds may still be limited  what I do learn applies to my real life. Play enough video games and eventually you will really believe you can snowboard  fly a plane  drive a nine second quarter mile  or kill a man. I know I can. Unlike any pop culture phenomenon before it  video games actually allow us to become part of the machine. They allow us to sublimate into the culture of interactive  downloaded  streaming  HD reality. We are interacting with our entertainment. I have come to expect this level of interaction. Without it  the problems faced in the real world    poverty  war  disease and genocide    lack the levity they should. Their importance blends into the sensationalized drama of prime time TV. But the beauty of video games today lies not in the lifelike graphics  the vibrating joysticks or virtual surround sound. It lies in that these games are beginning to make me emotional. I have fought in wars  feared for my own survival  watched my cohorts die on beaches and woods that look and feel more real than any textbook or any news story. The people who create these games are smart. They know what makes me scared  excited  panicked  proud or sad. Then they use these emotions to dimensionalize the worlds they create. A well designed video game will seamlessly weave the user into the fabric of the virtual experience. As one becomes more experienced the awareness of physical control melts away. I know what I want and I do it. No buttons to push  no triggers to pull  just me and the game. My fate and the fate of the world around me lie inside my hands. I know violent video games make my mother worry. What troubles me is not that video game violence is becoming more and more like real life violence  but that real life violence is starting to look more and more like a video game. These are all troubles outside of myself. I  however  have a problem very close to home. Something has happened to my brain. Perhaps there is a single part of our brain that holds all of our gut instincts  the things we know to do before we even think. While some of these instincts may be innate  most are learned  and all of them are hardwired into our brains. These instincts are essential for survival in both real and virtual worlds. Only in recent years has the technology behind video games allowed for a true overlap in stimuli. As gamers we are now living by the same laws of physics in the same cities and doing many of the same things we once did in real life  only virtually. Consider this    my real life car has about        miles on it. In all my driving games  I've driven a total of        miles. To some degree I've learned how to drive from the game. The sensory cues are very similar. It's a funny feeling when you have spent more time doing something on the TV than you have in real life. When I am driving down a road at sunset all I can think is  this is almost as beautiful as my games are. For my virtual worlds are perfect. More beautiful and rich than the real world around us. I'm not sure what the implications of my experience are  but the potential for using realistic video game stimuli in repetition on a vast number of loyal participants is frightening to me. Today I believe Big Brother would find much more success brainwashing the masses with video games rather than just simply TVs. Video games are fun  engaging  and leave your brain completely vulnerable to re programming. But maybe brainwashing isn't always bad. Imagine a game that teaches us to respect each other  or helps us to understand the problems we're all facing in the real world. There is a potential to do good as well. It is critical  as these virtual worlds continue to mirror the real world we live in  that game developers realize that they have tremendous responsibilities before them. I'm not sure what the future of video games holds for our civilization. But as virtual and real world experiences increasingly overlap there is a greater and greater potential for other people to feel the same way I do. What I have only recently come to realize is that beyond the graphics  sound  game play and emotion it is the power to break down reality that is so fascinating and addictive to me. I know that I am losing my grip. Part of me is just waiting to let go. I know though  that no matter how amazing video games may become  or how flat the real world may seem to us  that we must stay aware of what our games are teaching us and how they leave us feeling when we finally do unplug. DP  Wow. I found that video very  very thought provoking  and that's why I wanted to bring it here for you guys to see. And what was interesting about it is the obvious choice for me to talk about was graphics and audio. But as you heard  Michael talked about all these other elements as well. Video games give an awful lot of other things too  and that's why people get so addicted. The most important one being fun. The name of this track is  The Magic To Come.  Who is that going to come from  Is it going to come from the best directors in the world as we thought it probably would  I don't think so. I think it's going to come from the children who are growing up now that aren't stuck with all of the stuff that we remember from the past. They're going to do it their way  using the tools that we've created. The same with students or highly creative people  writers and people like that. As far as colleges go  there's about     colleges around the world teaching video game courses. That means there's literally thousands of new ideas. Some of the ideas are really dreadful and some of them are great. There's nothing worse than having to listen to someone try and pitch you a really bad video game idea. Chris Anderson  You're off  you're off. That's it. He's out of time. DP  I've just got a little tiny bit more if you'll indulge me. CA  Go ahead. I'm going to stay right here though. DP  This is just a cool shot  because this is students coming to school after class. The school is closed  they're coming back at midnight because they want to pitch their video game ideas. I'm sitting at the front of the class  and they're actually pitching their ideas. So it's hard to get students to come back to class  but it is possible. This is my daughter  her name's Emma  she's    months old. And I've been asking myself  what is Emma going to experience in the video game world  And as I've shown here  we have the audience. She's never going to know a world where you can't press a button and have millions of people ready to play. You know  we have the technology. She's never going to know a world where the graphics just aren't stunning and really immersive. And as the student video showed  we can impact and move. She's never going to know a world where video games aren't incredibly emotional and will probably make her cry. I just hope she likes video games. So  my closing thought. Games on the surface seem simple entertainment  but for those that like to look a little deeper  the new paradigm of video games could open entirely new frontiers to creative minds that like to think big. Where better to challenge those minds than here at TED  Thank you. Chris Anderson  David Perry. That was awesome. So  indeed  I have spent my life looking into the lives of presidents who are no longer alive. Waking up with Abraham Lincoln in the morning  thinking of Franklin Roosevelt when I went to bed at night. But when I try and think about what I've learned about the meaning in life  my mind keeps wandering back to a seminar that I took when I was a graduate student at Harvard with the great psychologist Erik Erikson. He taught us that the richest and fullest lives attempt to achieve an inner balance between three realms  work  love and play. And that to pursue one realm to the disregard of the other  is to open oneself to ultimate sadness in older age. Whereas to pursue all three with equal dedication  is to make possible a life filled not only with achievement  but with serenity. So since I tell stories  let me look back on the lives of two of the presidents I've studied to illustrate this point    Abraham Lincoln and Lyndon Johnson. As for that first sphere of work  I think what Abraham Lincoln's life suggests is that fierce ambition is a good thing. He had a huge ambition. But it wasn't simply for office or power or celebrity or fame    what it was for was to accomplish something worthy enough in life so that he could make the world a little better place for his having lived in it. Even as a child  it seemed  Lincoln dreamed heroic dreams. He somehow had to escape that hard scrabble farm from which he was born. No schooling was possible for him  except a few weeks here  a few weeks there. But he read books in every spare moment he could find. It was said when he got a copy of the King James Bible or  Aesop's Fables   he was so excited he couldn't sleep. He couldn't eat. The great poet Emily Dickinson once said   There is no frigate like a book to take us lands away.  How true for Lincoln. Though he never would travel to Europe  he went with Shakespeare's kings to merry England  he went with Lord Byron's poetry to Spain and Portugal. Literature allowed him to transcend his surroundings. But there were so many losses in his early life that he was haunted by death. His mother died when he was only nine years old  his only sister  Sarah  in childbirth a few years later  and his first love  Ann Rutledge  at the age of   . Moreover  when his mother lay dying  she did not hold out for him the hope that they would meet in an afterworld. She simply said to him   Abraham  I'm going away from you now  and I shall never return.  As a result he became obsessed with the thought that when we die our life is swept away    dust to dust. But only as he grew older did he develop a certain consolation from an ancient Greek notion    but followed by other cultures as well    that if you could accomplish something worthy in your life  you could live on in the memory of others. Your honor and your reputation would outlive your earthly existence. And that worthy ambition became his lodestar. It carried him through the one significant depression that he suffered when he was in his early   s. Three things had combined to lay him low. He had broken his engagement with Mary Todd  not certain he was ready to marry her  but knowing how devastating it was to her that he did that. His one intimate friend  Joshua Speed  was leaving Illinois to go back to Kentucky because Speed's father had died. And his political career in the state legislature was on a downward slide. He was so depressed that friends worried he was suicidal. They took all knives and razors and scissors from his room. And his great friend Speed went to his side and said   Lincoln  you must rally or you will die.  He said that   I would just as soon die right now  but I've not yet done anything to make any human being remember that I have lived.  So fueled by that ambition  he returned to the state legislature. He eventually won a seat in Congress. He then ran twice for the Senate  lost twice.  Everyone is broken by life   Ernest Hemingway once said   but some people are stronger in the broken places.  So then he surprised the nation with an upset victory for the presidency over three far more experienced  far more educated  far more celebrated rivals. And then when he won the general election  he stunned the nation even more by appointing each of these three rivals into his Cabinet. It was an unprecedented act at the time because everybody thought   He'll look like a figurehead compared to these people.  They said   Why are you doing this  Lincoln   He said   Look  these are the strongest and most able men in the country. The country is in peril. I need them by my side.  But perhaps my old friend Lyndon Johnson might have put it in less noble fashion   Better to have your enemies inside the tent pissing out  than outside the tent pissing in.  But it soon became clear that Abraham Lincoln would emerge as the undisputed captain of this unruly team. For each of them soon came to understand that he possessed an unparalleled array of emotional strengths and political skills that proved far more important than the thinness of his external r sum . For one thing  he possessed an uncanny ability to empathize with and to think about other peoples' point of view. He repaired injured feelings that might have escalated into permanent hostility. He shared credit with ease  assumed responsibility for the failure of his subordinates  constantly acknowledged his errors and learned from his mistakes. These are the qualities we should be looking for in our candidates in     . He refused to be provoked by petty grievances. He never submitted to jealousy or brooded over perceived slights. And he expressed his unshakeable convictions in everyday language  in metaphors  in stories. And with a beauty of language    almost as if the Shakespeare and the poetry he had so loved as a child had worked their way into his very soul. In       when the Emancipation Proclamation was signed  he brought his old friend  Joshua Speed  back to the White House  and remembered that conversation of decades before  when he was so sad. And he  pointing to the Proclamation  said   I believe  in this measure  my fondest hopes will be realized.  But as he was about to put his signature on the Proclamation his own hand was numb and shaking because he had shaken a thousand hands that morning at a New Year's reception. So he put the pen down. He said   If ever my soul were in an act  it is in this act. But if I sign with a shaking hand  posterity will say  'He hesitated.'  So he waited until he could take up the pen and sign with a bold and clear hand. But even in his wildest dreams  Lincoln could never have imagined how far his reputation would reach. I was so thrilled to find an interview with the great Russian writer  Leo Tolstoy  in a New York newspaper in the early     s. And in it  Tolstoy told of a trip that he'd recently made to a very remote area of the Caucasus  where there were only wild barbarians  who had never left this part of Russia. Knowing that Tolstoy was in their midst  they asked him to tell stories of the great men of history. So he said   I told them about Napoleon and Alexander the Great and Frederick the Great and Julius Caesar  and they loved it. But before I finished  the chief of the barbarians stood up and said  'But wait  you haven't told us about the greatest ruler of them all. We want to hear about that man who spoke with a voice of thunder  who laughed like the sunrise  who came from that place called America  which is so far from here  that if a young man should travel there  he would be an old man when he arrived. Tell us of that man. Tell us of Abraham Lincoln.'  He was stunned. He told them everything he could about Lincoln. And then in the interview he said   What made Lincoln so great  Not as great a general as Napoleon  not as great a statesman as Frederick the Great.  But his greatness consisted  and historians would roundly agree  in the integrity of his character and the moral fiber of his being. So in the end that powerful ambition that had carried Lincoln through his bleak childhood had been realized. That ambition that had allowed him to laboriously educate himself by himself  to go through that string of political failures and the darkest days of the war. His story would be told. So as for that second sphere  not of work  but of love    encompassing family  friends and colleagues    it  too  takes work and commitment. The Lyndon Johnson that I saw in the last years of his life  when I helped him on his memoirs  was a man who had spent so many years in the pursuit of work  power and individual success  that he had absolutely no psychic or emotional resources left to get him through the days once the presidency was gone. My relationship with him began on a rather curious level. I was selected as a White House Fellow when I was    years old. We had a big dance at the White House. President Johnson did dance with me that night. Not that peculiar    there were only three women out of the    White House Fellows. But he did whisper in my ear that he wanted me to work directly for him in the White House. But it was not to be that simple. For in the months leading up to my selection  like many young people  I'd been active in the anti Vietnam War movement  and had written an article against Lyndon Johnson  which unfortunately came out in The New Republic two days after the dance in the White House. And the theme of the article was how to remove Lyndon Johnson from power. So I was certain he would kick me out of the program. But instead  surprisingly  he said   Oh  bring her down here for a year  and if I can't win her over  no one can.  So I did end up working for him in the White House. Eventually accompanied him to his ranch to help him on those memoirs  never fully understanding why he'd chosen me to spend so many hours with. I like to believe it was because I was a good listener. He was a great storyteller. Fabulous  colorful  anecdotal stories. There was a problem with these stories  however  which I later discovered  which is that half of them weren't true. But they were great  nonetheless. So I think that part of his attraction for me was that I loved listening to his tall tales. But I also worried that part of it was that I was then a young woman. And he had somewhat of a minor league womanizing reputation. So I constantly chatted to him about boyfriends  even when I didn't have any at all. Everything was working perfectly  until one day he said he wanted to discuss our relationship. Sounded very ominous when he took me nearby to the lake  conveniently called Lake Lyndon Baines Johnson. And there was wine and cheese and a red checked tablecloth    all the romantic trappings. And he started out   Doris  more than any other woman I have ever known ...   And my heart sank. And then he said   You remind me of my mother.  It was pretty embarrassing  given what was going on in my mind. But I must say  the older I've gotten  the more I realize what an incredible privilege it was to have spent so many hours with this aging lion of a man. A victor in a thousand contests  three great civil rights laws  Medicare  aid to education. And yet  roundly defeated in the end by the war in Vietnam. And because he was so sad and so vulnerable  he opened up to me in ways he never would have had I known him at the height of his power    sharing his fears  his sorrows and his worries. And I'd like to believe that the privilege fired within me the drive to understand the inner person behind the public figure  that I've tried to bring to each of my books since then. But it also brought home to me the lessons which Erik Erikson had tried to instill in all of us about the importance of finding balance in life. For on the surface  Lyndon Johnson should have had everything in the world to feel good about in those last years  in the sense that he had been elected to the presidency  he had all the money he needed to pursue any leisure activity he wanted  he owned a spacious ranch in the countryside  a penthouse in the city  sailboats  speedboats. He had servants to answer any whim  and he had a family who loved him deeply. And yet  years of concentration solely on work and individual success meant that in his retirement he could find no solace in family  in recreation  in sports or in hobbies. It was almost as if the hole in his heart was so large that even the love of a family  without work  could not fill it. As his spirits sagged  his body deteriorated until  I believe  he slowly brought about his own death. In those last years  he said he was so sad watching the American people look toward a new president and forgetting him. He spoke with immense sadness in his voice  saying maybe he should have spent more time with his children  and their children in turn. But it was too late. Despite all that power  all that wealth  he was alone when he finally died    his ultimate terror realized. So as for that third sphere of play  which he never had learned to enjoy  I've learned over the years that even this sphere requires a commitment of time and energy    enough so that a hobby  a sport  a love of music  or art  or literature  or any form of recreation  can provide true pleasure  relaxation and replenishment. So deep  for instance  was Abraham Lincoln's love of Shakespeare  that he made time to spend more than a hundred nights in the theater  even during those dark days of the war. He said  when the lights went down and a Shakespeare play came on  for a few precious hours he could imagine himself back in Prince Hal's time. But an even more important form of relaxation for him  that Lyndon Johnson never could enjoy  was a love of    somehow    humor  and feeling out what hilarious parts of life can produce as a sidelight to the sadness. He once said that he laughed so he did not cry  that a good story  for him  was better than a drop of whiskey. His storytelling powers had first been recognized when he was on the circuit in Illinois. The lawyers and the judges would travel from one county courthouse to the other  and when anyone was knowing Lincoln was in town  they would come from miles around to listen to him tell stories. He would stand with his back against a fire and entertain the crowd for hours with his winding tales. And all these stories became part of his memory bank  so he could call on them whenever he needed to. And they're not quite what you might expect from our marble monument. One of his favorite stories  for example  had to do with the Revolutionary War hero  Ethan Allen. And as Lincoln told the story  Mr. Allen went to Britain after the war. And the British people were still upset about losing the Revolution  so they decided to embarrass him a little bit by putting a huge picture of General Washington in the only outhouse  where he'd have to encounter it. They figured he'd be upset about the indignity of George Washington being in an outhouse. But he came out of the outhouse not upset at all. And so they said   Well  did you see George Washington in there    Oh  yes   he said   perfectly appropriate place for him.   What do you mean   they said.  Well   he said   there's nothing to make an Englishman shit faster than the sight of General George Washington.  So you can imagine  if you are in the middle of a tense cabinet meeting    and he had hundreds of these stories    you would have to relax. So between his nightly treks to the theater  his story telling  and his extraordinary sense of humor and his love of quoting Shakespeare and poetry  he found that form of play which carried him through his days. In my own life  I shall always be grateful for having found a form of play in my irrational love of baseball. Which allows me  from the beginning of spring training to the end of the fall  to have something to occupy my mind and heart other than my work. It all began when I was only six years old  and my father taught me that mysterious art of keeping score while listening to baseball games    so that when he went to work in New York during the day  I could record for him the history of that afternoon's Brooklyn Dodgers game. Now  when you're only six years old  and your father comes home every single night and listens to you    as I now realize that I  in excruciating detail  recounted every single play of every inning of the game that had just taken place that afternoon. But he made me feel I was telling him a fabulous story. It makes you think there's something magic about history to keep your father's attention. In fact  I'm convinced I learned the narrative art from those nightly sessions with my father. Because at first  I'd be so excited I would blurt out   The Dodgers won   or   The Dodgers lost   Which took much of the drama of this two hour telling away. So I finally learned you had to tell a story from beginning to middle to end. I must say  so fervent was my love of the old Brooklyn Dodgers in those days that I had to confess in my first confession two sins that related to baseball. The first occurred because the Dodgers' catcher  Roy Campanella  came to my hometown of Rockville Centre  Long Island  just as I was in preparation for my first Holy Communion. And I was so excited    first person I'd ever see outside of Ebbets Field. But it so happened he was speaking in a Protestant Church. When you are brought up as a Catholic  you think that if you ever set foot in a Protestant Church  you'll be struck dead at the threshold. So I went to my father in tears   What are we going to do   He said   Don't worry. He's speaking in a parish hall. We're sitting in folding chairs. He's talking about sportsmanship. It's not a sin.  But as I left that night  I was certain that somehow I'd traded the life of my everlasting soul for this one night with Roy Campanella. And there were no indulgences around that I could buy. So I had this sin on my soul when I went to my first confession. I told the priest right away. He said   No problem. It wasn't a religious service.  But then  unfortunately  he said   And what else  my child   And then came my second sin. I tried to sandwich it in between talking too much in church  wishing harm to others  being mean to my sisters. And he said   To whom did you wish harm   And I had to say that I wished that various New York Yankees players would break arms  legs and ankles       so that the Brooklyn Dodgers could win their first World Series. He said   How often do you make these horrible wishes   And I had to say  every night when I said my prayers. So he said   Look  I'll tell you something. I love the Brooklyn Dodgers  as you do  but I promise you some day they will win fairly and squarely. You do not need to wish harm on others to make it happen.   Oh yes   I said. But luckily  my first confession    to a baseball loving priest  Well  though my father died of a sudden heart attack when I was still in my   s  before I had gotten married and had my three sons  I have passed his memory    as well as his love of baseball    on to my boys. Though when the Dodgers abandoned us to come to L.A.  I lost faith in baseball until I moved to Boston and became an irrational Red Socks fan. And I must say  even now  when I sit with my sons with our season tickets  I can sometimes close my eyes against the sun and imagine myself  a young girl once more  in the presence of my father  watching the players of my youth on the grassy fields below  Jackie Robinson  Roy Campanella  Pee Wee Reese  and Duke Snider. I must say there is magic in these moments. When I open my eyes and I see my sons in the place where my father once sat  I feel an invisible loyalty and love linking my sons to the grandfather whose face they never had a chance to see  but whose heart and soul they have come to know through all the stories I have told. Which is why  in the end  I shall always be grateful for this curious love of history  allowing me to spend a lifetime looking back into the past. Allowing me to learn from these large figures about the struggle for meaning for life. Allowing me to believe that the private people we have loved and lost in our families  and the public figures we have respected in our history  just as Abraham Lincoln wanted to believe  really can live on  so long as we pledge to tell and to retell the stories of their lives. Thank you for letting me be that storyteller today. Thank you. I want to take you back basically to my hometown  and to a picture of my hometown of the week that  Emergence  came out. And it's a picture we've seen several times. Basically   Emergence  was published on     . I live right there in the West Village  so the plume was luckily blowing west  away from us. We had a two and a half day old baby in the house that was ours    we hadn't taken it from somebody else. And one of the thoughts that I had dealing with these two separate emergences of a book and a baby  and having this event happen so close    that my first thought  when I was still kind of in the apartment looking out at it all or walking out on the street and looking out on it just in front of our building  was that I'd made a terrible miscalculation in the book that I'd just written. Because so much of that book was a celebration of the power and creative potential of density  of largely urban density  of connecting people and putting them together in one place  and putting them on sidewalks together and having them share ideas and share physical space together. And it seemed to me looking at that    that tower burning and then falling  those towers burning and falling    that in fact  one of the lessons here was that density kills. And that of all the technologies that were exploited to make that carnage come into being  probably the single group of technologies that cost the most lives were those that enable        people to live in two buildings     stories above the ground. If they hadn't been crowded    you compare the loss of life at the Pentagon to the Twin Towers  and you can see that very powerfully. And so I started to think  well  you know  density  density    I'm not sure if  you know  this was the right call. And I kind of ruminated on that for a couple of days. And then about two days later  the wind started to change a little bit  and you could sense that the air was not healthy. And so even though there were no cars still in the West Village where we lived  my wife sent me out to buy a  you know  a large air filter at the Bed Bath and Beyond  which was located about    blocks away  north. And so I went out. And obviously I'm physically a very strong person  as you can tell     Laughter     so I wasn't worried about carrying this thing    blocks. And I walked out  and this really miraculous thing happened to me as I was walking north to buy this air filter  which was that the streets were completely alive with people. There was an incredible    it was  you know  a beautiful day  as it was for about a week after  and the West Village had never seemed more lively. I walked up along Hudson Street    where Jane Jacobs had lived and written her great book that so influenced what I was writing in  Emergence     past the White Horse Tavern  that great old bar where Dylan Thomas drank himself to death  and the Bleecker Street playground was filled with kids. And all the people who lived in the neighborhood  who owned restaurants and bars in the neighborhood  were all out there    had them all open. People were out. There were no cars  so it seemed even better  in some ways. And it was a beautiful urban day  and the incredible thing about it was that the city was working. The city was there. All the things that make a great city successful and all the things that make a great city stimulating    they were all on display there on those streets. And I thought  well  this is the power of a city. I mean  the power of the city    we talked about cities as being centralized in space  but what makes them so strong most of the time is they're decentralized in function. They don't have a center executive branch that you can take out and cause the whole thing to fail. If they did  it probably was right there at Ground Zero. I mean  you know  the emergency bunker was right there  was destroyed by the attacks  and obviously the damage done to the building and the lives. But nonetheless  just    blocks north  two days later  the city had never looked more alive. If you'd gone into the minds of the people  well  you would have seen a lot of trauma  and you would have seen a lot of heartache  and you would have seen a lot of things that would take a long time to recover. But the system itself of this city was thriving. So I took heart in seeing that. So I wanted to talk a little bit about the reasons why that works so well  and how some of those reasons kind of map on to where the Web is going right now. The question that I found myself asking to people when I was talking about the book afterwards is    when you've talked about emergent behavior  when you've talked about collective intelligence  the best way to get people to kind of wrap their heads around that is to ask  who builds a neighborhood  Who decides that Soho should have this personality and that the Latin Quarter should have this personality  Well  there are some kind of executive decisions  but mostly the answer is    everybody and nobody. Everybody contributes a little bit. No single person is really the ultimate actor behind the personality of a neighborhood. Same thing to the question of  who was keeping the streets alive post      in my neighborhood  Well  it was the whole city. The whole system kind of working on it  and everybody contributing a small little part. And this is increasingly what we're starting to see on the Web in a bunch of interesting ways    most of which weren't around  actually  except in very experimental things  when I was writing  Emergence  and when the book came out. So it's been a very optimistic time  I think  and I want to just talk about a few of those things. I think that there is effectively a new kind of model of interactivity that's starting to emerge online right now. And the old one looked like this. This is not the future King of England  although it looks like it. It's some guy  it's a GeoCities homepage of some guy that I found online who's interested  if you look at the bottom  in soccer and Jesus and Garth Brooks and Clint Beckham and  my hometown     those are his links. But nothing really says this model of interactivity    which was so exciting and captures the real  the Web Zeitgeist of         than  Click here for a picture of my dog.  That is    you know  there's no sentence that kind of conjures up that period better than that  I think  which is that you suddenly have the power to put up a picture of your dog and link to it  and somebody reading the page has the power to click on that link or not click on that link. And  you know  I don't want to belittle that. That  in a sense    to reference what Jeff was talking about yesterday    that was  in a sense  the kind of interface electricity that powered a lot of the explosion of interest in the Web  that you could put up a link  and somebody could click on it  and it could take you anywhere you wanted to go. But it's still a very one to one kind of relationship. There's one person putting up the link  and there's another person on the other end trying to decide whether to click on it or not. The new model is much more like this  and we've already seen a couple of references to this. This is what happens when you search  Steven Johnson  on Google. About two months ago  I had the great breakthrough    one of my great  kind of shining achievements    which is that my website finally became a top result for  Steven Johnson.  There's some theoretical physicist at MIT named Steven Johnson who has dropped two spots  I'm happy to say. And  you know  I mean  I'll look at a couple of things like this  but Google is obviously the greatest technology ever invented for navel gazing. It's just that there are so many other people in your navel when you gaze. Because effectively  what's happening here  what's creating this page  obviously    and we all know this  but it's worth just thinking about it    is not some person deciding that I am the number one answer for Steven Johnson  but rather somehow the entire web of people putting up pages and deciding to link to my page or not link to it  and Google just sitting there and running the numbers. So there's this collective decision making that's going on. This page is effectively  collectively authored by the Web  and Google is just helping us kind of to put the authorship in one kind of coherent place. Now  they're more innovative    well  Google's pretty innovative    but there are some new twists on this. There's this incredibly interesting new site    Technorati    that's filled with lots of little widgets that are expanding on these. And these are looking in the blog world and the world of weblogs. He's analyzed basically all the weblogs out there that he's tracking. And he's tracking how many other weblogs linked to those weblogs  and so you have kind of an authority    a weblog that has a lot of links to it is more authoritative than a weblog that has few links to it. And so at any given time  on any given page on the Web  actually  you can say  what does the weblog community think about this page  And you can get a list. This is what they think about my site  it's ranked by blog authority. You can also rank it by the latest posts. So when I was talking in  Emergence   I talked about the limitations of the one way linking architecture that  basically  you could link to somebody else but they wouldn't necessarily know that you were pointing to them. And that was one of the reasons why the web wasn't quite as emergent as it could be because you needed two way linking  you needed that kind of feedback mechanism to be able to really do interesting things. Well  something like Technorati is supplying that. Now what's interesting here is that this is a quote from Dave Weinberger  where he talks about everything being purposive in the Web    there's nothing artificial. He has this line where he says  you know  you're going to put up a link there  if you see a link  somebody decided to put it there. And he says  the link to one site didn't just grow on the other page  like a tree fungus.  And in fact  I think that's not entirely true anymore. I could put up a feed of all those links generated by Technorati on the right hand side of my page  and they would change as the overall ecology of the Web changes. That little list there would change. I wouldn't really be directly in control of it. So it's much closer  in a way  to a data fungus  in a sense  wrapped around that page  than it is to a deliberate link that I've placed there. Now  what you're having here is basically a global brain that you're able to do lots of kind of experiments on to see what it's thinking. And there are all these interesting tools. Google does the Google Zeitgeist  which looks at search requests to test what's going on  what people are interested in  and they publish it with lots of fun graphs. And I'm saying a lot of nice things about Google  so I'll be I'll be saying one little critical thing. There's a problem with the Google Zeitgeist  which is it often comes back with news that a lot of people are searching for Britney Spears pictures  which is not necessarily news. The Columbia blows up  suddenly there are a lot of searches on Columbia. Well  you know  we should expect to see that. That's not necessarily something we didn't know already. So the key thing in terms of these new tools that are kind of plumbing the depths of the global brain  that are sending kind of trace dyes through that whole bloodstream    the question is  are you finding out something new  And one of the things that I experimented with is this thing called Google Share which is basically  you take an abstract term  and you search Google for that term  and then you search the results that you get back for somebody's name. So basically  the number of pages that mention this term  that also mention this page  the percentage of those pages is that person's Google Share of that term. So you can do kind of interesting contests. Like for instance  this is a Google Share of the TED Conference. So Richard Saul Wurman has about a    percent Google Share of the TED conference. Our good friend Chris has about a six percent    but with a bullet  I might add. But the interesting thing is  you can broaden the search a little bit. And it turns out  actually  that    percent is the Mola mola fish. I had no idea. No  that's not true. I made that up because I just wanted to put up a slide of the Mola mola fish. I also did    and I don't want to start a little fight in the next panel    but I did a Google Share analysis of evolution and natural selection. So right here    now this is a big category  you have smaller percentages  so this is  .  percent    Dan Dennett  who'll be speaking shortly. Right below him   .  percent  Steven Pinker. So Dennett's in the lead a little bit there. But what's interesting is you can then broaden the search and actually see interesting things and get a sense of what else is out there. So Gary Bauer is not too far behind    has slightly different theories about evolution and natural selection. And right behind him is L. Ron Hubbard. So    you can see we're in the ascot  which is always good. And by the way  Chris  that would've been a really good panel  I think  right there. Hubbard apparently started to reach  but besides that  I think it would be good next year. Another quick thing    this is a slightly different thing  but this analysis some of you may have seen. It just came out. This is bursty words  looking at the historical record of State of the Union Addresses. So these are words that suddenly start to appear out of nowhere  so they're kind of  you know  memes that start taking off  that didn't have a lot of historical precedent before. So the first one is    these are the bursty words around     s    slaves  emancipation  slavery  rebellion  Kansas. That's Britney Spears. I mean  you know  OK  interesting. They're talking about slavery in     .         relief  depression  recovery banks. And OK  I didn't learn anything new there as well    that's pretty obvious.       right at the center of the Reagan years    that's  we're  there's  we've  it's. Now  there's one way to interpret this  which is to say that  emancipation  and  depression  and  recovery  all have a lot of syllables. So you know  you can actually download    it's hard to remember those. But seriously  actually  what you can see there  in a way that would be very hard to detect otherwise  is Reagan reinventing the political language of the country and shifting to a much more intimate  much more folksy  much more telegenic    contracting all those verbs. You know     years before it was still   Ask not what you can do   but with Reagan  it's   that's where  there's Nancy and I   that kind of language. And so something we kind of knew  but you didn't actually notice syntactically what he was doing. I'll go very quickly. The question now    and this is the really interesting question    is  what kind of higher level shape is emerging right now in the overall Web ecosystem    and particularly in the ecosystem of the blogs because they are really kind of at the cutting edge. And I think what happens there will also happen in the wider system. Now there was a very interesting article by Clay Shirky that got a lot of attention about a month ago  and this is basically the distribution of links on the web to all these various different blogs. It follows a power law  so that there are a few extremely well linked to  popular blogs  and a long tail of blogs with very few links. So    percent of the blogs get    percent of the links. Now this is a very interesting thing. It's caused a lot of controversy because people thought that this was the ultimate kind of one man  one modem democracy  where anybody can get out there and get their voice heard. And so the question is   Why is this happening   It's not being imposed by fiat from above. It's an emergent property of the blogosphere right now. Now  what's great about it is that people are working on    within seconds of Clay publishing this piece  people started working on changing the underlying rules of the system so that a different shape would start appearing. And basically  the shape appears largely because of a kind of a first mover advantage. if you're the first site there  everybody links to you. If you're the second site there  most people link to you. And so very quickly you can accumulate a bunch of links  and it makes it more likely for newcomers to link to you in the future  and then you get this kind of shape. And so what Dave Sifry at Technorati started working on  literally as Shirky started    after he published his piece    was something that basically just gave a new kind of priority to newcomers. And he started looking at interesting newcomers that don't have a lot of links  that suddenly get a bunch of links in the last    hours. So in a sense  bursty weblogs coming from new voices. So he's working on a tool right there that can actually change the overall system. And it creates a kind of planned emergence. You're not totally in control  but you're changing the underlying rules in interesting ways because you have an end result which is maybe a more democratic spread of voices. So the most amazing thing about this    and I'll end on this note    is  most emergent systems  most self organizing systems are not made up of component parts that are capable of looking at the overall pattern and changing their behavior based on whether they like the pattern or not. So the most wonderful thing  I think  about this whole debate about power laws and software that could change it is the fact that we're having the conversation. I hope it continues here. Thanks a lot. Whoa  dude. Check out those killer equations. Sweet.  Laughter  Actually  for the next    minutes I'm going to do the best I can to describe the beauty of particle physics without equations. It turns out there's a lot we can learn from coral. Coral is a very beautiful and unusual animal. Each coral head consists of thousand of individual polyps. These polyps are continually budding and branching into genetically identical neighbors. If we imagine this to be a hyper intelligent coral  we can single out an individual and ask him a reasonable question. We can ask how exactly he got to be in this particular location compared to his neighbors    if it was just chance  or destiny  or what  Now  after admonishing us for turning the temperature up too high  he would tell us that our question was completely stupid. These corals can be quite kind of mean  you see  and I have surfing scars to prove that. But this polyp would continue and tell us that his neighbors were quite clearly identical copies of him. That he was in all these other locations as well  but experiencing them as separate individuals. For a coral  branching into different copies is the most natural thing in the world. Unlike us  a hyper intelligent coral would be uniquely prepared to understand quantum mechanics. The mathematics of quantum mechanics very accurately describes how our universe works. And it tells us our reality is continually branching into different possibilities  just like a coral. It's a weird thing for us humans to wrap our minds around  since we only ever get to experience one possibility. This quantum weirdness was first described by Erwin Schr dinger and his cat. The cat likes this version better. In this setup  Schr dinger is in a box with a radioactive sample that  by the laws of quantum mechanics  branches into a state in which it is radiated and a state in which it is not. In the branch in which the sample radiates  it sets off a trigger that releases poison and Schr dinger is dead. But in the other branch of reality  he remains alive. These realities are experienced separately by each individual. As far as either can tell  the other one doesn't exist. This seems weird to us  because each of us only experiences an individual existence  and we don't get to see other branches. It's as if each of us  like Schr dinger here  are a kind of coral branching into different possibilities. The mathematics of quantum mechanics tells us this is how the world works at tiny scales. It can be summed up in a single sentence  Everything that can happen  does. That's quantum mechanics. But this does not mean everything happens. The rest of physics is about describing what can happen and what can't. What physics tells us is that everything comes down to geometry and the interactions of elementary particles. And things can happen only if these interactions are perfectly balanced. Now I'll go ahead and describe how we know about these particles  what they are and how this balance works. In this machine  a beam of protons and anti protons are accelerated to near the speed of light and brought together in a collision  producing a burst of pure energy. This energy is immediately converted into a spray of subatomic particles  with detectors and computers used to figure out their properties. This enormous machine    the large Hadron Collider at CERN in Geneva    has a circumference of    miles and  when it's operating  draws five times as much power as the city of Monterey. We can't predict specifically what particles will be produced in any individual collision. Quantum mechanics tells us all possibilities are realized. But physics does tell us what particles can be produced. These particles must have just as much mass and energy as is carried in by the proton and anti proton. Any particles more massive than this energy limit aren't produced  and remain invisible to us. This is why this new particle accelerator is so exciting. It's going to push this energy limit seven times beyond what's ever been done before  so we're going to get to see some new particles very soon. But before talking about what we might see  let me describe the particles we already know of. There's a whole zoo of subatomic particles. Most of us are familiar with electrons. A lot of people in this room make a good living pushing them around. But the electron also has a neutral partner called the neutrino  with no electric charge and a very tiny mass. In contrast  the up and down quarks have very large masses  and combine in threes to make the protons and neutrons inside atoms. All of these matter particles come in left  and right handed varieties  and have anti particle partners that carry opposite charges. These familiar particles also have less familiar second and third generations  which have the same charges as the first but have much higher masses. These matter particles all interact with the various force particles. The electromagnetic force interacts with electrically charged matter via particles called photons. There is also a very weak force called  rather unimaginatively  the weak force  that interacts only with left handed matter. The strong force acts between quarks which carry a different kind of charge  called color charge  and come in three different varieties  red  green and blue. You can blame Murray Gell Mann for these names    they're his fault. Finally  there's the force of gravity  which interacts with matter via its mass and spin. The most important thing to understand here is that there's a different kind of charge associated with each of these forces. These four different forces interact with matter according to the corresponding charges that each particle has. A particle that hasn't been seen yet  but we're pretty sure exists  is the Higgs particle  which gives masses to all these other particles. The main purpose of the Large Hadron Collider is to see this Higgs particle  and we're almost certain it will. But the greatest mystery is what else we might see. And I'm going to show you one beautiful possibility towards the end of this talk. Now  if we count up all these different particles using their various spins and charges  there are    . That's a lot of particles to keep track of. And it seems strange that nature would have so many elementary particles. But if we plot them out according to their charges  some beautiful patterns emerge. The most familiar charge is electric charge. Electrons have an electric charge  a negative one  and quarks have electric charges in thirds. So when two up quarks and a down quark are combined to make a proton  it has a total electric charge of plus one. These particles also have anti particles  which have opposite charges. Now  it turns out the electric charge is actually a combination of two other charges  hypercharge and weak charge. If we spread out the hypercharge and weak charge and plot the charges of particles in this two dimensional charge space  the electric charge is where these particles sit along the vertical direction. The electromagnetic and weak forces interact with matter according to their hypercharge and weak charge  which make this pattern. This is called the Unified Electroweak Model  and it was put together back in     . The reason most of us are only familiar with electric charge and not both of these is because of the Higgs particle. The Higgs  over here on the left  has a large mass and breaks the symmetry of this electroweak pattern. It makes the weak force very weak by giving the weak particles a large mass. Since this massive Higgs sits along the horizontal direction in this diagram  the photons of electromagnetism remain massless and interact with electric charge along the vertical direction in this charge space. So the electromagnetic and weak forces are described by this pattern of particle charges in two dimensional space. We can include the strong force by spreading out its two charge directions and plotting the charges of the force particles in quarks along these directions. The charges of all known particles can be plotted in a four dimensional charge space  and projected down to two dimensions like this so we can see them. Whenever particles interact  nature keeps things in a perfect balance along all four of these charge directions. If a particle and an anti particle collide  it creates a burst of energy and a total charge of zero in all four charge directions. At this point  anything can be created as long as it has the same energy and maintains a total charge of zero. For example  this weak force particle and its anti particle can be created in a collision. In further interactions  the charges must always balance. One of the weak particles could decay into an electron and an anti neutrino  and these three still add to zero total charge. Nature always keeps a perfect balance. So these patterns of charges are not just pretty. They tell us what interactions are allowed to happen. And we can rotate this charge space in four dimensions to get a better look at the strong interaction  which has this nice hexagonal symmetry. In a strong interaction  a strong force particle  such as this one  interacts with a colored quark  such as this green one  to give a quark with a different color charge    this red one. And strong interactions are happening millions of times each second in every atom of our bodies  holding the atomic nuclei together. But these four charges corresponding to three forces are not the end of the story. We can also include two more charges corresponding to the gravitational force. When we include these  each matter particle has two different spin charges  spin up and spin down. So they all split  and give a nice pattern in six dimensional charge space. We can rotate this pattern in six dimensions  and see that it's quite pretty. Right now  this pattern matches our best current knowledge of how nature is built at the tiny scales of these elementary particles. This is what we know for certain. Some of these particles are at the very limit of what we've been able to reach with experiments. From this pattern  we already know the particle physics of these tiny scales. The way the universe works with these tiny scales is very beautiful. But now I'm going to discuss some new and old ideas about things we don't know yet. We want to expand this pattern using mathematics alone  and see if we can get our hands on the whole enchilada. We want to find all the particles and forces that make a complete picture of our universe. And we want to use this picture to predict new particles that we'll see when experiments reach higher energies. So there's an old idea in particle physics that this known pattern of charges  which is not very symmetric  could emerge from a more perfect pattern that gets broken    similar to how the Higgs particle breaks the electroweak pattern to give electromagnetism. In order to do this  we need to introduce new forces with new charge directions. When we introduce a new direction  we get to guess what charges the particles have along this direction  and then we can rotate it in with the others. If we guess wisely  we can construct the standard charges in six charge dimensions as a broken symmetry of this more perfect pattern in seven charge dimensions. This particular choice corresponds to a grand unified theory introduced by Pati and Salam in     . When we look at this new unified pattern  we can see a couple of gaps where particles seem to be missing. This is the way theories of unification work. A physicist looks for larger  more symmetric patterns that include the established pattern as a subset. The larger pattern allows us to predict the existence of particles that have never been seen. This unification model predicts the existence of these two new force particles  which should act a lot like the weak force  only weaker. Now we can rotate this set of charges in seven dimensions and consider an odd fact about the matter particles  the second and third generations of matter have exactly the same charges in six dimensional charge space as the first generation. These particles are not uniquely identified by their six charges. They sit on top of one another in the standard charge space. However  if we work in eight dimensional charge space  then we can assign unique new charges to each particle. Then we can spin these in eight dimensions  and see what the whole pattern looks like. Here we can see the second and third generations of matter now related to the first generation by a symmetry called  triality.  This particular pattern of charges in eight dimensions is actually part of the most beautiful geometric structure in mathematics. It's a pattern of the largest exceptional Lie group  E . This Lie group is a smooth  curved shape with     dimensions. Each point in this pattern corresponds to a symmetry of this very complex and beautiful shape. One small part of this E  shape can be used to describe the curved space time of Einstein's general relativity  explaining gravity. Together with quantum mechanics  the geometry of this shape could describe everything about how the universe works at the tiniest scales. The pattern of this shape living in eight dimensional charge space is exquisitely beautiful  and it summarizes thousands of possible interactions between these elementary particles  each of which is just a facet of this complicated shape. As we spin it  we can see many of the other intricate patterns contained in this one. And with a particular rotation  we can look down through this pattern in eight dimensions along a symmetry axis and see all the particles at once. It's a very beautiful object  and as with any unification  we can see some holes where new particles are required by this pattern. There are    gaps where new particles should be  two of which have been filled by the Pati Salam particles. From their location in this pattern  we know that these new particles should be scalar fields like the Higgs particle  but have color charge and interact with the strong force. Filling in these new particles completes this pattern  giving us the full E . This E  pattern has very deep mathematical roots. It's considered by many to be the most beautiful structure in mathematics. It's a fantastic prospect that this object of great mathematical beauty could describe the truth of particle interactions at the smallest scales imaginable. And this idea that nature is described by mathematics is not at all new. In       Galileo wrote this   Nature's grand book  which stands continually open to our gaze  is written in the language of mathematics. Its characters are triangles  circles and other geometrical figures  without which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it  without these  one is wandering around in a dark labyrinth.  I believe this to be true  and I've tried to follow Galileo's guidance in describing the mathematics of particle physics using only triangles  circles and other geometrical figures. Of course  when other physicists and I actually work on this stuff  the mathematics can resemble a dark labyrinth. But it's reassuring that at the heart of this mathematics is pure  beautiful geometry. Joined with quantum mechanics  this mathematics describes our universe as a growing E  coral  with particles interacting at every location in all possible ways according to a beautiful pattern. And as more of the pattern comes into view using new machines like the Large Hadron Collider  we may be able to see whether nature uses this E  pattern or a different one. This process of discovery is a wonderful adventure to be involved in. If the LHC finds particles that fit this E  pattern  that will be very  very cool. If the LHC finds new particles  but they don't fit this pattern    well  that will be very interesting  but bad for this E  theory. And  of course  bad for me personally. Now how bad would that be  Well  pretty bad. But predicting how nature works is a very risky game. This theory and others like it are long shots. One does a lot of hard work knowing that most of these ideas probably won't end up being true about nature. That's what doing theoretical physics is like  there are a lot of wipeouts. In this regard  new physics theories are a lot like start up companies. As with any large investment  it can be emotionally difficult to abandon a line of research when it isn't working out. But in science  if something isn't working  you have to toss it out and try something else. Now  the only way to maintain sanity and achieve happiness in the midst of this uncertainty is to keep balance and perspective in life. I've tried the best I can to live a balanced life. I try to balance my life equally between physics  love and surfing    my own three charge directions. This way  even if the physics I work on comes to nothing  I still know I've lived a good life. And I try to live in beautiful places. For most of the past ten years I've lived on the island of Maui  a very beautiful place. Now it's one of the greatest mysteries in the universe to my parents how I managed to survive all that time without engaging in anything resembling full time employment. I'm going to let you in on that secret. This was a view from my home office on Maui. And this is another  and another. And you may have noticed that these beautiful views are similar  but in slightly different places. That's because this used to be my home and office on Maui. I've chosen a very unusual life. But not worrying about rent allowed me to spend my time doing what I love. Living a nomadic existence has been hard at times  but it's allowed me to live in beautiful places and keep a balance in my life that I've been happy with. It allows me to spend a lot of my time hanging out with hyper intelligent coral. But I also greatly enjoy the company of hyper intelligent people. So I'm very happy to have been invited here to TED. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  I probably understood two percent of that  but I still absolutely loved it. So I'm going to sound dumb. Your theory of everything    Garrett Lisi  I'm used to coral. CA  That's right. The reason it's got a few people at least excited is because  if you're right  it brings gravity and quantum theory together. So are you saying that we should think of the universe  at its heart    that the smallest things that there are  are somehow an E  object of possibility  I mean  is there a scale to it  at the smallest scale  or ...  GL  Well  right now the pattern I showed you that corresponds to what we know about elementary particle physics    that already corresponds to a very beautiful shape. And that's the one that I said we knew for certain. And that shape has remarkable similarities    and the way it fits into this E  pattern could be the rest of the picture. And these patterns of points that I've shown for you actually represent symmetries of this high dimensional object that would be warping and moving and dancing over the space time that we experience. And that would be what explains all these elementary particles that we see. CA  But a string theorist  as I understand it  explains electrons in terms of much smaller strings vibrating    I know you don't like string theory    vibrating inside it. How should we think of an electron in relation to E   GL  No  it would be one of the symmetries of this E  shape. So what's happening is  as the shape is moving over space time  it's twisting. And the direction it's twisting as it moves is what particle we see. So it would be    CA  The size of the E  shape  how does that relate to the electron  I kind of feel like I need that for my picture. Is it bigger  Is it smaller  GL  Well  as far as we know electrons are point particles  so this would be going down to the smallest possible scales. So the way these things are explained in quantum field theory is  all possibilities are expanding and developing at once. And this is why I use the analogy to coral. And in this way  the way that E  comes in is it will be as a shape that's attached at each point in space time. And  as I said  the way the shape twists    the directional along which way the shape is twisting as it moves over this curved surface    is what the elementary particles are  themselves. So through quantum field theory  they manifest themselves as points and interact that way. I don't know if I'll be able to make this any clearer. CA  It doesn't really matter. It's evoking a kind of sense of wonder  and I certainly want to understand more of this. But thank you so much for coming. That was absolutely fascinating. I dabble in design. I'm a curator of architecture and design  I happen to be at the Museum of Modern Art. But what we're going to talk about today is really design. Really good designers are like sponges  they really are curious and absorb every kind of information that comes their way  and transform it so that it can be used by people like us. And so that gives me an opportunity  because every design show that I curate kind of looks at a different world. And it's great  because it seems like every time I change jobs. And what I'm going to do today is I'm going to give you a preview of the next exhibition that I'm working on  which is called  Design and the Elastic Mind.  The world that I decided to focus on this particular time is the world of science and the world of technology. Technology always comes into play when design is involved  but science does a little less. But designers are great at taking big revolutions that happen and transforming them so that we can use them. And this is what this exhibition looks at. If you think about your life today  you go every day through many different scales  many different changes of rhythm and pace. You work over different time zones  you talk to very different people  you multitask. We all know it  and we do it kind of automatically. Some of the minds in this audience are super elastic  others are a little slower  others have a few stretch marks  but nonetheless this is a quite exceptional audience from that viewpoint. Other people are not as elastic. I can't get my father in Italy to work on the Internet. He doesn't want to put high speed Internet at home. And that's because there's some little bit of fear  little bit of resistance or just clogged mechanisms. So designers work on this particular malaise that we have  these kinds of discomforts that we have  and try to make life easier for us. Elasticity of mind is something that we really need  you know  we really need  we really cherish and we really work on. And this exhibition is about the work of designers that help us be more elastic  and also of designers that really work on this elasticity as an opportunity. And one last thing is that it's not only designers  but it's also scientists. And before I launch into the display of some of the slides and into the preview  I would like to point out this beautiful detail about scientists and design. You can say that the relationship between science and design goes back centuries. You can of course talk about Leonardo da Vinci and many other Renaissance men and women    and there's a gigantic history behind it. But according to a really great science historian you might know  Peter Galison    he teaches at Harvard    what nanotechnology in particular and quantum physics have brought to designers is this renewed interest  this real passion for design. So basically  the idea of being able to build things bottom up  atom by atom  has made them all into tinkerers. And all of a sudden scientists are seeking designers  just like designers are seeking scientists. It's a brand new love affair that we're trying to cultivate at MOMA. Together with Adam Bly  who is the founder of Seed magazine    that's now a multimedia company  you might know it    we founded about a year ago a monthly salon for designers and scientists  and it's quite beautiful. And Keith has come  and also Jonathan has come and many others. And it was great  because at the beginning was this apology fest    you know  scientists would tell designers  you know  I don't know what style is  I'm not really elegant. And designers would like  oh  I don't know how to do an equation  I don't understand what you're saying. And then all of a sudden they really started talking each others' language  and now we're already at the point that they collaborate. Paul Steinhardt  a physicist from New York  and Aranda Lasch  architects  collaborated in an installation in London at the Serpentine. And it's really interesting to see how this happens. The exhibition will talk about the work of both designers and scientists  and show how they're presenting the possibilities of the future to us. I'm showing to you different sections of the show right now  just to give you a taste of it. Nanophysics and nanotechnology  for instance  have really opened the designer's mind. In this case I'm showing more the designers' work  because they're the ones that have really been stimulated. A lot of the objects in the show are concepts  not objects that exist already. But what you're looking at here is the work of some scientists from UCLA. This kind of alphabet soup is a new way to mark proteins    not only by color but literally by alphabet letters. So they construct it  and they can construct all kinds of forms at the nanoscale. This is the work of design students from the Royal College of Arts in London that have been working together with their tutor  Tony Dunne  and with a bunch of scientists around Great Britain on the possibilities of nanotechnology for design in the future. New sensing elements on the body    you can grow hairs on your nails  and therefore grab some of the particles from another person. They seem very  very obsessed with finding out more about the ideal mate. So they're working on enhancing everything  touch  smell    everything they can  in order to find the perfect mate. Very interesting. This is a typeface designer from Israel who has designed    he calls them  typosperma.  He's thinking    of course it's all a concept    of injecting typefaces into spermatozoa  I don't know how to say it in English    spermatazoi    in order to make them become    to almost have a song or a whole poem written with every ejaculation.  Laughter  I tell you  designers are quite fantastic  you know. So  tissue design. In this case too  you have a mixture of scientists and designers. This here is part of the same lab at the Royal College of Arts. The RCA is really quite an amazing school from that viewpoint. One of the assignments for a year was to work with in vitro meat. You know that already you can grow meat in vitro. In Australia they did it    this research company  called SymbioticA. But the problem is that it's a really ugly patty. And so  the assignment to the students was  how should the steak of tomorrow be  When you don't have to kill cows and it can have any shape  what should it be like  So this particular student  James King  went around the beautiful English countryside  picked the best  best cow that he could see  and then put her in the MRI machine. Then  he took the scans of the best organs and made the meat    of course  this is done with a Japanese resins food maker  but you know  in the future it could be made better    which reproduces the best MRI scan of the best cow he could find. Instead  this element here is much more banal. Something that you know can be done already is to grow bone tissue  so that you can make a wedding ring out of the bone tissue of your loved one    literally. So  this is indeed made of human bone tissue. This is SymbioticA  and they've been working    they were the first ones to do this in vitro meat    and now they've also done an in vitro coat  a leather coat. It's miniscule  but it's a real coat. It's shaped like one. So  we'll be able to really not have any excuse to be wearing everything leather in the future. One of the most important topics of the show    you know  as anything in our life today  we can look at it from many  many different viewpoints  and at different levels. One of the most interesting and most important concepts is the idea of scale. We change scale very often  we change resolution of screens  and we're not really fazed by it  we do it very comfortably. So you go  even in the exhibition  from the idea of nanotechnology and the nanoscale to the manipulation of really great amounts of data    the mapping and tagging of the universe and of the world. In this particular case a section will be devoted to information design. You see here the work of Ben Fry. This is  Human vs. Chimps     the few chromosomes that distinguish us from chimps. It was a beautiful visualization that he did for Seed magazine. And here's the whole code of Pac Man  visualized with all the go to  go back to  also made into a beautiful choreography. And then also graphs by scientists  this beautiful diagraph of protein homology. Scientists are starting to also consider aesthetics. We were discussing with Keith Shrubb  this morning the fact that many scientists tend not to use anything beautiful in their presentations  otherwise they're afraid of being considered dumb blondes. So they pick the worst background from any kind of PowerPoint presentation  the worst typeface. It's only recently that this kind of marriage between design and science is producing some of the first  pretty     if we can say so    scientific presentations. Another aspect of contemporary design that I think is mind opening  promising and will really be the future of design  is the idea of collective design. You know  the whole XO laptop  from One Laptop per Child  is based on the idea of collaboration and mash and networking. So  the more the merrier. The more computers  the stronger the signal  and children work on the interface so that it's all based on doing things together  tasks together. So the idea of collective design is something that will become even bigger in the future  and this is chosen as an example. Related to the idea of collective design and to the new balance between the individual and the collectiveness  collectivity is the idea of existence maximum. That's a term that I coined a few years ago while I was thinking of how pressed we are together  and at the same time how these small objects  like the Walkman first and then the iPod  create bubbles of space around us that enable us to have a metaphysical space that is much bigger than our physical space. You can be in the subway and you can be completely isolated and have your own room in your iPod. And this is the work of several designers that really enhance the idea of solitude and expansion by means of various techniques. This is a spa telephone. The idea is that it's become so difficult to have a private conversation anywhere that you go to the spa  you have a massage  you have a facial  maybe a rub  and then you have this beautiful pool with this perfect temperature  and you can have this isolation tank phone conversation with whomever you've been wanting to talk with for a long time. And same thing here  Social Tele presence. It's actually already used by the military a little bit  but it's the idea of being able to be somewhere else with your senses while you're removed from it physically. And this is called Blind Date. It's a  unclear   so if you're too shy to be really at the date  you can stay at a distance with your flowers and somebody else reenacts the date for you. Rapid manufacturing is another big area in which technology and design are  I think  bound to change the world. You've heard about it before many times. Rapid manufacturing is a computer file sent directly from the computer to the manufacturing machine. It used to be called rapid prototyping  rapid modeling. It started out in the '  s  but at the beginning it was machines carving out of a foam block a model that was very  very fragile  and could not have any real use. Slowly but surely  the materials became better    better resins. Techniques became better    not only carving but also stereolithography and laser    solidifying all kinds of resins  whether in powder or in liquid form. And the vats became bigger  to the point that now we can have actual chairs made by rapid manufacturing. It takes seven days today to manufacture a chair  but you know what  One day it will take seven hours. And then the dream is that you'll be able to  from home  customize your chair. You know  companies and designers will be designing the matrix or the margins that respect both solidity and brand  and design identity. And then you can send it to the Kinko's store at the corner and go get your chair. Now  the implications of this are enormous  not only regarding the participation of the final buyer in the design process  but also no tracking  no warehousing  no wasted materials. Also  I can imagine many design manufacturers will have to retool their own business plans and maybe invest in this Kinko's store. But it really is a big change. And here I'm showing a picture that was in Wired Magazine    you know  the Artifacts of the Future section that I love so much    that shows you can have your desktop  D printer and print your own basketball. But here instead are examples  you can already  D print textiles  which is very interesting. This is just a really nice touch    it's called slow prototyping. It's a designer that put        bees at work and they built this vase. They had a particular shape that they had to stay in. Mapping and tagging. As the capacity of computers becomes really  really big  and the capacity of our mind not that much bigger  we find that we need to tag as much as we can what we do in order to then retrace our path. Also  we do it in order to share with other people. Again  this communal sense of experience that seems to be so important today. So  various ways to map and tag are also the work of many designers nowadays. Also  the senses    designers and scientists all work on trying to expand our senses capabilities so that we can achieve more. And also animal senses in a way. This particular object that many people love so much is actually based on kind of a scientific experiment    the fact that bees have a very strong olfactory sense  and so    much like dogs that can smell certain kinds of skin cancer    bees can be trained by Pavlovian reflex to detect one type of cancer  and also pregnancy. And so this student at the RCA designed this beautiful blown glass object where the bees move from one chamber to the other if they detect that particular smell that signifies  in this case  pregnancy. Another shape is made for cancer. Design for Debate is a very interesting new endeavor that designers have really shaped for themselves. Some designers don't design objects  products  things that we're going to actually use  but rather  they design scenarios that are object based. They're still very useful. They help companies and other designers think better about the future. And usually they are accompanied by videos. This is quite beautiful. It's Dunne and Raby   All the Robots.  Those are a series of robots that are meant to be taken care of. We always think that robots will take care of us  and instead they designed these robots that are very  very needy. You need to take one in your arms and look at it in the eyes for about five minutes before it does something. Another one gets really  really nervous if you get in to the room  and starts shaking  so you have to calm it down. So it's really a way to make us think more about what robots mean to us. Noam Toran and  Accessories for Lonely Men   the idea is that when you lose your loved one or you go through a bad breakup  what you miss the most are those annoying things that you used to hate when you were with the other person. So he designed all these series of accessories. This one is something that takes away the sheets from you at night. Then there's another one that breathes on your neck. There's another one that throws plates and breaks them. So it's just this idea of what we really miss in life. Elio Caccavale  he took the idea of those dolls that explain leukemia. He's working on dolls that explain xenotransplantation  and also the spider gene into the goat  from a few years ago. He's working for the exhibition on a whole series of dolls that explain to children where babies come from today. Because it's not anymore Mom  Dad  the flowers and the bees  and then there's the baby. No  it can be two moms  three dads  in vitro    there's the whole idea of how babies can be made today that has changed. So it's a series of dolls that he's working on right now. One of the most beautiful things is that designers really work on life  even though they take technology into account. And many designers have been working recently on the idea of death and mourning  and what we can do about it today with new technologies. Or how we should behave about it with new technologies. These three objects over there are hard drives with a Bluetooth connection. But they're in reality very  very beautiful sculpted artifacts that contain the whole desktop and computer memory of somebody who passed away. So instead of having only the pictures  you will be able to put this object next to the computer and all of a sudden have  you know  Gertrude's whole life and all of her files and her address book come alive. And this is even better. This is Auger Loizeau   AfterLife.  It's the idea that some people don't believe in an afterlife. So to give them something tangible that shows that there is something after death  they take the gastric juices of people who passed away and concentrate them  and put them into a battery that can actually be used to power flashlights. They also go    you know  sex toys  whatever. It's quite amazing how these things can make you smile  can make you laugh  can make you cry sometimes. But I'm hoping that this particular exhibition will be able to trace a new portrait of where design is going    which is always  hopefully  a portrait a few years in advance of where the world is going. Thank you very much. You might be wondering why I'm wearing sunglasses  and one answer to that is  because I'm here to talk about glamour. So  we all think we know what glamour is. Here it is. It's glamorous movie stars  like Marlene Dietrich. And it comes in a male form  too    very glamorous. Not only can he shoot  drive  drink    you know  he drinks wine  there actually is a little wine in there    and of course  always wears a tuxedo. But I think that glamour actually has a much broader meaning    one that is true for the movie stars and the fictional characters  but also comes in other forms. A magazine  Well  it's certainly not this one. This is the least glamorous magazine on the newsstand    it's all about sex tips. Sex tips are not glamorous. And Drew Barrymore  for all her wonderful charm  is not glamorous either. But there is a glamour of industry. This is Margaret Bourke White's    one of her pictures she did. Fantastic  glamorous pictures of steel mills and paper mills and all kinds of glamorous industrial places. And there's the mythic glamour of the garage entrepreneur. This is the Hewlett Packard garage. We know everyone who starts a business in a garage ends up founding Hewlett Packard. There's the glamour of physics. What could be more glamorous than understanding the entire universe  grand unification  And  by the way  it helps if you're Brian Greene    he has other kinds of glamour. And there is  of course  this glamour. This is very  very glamorous  the glamour of outer space    and not the alien style glamour  but the nice  clean  early '  s version. So what do we mean by glamour  Well  one thing you can do if you want to know what glamour means is you can look in the dictionary. And it actually helps a lot more if you look in a very old dictionary  in this case the      dictionary. Because for centuries  glamour had a very particular meaning  and the word was actually used differently from the way we think of it. You had  a  glamour. It wasn't glamour as a quality    you  cast a glamour.  Glamour was a literal magic spell. Not a metaphorical one  the way we use it today  but a literal magic spell associated with witches and gypsies and to some extent  Celtic magic. And over the years  around the turn of the   th century  it started to take on this other kind of deception    this definition for any artificial interest in  or association with  an object through which it appears delusively magnified or glorified. But still  glamour is an illusion. Glamour is a magic spell. And there's something dangerous about glamour throughout most of history. When the witches cast a magic spell on you  it was not in your self interest    it was to get you to act against your interest. Well of course  in the   th century  glamour came to have this different meaning associated with Hollywood. And this is Hedy Lamarr. Hedy Lamarr said   Anyone can look glamorous  all you have to do is sit there and look stupid.   Laughter  But in fact  with all due respect to Hedy    about whom we'll hear more later    there's a lot more to it. There was a tremendous amount of technical achievement associated with creating this Hollywood glamour. There were scores of retouchers and lighting experts and make up experts. You can go to the museum of Hollywood history in Hollywood and see Max Factor's special rooms that he painted different colors depending on the complexion of the star he was going to make up. So you've got this highly stylized portrait of something that was not entirely of this earth    it was a portrait of a star. And actually  we see glamorized photos of stars all the time    they call them false color. Glamour is a form of falsification  but falsification to achieve a particular purpose. It may be to illuminate the star  it may be to sell a film. And it involves a great deal of technique. It's not    glamour is not something    you don't wake up in the morning glamorous. I don't care who you are. Even Nicole Kidman doesn't wake up in the morning glamorous. There is a process of  idealization  glorification and dramatization   and it's not just the case for people. Glamour doesn't have to be people. Architectural photography    Julius Schulman  who has talked about transfiguration  took this fabulous  famous picture of the Kauffman House. Architectural photography is extremely glamorous. It puts you into this special  special world. This is Alex Ross's comic book art  which appears to be extremely realistic  as part of his style is he gives you a kind of realism in his comic art. Except that light doesn't work this way in the real world. When you stack people in rows  the ones in the background look smaller than the ones in the foreground    but not in the world of glamour. What glamour is all about    I took this from a blurb in the table of contents of New York magazine  which was telling us that glamour is back    glamour is all about transcending the everyday. And I think that that's starting to get at what the core that combines all sorts of glamour is. This is Filippino Lippi's      portrait of Saint Apollonia. And I don't know who she is either  but this is the    th  century equivalent of a supermodel. It's a very glamorous portrait. Why is it glamorous  It's glamorous  first  because she is beautiful    but that does not make you glamorous  that only makes you beautiful. She is graceful  she is mysterious and she is transcendent  and those are the central qualities of glamour. You don't see her eyes  they're looking downward. She's not looking away from you exactly  but you have to mentally imagine her world. She's encouraging you to contemplate this higher world to which she belongs  where she can be completely tranquil while holding the iron instruments of her death by torture. Mel Gibson's  Passion Of The Christ     not glamorous. That's glamour  that's Michelangelo's  Pieta   where Mary is the same age as Jesus and they're both awfully happy and pleasant. Glamour invites us to live in a different world. It has to simultaneously be mysterious  a little bit distant    that's why  often in these glamour shots  the person is not looking at the audience  it's why sunglasses are glamorous    but also not so far above us that we can't identify with the person. In some sense  there has to be something like us. So as I say  in religious art  you know  God is not glamorous. God cannot be glamorous because God is omnipotent  omniscient    too far above us. And yet you will see in religious art  saints or the Virgin Mary will often be portrayed    not always    in glamorous forms. As I said earlier  glamour does not have to be about people  but it has to have this transcendent quality. What is it about Superman  Aside from Alex Ross's style  which is very glamorous  one thing about Superman is he makes you believe that a man can fly. Glamour is all about transcending this world and getting to an idealized  perfect place. And this is one reason that modes of transportation tend to be extremely glamorous. The less experience we have with them  the more glamorous they are. So you can do a glamorized picture of a car  but you can't do a glamorized picture of traffic. You can do a glamorized picture of an airplane  but not the inside. The notion is that it's going to transport you  and the story is not about  you know  the guy in front of you in the airplane  who has this nasty little kid  or the big cough. The story is about where you're arriving  or thinking about where you're arriving. And this sense of being transported is one reason that we have glamour styling. This sort of streamlining styling is not just glamorous because we associate it with movies of that period  but because  in it's streamlining  it transports us from the everyday. The same thing    arches are very glamorous. Arches with stained glass    even more glamorous. Staircases that curve away from you are glamorous. I happen to find that particular staircase picture very glamorous because  to me  it captures the whole promise of the academic contemplative life    but maybe that's because I went to Princeton. Anyway  skylines are super glamorous  city streets    not so glamorous. You know  when you get  actually to this town it has reality. The horizon  the open road  is very  very glamorous. There are few things more glamorous than the horizon    except  possibly  multiple horizons. Of course  here you don't feel the cold  or the heat    you just see the possibilities. In order to pull glamour off  you need this Renaissance quality of sprezzatura  which is a term coined by Castiglione in his book   The Book Of The Courtier.  There's the not glamorous version of what it looks like today  after a few centuries. And sprezzatura is the art that conceals art. It makes things look effortless. You don't think about how Nicole Kidman is maneuvering that dress    she just looks completely natural. And I remember reading  after the Lara Croft movies  how Angelina Jolie would go home completely black and blue. Of course  they covered that with make up  because Lara Croft did all those same stunts    but she doesn't get black and blue  because she has sprezzatura.  To conceal all art and make whatever is done or said appear to be without effort   And this is one of the critical aspects of glamour. Glamour is about editing. How do you create the sense of transcendence  the sense of evoking a perfect world  The sense of  you know  life could be better  I could join this    I could be a perfect person  I could join this perfect world. We don't tell you all the grubby details. Now  this was kindly lent to me by Jeff Bezos  from last year. This is underneath Jeff's desk. This is what the real world of computers  lamps  electrical appliances of all kinds  looks like. But if you look in a catalog    particularly a catalog of modern  beautiful objects for your home    it looks like this. There are no cords. Look next time you get these catalogs in your mail    you can usually figure out where they hid the cord. But there's always this illusion that if you buy this lamp  you will live in a world without cords.  Laughter  And the same thing is true of  if you buy this laptop or you buy this computer    and even in these wireless eras  you don't get to live in the world without cords. You have to have mystery and you have to have grace. And there she is    Grace. This is the most glamorous picture  I think  ever. Part of the thing is that  in  Rear Window   the question is  is she too glamorous to live in his world  And the answer is no  but of course it's really just a movie. Here's Hedy Lamarr again. And  you know  this kind of head covering is extremely glamorous because  like sunglasses  it conceals and reveals at the same time. Translucence is glamorous    that's why all these people wear pearls. It's why barware is glamorous. Glamour is translucent    not transparent  not opaque. It invites us into the world but it doesn't give us a completely clear picture. And I think if Grace Kelly is the most glamorous person  maybe a spiral staircase with glass block may be the most glamorous interior shot  because a spiral staircase is incredibly glamorous. It has that sense of going up and away  and yet you never think about how you would really trip if you were    particularly going down. And of course glass block has that sense of translucence. So  this session's supposed to be about pure pleasure but glamour's really partly about meaning. All individuals and all cultures have ideals that cannot possibly be realized in reality. They have contradictions  they uphold principles that are incommensurable with each other    whatever it is    and yet these ideals give meaning and purpose to our lives as cultures and as individuals. And the way we deal with that is we displace them    we put them into a golden world  an imagined world  an age of heroes  the world to come. And in the life of an individual  we often associate that with some object. The white picket fence  the perfect house. The perfect kitchen    no bills on the counter in the perfect kitchen. You know  you buy that Viking range  this is what your kitchen will look like. The perfect love life    symbolized by the perfect necklace  the perfect diamond ring. The perfect getaway in your perfect car. This is an interior design firm that is literally called Utopia. The perfect office    again  no cords  as far as I can tell. And certainly  no  it doesn't look a thing like my office. I mean  there's no paper on the desk. We want this golden world. And some people get rich enough  and if they have their ideals    in a sort of domestic sense  they get to acquire their perfect world. Dean Koontz built this fabulous home theater  which is    I don't think accidentally    in Art Deco style. That symbolizes this sense of being safe and at home. This is not always good  because what is your perfect world  What is your ideal  and also  what has been edited out  Is it something important   The Matrix  is a movie that is all about glamour. I could do a whole talk on  The Matrix  and glamour. It was criticized for glamorizing violence  because  look    sunglasses and those long coats  and  of course  they could walk up walls and do all these kinds of things that are impossible in the real world. This is another Margaret Bourke White photo. This is from Soviet Union. Attractive. I mean  look how happy the people are  and good looking too. You know  we're marching toward Utopia. I'm not a fan of PETA  but I think this is a great ad. Because what they're doing is they're saying  your coat's not so glamorous  what's been edited out is something important. But actually  what's even more important than remembering what's been edited out is thinking  are the ideals good  Because glamour can be very totalitarian and deceptive. And it's not just a matter of glamorizing cleaning your floor. This is from  Triumph Of The Will     brilliant editing to cut together things. There's a glamour shot. National Socialism is all about glamour. It was a very aesthetic ideology. It was all about cleaning up Germany  and the West  and the world  and ridding it of anything unglamorous. So glamour can be dangerous. I think glamour has a genuine appeal  has a genuine value. I'm not against glamour. But there's a kind of wonder in the stuff that gets edited away in the cords of life. And there is both a way to avoid the dangers of glamour and a way to broaden your appreciation of it. And that's to take Isaac Mizrahi's advice and confront the manipulation of it all  and sort of admit that manipulation is something that we enjoy  but also enjoy how it happens. And here's Hedy Lamarr. She's very glamorous but  you know  she invented spread spectrum technology. So she's even more glamorous if you know that she really wasn't stupid  even though she thought she could look stupid. David Hockney talks about how the appreciation of this very glamorous painting is heightened if you think about the fact that it takes two weeks to paint this splash  which only took a fraction of a second to happen. There is a book out in the bookstore    it's called  Symphony In Steel   and it's about the stuff that's hidden under the skin of the Disney Center. And that has a fascination. It's not necessarily glamorous  but unveiling the glamour has an appeal. There's a wonderful book called  Crowns  that's all these glamour pictures of black women in their church hats. And there's a quote from one of these women  and she talks about   As a little girl  I'd admire women at church with beautiful hats. They looked like beautiful dolls  like they'd just stepped out of a magazine. But I also knew how hard they worked all week. Sometimes under those hats there's a lot of joy and a lot of sorrow.  And  actually  you get more appreciation for glamour when you realize what went into creating it. Thank you. This session is on natural wonders  and the bigger conference is on the pursuit of happiness. I want to try to combine them all  because to me  healing is really the ultimate natural wonder. Your body has a remarkable capacity to begin healing itself  and much more quickly than people had once realized  if you simply stop doing what s causing the problem. And so  really  so much of what we do in medicine and life in general is focused on mopping up the floor without also turning off the faucet. I love doing this work  because it really gives many people new hope and new choices that they didn t have before  and it allows us to talk about things that    not just diet  but that happiness is not    we're talking about the pursuit of happiness  but when you really look at all the spiritual traditions  what Aldous Huxley called the  perennial wisdom   when you get past the named and forms and rituals that really divide people  it s really about    our nature is to be happy  our nature is to be peaceful  our nature is to be healthy. And so it s not something    happiness is not something you get  health is generally not something that you get. But rather all of these different practices    you know  the ancient swamis and rabbis and priests and monks and nuns didn t develop these techniques to just manage stress or lower your blood pressure  unclog your arteries  even though it can do all those things. They re powerful tools for transformation  for quieting down our mind and bodies to allow us to experience what it feels like to be happy  to be peaceful  to be joyful and to realize that it s not something that you pursue and get  but rather it s something that you have already until you disturb it. I studied yoga for many years with a teacher named Swami Satchidananda and people would say   What are you  a Hindu   He d say   No  I m an undo.  And it s really about identifying what s causing us to disturb our innate health and happiness  and then to allow that natural healing to occur. To me  that s the real natural wonder. So  within that larger context  we can talk about diet  stress management    which are really these spiritual practices    moderate exercise  smoking cessation  support groups and community    which I ll talk more about    and some vitamins and supplements. And it s not a diet. You know  when most people think about the diet I recommend  they think it s a really strict diet. For reversing disease  that s what it takes  but if you re just trying to be healthy  you have a spectrum of choices. And to the degree that you can move in a healthy direction  you re going to live longer  you re going to feel better  you re going to lose weight  and so on. And in our studies  what we ve been able to do is to use very expensive  high tech  state of the art measures to prove how powerful these very simple and low tech and low cost    and in many ways  ancient    interventions  can be. We first began by looking at heart disease  and when I began doing this work    or    years ago  it was thought that once you have heart disease it can only get worse. And what we found was that  instead of getting worse and worse  in many cases it could get better and better  and much more quickly than people had once realized. This is a representative patient who at the time was       totally needed to have a bypass  decided to do this instead. We used quantitative arteriography  showing the narrowing. This is one of the arteries that feed the heart  one of the main arteries  and you can see the narrowing here. A year later  it s not as clogged  normally  it goes the other direction. These minor changes in blockages caused a     percent improvement in blood flow  and using cardiac positron emission tomography  or  PET   scans  blue and black is no blood flow  orange and white is maximal. Huge differences can occur without drugs  without surgery. Clinically  he literally couldn t walk across the street without getting severe chest pain  within a month  like most people  was pain free  and within a year  climbing more than     floors a day on a Stairmaster. This is not unusual  and it s part of what enables people to maintain these kinds of changes  because it makes such a big difference in their quality of life. Overall  if you looked at all the arteries in all the patients  they got worse and worse  from one year to five years  in the comparison group. This is the natural history of heart disease  but it s really not natural because we found it could get better and better  and much more quickly than people had once thought. We also found that the more people change  the better they got. It wasn t a function of how old or how sick they were    it was mainly how much they changed  and the oldest patients improved as much as the young ones. I got this as a Christmas card a few years ago from two of the patients in one of our programs. The younger brother is     the older one s     they wanted to show me how much more flexible they were. And the following year they sent me this one  which I thought was kind of funny. You just never know. And what we found was that    percent of the patients start to reverse the progression of their heart disease. Now I thought  you know  if we just did good science  that would change medical practice. But  that was a little naive. It s important  but not enough. Because we doctors do what we get paid to do  and we get trained to do what we get paid to do  so if we change insurance  then we change medical practice and medical education. Insurance will cover the bypass  it ll cover the angioplasty  it won t  until recently  cover diet and lifestyle. So  we began through our nonprofit institute's training hospitals around the country  and we found that most people could avoid surgery  and not only was it medically effective  it was also cost effective. And the insurance companies found that they began to save almost        dollars per patient  and Medicare is now in the middle of doing a demonstration project where they re paying for       people to go through the program on the sites that we train. The fortuneteller says   I give smokers a discount because there s not as much to tell.   Laughter  I like this slide  because it s a chance to talk about what really motivates people to change  and what doesn t. And what doesn t work is fear of dying  and that s what s normally used. Everybody who smokes knows it s not good for you  and still    percent of Americans smoke       percent in some parts of the world. Why do people do it  Well  because it helps them get through the day. And I ll talk more about this  but the real epidemic isn t just heart disease or obesity or smoking    it s loneliness and depression. As one woman said   I ve got    friends in this package of cigarettes  and they re always there for me and nobody else is. You re going to take away my    friends  What are you going to give me   Or they eat when they get depressed  or they use alcohol to numb the pain  or they work too hard  or watch too much TV. There are lots of ways we have of avoiding and numbing and bypassing pain  but the point of all of this is to deal with the cause of the problem. And the pain is not the problem  it s the symptom. And telling people they re going to die is too scary to think about  or  they re going to get emphysema or heart attack is too scary  and so they don t want to think about it  so they don t. The most effective anti smoking ad was this one. You ll notice the limp cigarette hanging out of his mouth  and  impotence     the headline is   Impotent     it s not emphysema. What was the biggest selling drug of all time when it was introduced a few years ago  Viagra  right  Why  Because a lot of guys need it. It s not like you say   Hey Joe  I m having erectile dysfunction  how about you   And yet  look at the number of prescriptions that are being sold. It s not so much psychological  it s vascular  and nicotine makes your arteries constrict. So does cocaine  so does a high fat diet  so does emotional stress. So the very behaviors that we think of as being so sexy in our culture are the very ones that leave so many people feeling tired  lethargic  depressed and impotent  and that s not much fun. But when you change those behaviors  your brain gets more blood  you think more clearly  you have more energy  your heart gets more blood in ways I ve shown you. Your sexual function improves. And these things occur within hours. This is a study  a high fat meal  and within one or two hours blood flow is measurably less    and you ve all experienced this at Thanksgiving. When you eat a big fatty meal  how do you feel  You feel kind of sleepy afterwards. On a low fat meal  the blood flow doesn t go down    it even goes up. Many of you have kids  and you know that s a big change in your lifestyle  and so people are not afraid to make big changes in lifestyle if they re worth it. And the paradox is that when you make big changes  you get big benefits  and you feel so much better so quickly. For many people  those are choices worth making    not to live longer  but to live better. I want to talk a little bit about the obesity epidemic  because it really is a problem. Two thirds of adults are overweight or obese  and diabetes in kids and    year olds has increased    percent in the last    years. It s no joke  it s real. And just to show you this  this is from the CDC. These are not election returns  these are the percentage of people who are overweight. And if you see from '   to '   to '    '    '    '    '      you get a new category     to    percent  '    '    '    '    '    '      you get a new category  '    '          and     . Mississippi  more than    percent of people are overweight. Why is this  Well  this is one way to lose weight that works very well ... but it doesn t last  which is the problem. Now  there s no mystery in how you lose weight  you either burn more calories by exercise or you eat fewer calories. Now  one way to eat fewer calories is to eat less food  which is why you can lose weight on any diet if you eat less food  or if you restrict entire categories of foods. But the problem is  you get hungry  so it s hard to keep it off. The other way is to change the type of food. And fat has nine calories per gram  whereas protein and carbs only have four. So  when you eat less fat  you eat fewer calories without having to eat less food. So you can eat the same amount of food  but you ll be getting fewer calories because the food is less dense in calories. And it s the volume of food that affects satiety  rather than the type of food. You know  I don t like talking about the Atkins diet  but I get asked about it every day  and so I just thought I d spend a few minutes on that. The myth that you hear about is  Americans have been told to eat less fat  the percent of calories from fat is down  Americans are fatter than ever  therefore fat doesn t make you fat. It s a half truth. Actually  Americans are eating more fat than ever  and even more carbs. And so the percentage is lower  the actual amount is higher  and so the goal is to reduce both. Dr. Atkins and I debated each other many times before he died  and we agreed that Americans eat too many simple carbs  the  bad carbs   and these are things like       sugar  white flour  white rice  alcohol. And you get a double whammy  you get all these calories that don t fill you up because you ve removed the fiber  and they get absorbed quickly so your blood sugar zooms up. Your pancreas makes insulin to bring it back down  which is good. But insulin accelerates the conversion of calories into fat. So  the goal is not to go to pork rinds and bacon and sausages    these are not health foods    but to go from  bad carbs  to what are called  good carbs.  And these are things like whole foods  or unrefined carbs  fruits  vegetables  whole wheat flour  brown rice  in their natural forms  are rich in fiber. And the fiber fills you up before you get too many calories  and it slows the absorption so you don t get that rapid rise in blood sugar. So  and you get all the disease protective substances. It s not just what you exclude from your diet  but also what you include that s protective. Just as all carbs are not bad for you  all fats are not bad for you. There are good fats. And these are predominantly what are called the Omega   fatty acids. You find these  for example  in fish oil. And the bad fats are things like trans fatty acids and processed food and saturated fats  which we find in meat. If you don t remember anything else from this talk  three grams a day of fish oil can reduce your risk of a heart attack and sudden death by    to    percent. Three grams a day. They come in one gram capsules  more than that just gives you extra fat you don t need. It also helps reduce the risk of the most common cancers like breast  prostate and colon cancer. Now  the problem with the Atkins diet  everybody knows people who have lost weight on it  but you can lose weight on amphetamines  you know  and fen phen. I mean  there are lots of ways of losing weight that aren t good for you. You want to lose weight in a way that enhances your health rather than the one that harms it. And the problem is that it s based on this half truth  which is that Americans eat too many simple carbs  so if you eat fewer simple carbs you re going to lose weight. You ll lose even more weight if you go to whole foods and less fat  and you ll enhance your health rather than harming it. He says   I ve got some good news. While your cholesterol level has remained the same  the research findings have changed.  Now  what happens to your heart when you go on an Atkins diet  The red is good at the beginning  and a year later    this is from a study done in a peer reviewed journal called Angiology    there s more red after a year on a diet like I would recommend  there s less red  less blood flow after a year on an Atkins type diet. So  yes  you can lose weight  but your heart isn t happy. Now  one of the studies funded by the Atkins Center found that    percent of the people were constipated     percent had bad breath     percent had headaches   this is not a healthy way to eat. And so  you might start to lose weight and start to attract people towards you  but when they get too close it s going to be a problem. And more seriously  there are case reports now of    year old girls who died after a few weeks on the Atkins diet    of bone disease  kidney disease  and so on. And that s how your body excretes waste  is through your breath  your bowels and your perspiration. So when you go on these kinds of diet  they begin to smell bad. So  an optimal diet is low in fat  low in the bad carbs  high in the good carbs and enough of the good fats. And then  again  it s a spectrum  when you move in this direction  you re going to lose weight  you re going to feel better and you re going to gain health. Now  there are ecological reasons for eating lower on the food chain too  whether it s the deforestation of the Amazon  or making more protein available  to the four billion people who live on a dollar a day    not to mention whatever ethical concerns people have. So  there are lots of reasons for eating this way that go beyond just your health. Now  we re about to publish the first study looking at the effects of this program on prostate cancer  and  in collaboration with Sloane Kettering and with UCSF. We took    men who had biopsy proven prostate cancer and who had elected  for reasons unrelated to the study  not to have surgery. We could randomly divide them into two groups  and then we could have one group that is a non intervention control group to compare to  which we can t do with  say  breast cancer  because everyone gets treated. What we found was that  after a year  none of the experimental group patients who made these lifestyle changes needed treatment  whereas six of the control group patients needed surgery or radiation. When we looked at their PSA levels    which is a marker for prostate cancer    they got worse in the control group  but they actually got better in the experimental group  and these differences were highly significant. And then I wondered  was there any relationship between how much people changed their diet and lifestyle    whichever group they were in    and the changes in PSA  And sure enough  we found a dose response relationship  just like we found in the arterial blockages in our cardiac studies. And in order for the PSA to go down  they had to make pretty big changes. I then wondered  well  maybe they re just changing their PSA  but it s not really affecting the tumor growth. So we took some of their blood serum and sent it down to UCLA  they added it to a standard line of prostate tumor cells growing in tissue culture  and it inhibited the growth seven times more in the experimental group than in the control group       versus   percent. And finally  I said  I wonder if there s any relationship between how much people change and how it inhibited their tumor growth  whichever group they happened to be in. And this really got me excited because again  we found the same pattern  the more people change  the more it affected the growth of their tumors. And finally  we did MRI and MR spectroscopy scans on some of these patients  and the tumor activity is shown in red in this patient  and you can see clearly it s better a year later  along with the PSA going down. So  if it s true for prostate cancer  it ll almost certainly be true for breast cancer as well. And whether or not you have conventional treatment  in addition  if you make these changes  it may help reduce the risk of recurrence. The last thing I want to talk about  apropos of the issue of the pursuit of happiness  is that study after study have shown that people who are lonely and depressed    and depression is the other real epidemic in our culture    are many times more likely to get sick and die prematurely  in part because  as we talked about  they re more likely to smoke and overeat and drink too much and work too hard and so on. But also  through mechanisms that we don t fully understand  people who are lonely and depressed are many times    three to five to ten times  in some studies    more likely to get sick and die prematurely. And depression is treatable. We need to do something about that. Now  on the other hand  anything that promotes intimacy is healing. It can be sexual intimacy   I happen to think that healing energy and erotic energy are just different forms of the same thing. Friendship  altruism  compassion  service   all the perennial truths that we talked about that are part of all religion and all cultures    once you stop trying to see the differences  these are the things in our own self interest  because they free us from our suffering and from disease. And it s in a sense the most selfish thing that we can do. Just take a look at one study. This was done by David Spiegel at Stanford. He took women with metastatic breast cancer  randomly divided them into two groups. One group of people just met for an hour and a half once a week in a support group. It was a nurturing  loving environment  where they were encouraged to let down their emotional defenses and talk about how awful it is to have breast cancer with people who understood  because they were going through it too. They just met once a week for a year. Five years later  those women lived twice as long  and you can see that the people    and that was the only difference between the groups. It was a randomized control study published in The Lancet. Other studies have shown this as well. So  these simple things that create intimacy are really healing  and even the word healing  it comes from the root  to make whole.  The word yoga comes from the Sanskrit  meaning  union  to yoke  to bring together.  And the last slide I want to show you is from    I was    again  this swami that I studied with for so many years  and I did a combined oncology and cardiology Grand Rounds at the University of Virginia medical school a couple of years ago. And at the end of it  somebody said   Hey  Swami  what s the difference between wellness and illness   And so he went up on the board and he wrote the word  illness   and circled the first letter  and then wrote the word  wellness   and circled the first two letters ... To me  it s just shorthand for what we re talking about  that anything that creates a sense of connection and community and love is really healing. And then we can enjoy our lives more fully without getting sick in the process. Thank you.  Applause  You all know this story. In the summer of       Enrico Fermi  the Italian American physicist and atomic pile builder  went to lunch at Los Alamos National Laboratory and joined some colleagues there  and asked them a question   Where is everybody   This confused his colleagues  obviously  because they were sitting right there with him. And then he had to clarify that he wasn't talking about them. He was talking about the space aliens. You see  this was only a few years after the supposed flying saucer crash at Roswell  New Mexico. And even though that turned out to be nothing  nothing at all    merely a downed weather balloon piloted by small hairless men with slits for mouths ... Still  America had gone saucer mad  even famous scientists who were eating lunch. Fermi's reasoning  if I may paraphrase badly  is that the universe is so vast that it stands to reason  there should be other intelligent life out there. And the universe is so old that unless we were the very first civilization ever to evolve  we should have some evidence of their existence by now. And yet  to the best of our knowledge  we are alone.  Where is everybody   asked Fermi  and his colleagues had no answer. Fermi then went on with the same blunt logic to disprove fairies  Sasquatch  God  the possibility of love    and thereafter  as you know  Enrico Fermi ate alone. Now  I am not a scientist. I have never built an atomic pile. Although  I might argue that  technically  every pile is atomic. However  with respect  I might point out two possibilities that Enrico Fermi perhaps did not consider. One is that the aliens might be very far away. Perhaps  I dare say  even on other planets. The other possibility    is  perhaps  Enrico Fermi himself was an alien. Think about it. Isn't it a little convenient that in the midst of the World War  out of nowhere  suddenly an Italian scientist showed up with an amazing new technology that would transform everything in the world and darken the history of the human species forever after  And isn't it a little strange that he required no payment for this  That he asked for only one thing    a gift of two healthy sperm whales  That's    that's not true. But it is strange. And if Enrico Fermi were indeed a space alien  wouldn't he be the first to have tried to convince his fellow scientists that the space aliens are not already here  For it is given in certain UFO ology or UFOlogy circles  that the aliens are already here and have been for millennia  that they have walked among us in disguise  observing us  guiding our evolution from ape to man    if you believe in that sort of thing    and  occasionally  kidnapping us in their flying saucers and taking us away to have sex with us in pyramids. It's a difficult theory to discount  I think you'll agree. For even in my own life  there are memories I have that are difficult to explain    happenings that are so odd and unaccountably weird  that it is difficult to imagine they were not the result of prolonged and frequent contact with aliens throughout my life. For how else will you explain the amazing and absolutely true close encounters that I had and will describe to you now  Encounter one  Ocean City  New Jersey      . This was the summer when the special edition of  Close Encounters of the Third Kind  was released. And I went on vacation with my parents to the Jersey shore. Within    hours  I was horribly sunburned  just like Richard Dreyfuss in the movie. And so I spent the rest of the vacation largely sitting outside our little rental house at night  the sidewalk still warm from the sun  watching the skies for UFOs. What did I see  Stars  satellites  blinking airplanes    typical sky junk. Occasionally  kids would come and join me and watch  but their necks soon got sore  and they would go off to the boardwalk to play video games and mingle with humans. I was pretty good at the video games. I was not very good at the other part  so I stayed alone with the cosmos. And that's when it happened. An elderly couple came walking down the street. I would say they were in their late seventies  and I would say that they were on a date  because he was wearing a very neat little suit with a yellow tie    a brown suit. And she was wearing a cardigan  because it was now fully night and a chill was coming in off the ocean. I remember  for some reason  that they were exactly the same height. And then they stopped  and the man turned to me and said   What are you looking for  flying saucers   You have to admit  that's a pretty boss piece of detective work for an old man on a date. But what was stranger still    and even I realized it at the time  as a nine year old child    was that they stopped at all. That this old man would interrupt his moonlight stroll with his sweetheart with the precise reason of making fun of a child.  Oh   he said   little green men.  And then his girlfriend joined in  too.  There's no such thing as space men   she said.  There's no such thing.  And then they both laughed.  Ha  ha  ha.  I looked around. The street was entirely empty. I had stopped hearing the sound of the ocean. It was as though time had stopped. I did not know why they were teasing me. I looked into their strangely angry faces  and I remember wondering  are they wearing rubber masks  And what would be behind those rubber masks  if they were  Giant  almond shaped  unblinking eyes  Slits for mouths  The old man crooked his finger as though he were firing a gun  and then he made laser sounds.  Kew  kew  kew    watch out.  And they turned at once and walked away. The old man reached out his knobbly claw for the woman's hand  and found it  and left me alone. Now  you could describe this as a simple misunderstanding    a strange encounter among humans. Maybe it was swamp gas  but    I know what I saw. Close encounter two  Brookline  Massachusetts      . I went to see the movie  Dune   and a girl talked to me. Now  on its face    this is impossible on its face  I realize    but it is absolutely true. It was opening night  naturally. I went with my friend Tim McGonigal  who sat on my left. On my right was the girl in question. She had long  curly black hair  a blue jean jacket. I remember  she had some sort of injury to her ankle  an Ace bandage  and she had crutches. She was very tall  I would say. I was starting high school at the time. I would say she was a junior  but I had never seen her before. She didn't go to my school. I didn't know her name  and I never will. She was sitting with someone who I presume was her mother  and they were talking about the novel   Dune.  They were both big fans  mother and daughter    very unusual. They were talking about how their favorite characters were the giant sandworms. And then it got stranger. That's when she turned to me and said   Are you looking forward to seeing the movie   First of all  I was embarrassed because I had not read the novel  Dune  at that time. I was merely a connoisseur of movies featuring desert planets  as I still am. But it was also the tone of how she asked the question  apropos of nothing  like she didn't even care about the answer  as though she just wanted to talk to me. I did not know what to say. I said   Yes.  I did not even turn my head. The movie began. I need not remind you that this was David Lynch's version of  Dune   in which all of the characters were sexy and deformed at the same time. There was a character called the Third Stage Guild Navigator  which was a kind of giant  floating fetus creature that lived in a giant tank with this orange mist of psychedelic spice swirling around him  allowing him to bend space and time. He could never leave the tank or interact with the outside world. He had become  in his isolation  so deformed and so sexy  that he had to talk through a kind of old timey radio to the outside world  and could never touch them. I mean  I liked him a lot better than the sandworms. The sandworms were fine  but your favorite character  Please. When the movie ended  everyone seemed very happy to get up and get out of the theatre as soon as possible. Except for the girl. As I walked out  her pace slowed. Perhaps it was the crutches  but it seemed    it seemed as though she might want to talk to me again. When I say it out loud  it sounds so ridiculous  but I can only come to the conclusion that it was what  in the alien abductee community  they call a  screen memory   a ridiculous false recollection designed by their brain to cover up some trauma    say  of being kidnapped and flown off to a sex pyramid. And so I sure am glad I did not slow down to talk to her. I sure am glad I never saw her again. Close encounter three  Philadelphia  Pennsylvania      . In the mid to late '  s  the novelist Whitley Strieber wrote a book called  Communion   in which he described his own lifelong experiences being abducted by aliens. And he also described the phenomenon known in this community as  lost time   where Whitley Strieber would suddenly become aware that he could not remember the previous ten minutes  or the previous ten hours  or the previous ten days. And would come to the conclusion that that was when the aliens were taking him and giving him rectal probes. This book became  naturally  an enormous best seller. This image by Ted Joseph was from that book  and was his  sort of  police sketch of what the creatures looked like that Whitley Strieber had described to him. And it was so successful that they made it into a movie. And in       the way I remember it  I was in Philadelphia visiting my girlfriend  and we decided  apropos of nothing  to go see this movie. And the way I remember it  the movie featured these details. One  Whitley Strieber was played by Christopher Walken. Two  the alien was played by a rubber puppet. Three  there was a surprisingly long sequence of the film in which the rubber puppet gives Christopher Walken a rectal probe. Four  this was being shown in a regular movie theater in Center City  Philadelphia. Five  all of which is to say  they made a movie out of the book   Communion   and it starred Christopher Walken. Does something seem strange about this to you  Something odd  Something off  Something wrong with this picture  Think about it. Yes. The answer is  I had a girlfriend. What  How did this happen  When did this happen  I remember walking out of the theater and becoming suddenly aware of this fact  as we walked hand in hand  and pondering these very same questions. And to this day  I have no answer for you. Close encounter four  the Algarve  Portugal      . Some years later  I and this woman    we'll call her  Catherine Fletcher     went traveling through the south of Portugal together. We stayed in old  crumbling  walled cities  in tiny little hotels  and we would climb up to the roof and drink Vinho Verde and watch the sun set and play checkers. What  Did we do this  Really  Does anyone do this  We went to some topless beaches. Excuse me  No  not in my life. For what it's worth  we went to Sagres  which was considered  at the time  to be the end of the world. And there I was chased by a pack of feral dogs on the dock  and the lead dog bit me on the ass  requiring me to go to a strange Portuguese clinic and receive an ass shot. Make of that what you will. Our last day in Portugal  we were in the district capital of Faro  and Catherine decided that she wanted to go to the beach one last time. Now  Faro is a bustling little city  and to get to the beach  she explained  you would have to take a bus and then a boat. And did I want to come with  But I was exhausted and dog bitten  and so I said   No.  I remember what she looked like before she left. The freckles had grown and multiplied on her face and shoulders  clustering into a kind of a tan. A tan  we were both tan    is this true  Her eyes were extra bright and extra blue  as a result. She was smiling. She was a single woman about to go alone into a country  not even speaking the language  to travel alone by bus and boat to go to a beach she did not know or had never seen. I loved her  and then she went out into that strange  alien land. It took me some time to come to my senses. I had my own  lost time  moment  where I woke up and suddenly realized it was very late in the day  almost dinnertime  and she had not come back. Nervous  I went down to the street to look for her. Now  I did not speak Portuguese. I did not know where the beach was. I could not call her on a cell phone because this was       and the aliens had not given us that technology yet. I realized that the day would only have two possible outcomes  either Catherine would come back to the hotel  or she would never come back to the hotel. And so I sat down to wait. I did not watch the skies  but the very end of the street where the buses and cars and pedestrians and little scooters were moving along. And I watched those constellations shift  hoping that they would part and I would see her face. It was at that moment  in that very small town of        or so  that I truly appreciated the vastness of the universe and the searching we might do in it. And that's when the Liberians came along. Five young men    all laughing  happy  traveling together  coming back to this hotel where they were staying. One of them was named Joseph  and he asked me what was I doing  and I explained. And he said   Don't worry.  He was sure that Catherine would be safe. But he did not seem so very sure  for he sat down to wait with me. And for the next two hours  they all waited with me  taking turns  going up to their room  coming back  telling me jokes  distracting me. Two hours  they gave me a message. We are not alone. And then  in the middle of a sentence  at the very birth of twilight  I turned and looked down the street. The stars aligned  and she came back. She was smiling. She did not understand why I was so worried. Neither did the Liberians  although there was a huge amount of relief in their laughter as they clapped us on the back  and went back up to their room and left us alone in the street  holding hands. An event like this leaves a scar on the memory  much like a piece of alien technology that has been inserted into your buttocks by a  Portuguese doctor.  And even now  a decade and a half later  even now that we are married  I look for her still  whenever she is not in the room. And even though  I think you'll agree  it is probable that during the time she was away  she was kidnapped and replaced by an alien clone  I love her and wait for her still. Thank you for your kind attention. You hear that this is the era of environment    or biology  or information technology ... Well  it's the era of a lot of different things that we're in right now. But one thing for sure  it's the era of change. There's more change going on than ever has occurred in the history of human life on earth. And you all sort of know it  but it's hard to get it so that you really understand it. And I've tried to put together something that's a good start for this. I've tried to show in this    though the color doesn't come out    that what I'm concerned with is the little    year time bubble that you are in. You tend to be interested in a generation past  a generation future    your parents  your kids  things you can change over the next few decades    and this    year time bubble you kind of move along in. And in that    years  if you look at the population curve  you find the population of humans on the earth more than doubles and we're up three and a half times since I was born. When you have a new baby  by the time that kid gets out of high school more people will be added than existed on earth when I was born. This is unprecedented  and it's big. Where it goes in the future is questioned. So that's the human part. Now  the human part related to animals  look at the left side of that. What I call the human portion    humans and their livestock and pets    versus the natural portion    all the other wild animals and just    these are vertebrates and all the birds  etc.  in the land and air  not in the water. How does it balance  Certainly         years ago  the civilization's beginning  the human portion was less than one tenth of one percent. Let's look at it now. You follow this curve and you see the whiter spot in the middle    that's your    year time bubble. Humans  livestock and pets are now    percent of that integrated total mass on earth and all wild nature is three percent. We have won. The next generation doesn't even have to worry about this game    it is over. And the biggest problem came in the last    years  it went from    percent up to that    percent. And this really is a sobering picture upon realizing that we  humans  are in charge of life on earth  we're like the capricious Gods of old Greek myths  kind of playing with life    and not a great deal of wisdom injected into it. Now  the third curve is information technology. This is Moore's Law plotted here  which relates to density of information  but it has been pretty good for showing a lot of other things about information technology    computers  their use  Internet  etc. And what's important is it just goes straight up through the top of the curve  and has no real limits to it. Now try and contrast these. This is the size of the earth going through that same       frame. And to make it really clear  I've put all four on one graph. There's no need to see the little detailed words on it. That first one is humans versus nature  we've won  there's no more gain. Human population. And so if you're looking for growth industries to get into  that's not a good one    protecting natural creatures. Human population is going up  it's going to continue for quite a while. Good business in obstetricians  morticians  and farming  housing  etc.    they all deal with human bodies  which require being fed  transported  housed and so on. And the information technology  which connects to our brains  has no limit    now  that is a wonderful field to be in. You're looking for growth opportunity  It's just going up through the roof. And then  the size of the Earth. Somehow making these all compatible with the Earth looks like a pretty bad industry to be involved with. So  that's the stage out of all this. I find  for reasons I don't understand  I really do have a goal. And the goal is that the world be desirable and sustainable when my kids reach my age    and I think that's    in other words  the next generation. I think that's a goal that we probably all share. I think it's a hopeless goal. Technologically  it's achievable  economically  it's achievable  politically  it means sort of the habits  institutions of people    it's impossible. The institutions of the past with all their inertia are just irrelevant for the future  except they're there and we have to deal with them. I spend about    percent of my time trying to save the world  the other    percent  the usual    and whatever else we devote ourselves to. And in that    percent  the main focus is on human mind  thinking skills  somehow trying to unleash kids from the straightjacket of school  which is putting information and dogma into them  get them so they really think  ask tough questions  argue about serious subjects  don't believe everything that's in the book  think broadly or creative. They can be. Our school systems are very flawed and do not reward you for the things that are important in life or for the survival of civilization  they reward you for a lot of learning and sopping up stuff. We can't go into that today because there isn't time    it's a broad subject. One thing for sure  in the future there is an essential feature    necessary  but not sufficient    which is doing more with less. We've got to be doing things with more efficiency using less energy  less material. Your great great grandparents got by on muscle power  and yet we all think there's this huge power that's essential for our lifestyle. And with all the wonderful technology we have we can do things that are much more efficient  conserve  recycle  etc. Let me just rush very quickly through things that we've done. Human powered airplane    Gossamer Condor sort of started me in this direction in      and     winning the Kremer prize in aviation history  followed by the Albatross. And we began making various odd planes and creatures. Here's a giant flying replica of a pterosaur that has no tail. Trying to have it fly straight is like trying to shoot an arrow with the feathered end forward. It was a tough job  and boy it made me have a lot of respect for nature. This was the full size of the original creature. We did things on land  in the air  on water    vehicles of all different kinds  usually with some electronics or electric power systems in them. I find they're all the same  whether its land  air or water. I'll be focusing on the air here. This is a solar powered airplane        miles carrying a person from France to England as a symbol that solar power is going to be an important part of our future. Then we did the solar car for General Motors    the Sunracer    that won the race in Australia. We got a lot of people thinking about electric cars  what you could do with them. A few years later  when we suggested to GM that now is the time and we could do a thing called the Impact  they sponsored it  and here's the Impact that we developed with them on their programs. This is the demonstrator. And they put huge effort into turning it into a commercial product. With that preamble  let's show the first two minute videotape  which shows a little airplane for surveillance and moving to a giant airplane. Narrator  A tiny airplane  the AV Pointer serves for surveillance    in effect  a pair of roving eyeglasses. A cutting edge example of where miniaturization can lead if the operator is remote from the vehicle. It is convenient to carry  assemble and launch by hand. Battery powered  it is silent and rarely noticed. It sends high resolution video pictures back to the operator. With onboard GPS  it can navigate autonomously  and it is rugged enough to self land without damage. The modern sailplane is superbly efficient. Some can glide as flat as    feet forward for every foot of descent. They are powered only by the energy they can extract from the atmosphere    an atmosphere nature stirs up by solar energy. Humans and soaring birds have found nature to be generous in providing replenishable energy. Sailplanes have flown over       miles  and the altitude record is over        feet. The Solar Challenger was made to serve as a symbol that photovoltaic cells can produce real power and will be part of the world's energy future. In       it flew     miles from Paris to England  solely on the power of sunbeams  and established a basis for the Pathfinder. The message from all these vehicles is that ideas and technology can be harnessed to produce remarkable gains in doing more with less    gains that can help us attain a desirable balance between technology and nature. The stakes are high as we speed toward a challenging future. Buckminster Fuller said it clearly   there are no passengers on spaceship Earth  only crew. We  the crew  can and must do more with less    much less.  Paul MacCready  If we could have the second video  the one minute  put in as quickly as you can  which    this will show the Pathfinder airplane in some flights this past year in Hawaii  and will show a sequence of some of the beauty behind it after it had just flown to        feet    higher than any propeller airplane has ever flown. It's amazing  just on the puny power of the sun    by having a super lightweight plane  you're able to get it up there. It's part of a long term program NASA sponsored. And we worked very closely with the whole thing being a team effort  and with wonderful results like that flight. And we're working on a bigger plane        foot span    and an intermediate size  one with a regenerative fuel cell that can store excess energy during the day  feed it back at night  and stay up        feet for months at a time. Ray Morgan's voice will come in here. There he's the project manager. Anything they do is certainly a team effort. He ran this program. Here's ... some things he showed as a celebration at the very end. Ray Morgan  We'd just ended a seven month deployment of Hawaii. For those who live on the mainland  it was tough being away from home. The friendly support  the quiet confidence  congenial hospitality shown by our Hawaiian and military hosts    this is starting    made the experience enjoyable and unforgettable. PM  We have real time IR scans going out through the Internet while the plane is flying. And it's exploring without polluting the stratosphere. That's its goal  the stratosphere  the blanket that really controls the radiation of the earth and permits life on earth to be the success that it is    probing that is very important. And also we consider it as a sort of poor man's stationary satellite  because it can stay right overhead for months at a time        times closer than the real GFC synchronous satellite. We couldn't bring one here to fly it and show you. But now let's look at the other end. In the video you saw that nine pound or eight pound Pointer airplane surveillance drone that Keenan has developed and just done a remarkable job. Where some have servos that have gotten down to  oh     or    grams  his weigh one third of a gram. And what he's going to bring out here is a surveillance drone that weighs about   ounces    that includes the video camera  the batteries that run it  the telemetry  the receiver and so on. And we'll fly it  we hope  with the same success that we had last night when we did the practice. So Matt Keenan  just any time you're    all right    ready to let her go. But first  we're going to make sure that it's appearing on the screen  so you see what it sees. You can imagine yourself being a mouse or fly inside of it  looking out of its camera. Matt Keenan  It's switched on. PM  But now we're trying to get the video. There we go. MK  Can you bring up the house lights  PM  Yeah  the house lights and we'll see you all better and be able to fly the plane better. MK  All right  we'll try to do a few laps around and bring it back in. Here we go. PM  The video worked right for the first few and I don't know why it    there it goes. Oh  that was only a minute  but I think you'd be safe to have that near the end of the flight  perhaps. We get to do the classic. All right. If this hits you  it will not hurt you. OK. Thank you very much. Thank you. But now  as they say in infomercials  we have something much better for you  which we're working on  planes that are only six inches       centimeters    in size. And Matt's plane was on the cover of Popular Science last month  showing what this can lead to. And in a while  something this size will have GPS and a video camera in it. We've had one of these fly nine miles through the air at    miles an hour with just a little battery in it. But there's a lot of technology going. There are just milestones along the way of some remarkable things. This one doesn't have the video in it  but you get a little feel from what it can do. OK  here we go. MK  Sorry. OK. PM  If you can pass it down when you're done. Yeah  I think    I lost a little orientation  I looked up into this light. It hit the building. And the building was poorly placed  actually. But you're beginning to see what can be done. We're working on projects now    even wing flapping things the size of hawk moths    DARPA contracts  working with Caltech  UCLA. Where all this leads  I don't know. Is it practical  I don't know. But like any basic research  when you're really forced to do things that are way beyond existing technology  you can get there with micro technology  nanotechnology. You can do amazing things when you realize what nature has been doing all along. As you get to these small scales  you realize we have a lot to learn from nature    not with    s    but when you get down to the nature's realm  nature has     million years of experience. It never makes a mistake. Because if you make a mistake  you don't leave any progeny. We should have nothing but success stories from nature  for you or for birds  and we're learning a lot from its fascinating subjects. In concluding  I want to get back to the big picture and I have just two final slides to try and put it in perspective. The first I'll just read. At last  I put in three sentences and had it say what I wanted. Over billions of years on a unique sphere  chance has painted a thin covering of life    complex  improbable  wonderful and fragile. Suddenly  we humans    a recently arrived species  no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature    have grown in population  technology and intelligence to a position of terrible power. We now wield the paintbrush. And that's serious  we're not very bright. We're short on wisdom  we're high on technology. Where's it going to lead  Well  inspired by the sentences  I decided to wield the paintbrush. Every    years I do a picture. Here's the one    tries to show that the world isn't getting any bigger. Sort of a timeline  very non linear scale  nature rates and trilobites and dinosaurs  and eventually we saw some humans with caves ... Birds were flying overhead  after pterosaurs. And then we get to the civilization above the little TV set with a gun on it. Then traffic jams  and power systems  and some dots for digital. Where it's going to lead    I have no idea. And so I just put robotic and natural cockroaches out there  but you can fill in whatever you want. This is not a forecast. This is a warning  and we have to think seriously about it. And that time when this is happening is not     years or     years. Things are going on this decade  next decade  it's a very short time that we have to decide what we are going to do. And if we can get some agreement on where we want the world to be    desirable  sustainable when your kids reach your age    I think we actually can reach it. Now  I said this was a warning  not a forecast. That was before    I painted this before we started in on making robotic versions of hawk moths and cockroaches  and now I'm beginning to wonder seriously    was this more of a forecast than I wanted  I personally think the surviving intelligent life form on earth is not going to be carbon based  it's going to be silicon based. And so where it all goes  I don't know. The one final bit of sparkle we'll put in at the very end here is an utterly impractical flight vehicle  which is a little ornithopter wing flapping device that    rubber band powered    that we'll show you. MK     gram. Sorry  one gram. PM  Last night we gave it a few too many turns and it tried to bash the roof out also. It's about a gram. The tube there's hollow  about paper thin. And if this lands on you  I assure you it will not hurt you. But if you reach out to grab it or hold it  you will destroy it. So  be gentle  just act like a wooden Indian or something. And when it comes down    and we'll see how it goes. We consider this to be sort of the spirit of TED. And you wonder  is it practical  And it turns out if I had not been    Unfortunately  we have some light bulb changes. We can probably get it down  but it's possible it's gone up to a greater destiny up there       than it ever had. And I wanted to make    just    But I want to make just two points. One is  you think it's frivolous  there's nothing to it. And yet if I had not been making ornithopters like that  a little bit cruder  in         a long  long time ago    there wouldn't have been a Gossamer Condor  there wouldn't have been an Albatross  a Solar Challenger  there wouldn't be an Impact car  there wouldn't be a mandate on zero emission vehicles in California. A lot of these things    or similar    would have happened some time  probably a decade later. I didn't realize at the time I was doing inquiry based  hands on things with teams  like they're trying to get in education systems. So I think that  as a symbol  it's important. And I believe that also is important. You can think of it as a sort of a symbol for learning and TED that somehow gets you thinking of technology and nature  and puts it all together in things that are    that make this conference  I think  more important than any that's taken place in this country in this decade. Thank you.  Applause  I grew up in Europe  and World War II caught me when I was between seven and    years old. And I realized how few of the grown ups that I knew were able to withstand the tragedies that the war visited on them    how few of them could even resemble a normal  contented  satisfied  happy life once their job  their home  their security was destroyed by the war. So I became interested in understanding what contributed to a life that was worth living. And I tried  as a child  as a teenager  to read philosophy and to get involved in art and religion and many other ways that I could see as a possible answer to that question. And finally I ended up encountering psychology by chance. I was at a ski resort in Switzerland without any money to actually enjoy myself  because the snow had melted and I didn't have money to go to a movie. But I found that on the    I read in the newspapers that there was to be a presentation by someone in a place that I'd seen in the center of Zurich  and it was about flying saucers  that  he was going to talk. And I thought  well  since I can't go to the movies  at least I will go for free to listen to flying saucers. And the man who talked at that evening lecture was very interesting. Instead of talking about little green men  he talked about how the psyche of the Europeans had been traumatized by the war  and now they're projecting flying saucers into the sky. He talked about how the mandalas of ancient Hindu religion were kind of projected into the sky as an attempt to regain some sense of order after the chaos of war. And this seemed very interesting to me. And I started reading his books after that lecture. And that was Carl Jung  whose name or work I had no idea about. Then I came to this country to study psychology and I started trying to understand the roots of happiness. This is a typical result that many people have presented  and there are many variations on it. But this  for instance  shows that about    percent of the people surveyed in the United States since      say that their life is very happy. And that hasn't changed at all. Whereas the personal income  on a scale that has been held constant to accommodate for inflation  has more than doubled  almost tripled  in that period. But you find essentially the same results  namely  that after a certain basic point    which corresponds more or less to just a few       dollars above the minimum poverty level    increases in material well being don't seem to affect how happy people are. In fact  you can find that the lack of basic resources  material resources  contributes to unhappiness  but the increase in material resources does not increase happiness. So my research has been focused more on    after finding out these things that actually corresponded to my own experience  I tried to understand  where    in everyday life  in our normal experience    do we feel really happy  And to start those studies about    years ago  I began to look at creative people    first artists and scientists  and so forth    trying to understand what made them feel that it was worth essentially spending their life doing things for which many of them didn't expect either fame or fortune  but which made their life meaningful and worth doing. This was one of the leading composers of American music back in the '  s. And the interview was    pages long. But this little excerpt is a very good summary of what he was saying during the interview. And it describes how he feels when composing is going well. And he says by describing it as an ecstatic state. Now   ecstasy  in Greek meant simply to stand to the side of something. And then it became essentially an analogy for a mental state where you feel that you are not doing your ordinary everyday routines. So ecstasy is essentially a stepping into an alternative reality. And it's interesting  if you think about it  how  when we think about the civilizations that we look up to as having been pinnacles of human achievement    whether it's China  Greece  the Hindu civilization  or the Mayas  or Egyptians    what we know about them is really about their ecstasies  not about their everyday life. We know the temples they built  where people could come to experience a different reality. We know about the circuses  the arenas  the theaters. These are the remains of civilizations and they are the places that people went to experience life in a more concentrated  more ordered form. Now  this man doesn't need to go to a place like this  which is also    this place  this arena  which is built like a Greek amphitheatre  is a place for ecstasy also. We are participating in a reality that is different from that of the everyday life that we're used to. But this man doesn't need to go there. He needs just a piece of paper where he can put down little marks  and as he does that  he can imagine sounds that had not existed before in that particular combination. So once he gets to that point of beginning to create  like Jennifer did in her improvisation  a new reality    that is  a moment of ecstasy    he enters that different reality. Now he says also that this is so intense an experience that it feels almost as if he didn't exist. And that sounds like a kind of a romantic exaggeration. But actually  our nervous system is incapable of processing more than about     bits of information per second. And in order to hear me and understand what I'm saying  you need to process about    bits per second. That's why you can't hear more than two people. You can't understand more than two people talking to you. Well  when you are really involved in this completely engaging process of creating something new  as this man is  he doesn't have enough attention left over to monitor how his body feels  or his problems at home. He can't feel even that he's hungry or tired. His body disappears  his identity disappears from his consciousness  because he doesn't have enough attention  like none of us do  to really do well something that requires a lot of concentration  and at the same time to feel that he exists. So existence is temporarily suspended. And he says that his hand seems to be moving by itself. Now  I could look at my hand for two weeks  and I wouldn't feel any awe or wonder  because I can't compose.  Laughter  So what it's telling you here is that obviously this automatic  spontaneous process that he's describing can only happen to someone who is very well trained and who has developed technique. And it has become a kind of a truism in the study of creativity that you can't be creating anything with less than    years of technical knowledge immersion in a particular field. Whether it's mathematics or music  it takes that long to be able to begin to change something in a way that it's better than what was there before. Now  when that happens  he says the music just flows out. And because all of these people I started interviewing    this was an interview which is over    years old    so many of the people described this as a spontaneous flow that I called this type of experience the  flow experience.  And it happens in different realms. For instance  a poet describes it in this form. This is by a student of mine who interviewed some of the leading writers and poets in the United States. And it describes the same effortless  spontaneous feeling that you get when you enter into this ecstatic state. This poet describes it as opening a door that floats in the sky    a very similar description to what Albert Einstein gave as to how he imagined the forces of relativity  when he was struggling with trying to understand how it worked. But it happens in other activities. For instance  this is another student of mine  Susan Jackson from Australia  who did work with some of the leading athletes in the world. And you see here in this description of an Olympic skater  the same essential description of the phenomenology of the inner state of the person. You don't think  it goes automatically  if you merge yourself with the music  and so forth. It happens also  actually  in the most recent book I wrote  called  Good Business   where I interviewed some of the CEOs who had been nominated by their peers as being both very successful and very ethical  very socially responsible. You see that these people define success as something that helps others and at the same time makes you feel happy as you are working at it. And like all of these successful and responsible CEOs say  you can't have just one of these things be successful if you want a meaningful and successful job. Anita Roddick is another one of these CEOs we interviewed. She is the founder of Body Shop  the natural cosmetics king. It's kind of a passion that comes from doing the best and having flow while you're working. This is an interesting little quote from Masaru Ibuka  who was at that time starting out Sony without any money  without a product    they didn't have a product  they didn't have anything  but they had an idea. And the idea he had was to establish a place of work where engineers can feel the joy of technological innovation  be aware of their mission to society and work to their heart's content. I couldn't improve on this as a good example of how flow enters the workplace. Now  when we do studies    we have  with other colleagues around the world  done over       interviews of people    from Dominican monks  to blind nuns  to Himalayan climbers  to Navajo shepherds    who enjoy their work. And regardless of the culture  regardless of education or whatever  there are these seven conditions that seem to be there when a person is in flow. There's this focus that  once it becomes intense  leads to a sense of ecstasy  a sense of clarity  you know exactly what you want to do from one moment to the other  you get immediate feedback. You know that what you need to do is possible to do  even though difficult  and sense of time disappears  you forget yourself  you feel part of something larger. And once the conditions are present  what you are doing becomes worth doing for its own sake. In our studies  we represent the everyday life of people in this simple scheme. And we can measure this very precisely  actually  because we give people electronic pagers that go off    times a day  and whenever they go off you say what you're doing  how you feel  where you are  what you're thinking about. And two things that we measure is the amount of challenge people experience at that moment and the amount of skill that they feel they have at that moment. So for each person we can establish an average  which is the center of the diagram. That would be your mean level of challenge and skill  which will be different from that of anybody else. But you have a kind of a set point there  which would be in the middle. If we know what that set point is  we can predict fairly accurately when you will be in flow  and it will be when your challenges are higher than average and skills are higher than average. And you may be doing things very differently from other people  but for everyone that flow channel  that area there  will be when you are doing what you really like to do    play the piano  be with your best friend  perhaps work  if work is what provides flow for you. And then the other areas become less and less positive. Arousal is still good because you are over challenged there. Your skills are not quite as high as they should be  but you can move into flow fairly easily by just developing a little more skill. So  arousal is the area where most people learn from  because that's where they're pushed beyond their comfort zone and to enter that    going back to flow    then they develop higher skills. Control is also a good place to be  because there you feel comfortable  but not very excited. It's not very challenging any more. And if you want to enter flow from control  you have to increase the challenges. So those two are ideal and complementary areas from which flow is easy to go into. The other combinations of challenge and skill become progressively less optimal. Relaxation is fine    you still feel OK. Boredom begins to be very aversive and apathy becomes very negative  you don't feel that you're doing anything  you don't use your skills  there's no challenge. Unfortunately  a lot of people's experience is in apathy. The largest single contributor to that experience is watching television  the next one is being in the bathroom  sitting. Even though sometimes watching television about seven to eight percent of the time is in flow  but that's when you choose a program you really want to watch and you get feedback from it. So the question we are trying to address    and I'm way over time    is how to put more and more of everyday life in that flow channel. And that is the kind of challenge that we're trying to understand. And some of you obviously know how to do that spontaneously without any advice  but unfortunately a lot of people don't. And that's what our mandate is  in a way  to do. Thank you. When I first arrived in beautiful Zimbabwe  it was difficult to understand that    percent of the population is HIV positive. It really wasn't until I was invited to the homes of people that I started to understand the human toll of the epidemic. For instance  this is Herbert with his grandmother. When I first met him  he was sitting on his grandmother's lap. He has been orphaned  as both of his parents died of AIDS  and his grandmother took care of him until he too died of AIDS. He liked to sit on her lap because he said that it was painful for him to lie in his own bed. When she got up to make tea  she placed him in my own lap and I had never felt a child that was that emaciated. Before I left  I actually asked him if I could get him something. I thought he would ask for a toy  or candy  and he asked me for slippers  because he said that his feet were cold. This is Joyce who's    in this picture      . Single mother  HIV positive. I photographed her before and after the birth of her beautiful baby girl  Issa. And I was last week walking on Lafayette Street in Manhattan and got a call from a woman who I didn't know  but she called to tell me that Joyce had passed away at the age of   . Joyce's mother is now taking care of her daughter  like so many other Zimbabwean children who've been orphaned by the epidemic. So a few of the stories. With every picture  there are individuals who have full lives and stories that deserve to be told. All these pictures are from Zimbabwe. Chris Anderson  Kirsten  will you just take one minute  just to tell your own story of how you got to Africa  Kirsten Ashburn  Mmm  gosh. CA  Just    KA  Actually  I was working at the time  doing production for a fashion photographer. And I was constantly reading the New York Times  and stunned by the statistics  the numbers. It was just frightening. So I quit my job and decided that that's the subject that I wanted to tackle. And I first actually went to Botswana  where I spent a month    this is in December         then went to Zimbabwe for a month and a half  and then went back again this March      for another month and a half in Zimbabwe. CA  That's an amazing story  thank you. KB  Thanks for letting me show these. I think all of us have been interested  at one time or another  in the romantic mysteries of all those societies that collapsed  such as the classic Maya in the Yucatan  the Easter Islanders  the Anasazi  Fertile Crescent society  Angor Wat  Great Zimbabwe and so on. And within the last decade or two  archaeologists have shown us that there were environmental problems underlying many of these past collapses. But there were also plenty of places in the world where societies have been developing for thousands of years without any sign of a major collapse  such as Japan  Java  Tonga and Tikopea. So evidently  societies in some areas are more fragile than in other areas. How can we understand what makes some societies more fragile than other societies  The problem is obviously relevant to our situation today  because today as well  there are some societies that have already collapsed  such as Somalia and Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. There are also societies today that may be close to collapse  such as Nepal  Indonesia and Columbia. What about ourselves  What is there that we can learn from the past that would help us avoid declining or collapsing in the way that so many past societies have  Obviously the answer to this question is not going to be a single factor. If anyone tells you that there is a single factor explanation for societal collapses  you know right away that they're an idiot. This is a complex subject. But how can we make sense out of the complexities of this subject  In analyzing societal collapses  I've arrived at a five point framework    a checklist of things that I go through to try and understand collapses. And I'll illustrate that five point framework by the extinction of the Greenland Norse society. This is a European society with literate records  so we know a good deal about the people and their motivation. In AD     Vikings went out to Greenland  settled Greenland  and around      they died out    the society collapsed  and every one of them ended up dead. Why did they all end up dead  Well  in my five point framework  the first item on the framework is to look for human impacts on the environment  people inadvertently destroying the resource base on which they depend. And in the case of the Viking Norse  the Vikings inadvertently caused soil erosion and deforestation  which was a particular problem for them because they required forests to make charcoal  to make iron. So they ended up an Iron Age European society  virtually unable to make their own iron. A second item on my checklist is climate change. Climate can get warmer or colder or dryer or wetter. In the case of the Vikings    in Greenland  the climate got colder in the late     s  and especially in the     s. But a cold climate isn't necessarily fatal  because the Inuit    the Eskimos inhabiting Greenland at the same time    did better  rather than worse  with cold climates. So why didn't the Greenland Norse as well  The third thing on my checklist is relations with neighboring friendly societies that may prop up a society. And if that friendly support is pulled away  that may make a society more likely to collapse. In the case of the Greenland Norse  they had trade with the mother country    Norway    and that trade dwindled  partly because Norway got weaker  partly because of sea ice between Greenland and Norway. The fourth item on my checklist is relations with hostile societies. In the case of Norse Greenland  the hostiles were the Inuit    the Eskimos sharing Greenland    with whom the Norse got off to bad relationships. And we know that the Inuit killed the Norse and  probably of greater importance  may have blocked access to the outer fjords  on which the Norse depended for seals at a critical time of the year. And then finally  the fifth item on my checklist is the political  economic  social and cultural factors in the society that make it more or less likely that the society will perceive and solve its environmental problems. In the case of the Greenland Norse  cultural factors that made it difficult for them to solve their problems were  their commitments to a Christian society investing heavily in cathedrals  their being a competitive ranked chiefly society  and their scorn for the Inuit  from whom they refused to learn. So that's how the five part framework is relevant to the collapse and eventual extinction of the Greenland Norse. What about a society today  For the past five years  I've been taking my wife and kids to Southwestern Montana  where I worked as a teenager on the hay harvest. And Montana  at first sight  seems like the most pristine environment in the United States. But scratch the surface  and Montana suffers from serious problems. Going through the same checklist  human environmental impacts  Yes  acute in Montana. Toxic problems from mine waste have caused damage of billions of dollars. Problems from weeds  weed control  cost Montana nearly     million dollars a year. Montana has lost agricultural areas from salinization  problems of forest management  problems of forest fires. Second item on my checklist  climate change. Yes    the climate in Montana is getting warmer and drier  but Montana agriculture depends especially on irrigation from the snow pack  and as the snow is melting    for example  as the glaciers in Glacier National Park are disappearing    that's bad news for Montana irrigation agriculture. Third thing on my checklist  relations with friendlies that can sustain the society. In Montana today  more than half of the income of Montana is not earned within Montana  but is derived from out of state  transfer payments from social security  investments and so on    which makes Montana vulnerable to the rest of the United States. Fourth  relations with hostiles. Montanans have the same problems as do all Americans  in being sensitive to problems created by hostiles overseas affecting our oil supplies  and terrorist attacks. And finally  last item on my checklist  question of how political  economic  social  cultural attitudes play into this. Montanans have long held values  which today seem to be getting in the way of their solving their own problems. Long held devotion to logging and to mines and to agriculture  and to no government regulation  values that worked well in the past  but they don't seem to be working well today. So  I'm looking at these issues of collapses for a lot of past societies and for many present societies. Are there any general conclusions that arise  In a way  just like Tolstoy's statement about every unhappy marriage being different  every collapsed or endangered society is different    they all have different details. But nevertheless  there are certain common threads that emerge from these comparisons of past societies that did or did not collapse and threatened societies today. One interesting common thread has to do with  in many cases  the rapidity of collapse after a society reaches its peak. There are many societies that don't wind down gradually  but they build up    get richer and more powerful    and then within a short time  within a few decades after their peak  they collapse. For example  the classic lowland Maya of the Yucatan began to collapse in the early    s    literally a few decades after the Maya were building their biggest monuments  and Maya population was greatest. Or again  the collapse of the Soviet Union took place within a couple of decades  maybe within a decade  of the time when the Soviet Union was at its greatest power. An analogue would be the growth of bacteria in a petri dish. These rapid collapses are especially likely where there's a mismatch between available resources and resource consumption  or a mismatch between economic outlays and economic potential. In a petri dish  bacteria grow. Say they double every generation  and five generations before the end the petri dish is      ths empty  and then the next generation's    ths empty  and the next generation half empty. Within one generation after the petri dish still being half empty  it is full. There's no more food and the bacteria have collapsed. So  this is a frequent theme  societies collapse very soon after reaching their peak in power. What it means to put it mathematically is that  if you're concerned about a society today  you should be looking not at the value of the mathematical function    the wealth itself    but you should be looking at the first derivative and the second derivatives of the function. That's one general theme. A second general theme is that there are many  often subtle environmental factors that make some societies more fragile than others. Many of those factors are not well understood. For example  why is it that in the Pacific  of those hundreds of Pacific islands  why did Easter Island end up as the most devastating case of complete deforestation  It turns out that there were about nine different environmental factors    some  rather subtle ones    that were working against the Easter Islanders  and they involve fallout of volcanic tephra  latitude  rainfall. Perhaps the most subtle of them is that it turns out that a major input of nutrients which protects island environments in the Pacific is from the fallout of continental dust from central Asia. Easter  of all Pacific islands  has the least input of dust from Asia restoring the fertility of its soils. But that's a factor that we didn't even appreciate until     . So  some societies  for subtle environmental reasons  are more fragile than others. And then finally  another generalization. I'm now teaching a course at UCLA  to UCLA undergraduates  on these collapses of societies. What really bugs my UCLA undergraduate students is  how on earth did these societies not see what they were doing  How could the Easter Islanders have deforested their environment  What did they say when they were cutting down the last palm tree  Didn't they see what they were doing  How could societies not perceive their impacts on the environments and stop in time  And I would expect that  if our human civilization carries on  then maybe in the next century people will be asking  why on earth did these people today in the year      not see the obvious things that they were doing and take corrective action  It seems incredible in the past. In the future  it'll seem incredible what we are doing today. And so I've been trying to develop a hierarchical set of considerations about why societies fail to solve their problems    why they fail to perceive the problems or  if they perceive them  why they fail to tackle them. Or  if they tackle them  why do they fail to succeed in solving them  I'll just mention two generalizations in this area. One blueprint for trouble  making collapse likely  is where there is a conflict of interest between the short term interest of the decision making elites and the long term interest of the society as a whole  especially if the elites are able to insulate themselves from the consequences of their actions. Where what's good in the short run for the elite is bad for the society as a whole  there's a real risk of the elite doing things that would bring the society down in the long run. For example  among the Greenland Norse    a competitive rank society    what the chiefs really wanted is more followers and more sheep and more resources to outcompete the neighboring chiefs. And that led the chiefs to do what's called flogging the land  overstocking the land  forcing tenant farmers into dependency. And that made the chiefs powerful in the short run  but led to the society's collapse in the long run. Those same issues of conflicts of interest are acute in the United States today. Especially because the decision makers in the United States are frequently able to insulate themselves from consequences by living in gated compounds  by drinking bottled water and so on. And within the last couple of years  it's been obvious that the elite in the business world correctly perceive that they can advance their short term interest by doing things that are good for them but bad for society as a whole  such as draining a few billion dollars out of Enron and other businesses. They are quite correct that these things are good for them in the short term  although bad for society in the long term. So  that's one general conclusion about why societies make bad decisions  conflicts of interest. And the other generalization that I want to mention is that it's particularly hard for a society to make quote unquote good decisions when there is a conflict involving strongly held values that are good in many circumstances but are poor in other circumstances. For example  the Greenland Norse  in this difficult environment  were held together for four and a half centuries by their shared commitment to religion  and by their strong social cohesion. But those two things    commitment to religion and strong social cohesion    also made it difficult for them to change at the end and to learn from the Inuit. Or today    Australia. One of the things that enabled Australia to survive in this remote outpost of European civilization for     years has been their British identity. But today  their commitment to a British identity is serving Australians poorly in their need to adapt to their situation in Asia. So it's particularly difficult to change course when the things that get you in trouble are the things that are also the source of your strength. What's going to be the outcome today  Well  all of us know the dozen sorts of ticking time bombs going on in the modern world  time bombs that have fuses of a few decades to    all of them  not more than    years  and any one of which can do us in  the time bombs of water  of soil  of climate change  invasive species  the photosynthetic ceiling  population problems  toxics  etc.  etc.    listing about    of them. And while these time bombs    none of them has a fuse beyond    years  and most of them have fuses of a few decades    some of them  in some places  have much shorter fuses. At the rate at which we're going now  the Philippines will lose all its accessible loggable forest within five years. And the Solomon Islands are only one year away from losing their loggable forest  which is their major export. And that's going to be spectacular for the economy of the Solomons. People often ask me  Jared  what's the most important thing that we need to do about the world's environmental problems  And my answer is  the most important thing we need to do is to forget about there being any single thing that is the most important thing we need to do. Instead  there are a dozen things  any one of which could do us in. And we've got to get them all right  because if we solve     we fail to solve the   th    we're in trouble. For example  if we solve our problems of water and soil and population  but don't solve our problems of toxics  then we are in trouble. The fact is that our present course is a non sustainable course  which means  by definition  that it cannot be maintained. And the outcome is going to get resolved within a few decades. That means that those of us in this room who are less than    or    years old will see how these paradoxes are resolved  and those of us who are over the age of    may not see the resolution  but our children and grandchildren certainly will. The resolution is going to achieve either of two forms  either we will resolve these non sustainable time fuses in pleasant ways of our own choice by taking remedial action  or else these conflicts are going to get settled in unpleasant ways not of our choice    namely  by war  disease or starvation. But what's for sure is that our non sustainable course will get resolved in one way or another in a few decades. In other words  since the theme of this session is choices  we have a choice. Does that mean that we should get pessimistic and overwhelmed  I draw the reverse conclusion. The big problems facing the world today are not at all things beyond our control. Our biggest threat is not an asteroid about to crash into us  something we can do nothing about. Instead  all the major threats facing us today are problems entirely of our own making. And since we made the problems  we can also solve the problems. That then means that it's entirely in our power to deal with these problems. In particular  what can all of us do  For those of you who are interested in these choices  there are lots of things you can do. There's a lot that we don't understand  and that we need to understand. And there's a lot that we already do understand  but aren't doing  and that we need to be doing. Thank you. Zach Kaplan  Keith and I lead a research team. We investigate materials and technologies that have unexpected properties. Over the last three years  we found over     of these things  and so we looked back into our library and selected six we thought would be most surprising for TED. Of these six  the first one that we're going to talk about is in the black envelope you're holding. It comes from a company in Japan called GelTech. Now go ahead and open it up. Keith Schacht  Now be sure and take the two pieces apart. What's unexpected about this is that it's soft  but it's also a strong magnet. Zach and I have always been fascinated observing unexpected things like this. We spent a long time thinking about why this is  and it's just recently that we realized  it's when we see something unexpected  it changes our understanding of the way things work. As you're seeing this gel magnet for the first time  if you assume that all magnets had to be hard  then seeing this surprised you and it changed your understanding of the way magnets could work. ZK  Now  it's important to understand what the unexpected properties are. But to really think about the implications of what this makes possible  we found that it helps to think about how it could be applied in the world. So  a first idea is to use it on cabinet doors. If you line the sides of the cabinets using the gel material    if a cabinet slams shut it wouldn't make a loud noise  and in addition the magnets would draw the cabinets closed. Imagine taking the same material  but putting it on the bottom of a sneaker. You know  this way you could go to the container store and buy one of those metal sheets that they hang on the back of your door  in your closet  and you could literally stick your shoes up instead of using a shelf. For me  I really love this idea. If you come to my apartment and see my closet  I'm sure you'd figure out why  it's a mess. KS  Seeing the unexpected properties and then seeing a couple of applications    it helps you see why this is significant  what the potential is. But we've found that the way we present our ideas it makes a big difference. ZK  It was like six months ago that Keith and I were out in L.A.  and we were at Starbucks having coffee with Roman Coppola. He works on mostly music videos and commercials with his company  The Directors Bureau. As we were talking  Roman told us that he's kind of an inventor on the side. And we were showing him the same gel magnet that you're holding in your hand    and you know  we shared the same ideas. And you could see it in his face  Roman starts to get really excited and he whips out this manila folder  he opens it up and Keith and I look in  and he starts showing us concepts that he's been working on. These things just get him really excited. And so we're looking at these concepts  and we were just like  whoa  this guy's good. Because the way that he presented the concept    his approach was totally different than ours. He sold it to you as if it was for sale right now. When we were going in the car back to the airport  we were thinking  why was this so powerful  And as we thought about it more  we realized that it let you fill in all the details about the experience  just as if you saw it on TV. So  for TED we decided to take our favorite idea for the gel magnet and work with Roman and his team at the Directors Bureau to create a commercial for a product from the future.

KS  Now  we showed the concept to a few people before this  and they asked us  when's it coming out  So I just wanted to let you know  it's not actually coming out  just the concept is. ZK  So now  when we dream up these concepts  it's important for us to make sure that they work from a technical standpoint. So I just want to quickly explain how this would work. This is the magnetically levitating board that they mentioned in the commercial. The gel that you're holding would be lining the bottom of the board. Now this is important for two reasons. One  the soft properties of the magnet that make it so that  if it were to hit the rider in the head  it wouldn't injure him. In addition  you can see from the diagram on the right  the underpart of the slide would be an electromagnet. So this would actually repel the rider a little bit as you're going down. The force of the water rushing down  in addition to that repulsion force  would make this slide go faster than any slide on the market. It's because of this that you need the magnetic braking system. When you get to the very bottom of the slide       the rider passes through an aluminum tube. And I'm going to kick it to Keith to explain why that's important from a technical standpoint. KS  So I'm sure all you engineers know that even though aluminum is a metal  it's not a magnetic material. But something unexpected happens when you drop a magnet down an aluminum tube. So we set up a quick experiment here to show that to you. Now  you see the magnet fell really slowly. Now  I'm not going to get into the physics of it  but all you need to know is that the faster the magnet's falling  the greater the stopping force. ZK  Now  our next technology is actually a    foot pole  and I have it right here in my pocket. There're a few different versions of it. KS  Some of them automatically unroll like this one. They can be made to automatically roll up  or they can be made stable  like Zach's  to hold any position in between. ZK  As we were talking to the vendor    to try to learn about how you could apply these  or how they're being applied currently    he was telling us that  in the military they use this one so soldiers can keep it on their chests    very concealed    and then  when they're out on the field  erect it as an antenna to clearly send signals back to the base. In our brainstorms  we came up with the idea you could use it for a soccer goal  so at the end of the game  you just roll up the goal and put it in your gym bag. KS  Now  the interesting thing about this is  you don't have to be an engineer to appreciate why a    foot pole that can fit in your pocket is so interesting. So we decided to go out onto the streets of Chicago and ask a few people on the streets what they thought you could do with this. Man  I clean my ceiling fans with that and I get the spider webs off my house    I do it that way. Woman  I'd make my very own walking stick. Woman  I would create a ladder to use to get up on top of the tree. Woman  An olive server. Man  Some type of extension pole    like what the painters use. Woman  I would make a spear that  when you went deep sea diving  you could catch the fish really fast  and then roll it back up  and you could swim easier ... Yeah. ZK  Now  for our next technology we're going to do a little demonstration  and so we need a volunteer from the audience. You sir  come on up. Come on up. Tell everybody your name. Steve Jurvetson  Steve. ZK  It's Steve. All right Steve  now  follow me. We need you to stand right in front of the TED sign. Right there. That's great. And hold onto this. Good luck to you. KS  No  not yet. ZK  I'd just like to let you all know that this presentation has been brought to you by Target. KS  Little bit    that's perfect  just perfect. Now  Zach  we're going to demonstrate a water gun fight from the future. So here  come on up to the front. All right  so now if you'll see here    no  no  it's OK. So  describe to the audience the temperature of your shirt. Go ahead. SJ  It's cold. KS  Now the reason it's cold is that's it's not actually water loaded into these squirt guns    it's a dry liquid developed by  M. It's perfectly clear  it's odorless  it's colorless. It's so safe you could drink this stuff. And the reason it feels cold is because it evaporates    times faster than water. All right  well thanks for coming up. ZK  Wait  wait  Steven    before you go we filled this with the dry liquid so during the break you can shoot your friends. SJ  Excellent  thank you. KS  Thanks for coming up. Let's give him a big round of applause. So what's the significance of this dry liquid  Early versions of the fluid were actually used on a Cray Supercomputer. Now  the unexpected thing about this is that Zach could stand up on stage and drench a perfectly innocent member of the audience without any concern that we'd damage the electronics  that we'd get him wet  that we'd hurt the books or the computers. It works because it's non conductive. So you can see here  you can immerse a whole circuit board in this and it wouldn't cause any damage. You can circulate it to draw the heat away. But today it's most widely used in office buildings    in the sprinkler system    as a fire suppression fluid. Again  it's perfectly safe for people. It puts out the fires  doesn't hurt anything. But our favorite idea for this was using it in a basketball game. So during halftime  it could rain down on the players  cool everyone down  and in a matter of minutes it would dry. Wouldn't hurt the court. ZK  Our next technology comes to us from a company in Japan called Sekisui Chemical. One of their R D engineers was working on a way to make plastic stiffer. While he was doing this  he noticed an unexpected thing. We have a video to show you. KS  So you see there  it didn't bounce back. Now  this was an unintended side effect of some experiments they were doing. It's technically called   shape retaining property.  Now  think about your interactions with aluminum foil. Shape retaining is common in metal  you bend a piece of aluminum foil  and it holds its place. Contrast that with a plastic garbage can    and you can push in the sides and it always bounces back. ZK  For example  you could make a watch that wraps around your wrist  but doesn't use a buckle. Taking it a little further  if you wove those strips together    kind of like a little basket    you could make a shape retaining sheet  and then you could embed it in a cloth  so you could make a picnic sheet that wraps around the table  so that way on a windy day it wouldn't blow away. For our next technology  it's hard to observe the unexpected property by itself  because it's an ink. So  we've prepared a video to show it applied to paper. KS  As this paper is bending  the resistance of the ink changes. So with simple electronics  you can detect how much the page is being bent. Now  to think about the potential for this  think of all the places ink is supplied  on business cards  on the back of cereal boxes  board games. Any place you use ink  you could change the way you interact with it. ZK  So my favorite idea for this is to apply the ink to a book. This could totally change the way that you interface with paper. You see the dark line on the side and the top. As you turn the pages of the book  the book can actually detect what page you're on  based on the curvature of the pages. In addition  if you were to fold in one of the corners  then you could program the book to actually email you the text on the page for your notes. KS  For our last technology  we worked again with Roman and his team at the Directors Bureau to develop a commercial from the future to explain how it works. Old Milk Carton  Oh yeah  it smells good. Who are you  New Milk Carton  I'm New Milk. OMC  I used to smell like you. Narrator  Fresh Watch  from Inventables Dairy Farms. Packaging that changes color when your milk's gone off. Don't let milk spoil your morning. ZK  Now  this technology was developed by these two guys  Professor Ken Suslick and Neil Rakow  of the University of Illinois. KS  Now the way it works  there's a matrix of color dyes. And these dyes change color in response to odors. So the smell of vanilla  that might change the four on the left to brown and the one on the right to yellow. This matrix can produce thousands of different color combinations to represent thousands of different smells. But like in the milk commercial  if you know what odor you want to detect  then they can formulate a specific dye to detect just that odor. ZK  Right. It was that that started a conversation with Professor Suslick and myself  and he was explaining to me the things that this is making possible  beyond just detecting spoiled food. It's really where the significance of it lies. His company actually did a survey of firemen all across the country to try to learn  how are they currently testing the air when they respond to an emergency scene  And he kind of comically explained that time after time  what the firemen would say is  they would rush to the scene of the crime  they would look around  if there were no dead policemen  it was OK to go. I mean  this is a true story. They're using policemen as canaries. But more seriously  they determined that you could develop a device that can smell better than the humans  and say if it's safe for the firemen. In addition  he's spun off a company from the University called ChemSensing  where they're working on medical equipment. So  a patient can come in and actually blow into their device. By detecting the odor of particular bacteria  or viruses  or even lung cancer  the dots will change and they can use software to analyze the results. This can radically improve the way that doctors diagnose patients. Currently  they're using a method of trial and error  but this could tell you precisely what disease you have. KS  So that was the six we had for you today  but I hope you're starting to see why we find these things so fascinating. Because every one of these six changed our understanding of what was possible in the world. Prior to seeing this  we would have assumed  a    foot pole couldn't fit in your pocket  something as inexpensive as ink couldn't sense the way paper is being bent  every one of these things    and we're constantly trying to find more. ZK  This is something that Keith and I really enjoy doing. I'm sure it's obvious to you now  but it was actually yesterday that I was reminded of why. I was having a conversation with Steve Jurvetson  over downstairs by the escalators  and he was telling me that when Chris sent out that little box  one of the items in it was the hydrophobic sand    the sand that doesn't get wet. He said that he was playing with it with his son. And you know  his son was mesmerized  because he would dunk it in the water  he would take it out and it was bone dry. A few weeks later  he said that his son was playing with a lock of his mother's hair  and he noticed that there were some drops of water on the hair. And he took the thing and he looked up to Steve and he said   Look  hydrophobic string.  I mean  after hearing that story    that really summed it up for me. Thank you very much. KS  Thank you. This is very strange for me  because I m not used to doing this  I usually stand on the other side of the light  and now I'm feeling the pressure I put other people into. And it's hard ... The previous speaker has  I think  really painted a very good background as to the impulse behind my work and what drives me  and my sense of loss  and trying to find the answer to the big questions. But this  for me  I mean  coming here to do this  feels like    there s this sculptor that I like very much  Giacometti  who after many years of living in France    and learning  you know  studying and working    he returned home and he was asked  what did you produce  What have you done with so many years of being away  And he sort of  he showed a handful of figurines. And obviously they were   Is this what you spent years doing  And we expected huge masterpieces   But what struck me is the understanding that in those little pieces was the culmination of a man s life  search  thought  everything    just in a reduced  small version. In a way  I feel like that. I feel like I m coming home to talk about what I ve been away doing for    years. And I will start with a brief taster of what I ve been about  a handful of films    nothing much  two feature films and a handful of short films. So  we ll go with the first piece. I love her  you know. She s not even my real mum. My real mum and dad dumped me and fucked off back to Nigeria. The devil is in me  Court. Court  Sleep. Woman  Have you ever been  Court  Where  Woman  Nigeria. Court  Never. My mum wanted to  couldn t afford it. Woman  Wish I could. I have this feeling I d be happy there. Why does everyone get rid of me  Court  I don't want to get rid of you. Woman  You don't need me. You re just too blind to see it now. Boy  What do you do all day  Marcus  Read. Boy  Don't you get bored  And how come you ain't got a job anyway  Marcus  I am retired. Boy  So  Marcus  So I've done my bit for Queen and country  now I work for myself. Boy  No  now you sit around like a bum all day. Marcus  Because I do what I like  Boy  Look man  reading don't feed no one. And it particularly don't feed your spliff habit. Marcus  It feeds my mind and my soul. Boy  Arguing with you is a waste of time  Marcus. Marcus  You re a rapper  am I right  Boy  Yeah. Marcus  A modern day poet. Boy  Yeah  you could say that. Marcus  So what do you talk about  Boy  What's that supposed to mean  Marcus  Simple. What do you rap about  Boy  Reality  man. Marcus  Whose reality  Boy  My fuckin' reality. Marcus  Tell me about your reality. Boy  Racism  oppression  people like me not getting a break in life. Marcus  So what solutions do you offer  I mean  the job of a poet is not just    Boy  Man  fight the power  Simple  blow the motherfuckers out of the sky. Marcus  With an AK     Boy  Man  if I had one  too fuckin' right. Marcus  And how many soldiers have you recruited to fight this war with you  Boy  Oh  Marcus  you know what I mean. Marcus  When a man resorts to profanities  it s a sure sign of his inability to express himself. Boy  See man  you re just taking the piss out of me now. Marcus  The Panthers. Boy  Panthers  Ass kickin' guys who were fed up with all that white supremacist  powers that be bullshit  and just went in there and kicked everybody's arse. Fuckin  wicked  man. I saw the movie. Bad  What  Director    I saw his last film.  puise  right  Woman    Yes. D   Not to make a bad joke  but it was really  puis . Epuis     tired  exhausted  fed up. Director    Can you not shut up  Now  you talk straight to me  what s wrong with my films  Let s go. W   They suck. Woman    They suck  What about yours  What  what  what  what about  what  What do you think about your movie  D   My movies  they are OK  fine. They are better than making documentaries no one ever sees. What the fuck are you talking about  Did you ever move your fuckin' ass from Hollywood to go and film something real  You make people fuckin' sleep. Dream about bullshit. Newton Aduaka  Thank you. The first clip  really  is totally trying to capture what cinema is for me  and where I'm coming from in terms of cinema. The first piece was  really  there's a young woman talking about Nigeria  that she has a feeling she'll be happy there. These are the sentiments of someone that's been away from home. And that was something that I went through  you know  and I'm still going through. I've not been home for quite a while  for about five years now. I've been away    years in total. And so it s really    it's really how suddenly  you know  this was made in       which is the time of Abacha    the military dictatorship  the worst part of Nigerian history  this post colonial history. So  for this girl to have these dreams is simply how we preserve a sense of what home is. How    and it's sort of  perhaps romantic  but I think beautiful  because you just need something to hold on to  especially in a society where you feel alienated. Which takes us to the next piece  where the young man talks about lack of opportunity  living as a black person in Europe  the glass ceiling that we all know about  that we all talk about  and his reality. Again  this was my    this was me talking about    this was  again  the time of multiculturalism in the United Kingdom  and there was this buzzword    and it was trying to say  what exactly does this multiculturalism mean in the real lives of people  And what would a child    what does a child like Jamie    the young boy    think  I mean  with all this anger that's built up inside of him  What happens with that  What  of course  happens with that is violence  which we see when we talk about the ghettos and we talk about  you know  South Central L.A. and this kind of stuff  and which eventually  when channeled  becomes  you know  evolves and manifests itself as riots    like the one in France two years ago  where I live  which shocked everybody  because everyone thought   Oh well  France is a liberal society.  But I lived in England for    years. I've lived in France for about four  and I feel actually thrown back    years  living in France. And then  the third piece. The third piece for me is the question  What is cinema to you  What do you do with cinema  There's a young director  Hollywood director  with his friends    fellow filmmakers    talking about what cinema means. I suppose that will take me to my last piece    what cinema means for me. My life started as a    I started life in       a few months before the Biafran  which lasted for three years and it was three years of war. So that whole thing  that whole childhood echoes and takes me into the next piece. Onicha  Yes  mama. Commander  Soldiers  you are going to fight a battle  so you must get ready and willing to die. You must get      Child Soldiers  Ready and willing to die. C  Success  the change is only coming through the barrel of the gun. CS  The barrel of the gun  C  This is the gun. CS  This is the gun. C  This is an AK    rifle. This is your life. This is your life. This is ... this is ... this is your life. Ezra  They give us the special drugs. We call it bubbles. Amphetamines. Soldiers  Rain come  sun come  soldier man dey go. I say rain come  sun come  soldier man dey go. We went from one village to another    three villages. I don t remember how we got there. Witness  We walked and walked for two days. We didn't eat. There was no food  just little rice. Without food    I was sick. The injection made us not to have mind. God will forgive us. He knows we did not know. We did not know  Committee Chairman  Do you remember January  th        Ezra  I don t remember. Various Voices  You will die  You will die   Screaming  Onicha  Ezra   Ezra  Onicha  Onicha   Various Voices    We don't need no more trouble     No more trouble   They killed my mother. The Mende sons of bastards. Who is she  Me. Why you giving these to me  So you can stop staring at me. My story is a little bit complicated. I m interested. Mariam is pregnant. You know what you are  A crocodile. Big mouth. Short legs. In front of Rufus you are Ezra the coward. He s not taking care of his troops. Troop  pay your last honor. Salute. Open your eyes  Ezra. A blind man can see that the diamonds end up in his pocket.   We don't need no more trouble   Get that idiot out  I take you are preparing a major attack  This must be the mine. Your girl is here. Well done  well done. That is what you are here for  no  You are planning to go back to fight are you    We don't need no more trouble     No more trouble     We don't need no more trouble     No more trouble.   Wake up  Everybody wake up. Road block    We don't need no more ...   Committee Chairman  We hope that  with your help and the help of others  that this commission will go a long way towards understanding the causes of the rebel war. More than that  begin a healing process and finally to    as an act of closure to a terrible period in this country s history. The beginning of hope. Mr. Ezra Gelehun  please stand. State your name and age for the commission. Ezra  My name is Ezra Gelehun. I am    or   . I don t remember. Ask my sister  she is the witch  she knows everything. CC  Mr. Gelehun  I d like to remind you you re not on trial here for any crimes you committed. E  We were fighting for our freedom. If killing in a war is a crime  then you have to charge every soldier in the world. War is a crime  yes  but I did not start it. You too are a retired General  not so  CC  Yes  correct. E  So you too must stand trial then. Our government was corrupt. Lack of education was their way to control power. If I may ask  do you pay for school in your country  CC  No  we don t. E  You are richer than us. But we pay for school. Your country talks about democracy  but you support corrupt governments like my own. Why  Because you want our diamond. Ask if anyone in this room have ever seen real diamond before  No. CC  Mr. Gelehun  I'd like to remind you  you're not on trial here today. You are not on trial. E  Then let me go. CC  I can't do that  son. E  So you are a liar. NA  Thank you. Just very quickly to say that my point really here  is that while we re making all these huge advancements  what we're doing  which for me  you know  I think we should    Africa should move forward  but we should remember  so we do not go back here again. Thank you. Emeka Okafor  Thank you  Newton. One of the themes that comes through very strongly in the piece we just watched is this sense of the psychological trauma of the young that have to play this role of being child soldiers. And considering where you are coming from  and when we consider the extent to which it s not taken as seriously as it should be  what would you have to say about that  NA  In the process of my research  I actually spent a bit of time in Sierra Leone researching this. And I remember I met a lot of child soldiers    ex combatants  as they like to be called. I met psychosocial workers who worked with them. I met psychiatrists who spent time with them  aid workers  NGOs  the whole lot. But I remember on the flight back on my last trip  I remember breaking down in tears and thinking to myself  if any kid in the West  in the western world  went through a day of what any of those kids have gone through  they will be in therapy for the rest of their natural lives. So for me  the thought that we have all these children    it s a generation  we have a whole generation of children    who have been put through so much psychological trauma or damage  and Africa has to live with that. But I m just saying to factor that in  factor that in with all this great advancement  all this pronouncement of great achievement. That s really my thinking. EO  Well  we thank you again for coming to the TED stage. That was a very moving piece. NA  Thank you. EO  Thank you. One of my favorite cartoon characters is Snoopy. I love the way he sits and lies on his kennel and contemplates the great things of life. So when I thought about compassion  my mind immediately went to one of the cartoon strips  where he's lying there and he says   I really understand  and I really appreciate how one should love one's neighbor as one love's oneself. The only trouble is the people next door  I can't stand them.  This  in a way  is one of the challenges of how to interpret a really good idea. We all  I think  believe in compassion. If you look at all the world religions  all the main world religions  you'll find within them some teaching concerning compassion. So in Judaism  we have  from our Torah  that you should love your neighbor as you love yourself. And within Jewish teachings  the rabbinic teachings  we have Hillel  who taught that you shouldn't do to others what you don't like being done to yourself. And all the main religions have similar teachings. And again  within Judaism  we have a teaching about God  who is called the compassionate one  Ha rachaman. After all  how could the world exist without God being compassionate  And we  as taught within the Torah that we are made in the image of God  so we too have to be compassionate. But what does it mean  How does it impact on our everyday life  Sometimes  of course  being compassionate can produce feelings within us that are very difficult to control. I know there are many times when I've gone and conducted a funeral  or when I have been sitting with the bereaved  or with people who are dying  and I am overwhelmed by the sadness  by the difficulty  the challenge that is there for the family  for the person. And I'm touched  so that tears come to my eyes. And yet  if I just allowed myself to be overwhelmed by these feelings  I wouldn't be doing my job    because I have to actually be there for them and make sure that rituals happen  that practicalities are seen to. And yet  on the other hand  if I didn't feel this compassion  then I feel that it would be time for me to hang up my robe and give up being a rabbi. And these same feelings are there for all of us as we face the world. Who cannot be touched by compassion when we see the terrible horrors of the results of war  or famine  or earthquakes  or tsunamis  I know some people who say  Well  you know there's just so much out there    I can't do anything  I'm not going to even begin to try.  And there are some charity workers who call this compassion fatigue. There are others who feel they can't confront compassion anymore  and so they turn off the television and don't watch. In Judaism  though  we tend to always say  there has to be a middle way. You have to  of course  be aware of the needs of others  but you have to be aware in such a way that you can carry on with your life and be of help to people. So part of compassion has to be an understanding of what makes people tick. And  of course  you can't do that unless you understand yourself a bit more. And there's a lovely rabbinic interpretation of the beginnings of creation  which says that when God created the world  God thought that it would be best to create the world only with the divine attribute of justice. Because  after all  God is just. Therefore  there should be justice throughout the world. And then God looked to the future and realized  if the world was created just with justice  the world couldn't exist. So  God thought   Nope  I'm going to create the world just with compassion.  And then God looked to the future and realized that  in fact  if the world were just filled with compassion  there would be anarchy and chaos. There had to be limits to all things. The rabbis describe this as being like a king who has a beautiful  fragile glass bowl. If you put too much cold water in  it will shatter. If you put boiling water in  it will shatter. What do you have to do  Put in a mixture of the two. And so God put both of these possibilities into the world. There is something more though that has to be there. And that is the translation of the feelings that we may have about compassion into the wider world  into action. So  like Snoopy  we can't just lie there and think great thoughts about our neighbors. We actually have to do something about it. And so there is also  within Judaism  this notion of love and kindness that becomes very important   chesed.  All these three things  then  have to be melded together. The idea of justice  which gives boundaries to our lives and gives us a feeling of what's right about life  what's right about living  what should we be doing  social justice. There has to be a willingness to do good deeds  but not  of course  at the expense of our own sanity. You know  there's no way that you can do anything for anyone if you overdo things. And balancing them all in the middle is this notion of compassion  which has to be there  if you like  at our very roots. This idea of compassion comes to us because we're made in the image of God  who is ultimately the compassionate one. What does this compassion entail  It entails understanding the pain of the other. But even more than that  it means understanding one's connection to the whole of creation  understanding that one is part of that creation  that there is a unity that underlies all that we see  all that we hear  all that we feel. I call that unity God. And that unity is something that connects all of creation. And  of course  in the modern world  with the environmental movement  we're becoming even more aware of the connectivity of things  that something I do here actually does matter in Africa  that if I use too much of my carbon allowance  it seems to be that we are causing a great lack of rain in central and eastern Africa. So there is a connectivity  and I have to understand that    as part of the creation  as part of me being made in the image of God. And I have to understand that my needs sometimes have to be sublimated to other needs. This     minutes  business  I find quite fascinating. Because in Judaism  the number     in Hebrew letters  stands for life    the word  life.  So  in a sense  the    minutes is challenging me to say   In life  this is what's important in terms of compassion.  But  something else as well  actually     minutes is important. Because at Passover  when we have to eat unleavened bread  the rabbis say  what is the difference between dough that is made into bread  and dough that is made into unleavened bread  or  matzah   And they say  It's    minutes.  Because that's how long they say it takes for this dough to become leaven. What does it mean   dough becomes leaven   It means it gets filled with hot air. What's matzah  What's unleavened bread  You don't get it. Symbolically  what the rabbis say is that at Passover  what we have to do is try to get rid of our hot air    our pride  our feeling that we are the most important people in the whole entire world  and that everything should revolve round us. So we try and get rid of those  and so doing  try to get rid of the habits  the emotions  the ideas that enslave us  that make our eyes closed  give us tunnel vision so we don't see the needs of others    and free ourselves and free ourselves from that. And that too is a basis for having compassion  for understanding our place in the world. Now there is  in Judaism  a gorgeous story of a rich man who sat in synagogue one day. And  as many people do  he was dozing off during the sermon. And as he was dozing off  they were reading from the book of Leviticus in the Torah. And they were saying that in the ancient times in the temple in Jerusalem  the priests used to have bread  which they used to place into a special table in the temple in Jerusalem. The man was asleep  but he heard the words bread  temple  God  and he woke up. He said   God wants bread. That's it. God wants bread. I know what God wants.  And he rushed home. And after the Sabbath  he made    loaves of bread  took them to the synagogue  went into the synagogue  opened the ark and said   God  I don't know why you want this bread  but here you are.  And he put it in the ark with the scrolls of the Torah. Then he went home. The cleaner came into the synagogue.  Oh God  I'm in such trouble. I've got children to feed. My wife's ill. I've got no money. What can I do   He goes into the synagogue.  God  will you please help me  Ah  what a wonderful smell.  He goes to the ark. He opens the ark.  There's bread  God  you've answered my plea. You've answered my question.  Takes the bread and goes home. Meanwhile  the rich man thinks to himself   I'm an idiot. God wants bread  God  the one who rules the entire universe  wants my bread   He rushes to the synagogue.  I'll get it out of the ark before anybody finds it.  He goes in there  and it's not there. And he says   God  you really did want it. You wanted my bread. Next week  with raisins.  This went on for years. Every week  the man would bring bread with raisins  with all sorts of good things  put it into the ark. Every week  the cleaner would come.  God you've answered my plea again.  Take the bread. Take it home. Went on until a new rabbi came. Rabbis always spoil things. The rabbi came in and saw what was going on. And he called the two of them to his office. And he said  you know   This is what's happening.  And the rich man    oh  dear    crestfallen.  You mean God didn't want my bread   And the poor man said   And you mean God didn't answer my pleas   And the rabbi said   You've misunderstood me. You've misunderstood totally   he said.  Of course  what you are doing   he said to the rich man   is answering God's plea that we should be compassionate. And God   he said to the poor man   is answering your plea that people should be compassionate and give.  He looked at the rich man. He held the rich man's hands and said   Don't you understand   He said   These are the hands of God.  So that is the way I feel  that I can only try to approach this notion of being compassionate  of understanding that there is a connectivity  that there is a unity in this world  that I want to try and serve that unity  and that I can try and do that by understanding  I hope  trying to understand something of the pain of others  but understanding that there are limits  that people have to bear responsibility for some of the problems that come upon them  and that I have to understand that there are limits to my energy  to the giving I can give. I have to reevaluate them  try and separate out the material things and my emotions that may be enslaving me  so that I can see the world clearly. And then I have to try to see in what ways I can make these the hands of God. And so try to bring compassion to life in this world. A human child is born  and for quite a long time is a consumer. It cannot be consciously a contributor. It is helpless. It doesn't know how to survive  even though it is endowed with an instinct to survive. It needs the help of mother  or a foster mother  to survive. It can't afford to doubt the person who tends the child. It has to totally surrender  as one surrenders to an anesthesiologist. It has to totally surrender. That implies a lot of trust. That implies the trusted person won't violate the trust. As the child grows  it begins to discover that the person trusted is violating the trust. It doesn't know even the word  violation.  Therefore  it has to blame itself  a wordless blame  which is more difficult to really resolve    the wordless self blame. As the child grows to become an adult  so far  it has been a consumer  but the growth of a human being lies in his or her capacity to contribute  to be a contributor. One cannot contribute unless one feels secure  one feels big  one feels  I have enough. To be compassionate is not a joke. It's not that simple. One has to discover a certain bigness in oneself. That bigness should be centered on oneself  not in terms of money  not in terms of power you wield  not in terms of any status that you can command in the society  but it should be centered on oneself. The self  you are self aware. On that self  it should be centered    a bigness  a wholeness. Otherwise  compassion is just a word and a dream. You can be compassionate occasionally  more moved by empathy than by compassion. Thank God we are empathetic. When somebody's in pain  we pick up the pain. In a Wimbledon final match  these two guys fight it out. Each one has got two games. It can be anybody's game. What they have sweated so far has no meaning. One person wins. The tennis etiquette is  both the players have to come to the net and shake hands. The winner boxes the air and kisses the ground  throws his shirt as though somebody is waiting for it. And this guy has to come to the net. When he comes to the net  you see  his whole face changes. It looks as though he's wishing that he didn't win. Why  Empathy. That's human heart. No human heart is denied of that empathy. No religion can demolish that by indoctrination. No culture  no nation and nationalism    nothing can touch it because it is empathy. And that capacity to empathize is the window through which you reach out to people  you do something that makes a difference in somebody's life    even words  even time. Compassion is not defined in one form. There's no Indian compassion. There's no American compassion. It transcends nation  the gender  the age. Why  Because it is there in everybody. It's experienced by people occasionally. Then this occasional compassion  we are not talking about    it will never remain occasional. By mandate  you cannot make a person compassionate. You can't say   Please love me.  Love is something you discover. It's not an action  but in the English language  it is also an action. I will come to it later. So one has got to discover a certain wholeness. I am going to cite the possibility of being whole  which is within our experience  everybody's experience. In spite of a very tragic life  one is happy in moments which are very few and far between. And the one who is happy  even for a slapstick joke  accepts himself and also the scheme of things in which one finds oneself. That means the whole universe  known things and unknown things. All of them are totally accepted because you discover your wholeness in yourself. The subject     me     and the object    the scheme of things    fuse into oneness  an experience nobody can say   I am denied of   an experience common to all and sundry. That experience confirms that  in spite of all your limitations    all your wants  desires  unfulfilled  and the credit cards and layoffs and  finally  baldness    you can be happy. But the extension of the logic is that you don't need to fulfill your desire to be happy. You are the very happiness  the wholeness that you want to be. There's no choice in this  that only confirms the reality that the wholeness cannot be different from you  cannot be minus you. It has got to be you. You cannot be a part of wholeness and still be whole. Your moment of happiness reveals that reality  that realization  that recognition   Maybe I am the whole. Maybe the swami is right. Maybe the swami is right.  You start your new life. Then everything becomes meaningful. I have no more reason to blame myself. If one has to blame oneself  one has a million reasons plus many. But if I say  in spite of my body being limited    if it is black it is not white  if it is white it is not black  body is limited any which way you look at it. Limited. Your knowledge is limited  health is limited  and power is therefore limited  and the cheerfulness is going to be limited. Compassion is going to be limited. Everything is going to be limitless. You cannot command compassion unless you become limitless  and nobody can become limitless  either you are or you are not. Period. And there is no way of your being not limitless too. Your own experience reveals  in spite of all limitations  you are the whole. And the wholeness is the reality of you when you relate to the world. It is love first. When you relate to the world  the dynamic manifestation of the wholeness is  what we say  love. And itself becomes compassion if the object that you relate to evokes that emotion. Then that again transforms into giving  into sharing. You express yourself because you have compassion. To discover compassion  you need to be compassionate. To discover the capacity to give and share  you need to be giving and sharing. There is no shortcut  it is like swimming by swimming. You learn swimming by swimming. You cannot learn swimming on a foam mattress and enter into water. You learn swimming by swimming. You learn cycling by cycling. You learn cooking by cooking  having some sympathetic people around you to eat what you cook. And  therefore  what I say  you have to fake it and make it. You need to. My predecessor meant that. You have to act it out. You have to act compassionately. There is no verb for compassion  but you have an adverb for compassion. That's interesting to me. You act compassionately. But then  how to act compassionately if you don't have compassion  That is where you fake. You fake it and make it. This is the mantra of the United States of America. You fake it and make it. You act compassionately as though you have compassion  grind your teeth  take all the support system. If you know how to pray  pray. Ask for compassion. Let me act compassionately. Do it. You'll discover compassion and also slowly a relative compassion  and slowly  perhaps if you get the right teaching  you'll discover compassion is a dynamic manifestation of the reality of yourself  which is oneness  wholeness  and that's what you are. With these words  thank you very much. Compassion  what does it look like  Come with me to     South Bloodworth Street in Raleigh  North Carolina  where I grew up. If you come in you will see us  evening time  at table    set for ten but not always all seats filled    at the point when dinner is ready to be served. Since mom had eight kids  sometimes she said she couldn't tell who was who and where they were. Before we could eat  she would ask   Are all the children in   And if someone happened to be missing  we would have to  we say   Fix a plate  for that person  put it in the oven  then we could say grace  and we could eat. Also  while we were at the table  there was a ritual in our family  when something significant had happened for any one of us    whether mom had just been elected as the president of the PTA  or whether dad had gotten an assignment at the college of our denomination  or whether someone had won the jabberwocky contest for talent    the ritual at the family was  once the announcement is made  we must take five  ten minutes to do what we call  make over  that person    that is  to make a fuss over the one who had been honored in some way. For when one is honored  all are honored. Also  we had to make a report on our extended  visited  members  that is  extended members of the family  sick and elderly  shut in. My task was  at least once a week  to visit Mother Lassiter who lived on East Street  Mother Williamson who lived on Bledsoe Avenue  and Mother Lathers who lived on Oberlin Road. Why  Because they were old and infirm  and we needed to go by to see if they needed anything. For mom said   To be family  is to care and share and to look out for one another. They are our family.  And  of course  sometimes there was a bonus for going. They would offer sweets or money. Mom says   If they ask you what it costs to either go shopping for them  you must always say  'Nothing.' And if they insist  say  'Whatever you mind to give me.'  This was the nature of being at that table. In fact  she indicated that if we would do that  not only would we have the joy of receiving the gratitude from the members of the extended family  but she said   Even God will smile  and when God smiles  there is peace  and justice  and joy.  So  at the table at      I learned something about compassion. Of course  it was a minister's family  so we had to add God into it. And so  I came to think that mama eternal  mama eternal  is always wondering  Are all the children in  And if we had been faithful in caring and sharing  we had the sense that justice and peace would have a chance in the world. Now  it was not always wonderful at that table. Let me explain a point at which we did not rise to the occasion. It was Christmas  and at our family  oh  what a morning. Christmas morning  where we open up our gifts  where we have special prayers  and where we get to the old upright piano and we would sing carols. It was a very intimate moment. In fact  you could come down to the tree to get your gifts and get ready to sing  and then get ready for breakfast without even taking a bath or getting dressed  except that daddy messed it up. There was a member of his staff who did not have any place on that particular Christmas to celebrate. And daddy brought Elder Revels to the Christmas family celebration. We thought he must be out of his mind. This is our time. This is intimate time. This is when we can just be who we are  and now we have this stuffy brother with his shirt and tie on  while we are still in our PJs. Why would daddy bring Elder Revels  Any other time  but not to the Christmas celebration. And mom overheard us and said   Well  you know what  If you really understand the nature of this celebration  it is that this is a time where you extend the circle of love. That's what the celebration is all about. It's time to make space  to share the enjoyment of life in a beloved community.  So  we sucked up. But growing up at      compassion was not a word to be debated  it was a sensibility to how we are together. We are sisters and brothers united together. And  like Chief Seattle said   We did not spin the web of life. We're all strands in it. And whatever we do to the web  we do to ourselves.  Now that's compassion. So  let me tell you  I kind of look at the world this way. I see pictures  and something says   Now  that's compassion.  A harvested field of grain  with some grain in the corners  reminding me of the Hebrew tradition that you may indeed harvest  but you must always leave some on the edges  just in case there's someone who has not had the share necessary for good nurture. Talk about a picture of compassion. I see    always  it stirs my heart    a picture of Dr. Martin Luther King  Jr. walking arm in arm with Andy Young and Rabbi Heschel and maybe Thich Nhat Hanh and some of the other saints assembled  walking across the bridge and going into Selma. Just a photograph. Arm in arm for struggle. Suffering together in a common hope that we can be brothers and sisters without the accidents of our birth or our ethnicity robbing us of a sense of unity of being. So  there's another picture. Here  this one. I really do like this picture. When Dr. Martin Luther King  Jr. was assassinated  that day  everybody in my community was upset. You heard about riots all across the land. Bobby Kennedy was scheduled to bring an inner city message in Indianapolis. This is the picture. They said   It's going to be too volatile for you to go.  He insisted   I must go.  So  sitting on a flatbed truck  the elders of the community are there  and Bobby stands up and says to the people   I have bad news for you. Some of you may not have heard that Dr. King has been assassinated. I know that you are angry  and I know that you would almost wish to have the opportunity to enter now into activities of revenge. But   he said   what I really want you to know is that I know how you feel. Because I had someone dear to me snatched away. I know how you feel.  And he said   I hope that you will have the strength to do what I did. I allowed my anger  my bitterness  my grief to simmer a while  and then I made up my mind that I was going to make a different world  and we can do that together.  That's a picture. Compassion  I think I see it. I saw it when the Dalai Lama came to the Riverside Church while I was a pastor  and he invited representatives of faith traditions from all around the world. He asked them to give a message  and they each read in their own language a central affirmation  and that was some version of the golden rule   As you would that others would do unto you  do also unto them.  Twelve in their ecclesiastical or cultural or tribal attire affirming one message. We are so connected that we must treat each other as if an action toward you is an action toward myself. One more picture while I'm stinking and thinking about the Riverside Church      . Last night at Chagrin Fall  a newspaperman and a television guy said   That evening  when a service was held at the Riverside Church  we carried it on our station in this city. It was   he said   one of the most powerful moments of life together. We were all suffering. But you invited representatives of all of the traditions to come  and you invited them. 'Find out what it is in your tradition that tells us what to do when we have been humiliated  when we have been despised and rejected.' And they all spoke out of their own traditions  a word about the healing power of solidarity  one with the other.  I developed a sense of compassion sort of as second nature  but I became a preacher. Now  as a preacher  I got a job. I got to preach the stuff  but I got to do it too. Or  as Father Divine in Harlem used to say to folks   Some people preach the Gospel. I have to tangibilitate the Gospel.  So  the real issue is  How do you tangibilitate compassion  How do you make it real  My faith has constantly lifted up the ideal  and challenged me when I fell beneath it. In my tradition  there is a gift that we have made to other traditions    to everybody around the world who knows the story of the  Good Samaritan.  Many people think of it primarily in terms of charity  random acts of kindness. But for those who really study that text a little more thoroughly  you will discover that a question has been raised that leads to this parable. The question was   What is the greatest commandment   And  according to Jesus  the word comes forth   You must love yourself  you must love the Lord your God with all your heart  mind and soul  and your neighbor as yourself.  And then the person asked   Well  what do you mean  'neighbor '  And he answered it by telling the story of the man who fell among thieves  and how religious authorities went the other way  and how their supporters in the congregation went the other way  but an unsuspecting  despised person came along  saw the man in need  provided oil and wine for his wounds  put him on his own transportation  and took him to the inn and asked the innkeeper   Take care of him.  And he said   Here  this is the initial investment  but if needs continue  make sure that you provide them. And whatever else is needed  I will provide it and pay for it when I return.  This always seemed to me to be a deepening of the sense of what it means to be a Good Samaritan. A Good Samaritan is not simply one whose heart is touched in an immediate act of care and charity  but one who provides a system of sustained care    I like that  'a system of sustained care '    in the inn  take care. I think maybe it's one time when the Bible talks about a healthcare system and a commitment to do whatever is necessary    that all God's children would have their needs cared for  so that we could answer when mommy eternal asks   In regards to health  are all the children in   And we could say yes. Oh  what a joy it has been to be a person seeking to tangibilitate compassion. I recall that my work as a pastor has always involved caring for their spiritual needs  being concerned for housing  for healthcare  for the prisoners  for the infirm  for children    even the foster care children for whom no one can even keep a record where they started off  where they are going. To be a pastor is to care for these individual needs. But now  to be a Good Samaritan    and I always say  and to be a good American    for me  is not simply to congratulate myself for the individual acts of care. Compassion takes on a corporate dynamic. I believe that whatever we did around that table at Bloodworth Street must be done around tables and rituals of faith until we become that family  that family together that understands the nature of our unity. We are one people together. So  let me explain to you what I mean when I think about compassion  and why I think it is so important that right at this point in history. We would decide to establish this charter of compassion. The reason it's important is because this is a very special time in history. It is the time that  biblically  we would speak of as the day  or the year  of God's favor. This is a season of grace. Unusual things are beginning to happen. Please pardon me  as a black man  for celebrating that the election of Obama was an unusual sign of the fact that it is a year of favor. And yet  there is so much more that needs to be done. We need to bring health and food and education and respect for all God's citizens  all God's children  remembering mama eternal. Now  let me close my comments by telling you that whenever I feel something very deeply  it usually takes the form of verse. And so I want to close with a little song. I close with this song    it's a children's song    because we are all children at the table of mama eternal. And if mama eternal has taught us correctly  this song will make sense  not only to those of us who are a part of this gathering  but to all who sign the charter for compassion. And this is why we do it. The song says     I made heaven so happy today      Receiving God's love and giving it away     When I looked up  heaven smiled at me     Now  I'm so happy. Can't you see      I'm happy. Look at me. I'm happy. Can't you see      Sharing makes me happy  makes heaven happy too     I'm happy. Look at me. I'm happy. Can't you see      Let me share my happy loving smile with you.   That's compassion.  Applause  I'm speaking about compassion from an Islamic point of view  and perhaps my faith is not very well thought of as being one that is grounded in compassion. The truth of the matter is otherwise. Our holy book  the Koran  consists of     chapters  and each chapter begins with what we call the basmala  the saying of  In the name of God  the all compassionate  the all merciful   or  as Sir Richard Burton    not the Richard Burton who was married to Elizabeth Taylor  but the Sir Richard Burton who lived a century before that and who was a worldwide traveler and translator of many works of literature    translates it.  In the name of God  the compassionating  the compassionate.  And in a saying of the Koran  which to Muslims is God speaking to humanity  God says to his prophet Muhammad    whom we believe to be the last of a series of prophets  beginning with Adam  including Noah  including Moses  including Abraham  including Jesus Christ  and ending with Muhammad    that   We have not sent you  O Muhammad  except as a 'rahmah ' except as a source of compassion to humanity.  For us human beings  and certainly for us as Muslims  whose mission  and whose purpose in following the path of the prophet is to make ourselves as much like the prophet. And the prophet  in one of his sayings  said   Adorn yourselves with the attributes of God.  And because God Himself said that the primary attribute of his is compassion    in fact  the Koran says that  God decreed upon himself compassion   or   reigned himself in by compassion     therefore  our objective and our mission must be to be sources of compassion  activators of compassion  actors of compassion and speakers of compassion and doers of compassion. That is all well and good  but where do we go wrong  and what is the source of the lack of compassion in the world  For the answer to this  we turn to our spiritual path. In every religious tradition  there is the outer path and the inner path  or the exoteric path and the esoteric path. The esoteric path of Islam is more popularly known as Sufism  or  tasawwuf  in Arabic. And these doctors or these masters  these spiritual masters of the Sufi tradition  refer to teachings and examples of our prophet that teach us where the source of our problems lies. In one of the battles that the prophet waged  he told his followers   We are returning from the lesser war to the greater war  to the greater battle.  And they said   Messenger of God  we are battle weary. How can we go to a greater battle   He said   That is the battle of the self  the battle of the ego.  The sources of human problems have to do with egotism   I.  The famous Sufi master Rumi  who is very well known to most of you  has a story in which he talks of a man who goes to the house of a friend  and he knocks on the door  and a voice answers   Who's there    It's me   or  more grammatically correctly   It is I   as we might say in English. The voice says   Go away.  After many years of training  of disciplining  of search and struggle  he comes back. With much greater humility  he knocks again on the door. The voice asks   Who is there   He said   It is you  O heartbreaker.  The door swings open  and the voice says   Come in  for there is no room in this house for two I's      two capital I's  not these eyes     for two egos.  And Rumi's stories are metaphors for the spiritual path. In the presence of God  there is no room for more than one  I   and that is the  I  of divinity. In a teaching    called a  hadith qudsi  in our tradition    God says that   My servant   or  My creature  my human creature  does not approach me by anything that is dearer to me than what I have asked them to do.  And those of you who are employers know exactly what I mean. You want your employees to do what you ask them to do  and if they've done that  then they can do extra. But don't ignore what you've asked them to do.  And   God says   my servant continues to get nearer to me  by doing more of what I've asked them to do     extra credit  we might call it     until I love him or love her. And when I love my servant   God says   I become the eyes by which he or she sees  the ears by which he or she listens  the hand by which he or she grasps  and the foot by which he or she walks  and the heart by which he or she understands.  It is this merging of our self with divinity that is the lesson and purpose of our spiritual path and all of our faith traditions. Muslims regard Jesus as the master of Sufism  the greatest prophet and messenger who came to emphasize the spiritual path. When he says   I am the spirit  and I am the way   and when the prophet Muhammad said   Whoever has seen me has seen God   it is because they became so much an instrument of God  they became part of God's team    so that God's will was manifest through them  and they were not acting from their own selves and their own egos. Compassion on earth is given  it is in us. All we have to do is to get our egos out of the way  get our egotism out of the way. I'm sure  probably all of you here  or certainly the very vast majority of you  have had what you might call a spiritual experience  a moment in your lives when  for a few seconds  a minute perhaps  the boundaries of your ego dissolved. And at that minute  you felt at one with the universe    one with that jug of water  one with every human being  one with the Creator    and you felt you were in the presence of power  of awe  of the deepest love  the deepest sense of compassion and mercy that you have ever experienced in your lives. That is a moment which is a gift of God to us    a gift when  for a moment  he lifts that boundary which makes us insist on  I  I  I  me  me  me   and instead  like the person in Rumi's story  we say   Oh  this is all you. This is all you. And this is all us. And us  and I  and us are all part of you. O  Creator  O  the Objective  The source of our being and the end of our journey  you are also the breaker of our hearts. You are the one whom we should all be towards  for whose purpose we live  and for whose purpose we shall die  and for whose purpose we shall be resurrected again to account to God to what extent we have been compassionate beings.  Our message today  and our purpose today  and those of you who are here today  and the purpose of this charter of compassion  is to remind. For the Koran always urges us to remember  to remind each other  because the knowledge of truth is within every human being. We know it all. We have access to it all. Jung may have called it  the subconscious.  Through our subconscious  in your dreams    the Koran calls our state of sleep  the lesser death    the temporary death     in our state of sleep we have dreams  we have visions  we travel even outside of our bodies  for many of us  and we see wonderful things. We travel beyond the limitations of space as we know it  and beyond the limitations of time as we know it. But all this is for us to glorify the name of the creator whose primary name is the compassionating  the compassionate. God  Bokh  whatever name you want to call him with  Allah  Ram  Om  whatever the name might be through which you name or access the presence of divinity  it is the locus of absolute being  absolute love and mercy and compassion  and absolute knowledge and wisdom  what Hindus call  satchidananda.  The language differs  but the objective is the same. Rumi has another story about three men  a Turk  an Arab and    and I forget the third person  but for my sake  it could be a Malay. One is asking for angur    one is  say  an Englishman    one is asking for eneb  and one is asking for grapes. And they have a fight and an argument because     I want grapes.   I want eneb.  I want angur.     not knowing that the word that they're using refers to the same reality in different languages. There's only one absolute reality by definition  one absolute being by definition  because absolute is  by definition  single  and absolute and singular. There's this absolute concentration of being  the absolute concentration of consciousness  awareness  an absolute locus of compassion and love that defines the primary attributes of divinity. And these should also be the primary attributes of what it means to be human. For what defines humanity  perhaps biologically  is our physiology  but God defines humanity by our spirituality  by our nature. And the Koran says  He speaks to the angels and says   When I have finished the formation of Adam from clay  and breathed into him of my spirit  then  fall in prostration to him.  The angels prostrate  not before the human body  but before the human soul. Why  Because the soul  the human soul  embodies a piece of the divine breath  a piece of the divine soul. This is also expressed in biblical vocabulary when we are taught that we were created in the divine image. What is the imagery of God  The imagery of God is absolute being  absolute awareness and knowledge and wisdom and absolute compassion and love. And therefore  for us to be human    in the greatest sense of what it means to be human  in the most joyful sense of what it means to be human    means that we too have to be proper stewards of the breath of divinity within us  and seek to perfect within ourselves the attribute of being  of being alive  of beingness  the attribute of wisdom  of consciousness  of awareness  and the attribute of being compassionate and loving beings. This is what I understand from my faith tradition  and this is what I understand from my studies of other faith traditions  and this is the common platform on which we must all stand  and when we stand on this platform as such  I am convinced that we can make a wonderful world. And I believe  personally  that we're on the verge and that  with the presence and help of people like you here  we can bring about the prophecy of Isaiah. For he foretold of a period when people shall transform their swords into plowshares and will not learn war or make war anymore. We have reached a stage in human history that we have no option  we must  we must lower our egos  control our egos    whether it is individual ego  personal ego  family ego  national ego    and let all be for the glorification of the one. Thank you  and God bless you. I want to open by quoting Einstein's wonderful statement  just so people will feel at ease that the great scientist of the   th century also agrees with us  and also calls us to this action. He said   A human being is a part of the whole  called by us  the 'universe '    a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself  his thoughts and feelings  as something separated from the rest  a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us  restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion  to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.  This insight of Einstein's is uncannily close to that of Buddhist psychology  wherein compassion     karuna   it is called    is defined as   the sensitivity to another's suffering and the corresponding will to free the other from that suffering.  It pairs closely with love  which is the will for the other to be happy  which requires  of course  that one feels some happiness oneself and wishes to share it. This is perfect in that it clearly opposes self centeredness and selfishness to compassion  the concern for others  and  further  it indicates that those caught in the cycle of self concern suffer helplessly  while the compassionate are more free and  implicitly  more happy. The Dalai Lama often states that compassion is his best friend. It helps him when he is overwhelmed with grief and despair. Compassion helps him turn away from the feeling of his suffering as the most absolute  most terrible suffering anyone has ever had and broadens his awareness of the sufferings of others  even of the perpetrators of his misery and the whole mass of beings. In fact  suffering is so huge and enormous  his own becomes less and less monumental. And he begins to move beyond his self concern into the broader concern for others. And this immediately cheers him up  as his courage is stimulated to rise to the occasion. Thus  he uses his own suffering as a doorway to widening his circle of compassion. He is a very good colleague of Einstein's  we must say. Now  I want to tell a story  which is a very famous story in the Indian and Buddhist tradition  of the great Saint Asanga who was a contemporary of Augustine in the West and was sort of like the Buddhist Augustine. And Asanga lived     years after the Buddha's time. And he was discontented with the state of people's practice of the Buddhist religion in India at that time. And so he said   I'm sick of all this. Nobody's really living the doctrine. They're talking about love and compassion and wisdom and enlightenment  but they are acting selfish and pathetic. So  Buddha's teaching has lost its momentum. I know the next Buddha will come a few thousand years from now  but exists currently in a certain heaven     that's Maitreya     so  I'm going to go on a retreat and I'm going to meditate and pray until the Buddha Maitreya reveals himself to me  and gives me a teaching or something to revive the practice of compassion in the world today.  So he went on this retreat. And he meditated for three years and he did not see the future Buddha Maitreya. And he left in disgust. And as he was leaving  he saw a man    a funny little man sitting sort of part way down the mountain. And he had a lump of iron. And he was rubbing it with a cloth. And he became interested in that. He said   Well what are you doing   And the man said   I'm making a needle.  And he said   That's ridiculous. You can't make a needle by rubbing a lump of iron with a cloth.  And the man said   Really   And he showed him a dish full of needles. So he said   Okay  I get the point.  He went back to his cave. He meditated again. Another three years  no vision. He leaves again. This time  he comes down. And as he's leaving  he sees a bird making a nest on a cliff ledge. And where it's landing to bring the twigs to the cliff  its feathers brushes the rock    and it had cut the rock six to eight inches in. There was a cleft in the rock by the brushing of the feathers of generations of the birds. So he said   All right. I get the point.  He went back. Another three years. Again  no vision of Maitreya after nine years. And he again leaves  and this time  water dripping  making a giant bowl in the rock where it drips in a stream. And so  again  he goes back. And after    years there is still no vision. And he's freaked out. And he won't even look left or right to see any encouraging vision. And he comes to the town. He's a broken person. And there  in the town  he's approached by a dog who comes like this    one of these terrible dogs you can see in some poor countries  even in America  I think  in some areas    and he's looking just terrible. And he becomes interested in this dog because it's so pathetic  and it's trying to attract his attention. And he sits down looking at the dog. And the dog's whole hindquarters are a complete open sore. Some of it is like gangrenous  and there are maggots in the flesh. And it's terrible. He thinks   What can I do to fix up this dog  Well  at least I can clean this wound and wash it.  So  he takes it to some water. He's about to clean  but then his awareness focuses on the maggots. And he sees the maggots  and the maggots are kind of looking a little cute. And they're maggoting happily in the dog's hindquarters there.  Well  if I clean the dog  I'll kill the maggots. So how can that be  That's it. I'm a useless person and there's no Buddha  no Maitreya  and everything is all hopeless. And now I'm going to kill the maggots   So  he had a brilliant idea. And he took a shard of something  and cut a piece of flesh from his thigh  and he placed it on ground. He was not really thinking too carefully about the ASPCA. He was just immediately caught with the situation. So he thought   I will take the maggots and put them on this piece of flesh  then clean the dog's wounds  and then I'll figure out what to do with the maggots.  So he starts to do that. He can't grab the maggots. Apparently they wriggle around. They're kind of hard to grab  these maggots. So he says   Well  I'll put my tongue on the dog's flesh. And then the maggots will jump on my warmer tongue     the dog is kind of used up     and then I'll spit them one by one down on the thing.  So he goes down  and he's sticking his tongue out like this. And he had to close his eyes  it's so disgusting  and the smell and everything. And then  suddenly  there's a pfft  a noise like that. He jumps back and there  of course  is the future Buddha Maitreya in a beautiful vision    rainbow lights  golden  jeweled  a plasma body  an exquisite mystic vision    that he sees. And he says   Oh.  He bows. But  being human  he's immediately thinking of his next complaint. So as he comes up from his first bow he says   My Lord  I'm so happy to see you  but where have you been for    years  What is this   And Maitreya says   I was with you. Who do you think was making needles and making nests and dripping on rocks for you  mister dense    Looking for the Buddha in person   he said. And he said   You didn't have  until this moment  real compassion. And  until you have real compassion  you cannot recognize love.   Maitreya  means love   the loving one   in Sanskrit. And so he looked very dubious  Asanga did. And he said   If you don't believe me  just take me with you.  And so he took the Maitreya    it shrunk into a globe  a ball    took him on his shoulder. And he ran into town in the marketplace  and he said   Rejoice  Rejoice  The future Buddha has come ahead of all predictions. Here he is.  And then pretty soon they started throwing rocks and stones at him    it wasn't Chautauqua  it was some other town    because they saw a demented looking  scrawny looking yogi man  like some kind of hippie  with a bleeding leg and a rotten dog on his shoulder  shouting that the future Buddha had come. So  naturally  they chased him out of town. But on the edge of town  one elderly lady  a charwoman in the charnel ground  saw a jeweled foot on a jeweled lotus on his shoulder and then the dog  but she saw the jewel foot of the Maitreya  and she offered a flower. So that encouraged him  and he went with Maitreya. Maitreya then took him to a certain heaven  which is the typical way a Buddhist myth unfolds. And Maitreya then kept him in heaven for five years  dictating to him five complicated tomes of the methodology of how you cultivate compassion. And then I thought I would share with you what that method is  or one of them. A famous one  it's called the  Sevenfold Causal Method of Developing Compassion.  And it begins first by one meditating and visualizing that all beings are with one    even animals too  but everyone is in human form. The animals are in one of their human lives. The humans are human. And then  among them  you think of your friends and loved ones  the circle at the table. And you think of your enemies  and you think of the neutral ones. And then you try to say   Well  the loved ones I love. But  you know  after all  they're nice to me. I had fights with them. Sometimes they were unfriendly. I got mad. Brothers can fight. Parents and children can fight. So  in a way  I like them so much because they're nice to me. While the neutral ones I don't know. They could all be just fine. And then the enemies I don't like because they're mean to me. But they are nice to somebody. I could be them.  And then the Buddhists  of course  think that  because we've all had infinite previous lives  we've all been each other's relatives  actually. Therefore all of you  in the Buddhist view  in some previous life  although you don't remember it and neither do I  have been my mother    for which I do apologize for the trouble I caused you. And also  actually  I've been your mother. I've been female  and I've been every single one of yours' mother in a previous life  the way the Buddhists reflect. So  my mother in this life is really great. But all of you in a way are part of the eternal mother. You gave me that expression   the eternal mama   you said. That's wonderful. So  that's the way the Buddhists do it. A theist Christian can think that all beings  even my enemies  are God's children. So  in that sense  we're related. So  they first create this foundation of equality. So  we sort of reduce a little of the clinging to the ones we love    just in the meditation    and we open our mind to those we don't know. And we definitely reduce the hostility and the  I don't want to be compassionate to them  to the ones we think of as the bad guys  the ones we hate and we don't like. And we don't hate anyone  therefore. So we equalize. That's very important. And then the next thing we do is what is called  mother recognition.  And that is  we think of every being as familiar  as family. We expand. We take the feeling about remembering a mama  and we defuse that to all beings in this meditation. And we see the mother in every being. We see that look that the mother has on her face  looking at this child that is a miracle that she has produced from her own body  being a mammal  where she has true compassion  truly is the other  and identifies completely. Often the life of that other will be more important to her than her own life. And that's why it's the most powerful form of altruism. The mother is the model of all altruism for human beings  in spiritual traditions. And so  we reflect until we can sort of see that motherly expression in all beings. People laugh at me because  you know  I used to say that I used to meditate on mama Cheney as my mom  when  of course  I was annoyed with him about all of his evil doings in Iraq. I used to meditate on George Bush. He's quite a cute mom in a female form. He has his little ears and he smiles and he rocks you in his arms. And you think of him as nursing you. And then Saddam Hussein's serious mustache is a problem  but you think of him as a mom. And this is the way you do it. You take any being who looks weird to you  and you see how they could be familiar to you. And you do that for a while  until you really feel that. You can feel the familiarity of all beings. Nobody seems alien. They're not  other.  You reduce the feeling of otherness about beings. Then you move from there to remembering the kindness of mothers in general  if you can remember the kindness of your own mother  if you can remember the kindness of your spouse  or  if you are a mother yourself  how you were with your children. And you begin to get very sentimental  you cultivate sentimentality intensely. You will even weep  perhaps  with gratitude and kindness. And then you connect that with your feeling that everyone has that motherly possibility. Every being  even the most mean looking ones  can be motherly. And then  third  you step from there to what is called  a feeling of gratitude.  You want to repay that kindness that all beings have shown to you. And then the fourth step  you go to what is called  lovely love.  In each one of these you can take some weeks  or months  or days depending on how you do it  or you can do them in a run  this meditation. And then you think of how lovely beings are when they are happy  when they are satisfied. And every being looks beautiful when they are internally feeling a happiness. Their face doesn't look like this. When they're angry  they look ugly  every being  but when they're happy they look beautiful. And so you see beings in their potential happiness. And you feel a love toward them and you want them to be happy  even the enemy. We think Jesus is being unrealistic when he says   Love thine enemy.  He does say that  and we think he's being unrealistic and sort of spiritual and highfalutin.  Nice for him to say it  but I can't do that.  But  actually  that's practical. If you love your enemy that means you want your enemy to be happy. If your enemy was really happy  why would they bother to be your enemy  How boring to run around chasing you. They would be relaxing somewhere having a good time. So it makes sense to want your enemy to be happy  because they'll stop being your enemy because that's too much trouble. But anyway  that's the  lovely love.   And then finally  the fifth step is compassion   universal compassion.  And that is where you then look at the reality of all the beings you can think of. And you look at them  and you see how they are. And you realize how unhappy they are actually  mostly  most of the time. You see that furrowed brow in people. And then you realize they don't even have compassion on themselves. They're driven by this duty and this obligation.  I have to get that. I need more. I'm not worthy. And I should do something.  And they're rushing around all stressed out. And they think of it as somehow macho  hard discipline on themselves. But actually they are cruel to themselves. And  of course  they are cruel and ruthless toward others. And they  then  never get any positive feedback. And the more they succeed and the more power they have  the more unhappy they are. And this is where you feel real compassion for them. And you then feel you must act. And the choice of the action  of course  hopefully will be more practical than poor Asanga  who was fixing the maggots on the dog because he had that motivation  and whoever was in front of him  he wanted to help. But  of course  that is impractical. He should have founded the ASPCA in the town and gotten some scientific help for dogs and maggots. And I'm sure he did that later.  Laughter  But that just indicates the state of mind  you know. And so the next step    the sixth step beyond  universal compassion     is this thing where you're linked with the needs of others in a true way  and you have compassion for yourself also  and it isn't sentimental only. You might be in fear of something. Some bad guy is making himself more and more unhappy being more and more mean to other people and getting punished in the future for it in various ways. And in Buddhism  they catch it in the future life. Of course in theistic religion they're punished by God or whatever. And materialism  they think they get out of it just by not existing  by dying  but they don't. And so they get reborn as whatever  you know. Never mind. I won't get into that. But the next step is called  universal responsibility.  And that is very important    the Charter of Compassion must lead us to develop through true compassion  what is called  universal responsibility.  In the great teaching of his Holiness the Dalai Lama that he always teaches everywhere  he says that that is the common religion of humanity  kindness. But  kindness  means  universal responsibility.  And that means whatever happens to other beings is happening to us  we are responsible for that  and we should take it and do whatever we can at whatever little level and small level that we can do it. We absolutely must do that. There is no way not to do it. And then  finally  that leads to a new orientation in life where we live equally for ourselves and for others and we are joyful and happy. One thing we mustn't think is that compassion makes you miserable. Compassion makes you happy. The first person who is happy when you get great compassion is yourself  even if you haven't done anything yet for anybody else. Although  the change in your mind already does something for other beings  they can sense this new quality in yourself  and it helps them already  and gives them an example. And that uncompassionate clock has just showed me that it's all over. So  practice compassion  read the charter  disseminate it and develop it within yourself. Don't just think   Well  I'm compassionate   or  I'm not compassionate   and sort of think you're stuck there. You can develop this. You can diminish the non compassion  the cruelty  the callousness  the neglect of others  and take universal responsibility for them. And then  not only will God smile and the eternal mama will smile  but Karen Armstrong will smile. Thank you very much.  Applause  I'm going to talk about compassion and the golden rule from a secular perspective and even from a kind of scientific perspective. I'm going to try to give you a little bit of a natural history of compassion and the golden rule. So  I'm going to be sometimes using kind of clinical language  and so it's not going to sound as warm and fuzzy as your average compassion talk. I want to warn you about that. So  I do want to say  at the outset  that I think compassion's great. The golden rule is great. I'm a big supporter of both. And I think it's great that the leaders of the religions of the world are affirming compassion and the golden rule as fundamental principles that are integral to their faiths. At the same time  I think religions don't deserve all the credit. I think nature gave them a helping hand here. I'm going to argue tonight that compassion and the golden rule are  in a certain sense  built into human nature. But I'm also going to argue that once you understand the sense in which they are built into human nature  you realize that just affirming compassion  and affirming the golden rule  is really not enough. There's a lot of work to be done after that. OK so  a quick natural history  first of compassion. In the beginning  there was compassion  and I mean not just when human beings first showed up  but actually even before that. I think it's probably the case that  in the human evolutionary lineage  even before there were homo sapiens  feelings like compassion and love and sympathy had earned their way into the gene pool  and biologists have a pretty clear idea of how this first happened. It happened through a principle known as kin selection. And the basic idea of kin selection is that  if an animal feels compassion for a close relative  and this compassion leads the animal to help the relative  then  in the end  the compassion actually winds up helping the genes underlying the compassion itself. So  from a biologist's point of view  compassion is actually a gene's way of helping itself. OK. I warned you this was not going to be very warm and fuzzy. I'll get there    I hope to get a little fuzzier. This doesn't bother me so much  that the underlying Darwinian rationale of compassion is kind of self serving at the genetic level. Actually  I think the bad news about kin selection is just that it means that this kind of compassion is naturally deployed only within the family. That's the bad news. The good news is compassion is natural. The bad news is that this kin selected compassion is naturally confined to the family. Now  there's more good news that came along later in evolution  a second kind of evolutionary logic. Biologists call that  reciprocal altruism.  OK. And there  the basic idea is that compassion leads you to do good things for people who then will return the favor. Again  I know this is not as inspiring a notion of compassion as you may have heard in the past  but from a biologist's point of view  this reciprocal altruism kind of compassion is ultimately self serving too. It's not that people think that  when they feel the compassion. It's not consciously self serving  but to a biologist  that's the logic. And so  you wind up most easily extending compassion to friends and allies. I'm sure a lot of you  if a close friend has something really terrible happen to them  you feel really bad. But if you read in the newspaper that something really horrible happened to somebody you've never heard of  you can probably live with that. That's just human nature. So  it's another good news bad news story. It's good that compassion was extended beyond the family by this kind of evolutionary logic. The bad news is this doesn't bring us universal compassion by itself. So  there's still work to be done. Now  there's one other result of this dynamic called reciprocal altruism  which I think is kind of good news  which is that the way that this is played out in the human species  it has given people an intuitive appreciation of the golden rule. I don't quite mean that the golden rule itself is written in our genes  but you can go to a hunter gatherer society that has had no exposure to any of the great religious traditions  no exposure to ethical philosophy  and you'll find  if you spend time with these people  that  basically  they believe that one good turn deserves another  and that bad deeds should be punished. And evolutionary psychologists think that these intuitions have a basis in the genes. So  they do understand that if you want to be treated well  you treat other people well. And it's good to treat other people well. That's close to being a kind of built in intuition. So  that's good news. Now  if you've been paying attention  you're probably anticipating that there's bad news here  we still aren't to universal love  and it's true because  although an appreciation of the golden rule is natural  it's also natural to carve out exceptions to the golden rule. I mean  for example  none of us  probably  want to go to prison  but we all think that there are some people who should go to prison. Right  So  we think we should treat them differently than we would want to be treated. Now  we have a rationale for that. We say they did these bad things that make it just that they should go to prison. None of us really extends the golden rule in truly diffuse and universal fashion. We have the capacity to carve out exceptions  put people in a special category. And the problem is that    although in the case of sending people to prison  you have this impartial judiciary determining who gets excluded from the golden rule    that in everyday life  the way we all make these decisions about who we're not going to extend the golden rule to  is we use a much rougher and readier formula. Basically it's just like  if you're my enemy  if you're my rival    if you're not my friend  if you're not in my family    I'm much less inclined to apply the golden rule to you. We all do that  and you see it all over the world. You see it in the Middle East  people who  from Gaza  are firing missiles at Israel. They wouldn't want to have missiles fired at them  but they say   Well  but the Israelis  or some of them have done things that put them in a special category.  The Israelis would not want to have an economic blockade imposed on them  but they impose one on Gaza  and they say   Well  the Palestinians  or some of them  have brought this on themselves.  So  it's these exclusions to the golden rule that amount to a lot of the world's trouble. And it's natural to do that. So  the fact that the golden rule is in some sense built in to us is not  by itself  going to bring us universal love. It's not going to save the world. Now  there's one piece of good news I have that may save the world. Okay. Are you on the edges of your seats here  Good  because before I tell you about that good news  I'm going to have to take a little excursion through some academic terrain. So  I hope I've got your attention with this promise of good news that may save the world. It's this non zero sumness stuff you just heard a little bit about. It's just a quick introduction to game theory. This won't hurt. Okay. It's about zero sum and non zero sum games. If you ask what kind of a situation is conducive to people becoming friends and allies  the technical answer is a non zero sum situation. And if you ask what kind of situation is conducive to people defining people as enemies  it's a zero sum situation. So  what do those terms mean  Basically  a zero sum game is the kind you're used to in sports  where there's a winner and a loser. So  their fortunes add up to zero. So  in tennis  every point is either good for you and bad for the other person  or good for them  bad for you. Either way  your fortunes add up to zero. That's a zero sum game. Now  if you're playing doubles  then the person on your side of the net is in a non zero sum relationship with you  because every point is either good for both of you    positive  win win    or bad for both of you  it's lose lose. That's a non zero sum game. And in real life  there are lots of non zero sum games. In the realm of economics  say  if you buy something  that means you'd rather have the merchandise than the money  but the merchant would rather have the money than the merchandise. You both feel you've won. In a war  two allies are playing a non zero sum game. It's going to either be win win or lose lose for them. So  there are lots of non zero sum games in real life. And you could basically reformulate what I said earlier  about how compassion is deployed and the golden rule is deployed  by just saying  well  compassion most naturally flows along non zero sum channels where people perceive themselves as being in a potentially win win situation with some of their friends or allies. The deployment of the golden rule most naturally happens along these non zero sum channels. So  kind of webs of non zero sumness are where you would expect compassion and the golden rule to kind of work their magic. With zero sum channels you would expect something else. Okay. So  now you're ready for the good news that I said might save the world. And now I can admit that it might not too  now that I've held your attention for three minutes of technical stuff. But it may. And the good news is that history has naturally expanded these webs of non zero sumness  these webs that can be these channels for compassion. You can go back all the way to the stone age  technological evolution    roads  the wheel  writing  a lot of transportation and communication technologies    has just inexorably made it so that more people can be in more non zero sum relationships with more and more people at greater and greater distances. That's the story of civilization. It's why social organization has grown from the hunter gatherer village to the ancient state  the empire  and now here we are in a globalized world. And the story of globalization is largely a story of non zero sumness. You've probably heard the term  interdependence  applied to the modern world. Well  that's just another term for non zero sum. If your fortunes are interdependent with somebody  then you live in a non zero sum relationship with them. And you see this all the time in the modern world. You saw it with the recent economic crash  where bad things happen in the economy    bad for everybody  for much of the world. Good things happen  and it's good for much of the world. And  you know  I'm happy to say  I think there's really evidence that this non zero sum kind of connection can expand the moral compass. I mean  if you look at the American attitudes toward Japanese during World War II    look at the depictions of Japanese in the American media as just about subhuman  and look at the fact that we dropped atomic bombs  really without giving it much of a thought    and you compare that to the attitude now  I think part of that is due to a kind of economic interdependence. Any form of interdependence  or non zero sum relationship forces you to acknowledge the humanity of people. So  I think that's good. And the world is full of non zero sum dynamics. Environmental problems  in many ways  put us all in the same boat. And there are non zero sum relationships that maybe people aren't aware of. For example  probably a lot of American Christians don't think of themselves as being in a non zero sum relationship with Muslims halfway around the world  but they really are  because if these Muslims become happier and happier with their place in the world and feel that they have a place in it  that's good for Americans  because there will be fewer terrorists to threaten American security. If they get less and less happy  that will be bad for Americans. So  there's plenty of non zero sumness. And so  the question is  If there's so much non zero sumness  why has the world not yet been suffused in love  peace  and understanding  The answer's complicated. It's the occasion for a whole other talk. Certainly  a couple of things are that  first of all  there are a lot of zero sum situations in the world. And also  sometimes people don't recognize the non zero sum dynamics in the world. In both of these areas  I think politicians can play a role. This isn't only about religion. I think politicians can help foster non zero sum relationships  Economic engagement is generally better than blockades and so on  in this regard. And politicians can be aware  and should be aware that  when people around the world are looking at them  are looking at their nation and picking up their cues for whether they are in a zero sum or a non zero sum relationship with a nation    like  say  America  or any other nation    human psychology is such that they use cues like  Do we feel we're being respected  Because  you know  historically  if you're not being respected  you're probably not going to wind up in a non zero sum  mutually profitable relationship with people. So  we need to be aware of what kind of signals we're sending out. And some of this  again  is in the realm of political work. If there's one thing I can encourage everyone to do  politicians  religious leaders  and us  it would be what I call  expanding the moral imagination     that is to say  your ability to put yourself in the shoes of people in very different circumstances. This is not the same as compassion  but it's conducive to compassion. It opens the channels for compassion. And I'm afraid we have another good news bad news story  which is that the moral imagination is part of human nature. That's good  but again we tend to deploy it selectively. Once we define somebody as an enemy  we have trouble putting ourselves in their shoes  just naturally. So  if you want to take a particularly hard case for an American  somebody in Iran who is burning an American flag  and you see them on TV. Well  the average American is going to resist the moral exercise of putting themselves in that person's head and is going to resist the idea that they have much in common with that person. And if you tell them   Well  they think America disrespects them and even wants to dominate them  and they hate America. Has there ever been somebody who disrespected you so much that you kind of hated them briefly   You know  they'll resist that comparison and that's natural  that's human. And  similarly  the person in Iran  when you try to humanize somebody in America who said that Islam is evil  they'll have trouble with that. So  it's a very difficult thing to get people to expand the moral imagination to a place it doesn't naturally go. I think it's worth the trouble because  again  it just helps us to understand. If you want to reduce the number of people who are burning flags  it helps to understand what makes them do it. And I think it's good moral exercise. I would say here is where religious leaders come in  because religious leaders are good at reframing issues for people  at harnessing the emotional centers of the brain to get people to alter their awareness and reframe the way they think. I mean  religious leaders are kind of in the inspiration business. It's their great calling right now  to get people all around the world better at expanding their moral imaginations  appreciating that in so many ways they're in the same boat. I would just sum up the way things look  at least from this secular perspective  as far as compassion and the golden rule go  by saying that it's good news that compassion and the golden rule are in some sense built into human nature. It's unfortunate that they tend to be selectively deployed. And it's going to take real work to change that. But  nobody ever said that doing God's work was going to be easy. Thanks. I think the future of this planet depends on humans  not technology  and we already have the knowledge    we re kind of at the endgame with knowledge. But we re nowhere near the endgame when it comes to our perception. We still have one foot in the dark ages. And when you listen to some of the presentations here    and the extraordinary range of human capability  our understandings    and then you contrast it with the fact we still call this planet   Earth   it s pretty extraordinary    we have one foot in the dark ages. Just quickly  Aristotle  his thing was   It s not flat  stupid  it s round.  Galileo    he had the Inquisition  so he had to be a little bit more polite    his was   It s not in the middle  you know.  And Hawkes   it s not earth  stupid  it s ocean.  This is an ocean planet. T.S. Eliot really said it for me    and this should give you goose bumps   we shall not cease from exploration and the end of our exploring shall be to return where we started and know the place for the first time.  And the next lines are   Through the unknown remembered gate  where the last of earth discovered is that which is the beginning.  So I have one message. It seems to me that we re all pointed in the wrong direction. For the rocketeers in the audience  I love what you re doing  I admire the guts  I admire the courage    but your rockets are pointed in the wrong goddamn direction. And it s all a question of perspective. Let me try and tell you    I don t mean to insult you  but look  if I    and I m not doing this for real because it would be an insult  so I m going to pretend  and it softens the blow    I m going to tell you what you re thinking. If I held up a square that was one foot square and the color of earth  and I held up another square that was the root two square    so it s  .  times bigger    and was the color of the oceans  and I said  what is the relative value of these two things  Well  it s the relative importance. You would say    yeah  yeah  yeah  we all know this  water covers twice the area of the planet than dry land. But it s a question of perception  and if that s what you re thinking  if that s what you think I mean when I say   This is an ocean planet stupidly called 'Earth.'  If you think that that s the relative importance  two to one  you re wrong by a factor of ten. Now  you re not as thick as two short planks  but you sound like it when you say  Earth   because that demonstration  if I turned around this way    that earth plane would be as thin as paper. It s a thin film  two dimensional existence. The ocean representation would have a depth to it. And if you hefted those two things you might find that the relative scale of those is    to  . It turns out that something more than    percent of life on earth is aquatic. That means that us terrestrials occupy a minority. The problem we have in believing that is    you just have to give up this notion that this Earth was created for us. Because it s a problem we have. If this is an ocean planet and we only have a small minority of this planet  it just interferes with a lot of what humanity thinks. Okay. Let me criticize this thing. I m not talking about James Cameron    although I could  but I won t. You really do have to go and see his latest film   Aliens of the Deep.  It s incredible. It features two of these deep rovers  and I can criticize them because these sweet things are mine. This  I think  represents one of the most beautiful classic submersibles built. If you look at that sub  you ll see a sphere. This is an acryclic sphere. It generates all of the buoyancy  all of the payload for the craft  and the batteries are down here hanging underneath  exactly like a balloon. This is the envelope  and this is the gondola  the payload. Also coming up later for criticism are these massive lights. And this one actually carries two great manipulators. It actually is a very good working sub    that s what it was designed for. The problem with it is    and the reason I will never build another one like it    is that this is a product of two dimensional thinking. It s what we humans do when we go in the ocean as engineers  we take all our terrestrial hang ups  all our constraints    importantly  these two dimensional constraints that we have  and they re so constrained we don t even understand it    and we take them underwater. You notice that Jim Cameron is sitting in a seat. A seat works in a two dimensional world  where gravity blasts down on that seat  OK  And in a two dimensional world  we do know about the third dimension but we don t use it because to go up requires an awful lot of energy against gravity. And then our mothers tell us   Careful you don t fall down     because you ll fall over. Now  go into the real atmosphere of this planet. This planet has an inner atmosphere of water  it s its inner atmosphere. It has two atmospheres    a lesser  outer gaseous atmosphere  a lighter one. Most of life on earth is in that inner atmosphere. And that life enjoys a three dimensional existence  which is alien to us. Fish do not sit in seats. They don t. Their mothers don t say to little baby fish   Careful you don t fall over.  They don t fall over. They don t fall. They live in a three dimensional world where there is no difference in energy between going this way  that way  that way or that way. It s truly a three dimensional space. And we re only just beginning to grasp it. I don t know of any other submersible  or even remote  that just takes advantage that this is a three dimensional space. This is the way we should be going into the oceans. This is a three dimensional machine. What we need to do is go down into the ocean with the freedom of the animals  and move in this three dimensional space. OK  this is good stuff. This is man s first attempt at flying underwater. Right now  I m just coming down on this gorgeous  big  giant manta ray. She has twice the wingspan that I do. There I m coming  she sees me. And just notice how she rolls under and turns  she doesn t sit there and try and blow air into a tank and kind of flow up or sink down    she just rolls. And the craft that I m in    this hasn t been shown before. Chris asked us to show stuff that hasn t been shown before. I wanted you to notice that she actually turned to come back up. There I am  I see her coming back  coming up underneath me. I put reverse thrust and I try and pull gently down. I m trying to do everything very gently. We spent about three hours together and she s beginning to trust me. And this ballet is controlled by this lady here. She gets about that close and then she pulls away. So now I try and go after her  but I m practicing flying. This is the first flying machine. This was the first prototype. This was a fly by wire. It has wings. There re no silly buoyancy tanks    it s permanently  positively buoyant. And then by moving through the water it s able to take that control. Now  look at that  look  it s    she just blew me away. She just rolled right away from underneath. Really that s the only real dive I ve ever made in this machine. It took    years to build. But this lady here taught me  hah  taught me so much. We just learned so much in three hours in the water there. I just had to go and build another machine. But look here. Instead of blowing tanks and coming up slowly without thinking about it  it s a little bit of back pressure  and that sub just comes straight back up out of the water. This is an internal Sony camera. Thank you  Sony. I don t really look that ugly  but the camera is so close that it s just distorted. Now  there she goes  right overhead. This is a wide angle camera. She s just a few inches off the top of my head.  Aah  ha  oh  he just crossed over the top of my head about  oh  I don t know  just so close.  I come back up  not for air.  This is an incredible encounter with a manta. I m speechless. We ve been just feet apart. I m going back down now.  Okay  can we cut that  Lights back up please. Trying to fly and keep up with that animal    it wasn t the lack of maneuverability that we had. It was the fact she was going so slow. I actually designed that to move faster through the water because I thought that was the thing that we needed to do  to move fast and get range. But after that encounter I really did want to go back with that animal and dance. She wanted to dance. And so what we needed to do was increase the wing area so that we just had more grip  develop higher forces. So the sub that was outside last year    this is the one. You see the larger wing area here. Also  clearly  it was such a powerful thing  we wanted to try and bring other people but we couldn't figure out how to do it. So we opened the world s first flight school. The rational for the world s first flight school goes something like  when the coastguards come up to me and say    they used to leave us alone when we were diving these goofy little spherical things  but when we started flying around in underwater jet fighters they got a little nervous    they would come up and say   Do you have a license for that   And then I d put my sunglasses on  the beard that would all sprout out  and I would say   I don t need no stinking license.   I write these stinking license   which I do. So Bob Gelfond's around here    but somebody in the audience here has license number   . They re one of the first subsea aviators. So we ve run two flight schools. Where the hell that goes  I don t know  but it s a lot of fun. What comes next in    seconds  I can t tell you. But the patent for underwater flight    Karen and I  we were looking at it  some business partners wanted us to patent it    we weren t sure about that. We ve decided we re just going to let that go. It just seems wrong to try and patent       the freedom for underwater flight. So anybody who wants to copy us and come and join us  go for it. The other thing is that we ve got much lower costs. We developed some other technology called spider optics  and Craig Ventner asked me to make an announcement here this morning  we re going to be building a beautiful  little  small version of this    unmanned  super deep    for his boat to go and get back some deep sea DNA stuff. Thank you. This was in an area called Wellawatta  a prime residential area in Colombo. We stood on the railroad tracks that ran between my friend's house and the beach. The tracks are elevated about eight feet from the waterline normally  but at that point the water had receded to a level three or four feet below normal. I'd never seen the reef here before. There were fish caught in rock pools left behind by the receding water. Some children jumped down and ran to the rock pools with bags. They were trying to catch fish. No one realized that this was a very bad idea. The people on the tracks just continued to watch them. I turned around to check on my friend's house. Then someone on the tracks screamed. Before I could turn around  everyone on the tracks was screaming and running. The water had started coming back. It was foaming over the reef. The children managed to run back onto the tracks. No one was lost there. But the water continued to climb. In about two minutes  it had reached the level of the railroad tracks and was coming over it. We had run about     meters by this time. It continued to rise. I saw an old man standing at his gate  knee deep in water  refusing to move. He said he'd lived his whole life there by the beach  and that he would rather die there than run. A boy broke away from his mother to run back into his house to get his dog  who was apparently afraid. An old lady  crying  was carried out of her house and up the road by her son. The slum built on the railroad reservation between the sea and the railroad tracks was completely swept away. Since this was a high risk location  the police had warned the residents  and no one was there when the water rose. But they had not had any time to evacuate any belongings. For hours afterwards  the sea was strewn with bits of wood for miles around    all of this was from the houses in the slum. When the waters subsided  it was as if it had never existed. This may seem hard to believe    unless you've been reading lots and lots of news reports    but in many places  after the tsunami  villagers were still terrified. When what was a tranquil sea swallows up people  homes and long tail boats    mercilessly  without warning    and no one can tell you anything reliable about whether another one is coming  I'm not sure you'd want to calm down either. One of the scariest things about the tsunami that I've not seen mentioned is the complete lack of information. This may seem minor  but it is terrifying to hear rumor after rumor after rumor that another tidal wave  bigger than the last  will be coming at exactly   p.m.  or perhaps tonight  or perhaps ... You don't even know if it is safe to go back down to the water  to catch a boat to the hospital. We think that Phi Phi hospital was destroyed. We think this boat is going to Phuket hospital  but if it's too dangerous to land at its pier  then perhaps it will go to Krabi instead  which is more protected. We don't think another wave is coming right away. At the Phi Phi Hill Resort  I was tucked into the corner furthest away from the television  but I strained to listen for information. They reported that there was an  .  magnitude earthquake in Sumatra  which triggered the massive tsunami. Having this news was comforting in some small way to understand what had just happened to us. However  the report focused on what had already occurred and offered no information on what to expect now. In general  everything was merely hearsay and rumor  and not a single person I spoke to for over    hours knew anything with any certainty. Those were two accounts of the Asian tsunami from two Internet blogs that essentially sprang up after it occurred. I'm now going to show you two video segments from the tsunami that also were shown on blogs. I should warn you  they're pretty powerful. One from Thailand  and the second one from Phuket as well. Voice    It's coming in. It's coming again. Voice    It's coming again  Voice    Yeah. It's coming again. Voice    Come get inside here. Voice    It's coming again. Voice    New wave  Voice    It's coming again. New wave   Unclear  They called me out here. James Surowiecki  Phew. Those were both on this site  waveofdestruction.org. In the world of blogs  there's going to be before the tsunami and after the tsunami  because one of the things that happened in the wake of the tsunami was that  although initially    that is  in that first day    there was actually a kind of dearth of live reporting  there was a dearth of live video and some people complained about this. They said   The blogsters let us down.  What became very clear was that  within a few days  the outpouring of information was immense  and we got a complete and powerful picture of what had happened in a way that we never had been able to get before. And what you had was a group of essentially unorganized  unconnected writers  video bloggers  etc.  who were able to come up with a collective portrait of a disaster that gave us a much better sense of what it was like to actually be there than the mainstream media could give us. And so in some ways the tsunami can be seen as a sort of seminal moment  a moment in which the blogosphere came  to a certain degree  of age. Now  I'm going to move now from this kind of    the sublime in the traditional sense of the word  that is to say  awe inspiring  terrifying    to the somewhat more mundane. Because when we think about blogs  I think for most of us who are concerned about them  we're primarily concerned with things like politics  technology  etc. And I want to ask three questions in this talk  in the    minutes that remain  about the blogosphere. The first one is  What does it tell us about our ideas  about what motivates people to do things  The second is  Do blogs genuinely have the possibility of accessing a kind of collective intelligence that has previously remained  for the most part  untapped  And then the third part is  What are the potential problems  or the dark side of blogs as we know them  OK  the first question  What do they tell us about why people do things  One of the fascinating things about the blogosphere specifically  and  of course  the Internet more generally    and it's going to seem like a very obvious point  but I think it is an important one to think about    is that the people who are generating these enormous reams of content every day  who are spending enormous amounts of time organizing  linking  commenting on the substance of the Internet  are doing so primarily for free. They are not getting paid for it in any way other than in the attention and  to some extent  the reputational capital that they gain from doing a good job. And this is    at least  to a traditional economist    somewhat remarkable  because the traditional account of economic man would say that  basically  you do things for a concrete reward  primarily financial. But instead  what we're finding on the Internet    and one of the great geniuses of it    is that people have found a way to work together without any money involved at all. They have come up with  in a sense  a different method for organizing activity. The Yale Law professor Yochai Benkler  in an essay called  Coase's Penguin   talks about this open source model  which we're familiar with from Linux  as being potentially applicable in a whole host of situations. And  you know  if you think about this with the tsunami  what you have is essentially a kind of an army of local journalists  who are producing enormous amounts of material for no reason other than to tell their stories. That's a very powerful idea  and it's a very powerful reality. And it's one that offers really interesting possibilities for organizing a whole host of activities down the road. So  I think the first thing that the blogosphere tells us is that we need to expand our idea of what counts as rational  and we need to expand our simple equation of value equals money  or  you have to pay for it to be good  but that in fact you can end up with collectively really brilliant products without any money at all changing hands. There are a few bloggers    somewhere maybe around     now    who do  in fact  make some kind of money  and a few who are actually trying to make a full time living out of it  but the vast majority of them are doing it because they love it or they love the attention  or whatever it is. So  Howard Rheingold has written a lot about this and  I think  is writing about this more  but this notion of voluntary cooperation is an incredibly powerful one  and one worth thinking about. The second question is  What does the blogosphere actually do for us  in terms of accessing collective intelligence  You know  as Chris mentioned  I wrote a book called  The Wisdom of Crowds.  And the premise of  The Wisdom of Crowds  is that  under the right conditions  groups can be remarkably intelligent. And they can actually often be smarter than even the smartest person within them. The simplest example of this is if you ask a group of people to do something like guess how many jellybeans are in a jar. If I had a jar of jellybeans and I asked you all to guess how many jellybeans were in that jar  your average guess would be remarkably good. It would be somewhere probably within three and five percent of the number of beans in the jar  and it would be better than    to    percent of you. There may be one or two of you who are brilliant jelly bean guessers  but for the most part the group's guess would be better than just about all of you. And what's fascinating is that you can see this phenomenon at work in many more complicated situations. For instance  if you look at the odds on horses at a racetrack  they predict almost perfectly how likely a horse is to win. In a sense  the group of betters at the racetrack is forecasting the future  in probabilistic terms. You know  if you think about something like Google  which essentially is relying on the collective intelligence of the Web to seek out those sites that have the most valuable information    we know that Google does an exceptionally good job of doing that  and it does that because  collectively  this disorganized thing we call the  World Wide Web  actually has a remarkable order  or a remarkable intelligence in it. And this  I think  is one of the real promises of the blogosphere. Dan Gillmor    whose book  We the Media  is included in the gift pack    has talked about it as saying that  as a writer  he's recognized that his readers know more than he does. And this is a very challenging idea. It's a very challenging idea to mainstream media. It's a very challenging idea to anyone who has invested an enormous amount of time and expertise  and who has a lot of energy invested in the notion that he or she knows better than everyone else. But what the blogosphere offers is the possibility of getting at the kind of collective  distributive intelligence that is out there  and that we know is available to us if we can just figure out a way of accessing it. Each blog post  each blog commentary may not  in and of itself  be exactly what we're looking for  but collectively the judgment of those people posting  those people linking  more often than not is going to give you a very interesting and enormously valuable picture of what's going on. So  that's the positive side of it. That's the positive side of what is sometimes called participatory journalism or citizen journalism  etc.    that  in fact  we are giving people who have never been able to talk before a voice  and we're able to access information that has always been there but has essentially gone untapped. But there is a dark side to this  and that's what I want to spend the last part of my talk on. One of the things that happens if you spend a lot of time on the Internet  and you spend a lot of time thinking about the Internet  is that it is very easy to fall in love with the Internet. It is very easy to fall in love with the decentralized  bottom up structure of the Internet. It is very easy to think that networks are necessarily good things    that being linked from one place to another  that being tightly linked in a group  is a very good thing. And much of the time it is. But there's also a downside to this    a kind of dark side  in fact    and that is that the more tightly linked we've become to each other  the harder it is for each of us to remain independent. One of the fundamental characteristics of a network is that  once you are linked in the network  the network starts to shape your views and starts to shape your interactions with everybody else. That's one of the things that defines what a network is. A network is not just the product of its component parts. It is something more than that. It is  as Steven Johnson has talked about  an emergent phenomenon. Now  this has all these benefits  it's very beneficial in terms of the efficiency of communicating information  it gives you access to a whole host of people  it allows people to coordinate their activities in very good ways. But the problem is that groups are only smart when the people in them are as independent as possible. This is the paradox of the wisdom of crowds  or the paradox of collective intelligence  that what it requires is actually a form of independent thinking. And networks make it harder for people to do that  because they drive attention to the things that the network values. So  one of the phenomena that's very clear in the blogosphere is that once a meme  once an idea gets going  it is very easy for people to just sort of pile on  because other people have  say  a link. People have linked to it  and so other people in turn link to it  etc.  etc. And that phenomenon of piling on the existing links is one that is characteristic of the blogosphere  particularly of the political blogosphere  and it is one that essentially throws off this beautiful  decentralized  bottom up intelligence that blogs can manifest in the right conditions. The metaphor that I like to use is the metaphor of the circular mill. A lot of people talk about ants. You know  this is a conference inspired by nature. When we talk about bottom up  decentralized phenomena  the ant colony is the classic metaphor  because  no individual ant knows what it's doing  but collectively ants are able to reach incredibly intelligent decisions. They're able to reach food as efficiently as possible  they're able to guide their traffic with remarkable speed. So  the ant colony is a great model  you have all these little parts that collectively add up to a great thing. But we know that occasionally ants go astray  and what happens is that  if army ants are wandering around and they get lost  they start to follow a simple rule    just do what the ant in front of you does. And what happens is that the ants eventually end up in a circle. And there's this famous example of one that was       feet long and lasted for two days  and the ants just kept marching around and around in a circle until they died. And that  I think  is a sort of thing to watch out for. That's the thing we have to fear    is that we're just going to keep marching around and around until we die. Now  I want to connect this back  though  to the tsunami  because one of the great things about the tsunami    in terms of the blogosphere's coverage  not in terms of the tsunami itself    is that it really did represent a genuine bottom up phenomenon. You saw sites that had never existed before getting huge amounts of traffic. You saw people being able to offer up their independent points of view in a way that they hadn't before. There  you really did see the intelligence of the Web manifest itself. So  that's the upside. The circular mill is the downside. And I think that the former is what we really need to strive for. Thank you very much.  Applause  Thank you for being here. And I say  thank you for being here  because I was silent for    years. And the first words that I spoke were in Washington  D.C.  on the   th anniversary of Earth Day. And my family and friends had gathered there to hear me speak. And I said   Thank you for being here.  My mother  out in the audience  she jumped up   Hallelujah  Johnny s talking   Imagine if you were quiet for    years and your mother was out in the audience  say. My dad said to me   That s one     I ll explain that. But I turned around because I didn t recognize where my voice was coming from. I hadn t heard my voice in    years  so I turned around and I looked and I said   God  who's saying what I m thinking   And then I realized it was me  you know  and I kind of laughed. And I could see my father   Yeah  he really is crazy.  Well  I want to take you on this journey. And the journey  I believe  is a metaphor for all of our journeys. Even though this one is kind of unusual  I want you to think about your own journey. My journey began in      when I witnessed two oil tankers collide beneath the Golden Gate  and a half a million gallons of oil spilled into the bay. It disturbed me so much that I decided that I was going to give up riding and driving in motorized vehicles. That s a big thing in California. And it was a big thing in my little community of Point Reyes Station in Inverness  California  because there were only about     people there in the winter   this was back in '   now. And so when I came in and I started walking around  people    they just knew what was going on. And people would drive up next to me and say   John  what are you doing   And I d say   Well  I m walking for the environment.  And they said   No  you re walking to make us look bad  right  You re walking to make us feel bad.  And maybe there was some truth to that  because I thought that if I started walking  everyone would follow. Because of the oil  everybody talked about the polllution. And so I argued with people about that  I argued and I argued. I called my parents up. I said   I ve given up riding and driving in cars.  My dad said   Why didn t you do that when you were      I didn t know about the environment then. They re back in Philadelphia. And so I told my mother   I m happy though  I m really happy.  She said   If you were happy  son  you wouldn t have to say it.  Mothers are like that. And so  on my   th birthday I decided  because I argued so much and I talk so much  that I was going to stop speaking for just one day    one day    to give it a rest. And so I did. I got up in the morning and I didn t say a word. And I have to tell you  it was a very moving experience  because for the first time  I began listening    in a long time. And what I heard  it kind of disturbed me. Because what I used to do  when I thought I was listening  was I would listen just enough to hear what people had to say and think that I could    I knew what they were going to say  and so I stopped listening. And in my mind  I just kind of raced ahead and thought of what I was going to say back  while they were still finishing up. And then I would launch in. Well  that just ended communication. So on this first day I actually listened. And it was very sad for me  because I realized that for those many years I had not been learning. I was   . I thought I knew everything. I didn t. And so I decided I d better do this for another day  and another day  and another day until finally  I promised myself for a year I would keep quiet because I started learning more and more and I needed to learn more. So for a year I said I would keep quiet  and then on my birthday I would reassess what I had learned and maybe I would talk again. Well  that lasted    years. Now during that time    those    years    I walked and I played the banjo and I painted and I wrote in my journal  and I tried to study the environment by reading books. And I decided that I was going to go to school. So I did. I walked up to Ashland  Oregon  where they were offering an environmental studies degree. It s only     miles. And I went into the Registrar s office and     What  what  what   I had a newspaper clipping.  Oh  so you really want to go to school here  You don t    We have a special program for you.  They did. And in those two years  I graduated with my first degree    a bachelor s degree. And my father came out  he was so proud. He said   Listen  we re really proud of you son  but what are you going to do with a bachelor s degree  You don t ride in cars  you don t talk    you re going to have to do those things.  I hunched my shoulder  I picked my backpack up again and I started walking. I walked all the way up to Port Townsend  Washington  where I built a wooden boat  rode it across Puget Sound and walked across Washington  to  Idaho and down to Missoula  Montana. I had written the University of Montana two years earlier and said I'd like to go to school there. I said I'd be there in about two years. And I was there. I showed up in two years and they    I tell this story because they really helped me. There are two stories in Montana. The first story is I didn t have any money    that s a sign I used a lot. And they said  Don't worry about that.  The director of the program said   Come back tomorrow.  He gave me     dollars  and he said   Register for one credit. You re going to go to South America  aren t you   And I said    Rivers and lakes  the hydrological systems  South America. So I did that. He came back  he said to me   OK John  now that you've registered for that one credit  you can have a key to an office  you can matriculate    you re matriculating  so you can use the library. And what we re going to do is  we re going to have all of the professors allow you to go to class. They re going to save your grade  and when we figure out how to get you the rest of the money  then you can register for that class and they ll give you the grade.  Wow  they don t do that in graduate schools  I don t think. But I use that story because they really wanted to help me. They saw that I was really interested in the environment  and they really wanted to help me along the way. And during that time  I actually taught classes without speaking. I had    students when I first walked into the class. I explained  with a friend who could interpret my sign language  that I was John Francis  I was walking around the world  I didn t talk and this was the last time this person s going to be here interpreting for me. All the students sat around and they went ... I could see they were looking for the schedule  to see when they could get out. They had to take that class with me. Two weeks later  everyone was trying to get into our class. And I learned in that class    because I would do things like this ... and they were all gathered around  going   What's he trying to say    I don't know  I think he's talking about clear cutting.   Yeah  clear cutting.   No  no  no  that's not clear cutting  that s    he's using a handsaw.   Well  you can t clearcut with a ...   Yes  you can clear cut ...   No  I think he s talking about selective forestry.  Now this was a discussion class and we were having a discussion. I just backed out of that  you know  and I just kind of kept the fists from flying. But what I learned was that sometimes I would make a sign and they said things that I absolutely did not mean  but I should have. And so what came to me is  if you were a teacher and you were teaching  if you weren t learning you probably weren t teaching very well. And so I went on. My dad came out to see me graduate and  you know  I did the deal  and my father said   We re really proud of you son  but ...   You know what went on  he said   You ve got to start riding and driving and start talking. What are you going to do with a master s degree   I hunched my shoulder  I got my backpack and I went on to the University of Wisconsin. I spent two years there writing on oil spills. No one was interested in oil spills. But something happened    Exxon Valdez. And I was the only one in the United States writing on oil spills. My dad came out again. He said   I don't know how you do this  son    I mean  you don't ride in cars  you don t talk. My sister said maybe I should leave you alone  because you seem to be doing a lot better when you re not saying anything.  Well  I put on my backpack again. I put my banjo on and I walked all the way to the East Coast  put my foot in the Atlantic Ocean    it was seven years and one day it took me to walk across the United States. And on Earth Day          the   th anniversary of Earth Day    that s when I began to speak. And that s why I said   Thank you for being here.  Because it's sort of like that tree in the forest falling  and if there's no one there to hear  does it really make a sound  And I m thanking you  and I'm thanking my family because they had come to hear me speak. And that s communication. And they also taught me about listening    that they listened to me. And it s one of those things that came out of the silence  the listening to each other. Really  very important    we need to listen to each other. Well  my journey kept going on. My dad said   That s one   and I still didn t let that go. I worked for the Coastguard  was made a U.N. Goodwill Ambassador. I wrote regulations for the United States    I mean  I wrote oil spill regulations.    years ago  if someone had said to me   John  do you really want to make a difference    Yeah  I want to make a difference.  He said   You just start walking east  get out of your car and just start walking east.  And as I walked off a little bit  they'd say   Yeah  and shut up  too.   You re going to make a difference  buddy.  How could that be  how could that be  How could doing such a simple thing like walking and not talking make a difference  Well  my time at the Coast Guard was a really good time. And after that    I only worked one year    I said   That's enough. One year's enough for me to do that.  I got on a sailboat and I sailed down to the Caribbean  and walked through all of the islands  and to Venezuela. And you know  I forgot the most important thing  which is why I started talking  which I have to tell you. I started talking because I had studied environment. I d studied environment at this formal level  but there was this informal level. And the informal level    I learned about people  and what we do and how we are. And environment changed from just being about trees and birds and endangered species to being about how we treated each other. Because if we are the environment  then all we need to do is look around us and see how we treat ourselves and how we treat each other. And so that s the message that I had. And I said   Well  I'm going to have to spread that message.  And I got in my sailboat  sailed all the way through the Caribbean    it wasn't really my sailboat  I kind of worked on that boat    got to Venezuela and I started walking. This is the last part of this story  because it s how I got here  because I still didn't ride in motorized vehicles. I was walking through El Dorado    it's a prison town  famous prison  or infamous prison    in Venezuela  and I don t know what possessed me  because this was not like me. There I am  walking past the guard gate and the guard stops and says   Pasaporte  pasaporte   and with an M   pointed at me. And I looked at him and I said   Passport  huh  I don't need to show you my passport. It s in the back of my pack. I'm Dr. Francis  I'm a U.N. Ambassador and I'm walking around the world.  And I started walking off. What possessed me to say this thing  The road turned into the jungle. I didn t get shot. And I got to    I start saying   Free at last    thank God Almighty  I m free at last.   What was that about   I m saying. What was that about  It took me     miles to figure out that  in my heart  in me  I had become a prisoner. I was a prisoner and I needed to escape. The prison that I was in was the fact that I did not drive or use motorized vehicles. Now how could that be  Because when I started  it seemed very appropriate to me not to use motorized vehicles. But the thing that was different was that every birthday  I asked myself about silence  but I never asked myself about my decision to just use my feet. I had no idea I was going to become a U.N. Ambassador. I had no idea I would have a Ph.D. And so I realized that I had a responsibility to more than just me  and that I was going to have to change. You know  we can do it. I was going to have to change. And I was afraid to change  because I was so used to the guy who only just walked. I was so used to that person that I didn t want to stop. I didn t know who I would be if I changed. But I know I needed to. I know I needed to change  because it would be the only way that I could be here today. And I know that a lot of times we find ourselves in this wonderful place where we ve gotten to  but there s another place for us to go. And we kind of have to leave behind the security of who we ve become  and go to the place of who we are becoming. And so  I want to encourage you to go to that next place  to let yourself out of any prison that you might find yourself in  as comfortable as it may be  because we have to do something now. We have to change now. As our former Vice President said  we have to become activists. So if my voice can touch you  if my actions can touch you  if my being here can touch you  please let it be. And I know that all of you have touched me while I ve been here. So  let s go out into the world and take this caring  this love  this respect that we ve shown each other right here at TED  and take this out into the world. Because we are the environment  and how we treat each other is really how we re going to treat the environment. So I want to thank you for being here and I want to end this in five seconds of silence. Thank you. This is a guy named Bob McKim. He was a creativity researcher in the '  s and '  s  and also led the Stanford Design Program. And in fact  my friend and IDEO founder  David Kelley  who s out there somewhere  studied under him at Stanford. And he liked to do an exercise with his students where he got them to take a piece of paper and draw the person who sat next to them  their neighbor  very quickly  just as quickly as they could. And in fact  we re going to do that exercise right now. You all have a piece of cardboard and a piece of paper. It s actually got a bunch of circles on it. I need you to turn that piece of paper over  you should find that it s blank on the other side. And there should be a pencil. And I want you to pick somebody that s seated next to you  and when I say  go  you ve got    seconds to draw your neighbor  OK  So  everybody ready  OK. Off you go. You ve got    seconds  you d better be fast. Come on  those masterpieces ... OK  Stop. All right  now. Yes  lot s of laughter. Yeah  exactly. Lots of laughter  quite a bit of embarrassment. Am I hearing a few  sorry s   I think I m hearing a few sorry s. Yup  yup  I think I probably am. And that s exactly what happens every time  every time you do this with adults. McKim found this every time he did it with his students. He got exactly the same response  lots and lots of sorry s. And he would point this out as evidence that we fear the judgment of our peers  and that we re embarrassed about showing our ideas to people we think of as our peers  to those around us. And this fear is what causes us to be conservative in our thinking. So we might have a wild idea  but we re afraid to share it with anybody else. OK  so if you try the same exercise with kids  they have no embarrassment at all. They just quite happily show their masterpiece to whoever wants to look at it. But as they learn to become adults  they become much more sensitive to the opinions of others  and they lose that freedom and they do start to become embarrassed. And in studies of kids playing  it s been shown time after time that kids who feel secure  who are in a kind of trusted environment    they re the ones that feel most free to play. And if you re starting a design firm  let s say  then you probably also want to create a place where people have the same kind of security. Where they have the same kind of security to take risks. Maybe have the same kind of security to play. Before founding IDEO  David said that what he wanted to do was to form a company where all the employees are my best friends. Now  that wasn t just self indulgence. He knew that friendship is a short cut to play. And he knew that it gives us a sense of trust  and it allows us then to take the kind of creative risks that we need to take as designers. And so  that decision to work with his friends    now he has     of them    was what got IDEO started. And our studios  like  I think  many creative workplaces today  are designed to help people feel relaxed  familiar with their surroundings  comfortable with the people that they re working with. It takes more than decor  but I think we ve all seen that creative companies do often have symbols in the workplace that remind people to be playful  and that it s a permissive environment. So  whether it s this microbus meeting room that we have in one our buildings at IDEO  or at Pixar  where the animators work in wooden huts and decorated caves  or at the Googleplex  where it s famous for its  beach  volleyball courts  and even this massive dinosaur skeleton with pink flamingos on it. Don t know the reason for the pink flamingos  but anyway  they re there in the garden. Or even in the Swiss office of Google  which perhaps has the most wacky ideas of all. And my theory is  that s so the Swiss can prove to their Californian colleagues that they re not boring. So they have the slide  and they even have a fireman s pole. Don t know what they do with that  but they have one. So all of these places have these symbols. Now  our big symbol at IDEO is actually not so much the place  it s a thing. And it s actually something that we invented a few years ago  or created a few years ago. It s a toy  it s called a  finger blaster.  And I forgot to bring one up with me. So if somebody can reach under the chair that s next to them  you ll find something taped underneath it. That s great. If you could pass it up. Thanks  David  I appreciate it. So this is a finger blaster  and you will find that every one of you has got one taped under your chair. And I m going to run a little experiment. Another little experiment. But before we start  I need just to put these on. Thank you. All right. Now  what I m going to do is  I m going to see how    I can t see out of these  OK. I m going to see how many of you at the back of the room can actually get those things onto the stage. So the way they work is  you know  you just put your finger in the thing  pull them back  and off you go. So  don t look backwards. That s my only recommendation here. I want to see how many of you can get these things on the stage. So come on  There we go  there we go. Thank you. Thank you. Oh. I have another idea. I wanted to    there we go. There we go. Thank you  thank you  thank you. Not bad  not bad. No serious injuries so far. Well  they re still coming in from the back there  they re still coming in. Some of you haven t fired them yet. Can you not figure out how to do it  or something  It s not that hard. Most of your kids figure out how to do this in the first    seconds  when they pick it up. All right. This is pretty good  this is pretty good. Okay  all right. Let s    I suppose we'd better... I'd better clear these up out of the way  otherwise  I m going to trip over them. All right. So the rest of you can save them for when I say something particularly boring  and then you can fire at me. All right. I think I m going to take these off now  because I can t see a damn thing when I ve    all right  OK. So  ah  that was fun. All right  good. So  OK  so why  So we have the finger blasters. Other people have dinosaurs  you know. Why do we have them  Well  as I said  we have them because we think maybe playfulness is important. But why is it important  We use it in a pretty pragmatic way  to be honest. We think playfulness helps us get to better creative solutions. Helps us do our jobs better  and helps us feel better when we do them. Now  an adult encountering a new situation    when we encounter a new situation we have a tendency to want to categorize it just as quickly as we can  you know. And there s a reason for that  we want to settle on an answer. Life s complicated  we want to figure out what s going on around us very quickly. I suspect  actually  that the evolutionary biologists probably have lots of reasons  for  why we want to categorize new things very  very quickly. One of them might be  you know  when we see this funny stripy thing  is that a tiger just about to jump out and kill us  Or is it just some weird shadows on the tree  We need to figure that out pretty fast. Well  at least  we did once. Most of us don t need to anymore  I suppose. This is some aluminum foil  right  You use it in the kitchen. That s what it is  isn t it  Of course it is  of course it is. Well  not necessarily. Kids are more engaged with open possibilities. Now  they ll certainly    when they come across something new  they ll certainly ask   What is it   Of course they will. But they ll also ask   What can I do with it   And you know  the more creative of them might get to a really interesting example. And this openness is the beginning of exploratory play. Any parents of young kids in the audience  There must be some. Yeah  thought so. So we ve all seen it  haven t we  We ve all told stories about how  on Christmas morning  our kids end up playing with the boxes far more than they play with the toys that are inside them. And you know  from an exploration perspective  this behavior makes complete sense. Because you can do a lot more with boxes than you can do with a toy. Even one like  say  Tickle Me Elmo    which  despite its ingenuity  really only does one thing  whereas boxes offer an infinite number of choices. So again  this is another one of those playful activities that  as we get older  we tend to forget and we have to relearn. So another one of Bob McKim s favorite exercises is called the     Circles Test.  So we re back to work. You guys are going to get back to work again. Turn that piece of paper that you did the sketch on back over  and you ll find those    circles printed on the piece of paper. So it should look like this. You should be looking at something like this. So what I m going to do is  I m going to give you minute  and I want you to adapt as many of those circles as you can into objects of some form. So for example  you could turn one into a football  or another one into a sun. All I m interested in is quantity. I want you to do as many of them as you can  in the minute that I m just about to give you. So  everybody ready  OK  Off you go. Okay. Put down your pencils  as they say. So  who got more than five circles figured out  Hopefully everybody  More than     Keep your hands up if you did   .         Anybody get all     No  Oh  Somebody did. Fantastic. Did anybody to a variation on a theme  Like a smiley face  Happy face  Sad face  Sleepy face  Anybody do that  Anybody use my examples  The sun and the football  Great. Cool. So I was really interested in quantity. I wasn t actually very interested in whether they were all different. I just wanted you to fill in as many circles as possible. And one of the things we tend to do as adults  again  is we edit things. We stop ourselves from doing things. We self edit as we re having ideas. And in some cases  our desire to be original is actually a form of editing. And that actually isn t necessarily really playful. So that ability just to go for it and explore lots of things  even if they don t seem that different from each other  is actually something that kids do well  and it is a form of play. So now  Bob McKim did another version of this test in a rather famous experiment that was done in the     s. Anybody know what this is  It s the peyote cactus. It s the plant from which you can create mescaline  one of the psychedelic drugs. For those of you around in the '  s  you probably know it well. McKim published a paper in       describing an experiment that he and his colleagues conducted to test the effects of psychedelic drugs on creativity. So he picked    professionals    they were engineers  physicists  mathematicians  architects  furniture designers even  artists    and he asked them to come along one evening  and to bring a problem with them that they were working on. He gave each of them some mescaline  and had them listen to some nice  relaxing music for a while. And then he did what s called the Purdue Creativity Test. You might know it as   How many uses can you find for a paper clip   It s basically the same thing as the    circles thing that I just had you do. Now  actually  he gave the test before the drugs and after the drugs  to see what the difference was in people s facility and speed with coming up with ideas. And then he asked them to go away and work on those problems that they d brought. And they d come up with a bunch of interesting solutions    and actually  quite valid solutions    to the things that they d been working on. And so  some of the things that they figured out  some of these individuals figured out  in one case  a new commercial building and designs for houses that were accepted by clients  a design of a solar space probe experiment  a redesign of the linear electron accelerator  an engineering improvement to a magnetic tape recorder    you can tell this is a while ago  the completion of a line of furniture  and even a new conceptual model of the photon. So it was a pretty successful evening. In fact  maybe this experiment was the reason that Silicon Valley got off to its great start with innovation. We don t know  but it may be. We need to ask some of the CEOs whether they were involved in this mescaline experiment. But really  it wasn t the drugs that were important  it was this idea that what the drugs did would help shock people out of their normal way of thinking  and getting them to forget the adult behaviors that were getting in the way of their ideas. But it s hard to break our habits  our adult habits. At IDEO we have brainstorming rules written on the walls. Edicts like   Defer judgment   or  Go for quantity.  And somehow that seems wrong. I mean  can you have rules about creativity  Well  it sort of turns out that we need rules to help us break the old rules and norms that otherwise we might bring to the creative process. And we ve certainly learnt that over time  you get much better brainstorming  much more creative outcomes when everybody does play by the rules. Now  of course  many designers  many individual designers  achieve this is in a much more organic way. I think the Eameses are wonderful examples of experimentation. And they experimented with plywood for many years without necessarily having one single goal in mind. They were exploring following what was interesting to them. They went from designing splints for wounded soldiers coming out of World War II and the Korean War  I think  and from this experiment they moved on to chairs. Through constant experimentation with materials  they developed a wide range of iconic solutions that we know today  eventually resulting in  of course  the legendary lounge chair. Now  if the Eameses had stopped with that first great solution  then we wouldn t be the beneficiaries of so many wonderful designs today. And of course  they used experimentation in all aspects of their work  from films to buildings  from games to graphics. So  they re great examples  I think  of exploration and experimentation in design. Now  while the Eameses were exploring those possibilities  they were also exploring physical objects. And they were doing that through building prototypes. And building is the next of the behaviors that I thought I d talk about. So the average Western first grader spends as much as    percent of their play time taking part in what s called  construction play.  Construction play    it s playful  obviously  but also a powerful way to learn. When play is about building a tower out of blocks  the kid begins to learn a lot about towers. And as they repeatedly knock it down and start again  learning is happening as a sort of by product of play. It s classically learning by doing. Now  David Kelley calls this behavior  when it s carried out by designers   thinking with your hands.  And it typically involves making multiple  low resolution prototypes very quickly  often by bringing lots of found elements together in order to get to a solution. On one of his earliest projects  the team was kind of stuck  and they came up with a mechanism by hacking together a prototype made from a roll on deodorant. Now  that became the first commercial computer mouse for the Apple Lisa and the Macintosh. So  they learned their way to that by building prototypes. Another example is a group of designers who were working on a surgical instrument with some surgeons. They were meeting with them  they were talking to the surgeons about what it was they needed with this device. And one of the designers ran out of the room and grabbed a white board marker and a film canister    which is now becoming a very precious prototyping medium    and a clothespin. He taped them all together  ran back into the room and said   You mean  something like this   And the surgeons grabbed hold of it and said  well  I want to hold it like this  or like that. And all of a sudden a productive conversation was happening about design around a tangible object. And in the end it turned into a real device. And so this behavior is all about quickly getting something into the real world  and having your thinking advanced as a result. At IDEO there s a kind of a back to preschool feel sometimes about the environment. The prototyping carts  filled with colored paper and Play Doh and glue sticks and stuff    I mean  they do have a bit of a kindergarten feel to them. But the important idea is that everything s at hand  everything s around. So when designers are working on ideas  they can start building stuff whenever they want. They don t necessarily even have to go into some kind of formal workshop to do it. And we think that s pretty important. And then the sad thing is  although preschools are full of this kind of stuff  as kids go through the school system it all gets taken away. They lose this stuff that facilitates this sort of playful and building mode of thinking. And of course  by the time you get to the average workplace  maybe the best construction tool we have might be the Post it notes. It s pretty barren. But by giving project teams and the clients who they re working with permission to think with their hands  quite complex ideas can spring into life and go right through to execution much more easily. This is a nurse using a very simple    as you can see    plasticine prototype  explaining what she wants out of a portable information system to a team of technologists and designers that are working with her in a hospital. And just having this very simple prototype allows her to talk about what she wants in a much more powerful way. And of course  by building quick prototypes  we can get out and test our ideas with consumers and users much more quickly than if we re trying to describe them through words. But what about designing something that isn t physical  Something like a service or an experience  Something that exists as a series of interactions over time  Instead of building play  this can be approached with role play. So  if you re designing an interaction between two people    such as  I don t know    ordering food at a fast food joint or something  you need to be able to imagine how that experience might feel over a period of time. And I think the best way to achieve that  and get a feeling for any flaws in your design  is to act it out. So we do quite a lot of work at IDEO trying to convince our clients of this. They can be a little skeptical  I ll come back to that. But a place  I think  where the effort is really worthwhile is where people are wrestling with quite serious problems    things like education or security or finance or health. And this is another example in a healthcare environment of some doctors and some nurses and designers acting out a service scenario around patient care. But you know  many adults are pretty reluctant to engage with role play. Some of it s embarrassment and some of it is because they just don t believe that what emerges is necessarily valid. They dismiss an interesting interaction by saying  you know   That s just happening because they re acting it out.  Research into kids' behavior actually suggests that it s worth taking role playing seriously. Because when children play a role  they actually follow social scripts quite closely that they ve learnt from us as adults. If one kid plays  store   and another one s playing  house   then the whole kind of play falls down. So they get used to quite quickly to understanding the rules for social interactions  and are actually quite quick to point out when they re broken. So when  as adults  we role play  then we have a huge set of these scripts already internalized. We ve gone through lots of experiences in life  and they provide a strong intuition as to whether an interaction is going to work. So we re very good  when acting out a solution  at spotting whether something lacks authenticity. So role play is actually  I think  quite valuable when it comes to thinking about experiences. Another way for us  as designers  to explore role play is to put ourselves through an experience which we re designing for  and project ourselves into an experience. So here are some designers who are trying to understand what it might feel like to sleep in a confined space on an airplane. And so they grabbed some very simple materials  you can see  and did this role play  this kind of very crude role play  just to get a sense of what it would be like for passengers if they were stuck in quite small places on airplanes. This is one of our designers  Kristian Simsarian  and he s putting himself through the experience of being an ER patient. Now  this is a real hospital  in a real emergency room. One of the reasons he chose to take this rather large video camera with him was because he didn t want the doctors and nurses thinking he was actually sick  and sticking something into him that he was going to regret later. So anyhow  he went there with his video camera  and it s kind of interesting to see what he brought back. Because when we looked at the video when he got back  we saw    minutes of this. And also  the amazing thing about this video    as soon as you see it you immediately project yourself into that experience. And you know what it feels like  all of that uncertainty while you re left out in the hallway while the docs are dealing with some more urgent case in one of the emergency rooms  wondering what the heck s going on. And so this notion of using role play    or in this case  living through the experience as a way of creating empathy    particularly when you use video  is really powerful. Or another one of our designers  Altay Sendil  he s here having his chest waxed  not because he s very vain  although actually he is    no  I m kidding    but in order to empathize with the pain that chronic care patients go through when they re having dressings removed. And so sometimes these analogous experiences  analogous role play  can also be quite valuable. So when a kid dresses up as a firefighter  you know  he s beginning to try on that identity. He wants to know what it feels like to be a firefighter. We re doing the same thing as designers. We re trying on these experiences. And so the idea of role play is both as an empathy tool  as well as a tool for prototyping experiences. And you know  we kind of admire people who do this at IDEO anyway. Not just because they lead to insights about the experience  but also because of their willingness to explore and their ability to unselfconsciously surrender themselves to the experience. In short  we admire their willingness to play. Playful exploration  playful building and role play  those are some of the ways that designers use play in their work. And so far  I admit  this might feel like it s a message just to go out and play like a kid. And to certain extent it is  but I want to stress a couple of points. The first thing to remember is that play is not anarchy. Play has rules  especially when it s group play. When kids play tea party  or they play cops and robbers  they re following a script that they ve agreed to. And it s this code negotiation that leads to productive play. So  remember the sketching task we did at the beginning  The kind of little face  the portrait you did  Well  imagine if you did the same task with friends while you were drinking in a pub. But everybody agreed to play a game where the worst sketch artist bought the next round of drinks. That framework of rules would have turned an embarrassing  difficult situation into a fun game. As a result  we d all feel perfectly secure and have a good time    but because we all understood the rules and we agreed on them together. But there aren t just rules about how to play  there are rules about when to play. Kids don t play all the time  obviously. They transition in and out of it  and good teachers spend a lot of time thinking about how to move kids through these experiences. As designers  we need to be able to transition in and out of play also. And if we re running design studios we need to be able to figure out  how can we transition designers through these different experiences  I think this is particularly true if we think about the sort of    I think what s very different about design is that we go through these two very distinctive modes of operation. We go through a sort of generative mode  where we re exploring many ideas  and then we come back together again  and come back looking for that solution  and developing that solution. I think they re two quite different modes  divergence and convergence. And I think it s probably in the divergent mode that we most need playfulness. Perhaps in convergent mode we need to be more serious. And so being able to move between those modes is really quite important. So  it s where there s a more nuanced version view of play  I think  is required. Because it s very easy to fall into the trap that these states are absolute. You re either playful or you re serious  and you can t be both. But that s not really true  you can be a serious professional adult and  at times  be playful. It s not an either or  it s an  and.  You can be serious and play. So to sum it up  we need trust to play  and we need trust to be creative. So  there s a connection. And there are a series of behaviors that we ve learnt as kids  and that turn out to be quite useful to us as designers. They include exploration  which is about going for quantity  building  and thinking with your hands  and role play  where acting it out helps us both to have more empathy for the situations in which we re designing  and to create services and experiences that are seamless and authentic. Thank you very much.  Applause  The fragrance that you will smell  you will never be able to smell this way again. It s a fragrance called Beyond Paradise  which you can find in any store in the nation. Except here it s been split up in parts by Est e Lauder and by the perfumer who did it  Calice Becker  and I'm most grateful to them for this. And it s been split up in successive bits and a chord. So what you re smelling now is the top note. And then will come what they call the heart  the lush heart note. I will show it to you. The Eden top note is named after the Eden Project in the U.K. The lush heart note  Melaleuca bark note    which does not contain any Melaleuca bark  because it s totally forbidden. And after that  the complete fragrance. Now what you are smelling is a combination of    I asked how many molecules there were in there  and nobody would tell me. So I put it through a G.C.  a Gas Chromatograph that I have in my office  and it s about    . So what you re smelling is several hundred molecules floating through the air  hitting your nose. And do not get the impression that this is very subjective. You are all smelling pretty much the same thing  OK  Smell has this reputation of being somewhat different for each person. It s not really true. And perfumery shows you that can t be true  because if it were like that it wouldn t be an art  OK  Now  while the smell wafts over you  let me tell you the history of an idea. Everything that you re smelling in here is made up of atoms that come from what I call the Upper East Side of the periodic table    a nice  safe neighborhood. You really don t want to leave it if you want to have a career in perfumery. Some people have tried in the     s to add things from the bad parts  and it didn t really work. These are the five atoms from which just about everything that you re going to smell in real life  from coffee to fragrance  are made of. The top note that you smelled at the very beginning  the cut grass green  what we call in perfumery    they re weird terms    and this would be called a green note  because it smells of something green  like cut grass. This is cis   hexene   ol. And I had to learn chemistry on the fly in the last three years. A very expensive high school chemistry education. This has six carbon atoms  so  hexa   hexene   ol. It has one double bond  it has an alcohol on the end  so it s  ol   and that s why they call it cis   hexene   ol. Once you figure this out  you can really impress people at parties. This smells of cut grass. Now  this is the skeleton of the molecule. If you dress it up with atoms  hydrogen atoms    that s what it looks like when you have it on your computer    but actually it s sort of more like this  in the sense that the atoms have a certain sphere that you cannot penetrate. They repel. OK  now. Why does this thing smell of cut grass  OK  Why doesn t it smell of potatoes or violets  Well  there are really two theories. But the first theory is  it must be the shape. And that s a perfectly reasonable theory in the sense that almost everything else in biology works by shape. Enzymes that chew things up  antibodies  it s all  you know  the fit between a protein and whatever it is grabbing  in this case a smell. And I will try and explain to you what s wrong with this notion. And the other theory is that we smell molecular vibrations. Now  this is a totally insane idea. And when I first came across it in the early '  s  I thought my predecessor  Malcolm Dyson and Bob Wright  had really taken leave of their senses  and I ll explain to you why this was the case. However  I came to realize gradually that they may be right    and I have to convince all my colleagues that this is so  but I m working on it. Here s how shape works in normal receptors. You have a molecule coming in  it gets into the protein  which is schematic here  and it causes this thing to switch  to turn  to move in some way by binding in certain parts. And the attraction  the forces  between the molecule and the protein cause the motion. This is a shape based idea. Now  what s wrong with shape is summarized in this slide. The way   I expect everybody to memorize these compounds. This is one page of work from a chemist s workbook  OK  Working for a fragrance company. He s making    molecules  and he s looking for a sandalwood  something that smells of sandalwood. Because there s a lot of money in sandalwoods. And of these    molecules  only      actually smells of sandalwood. And he puts an exclamation mark  OK  This is an awful lot of work. This actually is roughly  in man years of work          dollars roughly  if you keep them on the low salaries with no benefits. So this is a profoundly inefficient process. And my definition of a theory is  it s not just something that you teach people  it s labor saving. A theory is something that enables you to do less work. I love the idea of doing less work. So let me explain to you why    a very simple fact that tells you why this shape theory really does not work very well. This is cis   hexene   ol. It smells of cut grass. This is cis   hexene   thiol  and this smells of rotten eggs  OK  Now  you will have noticed that vodka never smells of rotten eggs. If it does  you put the glass down  you go to a different bar. This is    in other words  we never get the O H    we never mistake it for an S H  OK  Like  at no concentration  even pure  you know  if you smelt pure ethanol  it doesn t smell of rotten eggs. Conversely  there is no concentration at which the sulfur compound will smell like vodka. It s very hard to explain this by molecular recognition. Now  I showed this to a physicist friend of mine who has a profound distaste for biology  and he says   That s easy  The things are a different color   We have to go a little beyond that. Now let me explain why vibrational theory has some sort of interest in it. These molecules  as you saw in the beginning  the building blocks had springs connecting them to each other. In fact  molecules are able to vibrate at a set of frequencies which are very specific for each molecule and for the bonds connecting them. So this is the sound of the O H stretch  translated into the audible range. S H  quite a different frequency. Now  this is kind of interesting  because it tells you that you should be looking for a particular fact  which is this  nothing in the world smells like rotten eggs except S H  OK  Now  Fact B  nothing in the world has that frequency except S H. If you look on this  imagine a piano keyboard. The S H stretch is in the middle of a part of the keyboard that has been  so to speak  damaged  and there are no neighboring notes  nothing is close to it. You have a unique smell  a unique vibration. So I went searching when I started in this game to convince myself that there was any degree of plausibility to this whole crazy story. I went searching for a type of molecule  any molecule  that would have that vibration and that    the obvious prediction was that it should absolutely smell of sulfur. If it didn t  the whole idea was toast  and I might as well move on to other things. Now  after searching high and low for several months  I discovered that there was a type of molecule called a Borane which has exactly the same vibration. Now the good news is  Boranes you can get hold of. The bad news is they re rocket fuels. Most of them explode spontaneously in contact with air  and when you call up the companies  they only give you minimum ten tons  OK  So this was not what they call a laboratory scale experiment  and they wouldn t have liked it at my college. However  I managed to get a hold of a Borane eventually  and here is the beast. And it really does have the same    if you calculate  if you measure the vibrational frequencies  they are the same as S H. Now  does it smell of sulfur  Well  if you go back in the literature  there s a man who knew more about Boranes than anyone alive then or since  Alfred Stock  he synthesized all of them. And in an enormous    page paper in German he says  at one point    my wife is German and she translated it for me    and at one point he says   ganz widerlich Geruch   an  absolutely repulsive smell   which is good. Reminiscent of hydrogen sulfide. So this fact that Boranes smell of sulfur had been known since       and utterly forgotten until           . Now  the slight fly in the ointment is this  that if we smell molecular vibrations  we must have a spectroscope in our nose. Now  this is a spectroscope  OK  on my laboratory bench. And it s fair to say that if you look up somebody s nose  you re unlikely to see anything resembling this. And this is the main objection to the theory. OK  great  we smell vibrations. How  All right  Now when people ask this kind of question  they neglect something  which is that physicists are really clever  unlike biologists. This is a joke. I m a biologist  OK  So it s a joke against myself. Bob Jacklovich and John Lamb at Ford Motor Company  in the days when Ford Motor was spending vast amounts of money on fundamental research  discovered a way to build a spectroscope that was intrinsically nano scale. In other words  no mirrors  no lasers  no prisms  no nonsense  just a tiny device  and he built this device. And this device uses electron tunneling. Now  I could do the dance of electron tunneling  but I ve done a video instead  which is much more interesting. Here s how it works. Electrons are fuzzy creatures  and they can jump across gaps  but only at equal energy. If the energy differs  they can t jump. Unlike us  they won t fall off the cliff. OK. Now. If something absorbs the energy  the electron can travel. So here you have a system  you have something    and there s plenty of that stuff in biology    some substance giving an electron  and the electron tries to jump  and only when a molecule comes along that has the right vibration does the reaction happen  OK  This is the basis for the device that these two guys at Ford built. And every single part of this mechanism is actually plausible in biology. In other words  I ve taken off the shelf components  and I ve made a spectroscope. What s nice about this idea  if you have a philosophical bent of mind  is that then it tells you that the nose  the ear and the eye are all vibrational senses. Of course  it doesn t matter  because it could also be that they re not. But it has a certain       it has a certain ring to it which is attractive to people who read too much   th century German literature. And then a magnificent thing happened  I left academia and joined the real world of business  and a company was created around my ideas to make new molecules using my method  along the lines of  let s put someone else s money where your mouth is. And one of the first things that happened was we started going around to fragrance companies asking for what they needed  because  of course  if you could calculate smell  you don t need chemists. You need a computer  a Mac will do it  if you know how to program the thing right  OK  So you can try a thousand molecules  you can try ten thousand molecules in a weekend  and then you only tell the chemists to make the right one. And so that s a direct path to making new odorants. And one of the first things that happened was we went to see some perfumers in France    and here s where I do my Charles Fleischer impression    and one of them says   You cannot make a coumarin.  He says to me   I bet you cannot make a coumarin.  Now  coumarin is a very common thing  a material  in fragrance which is derived from a bean that comes from South America. And it is the classic synthetic aroma chemical  OK  It s the molecule that has made men s fragrances smell the way they do since       to be exact. And the problem is it s a carcinogen. So nobody likes particularly to    you know  aftershave with carcinogens. There are some reckless people  but it s not worth it  OK  So they asked us to make a new coumarin. And so we started doing calculations. And the first thing you do is you calculate the vibrational spectrum of coumarin  and you smooth it out  so that you have a nice picture of what the sort of chord  so to speak  of coumarin is. And then you start cranking the computer to find other molecules  related or unrelated  that have the same vibrations. And we actually  in this case  I m sorry to say  it happened    it was serendipitous. Because I got a phone call from our chief chemist and he said  look  I ve just found this such a beautiful reaction  that even if this compound doesn t smell of coumarin  I want to do it  it s just such a nifty  one step    I mean  chemists have weird minds    one step     percent yield  you know  and you get this lovely crystalline compound. Let us try it. And I said  first of all  let me do the calculation on that compound  bottom right  which is related to coumarin  but has an extra pentagon inserted into the molecule. Calculate the vibrations  the purple spectrum is that new fellow  the white one is the old one. And the prediction is it should smell of coumarin. They made it ... and it smelled exactly like coumarin. And this is our new baby  called tonkene. You see  when you re a scientist  you re always selling ideas. And people are very resistant to ideas  and rightly so. Why should new ideas be accepted  But when you put a little    gram vial on the table in front of perfumers and it smells like coumarin  and it isn t coumarin  and you ve found it in three weeks  this focuses everybody s mind wonderfully. And people often ask me  is your theory accepted  And I said  well  by whom  I mean most  you know    there s three attitudes  You re right  and I don t know why  which is the most rational one at this point. You re right  and I don t care how you do it  in a sense  you bring me the molecules  you know. And  You re completely wrong  and I m sure you re completely wrong. OK  Now  we re dealing with people who only want results  and this is the commercial world. And they tell us that even if we do it by astrology  they re happy. But we re not actually doing it by astrology. But for the last three years  I ve had what I consider to be the best job in the entire universe  which is to put my hobby    which is  you know  fragrance and all the magnificent things    plus a little bit of biophysics  a small amount of self taught chemistry at the service of something that actually works. Thank you very much. So  about three years ago I was in London  and somebody called Howard Burton came to me and said  I represent a group of people  and we want to start an institute in theoretical physics. We have about     million dollars  and we want to do it well. We want to be in the forefront fields  and we want to do it differently. We want to get out of this thing where the young people have all the ideas  and the old people have all the power and decide what science gets done. It took me about    seconds to decide that that was a good idea. Three years later  we have the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo  Ontario. It s the most exciting job I ve ever had. And it s the first time I ve had a job where I m afraid to go away because of everything that s going to happen in this week when I m here. But in any case  what I m going to do in my little bit of time is take you on a quick tour of some of the things that we talk about and we think about. So  we think a lot about what really makes science work  The first thing that anybody who knows science  and has been around science  is that the stuff you learn in school as a scientific method is wrong. There is no method. On the other hand  somehow we manage to reason together as a community  from incomplete evidence to conclusions that we all agree about. And this is  by the way  something that a democratic society also has to do. So how does it work  Well  my belief is that it works because scientists are a community bound together by an ethics. And here are some of the ethical principles. I m not going to read them all to you because I m not in teacher mode. I m in entertain  amaze mode. But one of the principles is that everybody who is part of the community gets to fight and argue as hard as they can for what they believe. But we re all disciplined by the understanding that the only people who are going to decide  you know  whether I m right or somebody else is right  are the people in our community in the next generation  in    and    years. So it s this combination of respect for the tradition and community we re in  and rebellion that the community requires to get anywhere  that makes science work. And being in this process of being in a community that reasons from shared evidence to conclusions  I believe  teaches us about democracy. Not only is there a relationship between the ethics of science and the ethics of being a citizen in democracy  but there has been  historically  a relationship between how people think about space and time  and what the cosmos is  and how people think about the society that they live in. And I want to talk about three stages in that evolution. The first science of cosmology that was anything like science was Aristotelian science  and that was hierarchical. The earth is in the center  then there are these crystal spheres  the sun  the moon  the planets and finally the celestial sphere  where the stars are. And everything in this universe has a place. And Aristotle s law of motion was that everything goes to its natural place  which was of course  the rule of the society that Aristotle lived in  and more importantly  the medieval society that  through Christianity  embraced Aristotle and blessed it. And the idea is that everything is defined. Where something is  is defined with respect to this last sphere  the celestial sphere  outside of which is this eternal  perfect realm  where lives God  who is the ultimate judge of everything. So that is both Aristotelian cosmology  and in a certain sense  medieval society. Now  in the   th century there was a revolution in thinking about space and time and motion and so forth of Newton. And at the same time there was a revolution in social thought of John Locke and his collaborators. And they were very closely associated. In fact  Newton and Locke were friends. Their way of thinking about space and time and motion on the one hand  and a society on the other hand  were closely related. And let me show you. In a Newtonian universe  there s no center    thank you. There are particles and they move around with respect to a fixed  absolute framework of space and time. It s meaningful to say absolutely where something is in space  because that s defined  not with respect to say  where other things are  but with respect to this absolute notion of space  which for Newton was God. Now  similarly  in Locke s society there are individuals who have certain rights  properties in a formal sense  and those are defined with respect to some absolute  abstract notions of rights and justice  and so forth  which are independent of what else has happened in the society. Of who else there is  of the history and so forth. There is also an omniscient observer who knows everything  who is God  who is in a certain sense outside the universe  because he has no role in anything that happens  but is in a certain sense everywhere  because space is just the way that God knows where everything is  according to Newton  OK  So this is the foundations of what s called  traditionally  liberal political theory and Newtonian physics. Now  in the   th century we had a revolution that was initiated at the beginning of the   th century  and which is still going on. It was begun with the invention of relativity theory and quantum theory. And merging them together to make the final quantum theory of space and time and gravity  is the culmination of that  something that s going on right now. And in this universe there s nothing fixed and absolute. Zilch  OK. This universe is described by being a network of relationships. Space is just one aspect  so there s no meaning to say absolutely where something is. There s only where it is relative to everything else that is. And this network of relations is ever evolving. So we call it a relational universe. All properties of things are about these kinds of relationships. And also  if you re embedded in such a network of relationships  your view of the world has to do with what information comes to you through the network of relations. And there s no place for an omniscient observer or an outside intelligence knowing everything and making everything. So this is general relativity  this is quantum theory. This is also  if you talk to legal scholars  the foundations of new ideas in legal thought. They re thinking about the same things. And not only that  they make the analogy to relativity theory and cosmology often. So there s an interesting discussion going on there. This last view of cosmology is called the relational view. So the main slogan here is that there s nothing outside the universe  which means that there s no place to put an explanation for something outside. So in such a relational universe  if you come upon something that s ordered and structured  like this device here  or that device there  or something beautiful  like all the living things  all of you guys in the room     guys  in physics  by the way  is a generic term  men and women. Then you want to know  you re a person  you want to know how is it made. And in a relational universe the only possible explanation was  somehow it made itself. There must be mechanisms of self organization inside the universe that make things. Because there s no place to put a maker outside  as there was in the Aristotelian and the Newtonian universe. So in a relational universe we must have processes of self organization. Now  Darwin taught us that there are processes of self organization that suffice to explain all of us and everything we see. So it works. But not only that  if you think about how natural selection works  then it turns out that natural selection would only make sense in such a relational universe. That is  natural selection works on properties  like fitness  which are about relationships of some species to some other species. Darwin wouldn t make sense in an Aristotelian universe  and wouldn t really make sense in a Newtonian universe. So a theory of biology based on natural selection requires a relational notion of what are the properties of biological systems. And if you push that all the way down  really  it makes the best sense in a relational universe where all properties are relational. Now  not only that  but Einstein taught us that gravity is the result of the world being relational. If it wasn t for gravity  there wouldn t be life  because gravity causes stars to form and live for a very long time  keeping pieces of the world  like the surface of the Earth  out of thermal equilibrium for billions of years so life can evolve. In the   th century  we saw the independent development of two big themes in science. In the biological sciences  they explored the implications of the notion that order and complexity and structure arise in a self organized way. That was the triumph of Neo Darwinism and so forth. And slowly  that idea is leaking out to the cognitive sciences  the human sciences  economics  et cetera. At the same time  we physicists have been busy trying to make sense of and build on and integrate the discoveries of quantum theory and relativity. And what we ve been working out is the implications  really  of the idea that the universe is made up of relations.   st century science is going to be driven by the integration of these two ideas  the triumph of relational ways of thinking about the world  on the one hand  and self organization or Darwinian ways of thinking about the world  on the other hand. And also  is that in the   st century our thinking about space and time and cosmology  and our thinking about society are both going to continue to evolve. And what they re evolving towards is the union of these two big ideas  Darwinism and relationalism. Now  if you think about democracy from this perspective  a new pluralistic notion of democracy would be one that recognizes that there are many different interests  many different agendas  many different individuals  many different points of view. Each one is incomplete  because you re embedded in a network of relationships. Any actor in a democracy is embedded in a network of relationships. And you understand some things better than other things  and because of that there s a continual jostling and give and take  which is politics. And politics is  in the ideal sense  the way in which we continually address our network of relations in order to achieve a better life and a better society. And I also think that science will never go away and    I m finishing on this line. In fact  I m finished. Science will never go away. I spent the better part of a decade looking at American responses to mass atrocity and genocide. And I'd like to start by sharing with you one moment that to me sums up what there is to know about American and democratic responses to mass atrocity. And that moment came on April         . So    years ago  almost  in the middle of the Rwandan genocide  in which         people would be systematically exterminated by the Rwandan government and some extremist militia. On April     in the New York Times  the paper reported that somewhere between         and         people had already been killed in the genocide. It was in the paper    not on the front page. It was a lot like the Holocaust coverage  it was buried in the paper. Rwanda itself was not seen as newsworthy  and amazingly  genocide itself was not seen as newsworthy. But on April     a wonderfully honest moment occurred. And that was that an American congresswoman named Patricia Schroeder from Colorado met with a group of journalists. And one of the journalists said to her  what's up  What's going on in the U.S. government  Two to         people have just been exterminated in the last couple of weeks in Rwanda. It's two weeks into the genocide at that time  but of course  at that time you don't know how long it's going to last. And the journalist said  why is there so little response out of Washington  Why no hearings  no denunciations  no people getting arrested in front of the Rwandan embassy or in front of the White House  What's the deal  And she said    she was so honest    she said   It's a great question. All I can tell you is that in my congressional office in Colorado and my office in Washington  we're getting hundreds and hundreds of calls about the endangered ape and gorilla population in Rwanda  but nobody is calling about the people. The phones just aren't ringing about the people.  And the reason I give you this moment is there's a deep truth in it. And that truth is  or was  in the   th century  that while we were beginning to develop endangered species movements  we didn't have an endangered people's movement. We had Holocaust education in the schools. Most of us were groomed not only on images of nuclear catastrophe  but also on images and knowledge of the Holocaust. There's a museum  of course  on the Mall in Washington  right next to Lincoln and Jefferson. I mean  we have owned Never Again culturally  appropriately  interestingly. And yet the politicization of Never Again  the operationalization of Never Again  had never occurred in the   th century. And that's what that moment with Patricia Schroeder I think shows  that if we are to bring about an end to the world's worst atrocities  we have to make it such. There has to be a role    there has to be the creation of political noise and political costs in response to massive crimes against humanity  and so forth. So that was the   th century. Now here    and this will be a relief to you at this point in the afternoon    there is good news  amazing news  in the   st century  and that is that  almost out of nowhere  there has come into being an anti genocide movement  an anti genocide constituency  and one that looks destined  in fact  to be permanent. It grew up in response to the atrocities in Darfur. It is comprised of students. There are something like     anti genocide chapters on college campuses around the country. It's bigger than the anti apartheid movement. There are something like     high school chapters devoted to stopping the genocide in Darfur. Evangelicals have joined it. Jewish groups have joined it.  Hotel Rwanda  watchers have joined it. It is a cacophonous movement. To call it a movement  as with all movements  perhaps  is a little misleading. It's diverse. It's got a lot of different approaches. It's got all the ups and the downs of movements. But it has been amazingly successful in one regard  in that it has become  it has congealed into this endangered people's movement that was missing in the   th century. It sees itself  such as it is  the it  as something that will create the impression that there will be political cost  there will be a political price to be paid  for allowing genocide  for not having an heroic imagination  for not being an upstander but for being  in fact  a bystander. Now because it's student driven  there's some amazing things that the movement has done. They have launched a divestment campaign that has now convinced  I think     universities in    states to divest their holdings of stocks with regard to companies doing business in Sudan. They have a       GENOCIDE number    this is going to sound very kitsch  but for those of you who may not be  I mean  may be apolitical  but interested in doing something about genocide  you dial       GENOCIDE and you type in your zip code  and you don't even have to know who your congressperson is. It will refer you directly to your congressperson  to your U.S. senator  to your governor where divestment legislation is pending. They've lowered the transaction costs of stopping genocide. I think the most innovative thing they've introduced recently are genocide grades. And it takes students to introduce genocide grades. So what you now have when a Congress is in session is members of Congress calling up these    year olds or    year olds and saying  I'm just told I have a D minus on genocide  what do I do to get a C  I just want to get a C. Help me. And the students and the others who are part of this incredibly energized base are there to answer that  and there's always something to do. Now  what this movement has done is it has extracted from the Bush administration from the United States  at a time of massive over stretch    military  financial  diplomatic    a whole series of commitments to Darfur that no other country in the world is making. For instance  the referral of the crimes in Darfur to the International Criminal Court  which the Bush administration doesn't like. The expenditure of   billion dollars in refugee camps to try to keep  basically  the people who've been displaced from their homes by the Sudanese government  by the so called Janjaweed  the militia  to keep those people alive until something more durable can be achieved. And recently  or now not that recently  about six months ago  the authorization of a peacekeeping force of        that will go. And that's all the Bush administration's leadership  and it's all because of this bottom up pressure and the fact that the phones haven't stopped ringing from the beginning of this crisis. The bad news  however  to this question of will evil prevail  is that evil lives on. The people in those camps are surrounded on all sides by so called Janjaweed  these men on horseback with spears and Kalashnikovs. Women who go to get firewood in order to heat the humanitarian aid in order to feed their families    humanitarian aid  the dirty secret of it is it has to be heated  really  to be edible    are themselves subjected to rape  which is a tool of the genocide that is being used. And the peacekeepers I've mentioned  the force has been authorized  but almost no country on Earth has stepped forward since the authorization to actually put its troops or its police in harm's way. So we have achieved an awful lot relative to the   th century  and yet far too little relative to the gravity of the crime that is unfolding as we sit here  as we speak. Why the limits to the movement  Why is what has been achieved  or what the movement has done  been necessary but not sufficient to the crime  I think there are a couple    there are many reasons    but a couple just to focus on briefly. The first is that the movement  such as it is  stops at America's borders.  It is not a global movement. It does not have too many compatriots abroad who themselves are asking their governments to do more to stop genocide. And the Holocaust culture that we have in this country makes Americans  sort of  more prone to  I think  want to bring Never Again to life. The guilt that the Clinton administration expressed  that Bill Clinton expressed over Rwanda  created a space in our society for a consensus that Rwanda was bad and wrong and we wish we had done more  and that is something that the movement has taken advantage of. European governments  for the most part  haven't acknowledged responsibility  and there's nothing to kind of to push back and up against. So this movement  if it's to be durable and global  will have to cross borders  and you will have to see other citizens in democracies  not simply resting on the assumption that their government would do something in the face of genocide  but actually making it such. Governments will never gravitate towards crimes of this magnitude naturally or eagerly. As we saw  they haven't even gravitated towards protecting our ports or reigning in loose nukes. Why would we expect in a bureaucracy that it would orient itself towards distant suffering  So one reason is it hasn't gone global. The second is  of course  that at this time in particular in America's history  we have a credibility problem  a legitimacy problem in international institutions. It is structurally really  really hard to do  as the Bush administration rightly does  which is to denounce genocide on a Monday and then describe water boarding on a Tuesday as a no brainer and then turn up on Wednesday and look for troop commitments. Now  other countries have their own reasons for not wanting to get involved. Let me be clear. They're in some ways using the Bush administration as an alibi. But it is essential for us to be a leader in this sphere  of course to restore our standing and our leadership in the world. The recovery's going to take some time. We have to ask ourselves  what now  What do we do going forward as a country and as citizens in relationship to the world's worst places  the world's worst suffering  killers  and the kinds of killers that could come home to roost sometime in the future  The place that I turned to answer that question was to a man that many of you may not have ever heard of  and that is a Brazilian named Sergio Vieira de Mello who  as Chris said  was blown up in Iraq in     . He was the victim of the first ever suicide bomb in Iraq. It's hard to remember  but there was actually a time in the summer of       even after the U.S. invasion  where  apart from looting  civilians were relatively safe in Iraq. Now  who was Sergio  Sergio Vieira de Mello was his name. In addition to being Brazilian  he was described to me before I met him in      as someone who was a cross between James Bond on the one hand and Bobby Kennedy on the other. And in the U.N.  you don't get that many people who actually manage to merge those qualities. He was James Bond like in that he was ingenious. He was drawn to the flames  he chased the flames  he was like a moth to the flames. Something of an adrenalin junkie. He was successful with women. He was Bobby Kennedy like because in some ways one could never tell if he was a realist masquerading as an idealist or an idealist masquerading as a realist  as people always wondered about Bobby Kennedy and John Kennedy in that way. What he was was a decathlete of nation building  of problem solving  of troubleshooting in the world's worst places and in the world's most broken places. In failing states  genocidal states  under governed states  precisely the kinds of places that threats to this country exist on the horizon  and precisely the kinds of places where most of the world's suffering tends to get concentrated. These are the places he was drawn to. He moved with the headlines. He was in the U.N. for    years. He joined at the age of   . Started off when the causes in the wars du jour in the '  s were wars of independence and decolonization. He was there in Bangladesh dealing with the outflow of millions of refugees    the largest refugee flow in history up to that point. He was in Sudan when the civil war broke out there. He was in Cyprus right after the Turkish invasion. He was in Mozambique for the War of Independence. He was in Lebanon. Amazingly  he was in Lebanon    the U.N. base was used    Palestinians staged attacks out from behind the U.N. base. Israel then invaded and overran the U.N. base. Sergio was in Beirut when the U.S. Embassy was hit by the first ever suicide attack against the United States. People date the beginning of this new era to       but surely       with the attack on the US Embassy and the Marine barracks    which Sergio witnessed    those are  in fact  in some ways  the dawning of the era that we find ourselves in today. From Lebanon he went to Bosnia in the '  s. The issues were  of course  ethnic sectarian violence. He was the first person to negotiate with the Khmer Rouge. Talk about evil prevailing. I mean  here he was in the room with the embodiment of evil in Cambodia. He negotiates with the Serbs. He actually crosses so far into this realm of talking to evil and trying to convince evil that it doesn't need to prevail that he earns the nickname    not Sergio but Serbio while he's living in the Balkans and conducting these kinds of negotiations. He then goes to Rwanda and to Congo in the aftermath of the genocide  and he's the guy who has to decide    huh  OK  the genocide is over          people have been killed  the people responsible are fleeing into neighboring countries    into Congo  into Tanzania. I'm Sergio  I'm a humanitarian  and I want to feed those    well  I don't want to feed the killers but I want to feed the two million people who are with them  so we're going to go  we're going to set up camps  and we're going to supply humanitarian aid. But  uh oh  the killers are within the camps. Well  I'd like to separate the sheep from the wolves. Let me go door to door to the international community and see if anybody will give me police or troops to do the separation. And their response  of course  was no more than we wanted to stop the genocide and put our troops in harm's way to do that  nor do we now want to get in the way and pluck genocidaires from camps. So then you have to make the decision. Do you turn off the international spigot of life support and risk two million civilian lives  Or do you continue feeding the civilians  knowing that the genocidaires are in the camps  literally sharpening their knives for future battle  What do you do  It's all lesser evil terrain in these broken places. Late '  s  nation building is the cause du jour. He's the guy put in charge. He's the Paul Bremer or the Jerry Bremer of first Kosovo and then East Timor. He governs the places. He's the viceroy. He has to decide on tax policy  on currency  on border patrol  on policing. He has to make all these judgments. He's a Brazilian in these places. He speaks seven languages. He's been up to that point in    war zones so he's positioned to make better judgments  perhaps  than people who have never done that kind of work. But nonetheless  he is the cutting edge of our experimentation with doing good with very few resources being brought to bear in  again  the world's worst places. And then after Timor       has happened  he's named U.N. Human Rights Commissioner  and he has to balance liberty and security and figure out  what do you do when the most powerful country in the United Nations is bowing out of the Geneva Conventions  bowing out of international law  Do you denounce  Well  if you denounce  you're probably never going to get back in the room. Maybe you stay reticent. Maybe you try to charm President Bush    and that's what he did. And in so doing he earned himself  unfortunately  his final and tragic appointment to Iraq    the one that resulted in his death. One note on his death  which is so devastating  is that despite predicating the war on Iraq on a link between Saddam Hussein and terrorism in       believe it or not  the Bush administration or the invaders did no planning  no pre war planning  to respond to terrorism. So Sergio    this receptacle of all of this learning on how to deal with evil and how to deal with brokenness  lay under the rubble for three and a half hours without rescue. Stateless. The guy who tried to help the stateless people his whole career. Like a refugee. Because he represents the U.N. If you represent everyone  in some ways you represent no one. You're un owned. And what the American    the most powerful military in the history of mankind was able to muster for his rescue  believe it or not  was literally these heroic two American soldiers went into the shaft. Building was shaking. One of them had been at      and lost his buddies on September   th  and yet went in and risked his life in order to save Sergio. But all they had was a woman's handbag    literally one of those basket handbags    and they tied it to a curtain rope from one of the offices at U.N. headquarters  and created a pulley system into this shaft in this quivering building in the interests of rescuing this person  the person we most need to turn to now  this shepherd  at a time when so many of us feel like we're lacking guidance. And this was the pulley system. This was what we were able to muster for Sergio. The good news  for what it's worth  is after Sergio and    others were killed that day in the attack on the U.N.  the military created a search and rescue unit that had the cutting equipment  the shoring wood  the cranes  the things that you would have needed to do the rescue. But it was too late for Sergio. I want to wrap up  but I want to close with what I take to be the four lessons from Sergio's life on this question of how do we prevent evil from prevailing  which is how I would have framed the question. Here's this guy who got a    year head start thinking about the kinds of questions we as a country are grappling with  we as citizens are grappling with now. What do we take away  First  I think  is his relationship to  in fact  evil is something to learn from. He  over the course of his career  changed a great deal. He had a lot of flaws  but he was very adaptive. I think that was his greatest quality. He started as somebody who would denounce harmdoers  he would charge up to people who were violating international law  and he would say  you're violating  this is the U.N. Charter. Don't you see it's unacceptable what you're doing  And they would laugh at him because he didn't have the power of states  the power of any military or police. He just had the rules  he had the norms  and he tried to use them. And in Lebanon  Southern Lebanon in '    he said to himself and to everybody else  I will never use the word  unacceptable  again. I will never use it. I will try to make it such  but I will never use that word again. But he lunged in the opposite direction. He started  as I mentioned  to get in the room with evil  to not denounce  and became almost obsequious when he won the nickname Serbio  for instance  and even when he negotiated with the Khmer Rouge would black box what had occurred prior to entering the room. But by the end of his life  I think he had struck a balance that we as a country can learn from. Be in the room  don't be afraid of talking to your adversaries  but don't bracket what happened before you entered the room. Don't black box history. Don't check your principles at the door. And I think that's something that we have to be in the room  whether it's Nixon going to China or Khrushchev and Kennedy or Reagan and Gorbachev. All the great progress in this country with relation to our adversaries has come by going into the room. And it doesn't have to be an act of weakness. You can actually do far more to build an international coalition against a harmdoer or a wrongdoer by being in the room and showing to the rest of the world that that person  that regime  is the problem and that you  the United States  are not the problem. Second take away from Sergio's life  briefly. What I take away  and this in some ways is the most important  he espoused and exhibited a reverence for dignity that was really  really unusual. At a micro level  the individuals around him were visible. He saw them. At a macro level  he thought  you know  we talk about democracy promotion  but we do it in a way sometimes that's an affront to people's dignity. We put people on humanitarian aid and we boast about it because we've spent three billion. It's incredibly important  those people would no longer be alive if the United States  for instance  hadn't spent that money in Darfur  but it's not a way to live. If we think about dignity in our conduct as citizens and as individuals with relation to the people around us  and as a country  if we could inject a regard for dignity into our dealings with other countries  it would be something of a revolution. Third point  very briefly. He talked a lot about freedom from fear. And I recognize there is so much to be afraid of. There are so many genuine threats in the world. But what Sergio was talking about is  let's calibrate our relationship to the threat. Let's not hype the threat  let's actually see it clearly. We have reason to be afraid of melting ice caps. We have reason to be afraid that we haven't secured loose nuclear material in the former Soviet Union. Let's focus on what are the legitimate challenges and threats  but not lunge into bad decisions because of a panic  of a fear. In times of fear  for instance  one of the things Sergio used to say is  fear is a bad advisor. We lunge towards the extremes when we aren't operating and trying to  again  calibrate our relationship to the world around us. Fourth and final point  he somehow  because he was working in all the world's worst places and all lesser evils  had a humility  of course  and an awareness of the complexity of the world around him. I mean  such an acute awareness of how hard it was. How Sisyphean this task was of mending  and yet aware of that complexity  humbled by it  he wasn't paralyzed by it. And we as citizens  as we go through this experience of the kind of  the crisis of confidence  crisis of competence  crisis of legitimacy  I think there's a temptation to pull back from the world and say  ah  Katrina  Iraq    we don't know what we're doing. We can't afford to pull back from the world. It's a question of how to be in the world. And the lesson  I think  of the anti genocide movement that I mentioned  that is a partial success but by no means has it achieved what it has set out to do    it'll be many decades  probably  before that happens    but is that if we want to see change  we have to become the change. We can't rely upon our institutions to do the work of necessarily talking to adversaries on their own without us creating a space for that to happen  for having respect for dignity  and for bringing that combination of humility and a sort of emboldened sense of responsibility to our dealings with the rest of the world. So will evil prevail  Is that the question  I think the short answer is  no  not unless we let it. Thank you. I thought I'd start with telling you or showing you the people who started  Jet Propulsion Lab . When they were a bunch of kids  they were kind of very imaginative  very adventurous  as they were trying at Caltech to mix chemicals and see which one blows up more. Well  I don't recommend that you try to do that now. Naturally  they blew up a shack  and Caltech  well  then  hey  you go to the Arroyo and really do all your tests in there. So  that's what we call our first five employees during the tea break  you know  in here. As I said  they were adventurous people. As a matter of fact  one of them  who was  kind of  part of a cult which was not too far from here on Orange Grove  and unfortunately he blew up himself because he kept mixing chemicals and trying to figure out which ones were the best chemicals. So  that gives you a kind of flavor of the kind of people we have there. We try to avoid blowing ourselves up. This one I thought I'd show you. Guess which one is a JPL employee in the heart of this crowd. I tried to come like him this morning  but as I walked out  then it was too cold  and I said  I'd better put my shirt back on. But more importantly  the reason I wanted to show this picture  look where the other people are looking  and look where he is looking. Wherever anybody else looks  look somewhere else  and go do something different  you know  and doing that. And that's kind of what has been the spirit of what we are doing. And I want to tell you a quote from Ralph Emerson that one of my colleagues  you know  put on my wall in my office  and it says   Do not go where the path may lead. Go instead where there is no path  and leave a trail.  And that's my recommendation to all of you  look what everybody is doing  what they are doing  go do something completely different. Don't try to improve a little bit on what somebody else is doing  because that doesn't get you very far. In our early days we used to work a lot on rockets  but we also used to have a lot of parties  you know. As you can see  one of our parties  you know  a few years ago. But then a big difference happened about    years ago  after Sputnik was launched. We launched the first American satellite  and that's the one you see on the left in there. And here we made     degrees change  we changed from a rocket house to be an exploration house. And that was done over a period of a couple of years  and now we are the leading organization  you know  exploring space on all of your behalf. But even when we did that  we had to remind ourselves  sometimes there are setbacks. So you see  on the bottom  that rocket was supposed to go upward  somehow it ended going sideways. So that's what we call the misguided missile. But then also  just to celebrate that  we started an event at JPL for  Miss Guided Missile.  So  we used to have a celebration every year and select    there used to be competition and parades and so on. It's not very appropriate to do it now. Some people tell me to do it  I think  well  that's not really proper  you know  these days. So  we do something a little bit more serious. And that's what you see in the last Rose Bowl  you know  when we entered one of the floats. That's more on the play side. And on the right side  that's the Rover just before we finished its testing to take it to the Cape to launch it. These are the Rovers up here that you have on Mars now. So that kind of tells you about  kind of  the fun things  you know  and the serious things that we try to do. But I said I'm going to show you a short clip of one of our employees to kind of give you an idea about some of the talent that we have. Video  Morgan Hendry  Beware of Safety is an instrumental rock band. It branches on more the experimental side. There's the improvisational side of jazz. There's the heavy hitting sound of rock. Being able to treat sound as an instrument  and be able to dig for more abstract sounds and things to play live  mixing electronics and acoustics. The music's half of me  but the other half    I landed probably the best gig of all. I work for the Jet Propulsion Lab. I'm building the next Mars Rover. Some of the most brilliant engineers I know are the ones who have that sort of artistic quality about them. You've got to do what you want to do. And anyone who tells you you can't  you don't listen to them. Maybe they're right   I doubt it. Tell them where to put it  and then just do what you want to do. I'm Morgan Hendry. I am NASA. Charles Elachi  Now  moving from the play stuff to the serious stuff  always people ask  why do we explore  Why are we doing all of these missions and why are we exploring them  Well  the way I think about it is fairly simple. Somehow     billion years ago there was a Big Bang  and you've heard a little bit about  you know  the origin of the universe. But somehow what strikes everybody's imagination    or lots of people's imagination    somehow from that original Big Bang we have this beautiful world that we live in today. You look outside  you have all that beauty that you see  all that life that you see around you  and here we have intelligent people like you and I who are having a conversation here. All that started from that Big Bang. So  the question is  How did that happen  How did that evolve  How did the universe form  How did the galaxies form  How did the planets form  Why is there a planet on which there is life which have evolved  Is that very common  Is there life on every planet that you can see around the stars  So we literally are all made out of stardust. We started from those stars  we are made of stardust. So  next time you are really depressed  look in the mirror and you can look and say  hi  I'm looking at a star here. You can skip the dust part. But literally  we are all made of stardust. So  what we are trying to do in our exploration is effectively write the book of how things have came about as they are today. And one of the first  or the easiest  places we can go and explore that is to go towards Mars. And the reason Mars takes particular attention  it's not very far from us. You know  it'll take us only six months to get there. Six to nine months at the right time of the year. It's a planet somewhat similar to Earth. It's a little bit smaller  but the land mass on Mars is about the same as the land mass on Earth  you know  if you don't take the oceans into account. It has polar caps. It has an atmosphere somewhat thinner than ours  so it has weather. So  it's very similar to some extent  and you can see some of the features on it  like the Grand Canyon on Mars  or what we call the Grand Canyon on Mars. It is like the Grand Canyon on Earth  except a hell of a lot larger. So it's about the size  you know  of the United States. It has volcanoes on it. And that's Mount Olympus on Mars  which is a kind of huge volcanic shield on that planet. And if you look at the height of it and you compare it to Mount Everest  you see  it'll give you an idea of how large that Mount Olympus  you know  is  relative to Mount Everest. So  it basically dwarfs  you know  Mount Everest here on Earth. So  that gives you an idea of the tectonic events or volcanic events which have happened on that planet. Recently from one of our satellites  this shows that it's Earth like    we caught a landslide occurring as it was happening. So it is a dynamic planet  and activity is going on as we speak today. And these Rovers  people wonder now  what are they doing today  so I thought I would show you a little bit what they are doing. This is one very large crater. Geologists love craters  because craters are like digging a big hole in the ground without really working at it  and you can see what's below the surface. So  this is called Victoria Crater  which is about a few football fields in size. And if you look at the top left  you see a little teeny dark dot. This picture was taken from an orbiting satellite. If I zoom on it  you can see  that's the Rover on the surface. So  that was taken from orbit  we had the camera zoom on the surface  and we actually saw the Rover on the surface. And we actually used the combination of the satellite images and the Rover to actually conduct science  because we can observe large areas and then you can get those Rovers to move around and basically go to a certain location. So  specifically what we are doing now is that Rover is going down in that crater. As I told you  geologists love craters. And the reason is  many of you went to the Grand Canyon  and you see in the wall of the Grand Canyon  you see these layers. And what these layers    that's what the surface used to be a million years ago     million years ago      million years ago  and you get deposits on top of them. So if you can read the layers it's like reading your book  and you can learn the history of what happened in the past in that location. So what you are seeing here are the layers on the wall of that crater  and the Rover is going down now  measuring  you know  the properties and analyzing the rocks as it's going down  you know  that canyon. Now  it's kind of a little bit of a challenge driving down a slope like this. If you were there you wouldn't do it yourself. But we really made sure we tested those Rovers before we got them down    or that Rover    and made sure that it's all working well. Now  when I came last time  shortly after the landing    I think it was  like  a hundred days after the landing    I told you I was surprised that those Rovers are lasting even a hundred days. Well  here we are four years later  and they're still working. Now you say  Charles  you are really lying to us  and so on  but that's not true. We really believed they were going to last    days or     days  because they are solar powered  and Mars is a dusty planet  so we expected the dust would start accumulating on the surface  and after a while we wouldn't have enough power  you know  to keep them warm. Well  I always say it's important that you are smart  but every once in a while it's good to be lucky. And that's what we found out. It turned out that every once in a while there are dust devils which come by on Mars  as you are seeing here  and when the dust devil comes over the Rover  it just cleans it up. It is like a brand new car that you have  and that's literally why they have lasted so long. And now we designed them reasonably well  but that's exactly why they are lasting that long and still providing all the science data. Now  the two Rovers  each one of them is  kind of  getting old. You know  one of them  one of the wheels is stuck  is not working  one of the front wheels  so what we are doing  we are driving it backwards. And the other one has arthritis of the shoulder joint  you know  it's not working very well  so it's walking like this  and we can move the arm  you know  that way. But still they are producing a lot of scientific data. Now  during that whole period  a number of people got excited  you know  outside the science community about these Rovers  so I thought I'd show you a video just to give you a reflection about how these Rovers are being viewed by people other than the science community. So let me go on the next short video. By the way  this video is pretty accurate of how the landing took place  you know  about four years ago. Video  Okay  we have parachute aligned. Okay  deploy the airbags. Open. Camera. We have a picture right now. Yeah  CE  That's about what happened in the Houston operation room. It's exactly like this. Video  Now  if there is life  the Dutch will find it. What is he doing  What is that  CE  Not too bad. So anyway  let me continue on showing you a little bit about the beauty of that planet. As I said earlier  it looked very much like Earth  so you see sand dunes. It looks like I could have told you these are pictures taken from the Sahara Desert or somewhere  and you'd have believed me  but these are pictures taken from Mars. But one area which is particularly intriguing for us is the northern region  you know  of Mars  close to the North Pole  because we see ice caps  and we see the ice caps shrinking and expanding  so it's very much like you have in northern Canada. And we wanted to find out    and we see all kinds of glacial features on it. So  we wanted to find out  actually  what is that ice made of  and could that have embedded in it some organic  you know  material. So we have a spacecraft which is heading towards Mars  called Phoenix  and that spacecraft will land    days  seven hours and    seconds from now  so you can adjust your watch. So it's on May    around just before five o'clock our time here on the West Coast  actually we will be landing on another planet. And as you can see  this is a picture of the spacecraft put on Mars  but I thought that just in case you're going to miss that show  you know  in    days  I'll show you  kind of  a little bit of what's going to happen. Video  That's what we call the seven minutes of terror. So the plan is to dig in the soil and take samples that we put them in an oven and actually heat them and look what gases will come from it. So this was launched about nine months ago. We'll be coming in at        miles per hour  and in seven minutes we have to stop and touch the surface very softly so we don't break that lander. Ben Cichy  Phoenix is the first Mars Scout mission. It's the first mission that's going to try to land near the North Pole of Mars  and it's the first mission that's actually going to try and reach out and touch water on the surface of another planet. Lynn Craig  Where there tends to be water  at least on Earth  there tends to be life  and so it's potentially a place where life could have existed on the planet in the past. Erik Bailey  The main purpose of EDL is to take a spacecraft that is traveling at        miles an hour and bring it to a screeching halt in a soft way in a very short amount of time. BC  We enter the Martian atmosphere. We're    miles above the surface of Mars. And our lander is safely tucked inside what we call an aeroshell. EB  Looks kind of like an ice cream cone  more or less. BC  And on the front of it is this heat shield  this saucer looking thing that has about a half inch of essentially what's cork on the front of it  which is our heat shield. Now  this is really special cork  and this cork is what's going to protect us from the violent atmospheric entry that we're about to experience. Rob Grover  Friction really starts to build up on the spacecraft  and we use the friction when it's flying through the atmosphere to our advantage to slow us down. BC  From this point  we're going to decelerate from        miles an hour down to     miles an hour. EB  The outside can get almost as hot as the surface of the Sun. RG  The temperature of the heat shield can reach       degrees Fahrenheit. EB  The inside doesn't get very hot. It probably gets about room temperature. Richard Kornfeld  There is this window of opportunity within which we can deploy the parachute. EB  If you fire the 'chute too early  the parachute itself could fail. The fabric and the stitching could just pull apart. And that would be bad. BC  In the first    seconds after we deploy the parachute  we'll decelerate from     miles an hour to a relatively slow     miles an hour. We no longer need the heat shield to protect us from the force of atmospheric entry  so we jettison the heat shield  exposing for the first time our lander to the atmosphere of Mars. LC  After the heat shield has been jettisoned and the legs are deployed  the next step is to have the radar system begin to detect how far Phoenix really is from the ground. BC  We've lost    percent of our entry velocity. So  we're    percent of the way to where we want to be. But that last one percent  as it always seems to be  is the tricky part. EB  Now the spacecraft actually has to decide when it's going to get rid of its parachute. BC  We separate from the lander going     miles an hour at roughly a kilometer above the surface of Mars        feet. That's like taking two Empire State Buildings and stacking them on top of one another. EB  That's when we separate from the back shell  and we're now in free fall. It's a very scary moment  a lot has to happen in a very short amount of time. LC  So it's in a free fall  but it's also trying to use all of its actuators to make sure that it's in the right position to land. EB  And then it has to light up its engines  right itself  and then slowly slow itself down and touch down on the ground safely. BC  Earth and Mars are so far apart that it takes over ten minutes for a signal from Mars to get to Earth. And EDL itself is all over in a matter of seven minutes. So by the time you even hear from the lander that EDL has started it'll already be over. EB  We have to build large amounts of autonomy into the spacecraft so that it can land itself safely. BC  EDL is this immense  technically challenging problem. It's about getting a spacecraft that's hurtling through deep space and using all this bag of tricks to somehow figure out how to get it down to the surface of Mars at zero miles an hour. It's this immensely exciting and challenging problem. CE  Hopefully it all will happen the way you saw it in here. So it will be a very tense moment  you know  as we are watching that spacecraft landing on another planet. So now let me talk about the next things that we are doing. So we are in the process  as we speak  of actually designing the next Rover that we are going to be sending to Mars. So I thought I would go a little bit and tell you  kind of  the steps we go through. It's very similar to what you do when you design your product. As you saw a little bit earlier  when we were doing the Phoenix one  we have to take into account the heat that we are going to be facing. So we have to study all kinds of different materials  the shape that we want to do. In general we don't try to please the customer here. What we want to do is to make sure we have an effective  you know  an efficient kind of machine. First we start by we want to have our employees to be as imaginative as they can. And we really love being close to the art center  because we have  as a matter of fact  one of the alumni from the art center  Eric Nyquist  had put a series of displays  far out displays  you know  in our what we call mission design or spacecraft design room  just to get people to think wildly about things. We have a bunch of Legos. So  as I said  this is a playground for adults  where they sit down and try to play with different shapes and different designs. Then we get a little bit more serious  so we have what we call our CAD CAMs and all the engineers who are involved  or scientists who are involved  who know about thermal properties  know about design  know about atmospheric interaction  parachutes  all of these things  which they work in a team effort and actually design a spacecraft in a computer to some extent  so to see  does that meet the requirement that we need. On the right  also  we have to take into account the environment of the planet where we are going. If you are going to Jupiter  you have a very high radiation  you know  environment. It's about the same radiation environment close by Jupiter as inside a nuclear reactor. So just imagine  you take your P.C. and throw it into a nuclear reactor and it still has to work. So these are kind of some of the little challenges  you know  that we have to face. If we are doing entry  we have to do tests of parachutes. You saw in the video a parachute breaking. That would be a bad day  you know  if that happened  so we have to test  because we are deploying this parachute at supersonic speeds. We are coming at extremely high speeds  and we are deploying them to slow us down. So we have to do all kinds of tests. To give you an idea of the size  you know  of that parachute relative to the people standing there. Next step  we go and actually build some kind of test models and actually test them  you know  in the lab at JPL  in what we call our Mars Yard. We kick them  we hit them  we drop them  just to make sure we understand how  where would they break. And then we back off  you know  from that point. And then we actually do the actual building and the flight. And this next Rover that we're flying is about the size of a car. That big shield that you see outside  that's a heat shield which is going to protect it. And that will be basically built over the next year  and it will be launched June a year from now. Now  in that case  because it was a very big Rover  we couldn't use airbags. And I know many of you  kind of  last time afterwards said well  that was a cool thing to have    those airbags. Unfortunately this Rover is  like  ten times the size of the  you know  mass wise  of the other Rover  or three times the mass. So we can't use airbags. So we have to come up with another ingenious idea of how do we land it. And we didn't want to take it propulsively all the way to the surface because we didn't want to contaminate the surface  we wanted the Rover to immediately land on its legs. So we came up with this ingenious idea  which is used here on Earth for helicopters. Actually  the lander will come down to about     feet and hover above that surface for     feet  and then we have a sky crane which will take that Rover and land it down on the surface. Hopefully it all will work  you know  it will work that way. And that Rover will be more kind of like a chemist. What we are going to be doing with that Rover as it drives around  it's going to go and analyze the chemical composition of rocks. So it will have an arm which will take samples  put them in an oven  crush and analyze them. But also  if there is something that we cannot reach because it is too high on a cliff  we have a little laser system which will actually zap the rock  evaporate some of it  and actually analyze what's coming from that rock. So it's a little bit like  Star Wars   you know  but it's real. It's real stuff. And also to help you  to help the community so you can do ads on that Rover  we are going to train that Rover to actually in addition to do this  to actually serve cocktails  you know  also on Mars. So that's kind of giving you an idea of the kind of  you know  fun things we are doing on Mars. I thought I'd go to  The Lord of the Rings  now and show you some of the things we have there. Now   The Lord of the Rings  has two things played through it. One  it's a very attractive planet    it just has the beauty of the rings and so on. But for scientists  also the rings have a special meaning  because we believe they represent  on a small scale  how the Solar System actually formed. Some of the scientists believe that the way the Solar System formed  that the Sun when it collapsed and actually created the Sun  a lot of the dust around it created rings and then the particles in those rings accumulated together  and they formed bigger rocks  and then that's how the planets  you know  were formed. So  the idea is  by watching Saturn we're actually watching our solar system in real time being formed on a smaller scale  so it's like a test bed for it. So  let me show you a little bit on what that Saturnian system looks like. First  I'm going to fly you over the rings. By the way  all of this is real stuff. This is not animation or anything like this. This is actually taken from the satellite that we have in orbit around Saturn  the Cassini. And you see the amount of detail that is in those rings  which are the particles. Some of them are agglomerating together to form larger particles. So that's why you have these gaps  is because a small satellite  you know  is being formed in that location. Now  you think that those rings are very large objects. Yes  they are very large in one dimension  in the other dimension they are paper thin. Very  very thin. What you are seeing here is the shadow of the ring on Saturn itself. And that's one of the satellites which was actually formed on that one. So  think about it as a paper thin  huge area of many hundreds of thousands of miles  which is rotating. And we have a wide variety of kind of satellites which will form  each one looking very different and very odd  and that keeps scientists busy for tens of years trying to explain this  and telling NASA we need more money so we can explain what these things look like  or why they formed that way. Well  there were two satellites which were particularly interesting. One of them is called Enceladus. It's a satellite which was all made of ice  and we measured it from orbit. Made of ice. But there was something bizarre about it. If you look at these stripes in here  what we call tiger stripes  when we flew over them  all of a sudden we saw an increase in the temperature  which said that those stripes are warmer than the rest of the planet. So as we flew by away from it  we looked back. And guess what  We saw geysers coming out. So this is a Yellowstone  you know  of Saturn. We are seeing geysers of ice which are coming out of that planet  which indicate that most likely there is an ocean  you know  below the surface. And somehow  through some dynamic effect  we're having these geysers which are being  you know  emitted from it. And the reason I showed the little arrow there  I think that should say    miles  we decided a few months ago to actually fly the spacecraft through the plume of that geyser so we can actually measure the material that it is made of. That was  unclear  also    you know  because we were worried about the risk of it  but it worked pretty well. We flew at the top of it  and we found that there is a fair amount of organic material which is being emitted in combination with the ice. And over the next few years  as we keep orbiting  you know  Saturn  we are planning to get closer and closer down to the surface and make more accurate measurements. Now  another satellite also attracted a lot of attention  and that's Titan. And the reason Titan is particularly interesting  it's a satellite bigger than our moon  and it has an atmosphere. And that atmosphere is very    as dense as our own atmosphere. So if you were on Titan  you would feel the same pressure that you feel in here. Except it's a lot colder  and that atmosphere is heavily made of methane. Now  methane gets people all excited  because it's organic material  so immediately people start thinking  could life have evolved in that location  when you have a lot of organic material. So people believe now that Titan is most likely what we call a pre biotic planet  because it's so cold organic material did not get to the stage of becoming biological material  and therefore life could have evolved on it. So it could be Earth  frozen three billion years ago before life actually started on it. So that's getting a lot of interest  and to show you some example of what we did in there  we actually dropped a probe  which was developed by our colleagues in Europe  we dropped a probe as we were orbiting Saturn. We dropped a probe in the atmosphere of Titan. And this is a picture of an area as we were coming down. Just looked like the coast of California for me. You see the rivers which are coming along the coast  and you see that white area which looks like Catalina Island  and that looks like an ocean. And then with an instrument we have on board  a radar instrument  we found there are lakes like the Great Lakes in here  so it looks very much like Earth. It looks like there are rivers on it  there are oceans or lakes  we know there are clouds. We think it's raining also on it. So it's very much like the cycle on Earth except because it's so cold  it could not be water  you know  because water would have frozen. What it turned out  that all that we are seeing  all this liquid   is made of  hydrocarbon and ethane and methane  similar to what you put in your car. So here we have a cycle of a planet which is like our Earth  but is all made of ethane and methane and organic material. So if you were on Mars    sorry  on Titan  you don't have to worry about four dollar gasoline. You just drive to the nearest lake  stick your hose in it  and you've got your car filled up. On the other hand  if you light a match the whole planet will blow up. So in closing  I said I want to close by a couple of pictures. And just to kind of put us in perspective  this is a picture of Saturn taken with a spacecraft from behind Saturn  looking towards the Sun. The Sun is behind Saturn  so we see what we call  forward scattering   so it highlights all the rings. And I'm going to zoom. There is a    I'm not sure you can see it very well  but on the top left  around    o'clock  there is a little teeny dot  and that's Earth. You barely can see ourselves. So what I did  I thought I'd zoom on it. So as you zoom in  you know  you can see Earth  you know  just in the middle here. So we zoomed all the way on the art center. So thank you very much. My name is Ursus Wehrli  and I would like to talk to you this morning about my project  Tidying Up Art. First of all    any questions so far  First of all  I have to say I'm not from around here. I'm from a completely different cultural area  maybe you noticed  I mean  I'm wearing a tie  first. And then secondly  I'm a little bit nervous because I'm speaking in a foreign language  and I want to apologize in advance  for any mistakes I might make. Because I'm from Switzerland  and I just don't hope you think this is Swiss German I'm speaking now here. This is just what it sounds like if we Swiss try to speak American. But don't worry    I don't have trouble with English  as such. I mean  it's not my problem  it's your language after all. I am fine. After this presentation here at TED  I can simply go back to Switzerland  and you have to go on talking like this all the time. So I've been asked by the organizers to read from my book. It's called  Tidying Up Art  and it's  as you can see  it's more or less a picture book. So the reading would be over very quickly. But since I'm here at TED  I decided to hold my talk here in a more modern way  in the spirit of TED here  and I managed to do some slides here for you. I'd like to show them around so we can just  you know    Actually  I managed to prepare for you some enlarged pictures    even better. So Tidying Up Art  I mean  I have to say  that's a relatively new term. You won't be familiar with it. I mean  it's a hobby of mine that I've been indulging in for the last few years  and it all started out with this picture of the American artist  Donald Baechler I had hanging at home. I had to look at it every day and after a while I just couldn't stand the mess anymore this guy was looking at all day long. Yeah  I kind of felt sorry for him. And it seemed to me even he felt really bad facing these unorganized red squares day after day. So I decided to give him a little support  and brought some order into neatly stacking the blocks on top of each other. Yeah. And I think he looks now less miserable. And it was great. With this experience  I started to look more closely at modern art. Then I realized how  you know  the world of modern art is particularly topsy turvy. And I can show here a very good example. It's actually a simple one  but it's a good one to start with. It's a picture by Paul Klee. And we can see here very clearly  it's a confusion of color. Yeah. The artist doesn't really seem to know where to put the different colors. The various pictures here of the various elements of the picture    the whole thing is unstructured. We don't know  maybe Mr. Klee was probably in a hurry  I mean       maybe he had to catch a plane  or something. We can see here he started out with orange  and then he already ran out of orange  and here we can see he decided to take a break for a square. And I would like to show you here my tidied up version of this picture. We can see now what was barely recognizable in the original     red and orange squares are juxtaposed with just two green squares. Yeah  that's great. So I mean  that's just tidying up for beginners. I would like to show you here a picture which is a bit more advanced. What can you say  What a mess. I mean  you see  everything seems to have been scattered aimlessly around the space. If my room back home had looked like this  my mother would have grounded me for three days. So I'd like to    I wanted to reintroduce some structure into that picture. And that's really advanced tidying up. Yeah  you're right. Sometimes people clap at this point  but that's actually more in Switzerland. We Swiss are famous for chocolate and cheese. Our trains run on time. We are only happy when things are in order. But to go on  here is a very good example to see. This is a picture by Joan Miro. And yeah  we can see the artist has drawn a few lines and shapes and dropped them any old way onto a yellow background. And yeah  it's the sort of thing you produce when you're doodling on the phone. And this is my       you can see now the whole thing takes up far less space. It's more economical and also more efficient. With this method Mr. Miro could have saved canvas for another picture. But I can see in your faces that you're still a little bit skeptical. So that you can just appreciate how serious I am about all this  I brought along the patents  the specifications for some of these works  because I've had my working methods patented at the Eidgen ssische Amt f r Geistiges Eigentum in Bern  Switzerland. I'll just quote from the specification.  Laut den Kunstpr fer Dr. Albrecht     It's not finished yet.  Laut den Kunstpr fer Dr. Albrecht G tz von Ohlenhusen wird die Verfahrensweise rechtlich gesch tzt welche die Kunst durch spezifisch aufger umte Regelm ssigkeiten des allgemeinen Formenschatzes neue Wirkungen zu erzielen m glich wird.  Ja  well I could have translated that  but you would have been none the wiser. I'm not sure myself what it means but it sounds good anyway. I just realized it's important how one introduces new ideas to people  that's why these patents are sometimes necessary. I would like to do a short test with you. Everyone is sitting in quite an orderly fashion here this morning. So I would like to ask you all to raise your right hand. Yeah. The right hand is the one we write with  apart from the left handers. And now  I'll count to three. I mean  it still looks very orderly to me. Now  I'll count to three  and on the count of three I'd like you all to shake hands with the person behind you. OK  One  two  three. You can see now  that's a good example  even behaving in an orderly  systematic way can sometimes lead to complete chaos. So we can also see that very clearly in this next painting. This is a painting by the artist  Niki de Saint Phalle. And I mean  in the original it's completely unclear to see what this tangle of colors and shapes is supposed to depict. But in the tidied up version  it's plain to see that it's a sunburnt woman playing volleyball. Yeah  it's a    this one here  that's much better. That's a picture by Keith Haring. I think it doesn't matter. So  I mean  this picture has not even got a proper title. It's called  Untitled  and I think that's appropriate. So  in the tidied up version we have a sort of Keith Haring spare parts shop. This is Keith Haring looked at statistically. One can see here quite clearly  you can see we have    pale green elements  of which one is in the form of a circle. Or here  for example  we have    pink squares with only one pink curve. I mean  that's interesting. One could extend this sort of statistical analysis to cover all Mr. Haring's various works  in order to establish in which period the artist favored pale green circles or pink squares. And the artist himself could also benefit from this sort of listing procedure by using it to estimate how many pots of paint he's likely to need in the future. One can obviously also make combinations. For example  with the Keith Haring circles and Kandinsky's dots. You can add them to all the squares of Paul Klee. In the end  one has a list with which one then can arrange. Then you categorize it  then you file it  put that file in a filing cabinet  put it in your office and you can make a living doing it. Yeah  from my own experience. So I'm    Actually  I mean  here we have some artists that are a bit more structured. It's not too bad. This is Jasper Johns. We can see here he was practicing with his ruler. But I think it could still benefit from more discipline. And I think the whole thing adds up much better if you do it like this. And here  that's one of my favorites. Tidying up Rene Magritte    this is really fun. You know  there is a    I'm always being asked what inspired me to embark on all this. It goes back to a time when I was very often staying in hotels. So once I had the opportunity to stay in a ritzy  five star hotel. And you know  there you had this little sign    I put this little sign outside the door every morning that read   Please tidy room.  I don't know if you have them over here. So actually  my room there hasn't been tidied once daily  but three times a day. So after a while I decided to have a little fun  and before leaving the room each day I'd scatter a few things around the space. Like books  clothes  toothbrush  etc. And it was great. By the time I returned everything had always been neatly returned to its place. But then one morning  I hang the same little sign onto that picture by Vincent van Gogh. And you have to say this room hadn't been tidied up since     . And when I returned it looked like this. Yeah  at least it is now possible to do some vacuuming. OK  I mean  I can see there are always people that like reacting that one or another picture hasn't been properly tidied up. So we can make a short test with you. This is a picture by Rene Magritte  and I'd like you all to inwardly    like in your head  that is    to tidy that up. So it's possible that some of you would make it like this. Yeah  I would actually prefer to do it more this way. Some people would make apple pie out of it. But it's a very good example to see that the whole work was more of a handicraft endeavor that involved the very time consuming job of cutting out the various elements and sticking them back in new arrangements. And it's not done  as many people imagine  with the computer  otherwise it would look like this. So now I've been able to tidy up pictures that I've wanted to tidy up for a long time. Here is a very good example. Take Jackson Pollock  for example. It's    oh  no  it's    that's a really hard one. But after a while  I just decided here to go all the way and put the paint back into the cans. Or you could go into three dimensional art. Here we have the fur cup by Meret Oppenheim. Here I just brought it back to its original state. But yeah  and it's great  you can even go  you know    Or we have this pointillist movement for those of you who are into art. The pointillist movement is that kind of paintings where everything is broken down into dots and pixels. And then I    this sort of thing is ideal for tidying up. So I once applied myself to the work of the inventor of that method  Georges Seurat  and I collected together all his dots. And now they're all in here. You can count them afterwards  if you like. You see  that's the wonderful thing about the tidy up art idea  it's new. So there is no existing tradition in it. There is no textbooks  I mean  not yet  anyway. I mean  it's  the future we will create.  But to round things up I would like to show you just one more. This is the village square by Pieter Bruegel. That's how it looks like when you send everyone home. Yeah  maybe you're asking yourselves where old Bruegel's people went  Of course  they're not gone. They're all here. I just piled them up. So I'm    yeah  actually I'm kind of finished at that moment. And for those who want to see more  I've got my book downstairs in the bookshop. And I'm happy to sign it for you with any name of any artist. But before leaving I would like to show you  I'm working right now on another    in a related field with my tidying up art method. I'm working in a related field. And I started to bring some order into some flags. Here    that's just my new proposal here for the Union Jack. And then maybe before I leave you ... yeah  I think  after you have seen that I have to leave anyway. Yeah  that was a hard one. I couldn't find a way to tidy that up properly  so I just decided to make it a little bit more simpler. Thank you very much. Welcome to        feet. Let me explain why we are here and why some of you have a pine cone close to you. Once upon a time  I did a book called  How Buildings Learn.  Today's event you might call  How Mountains Teach.  A little background  For    years I've been trying to figure out how to hack civilization so that we can get long term thinking to be automatic and common instead of difficult and rare    or in some cases  non existent. It would be helpful if humanity got into the habit of thinking of the now not just as next week or next quarter  but you know  next        years and the last        years    basically civilization's story so far. So we have the Long Now Foundation in San Francisco. It's an incubator for about a dozen projects  all having to do with continuity over the long term. Our core project is a rather ambitious folly    I suppose  a mythic undertaking  to build a        year clock that can really keep good time for that long a period. And the design problems of a project like that are just absolutely delicious. Go to the clock. And what we have here is something many of you saw here three years ago. It's the first working prototype of the clock. It's about nine feet high. Designed by Danny Hillis and Alexander Rose. It's presently in London  and is ticking away very deliberately at the science museum there. So the design problem for today is going to be  how do you house an eventual monumental clock like this so it can really tick  save time beautifully for     centuries  Well  this was the first solution. Alexander Rose came up with this idea of a spiraloid tower with continuous sloping ramps. And it looked like a way to go  until you start thinking about  what does deep time do to a building  Well  this is what deep time does to a building. This is the Parthenon. It's only       years old  and look what happened to it. Here's a beautiful project. They really knew it'd last forever  because they'd build it out of absolutely huge stones. And now it's a pathetic ruin and no one even knows what it was used for. That's what happens to buildings. They're vulnerable. Even the most durable and intactable buildings  like the pyramids of Giza  are in bad shape when you look up close. They've been looted inside and out. And they're built to protect things but they don't protect things. So we got to thinking  if you can't put things safely in a building  where can you safely put them  We thought  OK  underground. How about underground with a view  Underground in a place that's really solid. So the obvious answer was  we need a mountain. You don't want just any mountain. You need absolutely the right mountain if you're going to have a clock for        years. So here's an image of the long view of the search problem. And we got to thinking for various reasons it ought to be a desert mountain  so we got looking in the dry areas of the Southwest. We looked at mesas in New Mexico. We were looking at dead volcanoes in Arizona. Then Roger Kennedy  who was the director of the National Parks Service  led us to Eastern Nevada  to America's newest and oldest national park  which is called Great Basin National Park. It's right on the eastern border of Nevada. It's the highest range in the state    over        feet. And you'll notice that on the left  on the left  on the west  it's very steep  and on the right it's gentle. This place is remote. It's over     miles from any major city. It's nowhere near any Interstate or railroad. And it's    the only thing that goes by is what's called America's loneliest highway  U.S.   . Now  inside the yellow line here  on the right is    that's all national park. Inside the green line is national forest. And then over to the left is Bureau of Land Management land and some private land. Now  as it happened  that two mile long strip right in the middle  this vertical  was available because it was private land. And thanks to Jay Walker who was here and Mitch Kapor who was here  who started the process  Long Now was able to get that two mile long strip of land. And now let's look at the grand truth of what's there. We're in Pole Canyon  looking west up the western escarpment of Mount Washington  which is        feet on top. Those white cliffs are a dense Cambrian limestone. That's a       foot thick formation  and it might be a beautiful place to hide a clock. It would be a pilgrimage to get to it  it would be a serious hike to get up to where the clock is. So last June  the Long Now board  some staff and some donors and advisors  made a two week expedition to the mountain to explore it and investigate  one  if it's the right mountain  and two  if it's the right mountain  how it might actually work for us. Now Danny Hillis sort of framed the problem. He has a theory of how the overall clock experience should work. It's what he calls the seven stages of a mythic adventure. It starts with the image. The image is a picture you have in your mind of the goal at the end of the journey. In this case it might well be an image of the clock. Then there's the point of embarkation  that is  the point of transition from ordinary life to being a pilgrim on a quest. Then    this is a nice image of it  there's the labyrinth. The labyrinth is a concept  it's like a twilight zone  it's a place where it's difficult  where you get disoriented  maybe you get scared    but you have to go through it if you're going to get to some kind of deep reintegration. Then there should always be in sight the draw    a kind of a beacon that draws you on through the labyrinth to finish the process of getting there. Now Brian Eno  who's been in the thick of the Long Now process  spent two years making a C.D. called  January        and it's  Bell Studies for the Clock of the Long Now.  Based on    parts of it are based on an algorithm that Danny Hillis developed  so that a peal of    bells makes a different peal every day for        years. The Hillis algorithm.    factorial gives you that number. And in fact  pretty soon we'll hear the sound. January     . There it is. OK  back to Danny's list. Number five of the seven is the payoff. This is it. The climax. The goal. The main thing that you're trying to get to. And then Danny says a really great journey will have a secret payoff. Something you didn't expect that caps what you did expect. Then there's the return. You've got to have a gradual return to the ordinary world  so you have time to assimilate what you've learned. And then  how about a memento  Number seven. At the end of it there's something physical  a kind of reward that you take away. It might be a piece of a core drill of the mountain. Something that's just yours. How do you study a mountain for the kinds of things we're talking about  This is not a normal building project. What do you look for  What are the elements that will most affect your ideas and decisions  Start with borders. If you look on the left side of the cliffs here  that's national park. That's sacrosanct    you can't do anything with that. To the right of it is national forest. There's possibilities. The borders are important. Other elements were mines  weather  approaches and elevation. And especially trees. Look at those things up on top there. It turns out that Mount Washington is covered with bristlecone pines. They're the world's oldest living thing. People think they're just the size of shrubs  but that's not actually true. There are trees on that mountain that are       years old and still living. The wood is so solid it's like stone  and it lasts for a long time. So when you do tree ring studies of trunks that are on the mountain  some of them go back        years. The stone itself is absolutely beautiful  sculpted by millennia of very tough winters up there. We had tree ring analysts from the University of Arizona join us on the expedition. Now  if you guys have a pine cone handy  now's a good time to put it in your hand and feel it  especially on the end. That's interesting. You'll find out why it's called a bristlecone pine. A little sensory experience. Here's Danny Hillis in the midst of a bristlecone pine forest on Long Now land. I should say that the age of bristlecones was discovered  led by a theory. Edmund Schulman in the     s had been studying trees under great stress at Timberline  and came to the realization that he put in an article in Science magazine called   Longevity under Adversity in Conifers.  And then  based on that principle  he started looking around at the various trees at Timberline  and realized that the bristlecone pines    he found some in the White Mountains that were over       years old. Longevity under adversity is a pretty interesting design principle in its own right. OK  onto the mines. The first asking price for the property when we looked at it in      was one billion dollars for     acres and a couple of mines. Because the owner said   There's one billion dollars of beryllium in that mountain.  And we said   Wow  that's great. Listen  we'll counter. How about zero  And we're a non profit foundation  you can give us the property and take a hell of a tax deduction. All you have to do is prove to the government it's worth a billion dollars.  Well  a few years went by and there was some kind of back and forth  and by and by  thanks to Mitch and Jay  we were able to buy the whole property for         dollars. This is one of the mines. It doesn't have any beryllium in it. It's called the Pole Adit. And it does have tungsten  a little bit of tungsten  left over  that's the kind of mine it was. But it goes a mile and a half in a straight line  due east into the range  into very interesting territory    except that  as you'll see when we go inside in a minute  we were hoping for limestone but in there is just shale. And shale is not quite completely competent rock. Competent rock is rock that will hold itself up without any shoring. The shale would like some shoring  and so parts of it are caved in in there. That's Ben Roberts from    he's the bat specialist from the National Park. But there are many wonders back in there  like this weird fungus on some of the collapsed timbers. OK  here's another mine that's up on top of the property  and it dates back to     . That's what the property was originally built around    it was a set of mining claims. It was a very productive silver mine. In fact  it was the highest operating mine in Nevada  and it ran year round. You can imagine what it was like in the winter at        feet. You may recognize a couple of the miners there. There's Jeff Bezos on the right and Paul Saville on the left looking for galena  which is the lead silver thing. They didn't find any. They both kept their day jobs. Here's the last mine. It's called the Bonanza Adit. It's down in a canyon. And Alexander Rose on the left there worked with a bunch of people from the National Park to survey the whole mine. It's a mile deep. And they also found four species of bats in there. Now  almost all those mines  by the way  meet underneath the mountain. They don't quite  but it's something to think about. They don't quite meet. Let's go to weather. Mountains specialize in interesting weather. Way more interesting than Monterey even today. And so one Tuesday morning last June  there we were. Woke up in the morning    the mountain was covered with snow. That was a great time to go up and visit our weather station which again  thanks to Mitch Kapor  we're building up there. And it's a pretty interesting scene. This is  on the left there  the joyful lady is Pat Irwin  who's the regional head of the National Forest Service  and they gave us the temporary use permit to be there. We want a temporary use permit for the clock  eventually           year temporary use permit. The weather station's pretty interesting. Kurt Bollacker and Alexander Rose designed a radically wireless station. It runs on solar  and it sends a signal with that antenna and bounces it off of micrometeorite trails in the atmosphere to a place in Bozeman  Montana  where the data is taken down and then sent through landlines to San Francisco  where we put the data in real time up on our website. And there you see a week of weather at       feet on Mount Washington. Let's go to approaches. As it happens  there are no trails anywhere on Mount Washington  just a few old mining roads like this  so you have to bushwhack everywhere. But there's no bears  and there's no poison oak  and there's basically no people because this place has been empty for a long time. You can hike for days and not encounter anybody. Well  here's a potential approach. You need to come up the Lincoln Canyon. It's this beautiful world all of its own  surrounded by cliffs  and it's an easy hike to stroll up the canyon bottom  until you get to this barrier  and it actually presents a problem. So you can scratch Lincoln Canyon as an approach. Another possible approach is right up the western front of the mountain. You can see why we sometimes call it Long Mountain. And from where you're standing at       feet in the valley  it's an easy hike up to the mature pinyon and juniper forest through that knoll at the front at       feet. And you can carry right on up through meadows and steepening forest to the high base of the cliffs at        feet  where there's a bit of a problem. Now  Jeff Bezos advised us when he left at the end of the expedition   Make the clock inaccessible. The harder it is to get to  the more people will value it.  And check    those are     foot vertical walls there. So Alexander Rose wanted to explore this route  and he started over here on the left from his pickup truck at       feet and headed up the mountain. Now  as you gain elevation your IQ goes down    but your emotional affect goes up  which is great for having a mythic experience  whether you want to or not. In fact  Danny Hillis can estimate altitude by how much math he can't do in his head. Now  I happened to be on the radio with Alexander when he got to this point at the base of the cliffs  and he said  quote   There's a hidden notch. I think I can get up a ways.  Now  he's a rock climber  but you know  he's our executive director. I don't want him killed. I know he's going to love cliffs. I'm saying   Be careful  be careful  be careful.  Then he starts going up  and the next thing I hear is   I'm half way up. It's like climbing stairs. I'm going up    degrees. It's a secret passage. It's like something from Tolkien.  And I'm going   Careful  careful. Please be careful.  And then  of course  the next thing I hear is   I've made it to the top. You can see all of creation from up here.  And he dashed across the top of the mountains. In fact  there he is. That's Alexander Rose. First ascent of the western face to Mount Washington  and a solo ascent at that. This discovery changed everything about our sense of these cliffs and what to do with them. We realized that we had to name this thing that Alexander discovered. How about Zander's Crevice  No. So we finally decided on Alexander's Siq. Zander's Siq is named after    some of you have been to Petra  there's this wonderful slot canyon that leads into Petra called the Siq  and so this is the Siq. And it really is hidden. I can't find it in this image  and I'm not sure you can. Only when you get fresh snow can you see just along the rim there  and that brings it out. Now  Danny and I were up at this same area one day  and Danny looked over to the right and noticed something halfway up the cliffs  which is a kind of a porch or a cliff shelf with bristlecones on it  and supposed that people going up to the clock inside the mountain could come out onto that shelf and look down at the view. And the people toiling up the mountain could see them  these tiny little people up there  incredibly halfway up the cliff. How did they get there  Do I have to do that  And so that maybe becomes part of the draw and part of the labyrinth. You can get another angle on Danny's porch by going around to the south and looking north at the whole formation there. And you need to know that Danny's clock is to be kept accurate by a ray of sunshine  that perfect noon hitting it every sunny day  and the pulse of heat from that sets off a solar trigger which resets the clock to make it perfectly accurate. So even with the slowing of the rotation of the earth and so on  the clock will keep perfectly good time. So here we're looking from the south  look north. This is all Forest Service land. If you go up on top of those cliffs  that's some of the Long Now land in those trees. And if you go up there and look back  then you'll get a sense of what the view starts to be like from the top of the mountain. That's the long view. That's    miles to the horizon. And that's also timberline and those bristlecones really are shrubs. That's a different place to be. It's        feet and it's exquisite. Now  if you go over to the right from this image to looking at the edge of the cliffs  it's     foot  just about a yard to the left of Kurt Bollacker's foot  there is a     foot drop. He's ambling on over to Zander's Siq. That's what it looks like looking down it. We should probably put in a rail or something. Over on the eastern side it's gentle  as you can see. And that's not snow    that's what the white limestone looks like. You also see there a bighorn sheep. Their herd was reintroduced from Wyoming. And they're doing pretty well  but they've got a bit of trouble. This is Danny Hillis  and he's figuring out a design problem. he's trying to determine if where he is on a bit of Long Now land would appear from down in the valley to be the actual peak of the mountain. because the real peak is hidden around the corner. This is what in the infantry we used to call the military crest. And as it turned out the answer is  yes  that is from down below in the valley it does look like the peak  and that might be conjured with. We gradually realized we have three serious design domains to work on with this. One is the experience of the mountain. Another is the experience in the mountain. And the third is the experience from the mountain  which is really dominated by the view shed of the spring valley there behind Danny  and if you look off to the right  out there     miles across to the Schell Creek range. In the front  there are    ranches strung right along the base of the mountains using the water from the mountains. In fact  there are artesian wells where water springs right into the air. One of the ranches is called the Kirkeby Ranch  and I'll take you there for a minute. It's a very nice ranch. Alfalfa and cattle  run by Paul and Ronnie Brenham  and it's pretty idyllic. It's also hard work. And most of these ranches are having trouble keeping going. This is their view to the west of the Schell Creek range. And if you go out to that line of trees at the far end  you'll see what the valley used to look like. This is Rocky Mountain junipers that have been there for thousands of years. And a scheme emerged that Long Now is looking to see if it might be possible to buy up the whole valley  because those    ranches with their        acres dominate a     square mile valley with their grazing allotments and so on  and there's a possibility that you could get the whole thing for five million dollars and gradually restore it to its wild condition  and somewhere in the process turn it back over to the National Park  and it would double the size of Great Basin National Park. That would be swell. OK  let's take one more look at the mountain itself. The clock experience should be profound  but from the outside it should be invisible. Now  at the base of the high cliffs there's this natural cave. It's only about    feet deep  but what if it were deepened from inside  You excavated from somewhere  came up from inside and deepened it. And then you could have an entrance which was very rough and narrow as you first went in  that gradually becomes more refined and then actually quite exquisite. And this stone takes a perfect polish. You'd have a polished set of passages and chambers in there eventually leading to the        year clock. And it's not a mine. This would be a nuanced evocation of the basic structure of the mountain  and you would be appreciating it as much from inside as you do from outside. This is architecture not made by building  but by what you very carefully take away. So that's what the mountain taught us. Most of the amazingness of the clock we can borrow from the amazingness of the mountain. All we have to do is highlight its spectacular features and blend in with them. It's not a clock in a mountain    it's a mountain clock. Now  the Tewa Indians in the Southwest have a saying for what you need to do when you want to think long term about anything. They say   pin peya obe     welcome to the mountain. Thank you. I have  like  a thing about sleeping. I don't sleep that much  and I've come to this thing about  like  not sleeping much as being a great virtue  after years of kind of battling it as being a terrible detriment  or something. And now I really like sort of sitting up  you know. But for years I've been sitting up and I think that  like  my creativity is greatly motivated by this kind of insomnia. I lie awake. I think thoughts. I walk aimlessly. Sometimes I used to walk more at night. I walk during the day and I follow people who I think look interesting. And sometimes    actually  once it was on Page Six in the Post  that I was cruising this guy  like  sort of  whatever  but I was actually just following because he had these really great shoes on. And so I was following this guy. And I took a picture of his shoes  and we thanked each other and just went on our way. But I do that all the time. As a matter of fact  I think a lot of my design ideas come from mistakes and tricks of the eye. Because I feel like  you know  there are so many images out there  so many clothes out there. And the only ones that look interesting to me are the ones that look slightly mistaken  of course  or very  very surprising. And often  I'm driving in a taxi and I see a hole in a shirt  or something that looks very interesting or pretty or functional in some way that I'd never seen happen before. And so I'd make the car stop  and I'd get out of the car and walk  and see that in fact there wasn't a hole  but it was a trick of my eye  it was a shadow  you know. Or if there was a hole I'd think like  oh damn  there was actually someone thought of that thought already. Someone made that mistake already so I can't do it anymore. I don't know where inspiration comes from. It does not come for me from research. I don't get necessarily inspired by research. As a matter of fact  one of the most fun things I've ever  ever done in my whole life  was this Christmas season at the Guggenheim in New York. I read  Peter and the Wolf  with this beautiful band from Juilliard. And I did like  you know  the narrator  and I read it. And I saw this really smart critic who I love. This woman  Joan Acocella  who's a friend of mine  and she came backstage and she said  oh  you know  Isaac  did you know that  talking about Stalinism and talking about  you know  like the '  s in Russia. And I said  how do I know about Stalinism  I know about a wolf and a bird and  you know  he ate the bird  and then in the end you hear  you know  you hear the bird squeaking  or something  you know  So I don't really know that. I don't really    actually I do my own kind of research  you know. If I'm commissioned to do the costumes for an   th century opera  or something like that  I will do a lot of research  because it's interesting  not because it's what I'm supposed to do. I'm very  very  very inspired by movies. The color of movies and the way light makes the colors  light from behind the projection  or light from the projection  makes the colors look so impossible. And anyway  roll this little clip  I'll just show you. I sit up at night and I watch movies and I watch women in movies a lot. And I think about  you know  their roles  and about how you have to  like  watch what your daughters look at. Because I look at the way women are portrayed all the time. Whether they're kind of glorified in this way  or whether they're kind of  you know  ironically glorified  or whether they're  you know  sort of denigrated  or ironically denigrated. I go back to color all the time. Color is something that motivates me a lot. It's rarely color that I find in nature  although  you know  juxtaposed next to artificial color  natural color is so beautiful. So that's what I do. I study color a lot. But for the most part  I think  like  how can I ever make anything that is as beautiful as that image of Natalie Wood  How can I ever make anything as beautiful as Greta Garbo  I mean  that's just not possible  you know. And so that's what makes me lie awake at night  I guess  you know. I want to show you    I'm also like a big    I go to astrologers and tarot card readers often  and that's another thing that motivates me a lot. People say  oh  do that. An astrologer tells me to do something. So I do it. When I was about     an astrologer told me that I was going to meet the man of my dreams  and that his name was going to be Eric  right  So  you know  for years I would go to bars and  sort of  anyone I met whose name was Eric I was humping immediately  or something. And there were times when I was actually so desperate I would just  you know  walk into a room and just go like   Eric   And anybody who would turn around I would  sort of  make a beeline for. And I had this really interesting tarot reading a long time ago. The last card he pulled  which was representing my destiny was this guy on like a straw boater with a cane and you know  sort of spats and this  you know  a minstrel singer  right  I want to show you this clip because I do this kind of crazy thing where I do a cabaret act. So actually  check this out. Very embarrassing. The name of the show is based on this story that I have to tell you about my mother. It's sort of an excerpt from a quote of hers. I was dating this guy  right  And this has to do with being happy  I swear. I was dating this guy and it was going on for about a year  right. And we were getting serious  so we decided to invite them all to dinner  our parents. And we  you know  sort of introduced them to each other. My mother was  sort of  very sensitive to his mother  who it seemed was a little bit skeptical about the whole alternative lifestyle thing. You know  homosexuality  right  So my mother was a little offended. She turned to her and she said   Are you kidding  They have the greatest life together. They eat out  they see shows.  They eat out  they see shows. That's the name of the show  they eat out  they    that's on my tombstone when I die.  He ate out  he saw shows   right  So in editing these clips  I didn't have the audacity to edit a clip of me singing at Joe's Pub. So you'll have to  like  go check it out and come see me or something. Because it's mortifying  and yet it feels ... I don't know how to put this. I feel as little comfort as possible is a good thing  you know. And at least  you know  in my case  because if I just do one thing all the time  I don't know  I get very  very bored. I bore very easily. And you know  I don't say that I do everything well  I just say that I do a lot of things  that's all. And I kind of try not to look back  you know. Except  I guess  that's what staying up every night is about. Like  looking back and thinking  what a fool you made of yourself  you know. But I guess that's okay. Right  Because if you do many things you get to feel lousy about everything  and not just one  you know. You don't master feeling lousy about one thing. Yeah  exactly. I will show you this next thing  speaking of costumes for operas. I do work with different choreographers. I work with Twyla Tharp a lot  and I work with Mark Morris a lot  who is one of my best friends. And I designed three operas with him  and the most recent one   King Arthur.  I'd been very ingrained in the dance world since I was a teenager. I went to performing arts high school  where I was an actor. And many of my friends were ballet dancers. Again  I don't know where inspiration comes from. I don't know where it comes from. I started making puppets when I was a kid. Maybe that's where the whole inspiration thing started from  puppets  right. And then performing arts high school. There I was in high school  meeting dancers and acting. And somehow  from there  I got interested in design. I went to Parsons School of Design and then I began my career as a designer. I don't really think of myself as a designer  I don't really think of myself necessarily as a fashion designer. And frankly  I don't really know what to call myself. I think of myself as a ... I don't know what I think of myself as. It's just that. But I must say  this whole thing about being slightly bored all the time  that is what    I think that is a very important thing for a fashion designer. You always have to be slightly bored with everything. And if you're not  you have to pretend to be slightly bored with everything. But I am really a little bored with everything. I always say to my partner  Marisa Gardini  who books everything    she books everything and she makes everything happen. And she makes all the deals. And I always tell her that I find myself with a lot of time on the computer bridge program. Too much time on computer bridge  which is  you know  like that's so ... somehow  like  about ten years ago I thought that the most unboring place in the world would be like a T.V. studio  like for a day show. Some kind of day talk show. Because it's all of these things that I love all kind of in one place. And if you ever get bored you can look at another thing  and do another thing and talk about it  right  And so I had this T.V. show. And that was a very  very  very big part of my process. Actually  could you roll the clip  please  This is one of my favorite clips of Rosie. Hi there. Rosie O'Donnell  Hello  Ben. IM  Look how cute she looks with this  just a slick back. Man  Her grandmother says   Delish   IM  Ah  wow  delish. All right. So now where should I position myself  I want to stay out of the way. I don't want to be    okay. Here we go. Do you get nervous  Ashleigh  Ashleigh  Doing what  ROD  Cutting hair. A  Cutting hair  Never  never. I don't think there was ever a day where I cut hair I was nervous. IM  You look so cute already  by the way. ROD  You like it  All right. IM  Do you have a problem with looking cute  You want to look cute. ROD  Of course I want to look cute. IM  Just checking  because some people want to look  you know  aggressively ugly. ROD  No  not me  no. IM  You read about all these people who have a lot of money and they have kids and the kids always end up somehow  like  really messed up  you know what I mean  And there's got to be some way to do that  Rosie. Because just because if you're fabulously rich  and fabulously famous  does that mean you shouldn't have kids  because you know they're going to end up getting messed up  ROD  No  but it means that your priority has to be their well being first  I think. But you have to make the decision for yourself. My kids are seven  who the hell knows. They're going to be like    and in rehab. And they're going to be playing this clip   I'm such a good mother.  My God  this is the shortest I've ever had. IM  It looks good  yeah  A  I was going to ask you  has your hair ever been    ROD  No  It's all right    go crazy. IM  I feel like it needs to be a little closer down here. A  Oh no  we're just staging  ROD  We're just staging it. IM  Are you freaking out  You look so cute. ROD  No  I love it. It's the new me. IM  Oh  it's so fabulous  ROD  Flock of Rosie. Wooo  IM  So by the way. Of all the most unboring things in the world  right. I mean  like making someone who's already cute look terrible like that. That is not boring. That is nothing if it's not boring. Actually  I read this great quote the other day  which was   Style makes you feel great because it takes your mind off the fact that you're going to die.  Right  And then I realized  that was on my website  and then it said  like  you know  the quote was attributed to me and I thought  oh  I said something  you know  in an interview. I forgot that I said that. But it's really true. I want to show you this last clip because it's going to be my last goodbye. I'll tell you that I cook a lot also. I love to cook. And I often look at things as though they're food. Like I say  oh  you know  would you serve a rotten chicken  Then how could you serve  you know  a beat up old dress or something. How could you show a beat up old dress  I always relate things to kitchen ry. And so I think that's what it all boils down to. Everything boils down to that. So check this out. This is what I've been doing because I think it's the most fun thing in the world. It's  like  this website. It's got a lot of different things on it. It's a polymathematical website. We actually shoot segments like T.V. show segments. And it's kind of my favorite thing in the world. And it just began like in the beginning of February. So who knows  And again  I don't say it's good  I just think it's not boring  right  And here is the last bit. Chef  Do you  IM  Yeah  but I can never find buttermilk  ever. Chef  Oh. IM  You can't find buttermilk at Citarella  you can't find buttermilk. Chef  You can't  IM  It's always low fat buttermilk. Chef  No  but that's all it is. IM  Is that all it is  Chef  Oh  you don't know  Let me tell you something. Let me tell you something interesting. IM  You know what  Stop laughing. It's not funny. Just because I don't know that whole    that there's no such thing as whole buttermilk. Sorry  what  Chef  Well  here's the deal. Let me tell you the deal. In the old days when they used to make butter  you know how you make butter  IM  Churns  Chef  For cream  IM  Yeah  exactly. Chef  So you take heavy  high fat milk  which is cream  and you churn it until it separates into these curds and water. The liquid is actually that clear liquid. If you've ever overbeaten your whipped cream  it's actually buttermilk. And that's what it was in the early days. And that's what people used for baking and all sorts of things. Now  the buttermilk that you get is actually low fat or skim milk. IM  Excuse me  I didn't know. All right  Chef  The reason he thought that is because buttermilk is so wonderfully thick and delicious. IM  Yeah  it is  exactly. So who would think that it was low fat  Well  that's it. Thank you very much. Happy TED. It's so wonderful here. I love it. I love it. I love it. Thanks. Bye. I have a story  a story that I would like to share with you. And it's an African story. It is a story of hope  resilience and glamour. There was Hollywood. Then came Bollywood. Today we have Nollywood  the third largest film industry in the world. In      alone  almost       films were made in Nigeria. Now  try to imagine        films wrapped  distributed  every week in the streets of Lagos  Nigeria and West Africa. Some estimates put the value of this industry at     million dollars. It has created thousands  if not tens of thousands of jobs. And it's expanding. But keep in mind that this was a grassroots movement. This is something that happened without foreign investment  without government aid  and actually  it happened against all odds  in one of the most difficult moments in Nigerian economy. The industry is    years old. And so maybe you're thinking now  why  how  an Italian filmmaker based in Boston is so interested in this story  And so I think I have to tell you just a few words  a few things about my personal life  because I think there is a connection. My grandfather lived most of his life and is buried in Zambia. My father also lived most of his adult life in East Africa. And I was born in Zambia. Even though I left when I was only three years old  I really felt that Africa was this big part of my life. And it really was a place where I learned to walk. I think I uttered the first words  and my family bought their first home. So when we came back to Italy  and one of the things that I remember the most is my family having this hard time to share stories. It seemed that for our neighbors and friends  Africa was either this exotic place  this imaginary land that probably exists only in their imagination  or the place of horror  famine. And so we were always caught in this stereotype. And I remember really this desire to talk about Africa as a place where we lived and people live and go about their lives  and have dreams like we all have. So when I read in a newspaper in the business page the story of Nollywood  I really felt this is an incredible opportunity to tell a story that goes against all these preconceived notions. Here I can tell a story of Africans making movies like I do  and actually I felt this was an inspiration for me. I have the good fortune of being a filmmaker in residence at the Center of Digital Imaging Arts at Boston University. And we really look how digital technology is changing  and how young  independent filmmakers can make movies at a fraction of the cost. So when I proposed the story  I really had all the support to make this film. And not only had the support  I found two wonderful partners in crime in this adventure. Aimee Corrigan  a very talented and young photographer  and Robert Caputo  a friend and a mentor  who is a veteran of National Geographic  and told me   You know  Franco  in    years of covering Africa  I don't know if I have come across a story that is so full of hope and so fun.  So we went to Lagos in October     . And we went to Lagos to meet Bond Emeruwa  a wonderful  talented film director who is with us tonight. The plan was to give you a portrait of Nollywood  of this incredible film industry  following Bond in his quest to make an action movie that deals with the issue of corruption  called  Checkpoint.  Police corruption. And he had nine days to make it. We thought this was a good story. In the meantime  we had to cover Nollywood  and we talked to a lot of filmmakers. But I don't want to create too many expectations. I would like to show you six minutes. And these are six minutes they really prepared for the TED audience. There are several themes from the documentary  but they are re edited and made for you  OK  So I guess it's a world premier. Man  Action. Milverton Nwokedi  You cut a nice movie with just        dollars in Nigeria here. And you shoot in seven days. Peace Piberesima  We're doing films for the masses. We're not doing films for the elite and the people in their glass houses. They can afford to watch their  Robocop  and whatever. Mahmood Ali Balogun  I think filmmaking in Nigeria  for those who work in it  is a kind of subsistence filmmaking    what they do to make a living. It's not the fancy filmmaking where you say  oh  you want to put all the razzmatazz of Hollywood  and where you have big budgets. Here is that you make these films  it sells  you jump onto the location again to make another film  because if you don't make the next film  you're not going to feed. Bond Emeruwa  So while we're entertaining  we should be able to educate. I believe in the power of audiovisuals. I mean     percent of the population will watch Nollywood. I think it's the most viable vehicle right now to pass information across a dedicated cable. So if you're making a movie  no matter what your topic is  put in a message in there. Woman  You still have to report the incident. He needs proper medical attention. PP  I keep trying to explain to people  it's not about the quality at the moment    the quality is coming. I mean  there are those films that people are making for quality  but the first thing you have to remember about this society is that Africa still has people that live on one dollar a day  and these are the people that really watch these films. Sonny McDon W  Nollywood is a fantastic industry that has just been born in this part of the world. Because nobody believed that Nollywood can come out of Africa. Lancelot Imasen  But our films  they are stories that our people can relate to themselves. They are stories about our people  for our people. And consistently  they are glued to their screen whenever they see the story. Narrator  Suspense  fun and intrigue. It's the blockbuster comedy. You'll crack your ribs. Bernard Pinayon Agbaosi  We have been so deep into the foreign movies. It's all about the foreign movies. But we can do something too. We can do something  something that when the world sees it  they say  wow  this is Nigeria. Man  Just arrest yourself  sergeant. Don't embarrass yourself. Come on. Don't run away. Come back. Come back. SMW  You can now walk the street and see a role model. It s not just what you see in picture. You see the person live. You see how he talks. You see how he lives. He influences you really good  you know. It s not just what you see in the picture. It is not what you hear  you know  from the Western press. Man  See you. Bye. Action. Saint Obi  I was so fascinated  you know  with those cowboy movies. But then when I discovered the situation in my country  at that time there was so much corruption. For a young man to really make it out here  you got to think of some negative things and all that  or some kind of vices. And I didn't want that  you know. And I discovered that I could be successful in life as an actor  without doing crime  without cheating nobody  without telling no lies. Just me and God given talent. Man  Let's go. OK  it's time to kick some ass. Cover this. It's your own. Move it. Roboger Animadu  In big countries  when they do the movies  they have all these things in place. But here  we improvise these items  like the gunshots. Like they go  here  now  now  you see the gun there  but you won't see any guns shot  we use knock out. Kevin Books Ikeduba  What I'm scared of is just the explosion will come up in my face. Woman  That's why I use enough masking tape. The masking tape will hold it. Wat  wait. Just hold this for me. KBI  I'm just telling her to make sure she places it well so that it won't affect my face    the explosion  you know. But she's a professional. She knows what she s doing. I'm trying to protect my face too. This ain't going to be my last movie. You know  this is Nollywood  where the magic lives. RA  So now you're about to see how we do our own movies here  with or without any assistance from anybody. Man  Action. Cut. Franco Sacchi  So many things to say  so little time. So many themes in this story. I just can't tell you    there s one thing I want to tell you. I spent  you know  several weeks with all these actors  producers  and the problems they have to go through are unimaginable for  you know  a Westerner  a filmmaker who works in America or in Europe. But always with a smile  always with an enthusiasm  that is incredible. Werner Herzog  the German filmmaker said   I need to make movies like you need oxygen.  And I think they re breathing. The Nigerian filmmakers really  really  are doing what they like. And so it's a very  very important thing for them  and for their audiences. A woman told me   When I see a Nollywood film  I can relax  I really    I can breathe better.  There is also another very important thing that I hope will resonate with this audience. It s technology. I m very interested in it and I really think that the digital non linear editing has slashed  you know  the cost now is a fraction of what it used to be. Incredible cameras cost under       dollars. And this has unleashed tremendous energy. And guess what  We didn t have to tell to the Nigerian filmmakers. They understood it  they embraced the technology and they run with it  and they re successful. I hope that the Nollywood phenomenon will go both ways. I hope it will inspire other African nations to embrace the technology  look at the Nigerian model  make their films  create jobs  create a narrative for the population  something to identify  something positive  something that really is psychological relief and it's part of the culture. But I really think this is a phenomenon that can inspire us. I really think it goes both ways. Filmmakers  friends of mine  they look at Nollywood and they say   Wow  they are doing what we really want to do  and make a buck and live with this job.  So I really think it s a lesson that we're actually learning from them. And there's one thing  one small challenge that I have for you  and should make us reflect on the importance of storytelling. And I think this is really the theme of this session. Try to imagine a world where the only goal is food and a shelter  but no stories. No stories around the campfire. No legends  no fairytales. Nothing. No novels. Difficult  eh  It's meaningless. So this is what I really think. I think that the key to a healthy society is a thriving community of storytellers  and I think that the Nigerian filmmakers really have proved this. I would like you to hear their voices. Just a few moments. It s not an added sequence  just some voices from Nollywood. If you have an industry that puts a smile on people's face  that s Nollywood. SO  I believe very soon  we re not only going to have better movies  we'll have that original Nigerian movie. BE  It s still the same basic themes. Love  action. But we're telling it our own way  our own Nigerian way  African way. We have diverse cultures  diverse cultures  there are so many  that in the natal lifetimes  I don't see us exhausting the stories we have. FS  My job ends here  and the Nollywood filmmakers really have now to work. And I really hope that there will be many  many collaborations  where we teach each other things. And I really hope that this will happen. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Stop. I've got two questions. Franco  you described this as the world's third largest film industry. What does that translate to in terms of numbers of films  really  FS  Oh  yes. I think I mentioned briefly    it's close to       films. There is scientific data on this. CA        films a year  FS        films a year.      or    the censor board has censored       films alone. And we know that there are more. So it s safe to say that there are       films. So imagine    films per week. There are challenges. There are challenges. There is a glut of film  the quality has to be raised  they need to go to the next level  but I m optimistic. CA  And these aren t films that are primarily seen in cinemas  FS  Oh yes  of course. This is very important. Maybe  you know  for you to try to imagine this  these are films that are distributed directly in markets. They are bought in video shops. They can be rented for pennies. CA  On what format  FS  Oh  the format    thank you for the question. Yes  it's VCDs. It's a CD  it's a little bit more compressed image. They started with VHS. They actually didn't wait for  you know  the latest technology. They started in '    '  . So there are    million VCRs in Nigeria that play  you know  VHS and these VCDs. It's a CD basically. It's a compact disc. CA  So on the streets  are film casts ...   FS  You can be in a Lagos traffic jam and you can buy a movie or some bananas or some water. Yes. And I have to say  this really proves that storytelling  it's a commodity  it's a staple. There is no life without stories. CA  Franco  thank you so much. I thought I would think about changing your perspective on the world a bit  and showing you some of the designs that we have in nature. And so  I have my first slide to talk about the dawning of the universe and what I call the cosmic scene investigation  that is  looking at the relics of creation and inferring what happened at the beginning  and then following it up and trying to understand it. And so one of the questions that I asked you is  when you look around  what do you see  Well  you see this space that's created by designers and by the work of people  but what you actually see is a lot of material that was already here  being reshaped in a certain form. And so the question is  how did that material get here  How did it get into the form that it had before it got reshaped  and so forth  It's a question of what's the continuity  So one of the things I look at is  how did the universe begin and shape  What was the whole process in the creation and the evolution of the universe to getting to the point that we have these kinds of materials  So that's sort of the part  and let me move on then and show you the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. If you look at this picture  what you will see is a lot of dark with some light objects in it. And everything but    four of these light objects are stars  and you can see them there    little pluses. This is a star  this is a star  everything else is a galaxy  OK  So there's a couple of thousand galaxies you can see easily with your eye in here. And when I look out at particularly this galaxy  which looks a lot like ours  I wonder if there's an art design college conference going on  and intelligent beings there are thinking about  you know  what designs they might do  and there might be a few cosmologists trying to understand where the universe itself came from  and there might even be some in that galaxy looking at ours trying to figure out what's going on over here. But there's a lot of other galaxies  and some are nearby  and they're kind of the color of the Sun  and some are further away and they're a little bluer  and so forth. But one of the questions is    this should be  to you    how come there are so many galaxies  Because this represents a very clean fraction of the sky. This is only       galaxies. We think there's on the order    visible to the Hubble Space Telescope  if you had the time to scan it around    about     billion galaxies. Right  It's a very large number of galaxies. And that's roughly how many stars there are in our own galaxy. But when you look at some of these regions like this  you'll see more galaxies than stars  which is kind of a conundrum. So the question should come to your mind is  what kind of design  you know  what kind of creative process and what kind of design produced the world like that  And then I'm going to show you it's actually a lot more complicated. We're going to try and follow it up. We have a tool that actually helps us out in this study  and that's the fact that the universe is so incredibly big that it's a time machine  in a certain sense. We draw this set of nested spheres cut away so you see it. Put the Earth at the center of the nested spheres  just because that's where we're making observations. And the moon is only two seconds away  so if you take a picture of the moon using ordinary light  it's the moon two seconds ago  and who cares. Two seconds is like the present. The Sun is eight minutes ago. That's not such a big deal  right  unless there's solar flares coming then you want to get out the way. You'd like to have a little advance warning. But you get out to Jupiter and it's    minutes away. It's a problem. You hear about Mars  it's a problem communicating to Mars because it takes light long enough to go there. But if you look out to the nearest set of stars  to the nearest    or    stars  it's about    years. So if you take a picture of what's going on  it's    years ago. But you go and look to the center of the galaxy  it's thousands of years ago. If you look at Andromeda  which is the nearest big galaxy  and it's two million years ago. If you took a picture of the Earth two million years ago  there'd be no evidence of humans at all  because we don't think there were humans yet. I mean  it just gives you the scale. With the Hubble Space Telescope  we're looking at hundreds of millions of years to a billion years. But if we were capable to come up with an idea of how to look even further    there's some things even further  and that was what I did in a lot of my work  was to develop the techniques    we could look out back to even earlier epochs before there were stars and before there were galaxies  back to when the universe was hot and dense and very different. And so that's the sort of sequence  and so I have a more artistic impression of this. There's the galaxy in the middle  which is the Milky Way  and around that are the Hubble    you know  nearby kind of galaxies  and there's a sphere that marks the different times. And behind that are some more modern galaxies. You see the whole big picture  The beginning of time is funny    it's on the outside  right  And then there's a part of the universe we can't see because it's so dense and so hot  light can't escape. It's like you can't see to the center of the Sun  you have to use other techniques to know what's going on inside the Sun. But you can see the edge of the Sun  and the universe gets that way  and you can see that. And then you see this sort of model area around the outside  and that is the radiation coming from the Big Bang  which is actually incredibly uniform. The universe is almost a perfect sphere  but there are these very tiny variations which we show here in great exaggeration. And from them in the time sequence we're going to have to go from these tiny variations to these irregular galaxies and first stars to these more advanced galaxies  and eventually the solar system  and so forth. So it's a big design job  but we'll see about how things are going on. So the way these measurements were done  there's been a set of satellites  and this is where you get to see. So there was the COBE satellite  which was launched in       and we discovered these variations. And then in       the MAP satellite was launched    the WMAP    and it made somewhat better pictures. And later this year    this is the cool stealth version  the one that actually has some beautiful design features to it  and you should look    the Planck satellite will be launched  and it will make very high resolution maps. And that will be the sequence of understanding the very beginning of the universe. And what we saw was  we saw these variations  and then they told us the secrets  both about the structure of space time  and about the contents of the universe  and about how the universe started in its original motions. So we have this picture  which is quite a spectacular picture  and I'll come back to the beginning  where we're going to have some mysterious process that kicks the universe off at the beginning. And we go through a period of accelerating expansion  and the universe expands and cools until it gets to the point where it becomes transparent  then to the Dark Ages  and then the first stars turn on  and they evolve into galaxies  and then later they get to the more expansive galaxies. And somewhere around this period is when our solar system started forming. And it's maturing up to the present time. And there's some spectacular things. And this wastebasket part  that's to represent what the structure of space time itself is doing during this period. And so this is a pretty weird model  right  What kind of evidence do we have for that  So let me show you some of nature's patterns that are the result of this. I always think of space time as being the real substance of space  and the galaxies and the stars just like the foam on the ocean. It's a marker of where the interesting waves are and whatever went on. So here is the Sloan Digital Sky Survey showing the location of a million galaxies. So there's a dot on here for every galaxy. They go out and point a telescope at the sky  take a picture  identify what are stars and throw them away  look at the galaxies  estimate how far away they are  and plot them up. And just put radially they're going out that way. And you see these structures  this thing we call the Great Wall  but there are voids and those kinds of stuff  and they kind of fade out because the telescope isn't sensitive enough to do it. Now I'm going to show you this in  D. What happens is  you take pictures as the Earth rotates  you get a fan across the sky. There are some places you can't look because of our own galaxy  or because there are no telescopes available to do it. So the next picture shows you the three dimensional version of this rotating around. Do you see the fan like scans made across the sky  Remember  every spot on here is a galaxy  and you see the galaxies  you know  sort of in our neighborhood  and you sort of see the structure. And you see this thing we call the Great Wall  and you see the complicated structure  and you see these voids. There are places where there are no galaxies and there are places where there are thousands of galaxies clumped together  right. So there's an interesting pattern  but we don't have enough data here to actually see the pattern. We only have a million galaxies  right  So we're keeping  like  a million balls in the air but  what's going on  There's another survey which is very similar to this  called the Two degree Field of View Galaxy Redshift Survey. Now we're going to fly through it at warp a million. And every time there's a galaxy    at its location there's a galaxy    and if we know anything about the galaxy  which we do  because there's a redshift measurement and everything  you put in the type of galaxy and the color  so this is the real representation. And when you're in the middle of the galaxies it's hard to see the pattern  it's like being in the middle of life. It's hard to see the pattern in the middle of the audience  it's hard to see the pattern of this. So we're going to go out and swing around and look back at this. And you'll see  first  the structure of the survey  and then you'll start seeing the structure of the galaxies that we see out there. So again  you can see the extension of this Great Wall of galaxies showing up here. But you can see the voids  you can see the complicated structure  and you say  well  how did this happen  Suppose you're the cosmic designer. How are you going to put galaxies out there in a pattern like that  It's not just throwing them out at random. There's a more complicated process going on here. How are you going to end up doing that  And so now we're in for some serious play. That is  we have to seriously play God  not just change people's lives  but make the universe  right. So if that's your responsibility  how are you going to do that  What's the kind of technique  What's the kind of thing you're going to do  So I'm going to show you the results of a very large scale simulation of what we think the universe might be like  using  essentially  some of the play principles and some of the design principles that  you know  humans have labored so hard to pick up  but apparently nature knew how to do at the beginning. And that is  you start out with very simple ingredients and some simple rules  but you have to have enough ingredients to make it complicated. And then you put in some randomness  some fluctuations and some randomness  and realize a whole bunch of different representations. So what I'm going to do is show you the distribution of matter as a function of scales. We're going to zoom in  but this is a plot of what it is. And we had to add one more thing to make the universe come out right. It's called dark matter. That is matter that doesn't interact with light the typical way that ordinary matter does  the way the light's shining on me or on the stage. It's transparent to light  but in order for you to see it  we're going to make it white. OK  So the stuff that's in this picture that's white  that is the dark matter. It should be called invisible matter  but the dark matter we've made visible. And the stuff that is in the yellow color  that is the ordinary kind of matter that's turned into stars and galaxies. So I'll show you the next movie. So this    we're going to zoom in. Notice this pattern and pay attention to this pattern. We're going to zoom in and zoom in. And you'll see there are all these filaments and structures and voids. And when a number of filaments come together in a knot  that makes a supercluster of galaxies. This one we're zooming in on is somewhere between         and a million galaxies in that small region. So we live in the boonies. We don't live in the center of the solar system  we don't live in the center of the galaxy and our galaxy's not in the center of the cluster. So we're zooming in. This is a region which probably has more than          on the order of a million galaxies in that region. We're going to keep zooming in. OK. And so I forgot to tell you the scale. A parsec is  .   light years. So a gigaparsec is three billion light years    that's the scale. So it takes light three billion years to travel over that distance. Now we're into a distance sort of between here and here. That's the distance between us and Andromeda  right  These little specks that you're seeing in here  they're galaxies. Now we're going to zoom back out  and you can see this structure that  when we get very far out  looks very regular  but it's made up of a lot of irregular variations. So they're simple building blocks. There's a very simple fluid to begin with. It's got dark matter  it's got ordinary matter  it's got photons and it's got neutrinos  which don't play much role in the later part of the universe. And it's just a simple fluid and it  over time  develops into this complicated structure. And so you know when you first saw this picture  it didn't mean quite so much to you. Here you're looking across one percent of the volume of the visible universe and you're seeing billions of galaxies  right  and nodes  but you realize they're not even the main structure. There's a framework  which is the dark matter  the invisible matter  that's out there that's actually holding it all together. So let's fly through it  and you can see how much harder it is when you're in the middle of something to figure this out. So here's that same end result. You see a filament  you see the light is the invisible matter  and the yellow is the stars or the galaxies showing up. And we're going to fly around  and we'll fly around  and you'll see occasionally a couple of filaments intersect  and you get a large cluster of galaxies. And then we'll fly in to where the very large cluster is  and you can see what it looks like. And so from inside  it doesn't look very complicated  right  It's only when you look at it at a very large scale  and explore it and so forth  you realize it's a very intricate  complicated kind of a design  right  And it's grown up in some kind of way. So the question is  how hard would it be to assemble this  right  How big a contractor team would you need to put this universe together  right  That's the issue  right  And so here we are. You see how the filament    you see how several filaments are coming together  therefore making this supercluster of galaxies. And you have to understand  this is not how it would actually look if you    first  you can't travel this fast  everything would be distorted  but this is using simple rendering and graphic arts kind of stuff. This is how  if you took billions of years to go around  it might look to you  right  And if you could see invisible matter  too. And so the idea is  you know  how would you put together the universe in a very simple way  We're going to start and realize that the entire visible universe  everything we can see in every direction with the Hubble Space Telescope plus our other instruments  was once in a region that was smaller than an atom. It started with tiny quantum mechanical fluctuations  but expanding at a tremendous rate. And those fluctuations were stretched to astronomical sizes  and those fluctuations eventually are the things we see in the cosmic microwave background. And then we needed some way to turn those fluctuations into galaxies and clusters of galaxies and make these kinds of structures go on. So I'm going to show you a smaller simulation. This simulation was run on       processors for a month in order to make just this simple visible one. So I'm going to show you one that can be run on a desktop in two days in the next picture. So you start out with teeny fluctuations when the universe was at this point  now four times smaller  and so forth. And you start seeing these networks  this cosmic web of structure forming. And this is a simple one  because it doesn't have the ordinary matter and it just has the dark matter in it. And you see how the dark matter lumps up  and the ordinary matter just trails along behind. So there it is. At the beginning it's very uniform. The fluctuations are a part in        . There are a few peaks that are a part in         and then over billions of years  gravity just pulls in. This is light over density  pulls the material around in. That pulls in more material and pulls in more material. But the distances on the universe are so large and the time scales are so large that it takes a long time for this to form. And it keeps forming until the universe is roughly about half the size it is now  in terms of its expansion. And at that point  the universe mysteriously starts accelerating its expansion and cuts off the formation of larger scale structure. So we're just seeing as large a scale structure as we can see  and then only things that have started forming already are going to form  and then from then on it's going to go on. So we're able to do the simulation  but this is two days on a desktop. We need  you know     days on       processors to do the kind of simulation that I showed you before. So we have an idea of how to play seriously  creating the universe by starting with essentially less than an eyedrop full of material  and we create everything we can see in any direction  right  from almost nothing    that is  something extremely tiny  extremely small    and it is almost perfect  except it has these tiny fluctuations at a part in         level  which turn out to produce the interesting patterns and designs we see  that is  galaxies and stars and so forth. So we have a model  and we can calculate it  and we can use it to make designs of what we think the universe really looks like. And that design is sort of way beyond what our original imagination ever was. So this is what we started with    years ago  with the Cosmic Background Explorer    made the map on the upper right  which basically showed us that there were large scale fluctuations  and actually fluctuations on several scales. You can kind of see that. Since then we've had WMAP  which just gives us higher angular resolution. We see the same large scale structure  but we see additional small scale structure. And on the bottom right is if the satellite had flipped upside down and mapped the Earth  what kind of a map we would have got of the Earth. You can see  well  you can  kind of pick out all the major continents  but that's about it. But what we're hoping when we get to Planck  we'll have resolution about equivalent to the resolution you see of the Earth there  where you can really see the complicated pattern that exists on the Earth. And you can also tell  because of the sharp edges and the way things fit together  there are some non linear processes. Geology has these effects  which is moving the plates around and so forth. You can see that just from the map alone. We want to get to the point in our maps of the early universe we can see whether there are any non linear effects that are starting to move  to modify  and are giving us a hint about how space time itself was actually created at the beginning moments. So that's where we are today  and that's what I wanted to give you  a flavor of. Give you a different view about what the design and what everything else looks like. Thank you. What technology can we really apply to reducing global poverty  And what I found was quite surprising. We started looking at things like death rates in the   th century  and how they'd been improved  and very simple things turned out. You'd think maybe antibiotics made more difference than clean water  but it's actually the opposite. And so very simple things    off the shelf technologies that we could easily find on the then early Web    would clearly make a huge difference to that problem. But I also  in looking at more powerful technologies and nanotechnology and genetic engineering and other new emerging kind of digital technologies  became very concerned about the potential for abuse. If you think about it  in history  a long  long time ago we dealt with the problem of an individual abusing another individual. We came up with something    the Ten Commandments  Thou shalt not kill. That's a  kind of a one on one thing. We organized into cities. We had many people. And to keep the many from tyrannizing the one  we came up with concepts like individual liberty. And then  to have to deal with large groups  say  at the nation state level  and we had to have mutual non aggression  or through a series of conflicts  we eventually came to a rough international bargain to largely keep the peace. But now we have a new situation  really what people call an asymmetric situation  where technology is so powerful that it extends beyond a nation state. It's not the nation states that have potential access to mass destruction  but individuals. And this is a consequence of the fact that these new technologies tend to be digital. We saw genome sequences. You can download the gene sequences of pathogens off the Internet if you want to  and clearly someone recently    I saw in a science magazine    they said  well  the      flu is too dangerous to FedEx around. If people want to use it in their labs for working on research  just reconstruct it yourself  because  you know  it might break in FedEx. So that this is possible to do this is not deniable. So individuals in small groups super empowered by access to these kinds of self replicating technologies  whether it be biological or other  are clearly a danger in our world. And the danger is that they can cause roughly what's a pandemic. And we really don't have experience with pandemics  and we're also not very good as a society at acting to things we don't have direct and sort of gut level experience with. So it's not in our nature to pre act. And in this case  piling on more technology doesn't solve the problem  because it only super empowers people more. So the solution has to be  as people like Russell and Einstein and others imagine in a conversation that existed in a much stronger form  I think  early in the   th century  that the solution had to be not just the head but the heart. You know  public policy and moral progress. The bargain that gives us civilization is a bargain to not use power. We get our individual rights by society protecting us from others not doing everything they can do but largely doing only what is legal. And so to limit the danger of these new things  we have to limit  ultimately  the ability of individuals to have access  essentially  to pandemic power. We also have to have sensible defense  because no limitation is going to prevent a crazy person from doing something. And you know  and the troubling thing is that it's much easier to do something bad than to defend against all possible bad things  so the offensive uses really have an asymmetric advantage. So these are the kind of thoughts I was thinking in      and       and my friends told me I was getting really depressed  and they were really worried about me. And then I signed a book contract to write more gloomy thoughts about this and moved into a hotel room in New York with one room full of books on the Plague  and you know  nuclear bombs exploding in New York where I would be within the circle  and so on. And then I was there on September   th  and I stood in the streets with everyone. And it was quite an experience to be there. I got up the next morning and walked out of the city  and all the sanitation trucks were parked on Houston Street and ready to go down and start taking the rubble away. And I walked down the middle  up to the train station  and everything below   th Street was closed. It was quite a compelling experience  but not really  I suppose  a surprise to someone who'd had his room full of the books. It was always a surprise that it happened then and there  but it wasn't a surprise that it happened at all. And everyone then started writing about this. Thousands of people started writing about this. And I eventually abandoned the book  and then Chris called me to talk at the conference. I really don't talk about this anymore because  you know  there's enough frustrating and depressing things going on. But I agreed to come and say a few things about this. And I would say that we can't give up the rule of law to fight an asymmetric threat  which is what we seem to be doing because of the present  the people that are in power  because that's to give up the thing that makes civilization. And we can't fight the threat in the kind of stupid way we're doing  because a million dollar act causes a billion dollars of damage  causes a trillion dollar response which is largely ineffective and arguably  probably almost certainly  has made the problem worse. So we can't fight the thing with a million to one cost  one to a million cost benefit ratio. So after giving up on the book    and I had the great honor to be able to join Kleiner Perkins about a year ago  and to work through venture capital on the innovative side  and to try to find some innovations that could address what I saw as some of these big problems. Things where  you know  a factor of    difference can make a factor of       difference in the outcome. I've been amazed in the last year at the incredible quality and excitement of the innovations that have come across my desk. It's overwhelming at times. I'm very thankful for Google and Wikipedia so I can understand at least a little of what people are talking about who come through the doors. But I wanted to share with you three areas that I'm particularly excited about and that relate to the problems that I was talking about in the Wired article. The first is this whole area of education  and it really relates to what Nicholas was talking about with a      computer. And that is to say that there's a lot of legs left in Moore's Law. The most advanced transistors today are at    nanometers  and we've seen  and I've had the pleasure to invest in  companies that give me great confidence that we'll extend Moore's Law all the way down to roughly the    nanometer scale. Another factor of  say  six in dimensional reduction  which should give us about another factor of     in raw improvement in what the chips can do. And so  to put that in practical terms  if something costs about       dollars today  say  the best personal computer you can buy  that might be its cost  I think we can have that in      for    dollars. Okay  Now  just imagine what that      computer will be in      as a tool for education. I think the challenge for us is    I'm very certain that that will happen  the challenge is  will we develop the kind of educational tools and things with the net to let us take advantage of that device  I'd argue today that we have incredibly powerful computers  but we don't have very good software for them. And it's only in retrospect  after the better software comes along  and you take it and you run it on a ten year old machine  you say  God  the machine was that fast  I remember when they took the Apple Mac interface and they put it back on the Apple II. The Apple II was perfectly capable of running that kind of interface  we just didn't know how to do it at the time. So given that we know and should believe    because Moore's Law's been  like  a constant  I mean  it's just been very predictable progress over the last    years or whatever. We can know what the computers are going to be like in     . It's great that we have initiatives to say  let's go create the education and educate people in the world  because that's a great force for peace. And we can give everyone in the world a      computer or a     computer in the next    years. The second area that I'm focusing on is the environmental problem  because that's clearly going to put a lot of pressure on this world. We'll hear a lot more about that from Al Gore very shortly. The thing that we see as the kind of Moore's Law trend that's driving improvement in our ability to address the environmental problem is new materials. We have a challenge  because the urban population is growing in this century from two billion to six billion in a very short amount of time. People are moving to the cities. They all need clean water  they need energy  they need transportation  and we want them to develop in a green way. We're reasonably efficient in the industrial sectors. We've made improvements in energy and resource efficiency  but the consumer sector  especially in America  is very inefficient. But these new materials bring such incredible innovations that there's a strong basis for hope that these things will be so profitable that they can be brought to the market. And I want to give you a specific example of a new material that was discovered    years ago. If we take carbon nanotubes  you know  Iijima discovered them in       they just have incredible properties. And these are the kinds of things we're going to discover as we start to engineer at the nano scale. Their strength  they're almost the strongest material  tensile strength material known. They're very  very stiff. They stretch very  very little. In two dimensions  if you make  like  a fabric out of them  they're    times stronger than Kevlar. And if you make a three dimensional structure  like a buckyball  they have all sorts of incredible properties. If you shoot a particle at them and knock a hole in them  they repair themselves  they go zip and they repair the hole in femtoseconds  which is not    is really quick. If you shine a light on them  they produce electricity. In fact  if you flash them with a camera they catch on fire. If you put electricity on them  they emit light. If you run current through them  you can run       times more current through one of these than through a piece of metal. You can make both p  and n type semiconductors  which means you can make transistors out of them. They conduct heat along their length but not across    well  there is no width  but not in the other direction if you stack them up  that's a property of carbon fiber also. If you put particles in them  and they go shooting out the tip    they're like miniature linear accelerators or electron guns. The inside of the nanotubes is so small    the smallest ones are  .  nanometers    that it's basically a quantum world. It's a strange place inside a nanotube. And so we begin to see  and we've seen business plans already  where the kind of things Lisa Randall's talking about are in there. I had one business plan where I was trying to learn more about Witten's cosmic dimension strings to try to understand what the phenomenon was going on in this proposed nanomaterial. So inside of a nanotube  we're really at the limit here. So what we see is with these and other new materials that we can do things with different properties    lighter  stronger    and apply these new materials to the environmental problems. New materials that can make water  new materials that can make fuel cells work better  new materials that catalyze chemical reactions  that cut pollution and so on. Ethanol    new ways of making ethanol. New ways of making electric transportation. The whole green dream    because it can be profitable. And we've dedicated    we've just raised a new fund  we dedicated     million dollars to these kinds of investments. We believe that Genentech  the Compaq  the Lotus  the Sun  the Netscape  the Amazon  the Google in these fields are yet to be found  because this materials revolution will drive these things forward. The third area that we're working on  and we just announced last week    we were all in New York. We raised     million dollars in a specialty fund to work on a pandemic in biodefense. And to give you an idea of the last fund that Kleiner raised was a      million fund  so this for us is a very substantial fund. And what we did  over the last few months    well  a few months ago  Ray Kurzweil and I wrote an op ed in the New York Times about how publishing the      genome was very dangerous. And John Doerr and Brook and others got concerned   unclear   and we started looking around at what the world was doing about being prepared for a pandemic. And we saw a lot of gaps. And so we asked ourselves  you know  can we find innovative things that will go fill these gaps  And Brooks told me in a break here  he said he's found so much stuff he can't sleep  because there's so many great technologies out there  we're essentially buried. And we need them  you know. We have one antiviral that people are talking about stockpiling that still works  roughly. That's Tamiflu. But Tamiflu    the virus is resistant. It is resistant to Tamiflu. We've discovered with AIDS we need cocktails to work well so that the viral resistance    we need several anti virals. We need better surveillance. We need networks that can find out what's going on. We need rapid diagnostics so that we can tell if somebody has a strain of flu which we have only identified very recently. We've got to be able to make the rapid diagnostics quickly. We need new anti virals and cocktails. We need new kinds of vaccines. Vaccines that are broad spectrum. Vaccines that we can manufacture quickly. Cocktails  more polyvalent vaccines. You normally get a trivalent vaccine against three possible strains. We need    we don't know where this thing is going. We believe that if we could fill these    gaps  we have a chance to help really reduce the risk of a pandemic. And the difference between a normal flu season and a pandemic is about a factor of       in deaths and certainly enormous economic impact. So we're very excited because we think we can fund     or speed up    projects and see them come to market in the next couple years that will address this. So if we can address  use technology  help address education  help address the environment  help address the pandemic  does that solve the larger problem that I was talking about in the Wired article  And I'm afraid the answer is really no  because you can't solve a problem with the management of technology with more technology. If we let an unlimited amount of power loose  then we will    a very small number of people will be able to abuse it. We can't fight at a million to one disadvantage. So what we need to do is  we need better policy. And for example  some things we could do that would be policy solutions which are not really in the political air right now but perhaps with the change of administration would be    use markets. Markets are a very strong force. For example  rather than trying to regulate away problems  which probably won't work  if we could price into the cost of doing business  the cost of catastrophe  so that people who are doing things that had a higher cost of catastrophe would have to take insurance against that risk. So if you wanted to put a drug on the market you could put it on. But it wouldn't have to be approved by regulators  you'd have to convince an actuary that it would be safe. And if you apply the notion of insurance more broadly  you can use a more powerful force  a market force  to provide feedback. How could you keep the law  I think the law would be a really good thing to keep. Well  you have to hold people accountable. The law requires accountability. Today scientists  technologists  businessmen  engineers don't have any personal responsibility for the consequences of their actions. So if you tie that    you have to tie that back with the law. And finally  I think we have to do something that's not really    it's almost unacceptable to say this    which  we have to begin to design the future. We can't pick the future  but we can steer the future. Our investment in trying to prevent pandemic flu is affecting the distribution of possible outcomes. We may not be able to stop it  but the likelihood that it will get past us is lower if we focus on that problem. So we can design the future if we choose what kind of things we want to have happen and not have happen  and steer us to a lower risk place. Vice President Gore will talk about how we could steer the climate trajectory into a lower probability of catastrophic risk. But above all  what we have to do is we have to help the good guys  the people on the defensive side  have an advantage over the people who want to abuse things. And what we have to do to do that is we have to limit access to certain information. And growing up as we have  and holding very high the value of free speech  this is a hard thing for us to accept    for all of us to accept. It's especially hard for the scientists to accept who still remember  you know  Galileo essentially locked up  and who are still fighting this battle against the church. But that's the price of having a civilization. The price of retaining the rule of law is to limit the access to the great and kind of unbridled power. Thank you. I went to Spain a few months ago and I had the best foie gras of my life. The best culinary experience of my life. Because what I saw  I'm convinced  is the future of cooking. Ridiculous  right  Foie gras and the future of cooking. There's not a food today that's more maligned than foie gras  right  I mean  it's crucified. It was outlawed in Chicago for a while. It's pending here in California  and just recently in New York. It's like if you're a chef and you put it on your menu  you risk being attacked. Really  it happened here in San Francisco to a famous chef. I'm not saying that there's not a rationale for being opposed to foie gras. The reasons usually just boil down to the gavage  which is the force feeding. Basically you take a goose or a duck and you force feed a ton of grain down its throat. More grain in a couple of weeks than it would ever get in a lifetime. Its liver expands by eight times. Suffice to say it's like    it's not the prettiest picture of sustainable farming. The problem for us chefs is that it's so freakin' delicious. I mean  I love the stuff. It is fatty  it's sweet  it's silky  it's unctuous. It makes everything else you put it with taste incredible. Can we produce a menu that's delicious without foie gras  Yes  sure. You can also bike the Tour de France without steroids  right  Not a lot of people are doing it. And for good reason. So several months ago  a friend of mine sent me this link to this guy  Eduardo Sousa. Eduardo is doing what he calls natural foie gras. Natural foie gras. What's natural about foie gras  To take advantage of when the temperature drops in the fall  geese and ducks gorge on food to prepare for the harsh realities of winter. And the rest of the year they're free to roam around Eduardo's land and eat what they want. So no gavage  no force feeding  no factory like conditions  no cruelty. And it's shockingly not a new idea. His great granddad started    Pater a de Sousa    in     . And they've been doing it quietly ever since. That is until last year  when Eduardo won the Coup de Coeur  the coveted French gastronomic prize. It's like the Olympics of food products. He placed first for his foie gras. Big  big problem. As he said to me  that really pissed the French off. He said it sort of gleefully. It was all over the papers. I read about it. It was in Le Monde.  Spanish chef accused ...      and the French accused him.  Spanish chef accused of cheating.  They accused him of paying off the judges. They implicated actually  the Spanish government  amazingly. Huh  amazing. A huge scandal for a few weeks. Couldn't find a shred of evidence. Now  look at the guy. He doesn't look like a guy who's paying off French judges for his foie gras. So that died down  and very soon afterward  new controversy. He shouldn't win because it's not foie gras. It's not foie gras because it's not gavage. There's no force feeding. So by definition  he's lying and should be disqualified. As funny as it sounds  articulating it now and reading about it    actually  if we had talked about it before this controversy  I would have said   That's kind of true.  You know  foie gras by definition  force feeding  it's gavage  and that's what you get when you want foie gras. That is  until I went to Eduardo's farm in Extremadura     miles north of Seville  right on the Portugal border. I saw first hand a system that is incredibly complex and then at the same time  like everything beautiful in nature  is utterly simple. And he said to me  really from the first moment  my life's work is to give the geese what they want. He repeated that about    times in the two days I was with him. I'm just here to give the geese what they want. Actually  when I showed up he was lying down with the geese with his cell phone taking pictures of them like his children in the grass. Amazing. He's really just in love with    he's at one with    he's the goose whisperer. And when I was speaking to him  you know  I thought  like I'm speaking to you now  right  but sort of in the middle of my questions  my excited questions  because the more I got to know him and his system  the more exciting this whole idea became. He kept going like this to me. And I thought  OK  excited Jew from New York  right  I'm talking a little too aggressively  whatever  so you know  I slowed down. And finally  by the end of the day I was like  Ed uar do  you know like this  But he was still going like this. I figured it out. I was speaking too loudly. So I hushed my voice. I kind of like asked these questions and chatted with him through a translator in kind of a half whisper. And he stopped doing this. And amazingly  the geese who were on the other side of the paddock when I was around     Get the hell away from this kid      when I lowered my voice  they all came right up to us. Right up to us  like right up to here. Right along the fence line. And fence line was amazing in itself. The fence    like this conception of fence that we have it's totally backward with him. The electricity on this fiberglass fence is only on the outside. He rewired it. He invented it. I've never seen it. Have you  You fence in animals. You electrify the inside. He doesn't. He electrifies only the outside. Why  Because he said to me that he felt like the geese    and he proved this actually  not just a conceit  he proved this    the geese felt manipulated when they were imprisoned in their little paddocks. Even though they were imprisoned in this Garden of Eden with figs and everything else. He felt like they felt manipulated. So he got rid of the electricity  he got rid of current on the inside and kept it on the outside  so it would protect them against coyotes and other predators. Now  what happened  They ate  and he showed me on a chart  how they ate about    percent more feed to feed their livers. The landscape is incredible. I mean  his farm is incredible. It really is the Garden of Eden. There's figs and everything else there for the taking. And the irony of ironies is because Extremadura  the area    what does Extremadura mean  Extra hard land  right  Extra difficult. Extra hard. But over four generations  he and his family have literally transformed this extra hard land into a tasting menu. Upgrades the life for these geese. And they are allowed to take whatever they want. Another irony  the double irony is that on the figs and the olives  Eduardo can make more money selling those than he can on the foie gras. He doesn't care. He lets them take what they want and he says   Usually  it's about    percent. They're very fair.  The other    percent  he takes and he sells and he makes money on them. Part of the income for his farm. A big part of his income for his farm. But he never controls it. They get what they want  they leave the rest for me and I sell it. His biggest obstacle  really  was the marketplace  which demands these days bright yellow foie gras. That's how I've been trained. You want to look and see what good foie gras is  it's got to be bright yellow. It's the indication that it's the best foie gras. Well  because he doesn't force feed  because he doesn't gavage tons of corn  his livers were pretty grey. Or they were. But he found this wild plant called the Lupin bush. The Lupin bush  it's all around Extremadura. He let it go to seed  he took the seeds  he planted it on his    acres  all around. And the geese love the Lupin bush. Not for the bush  but for the seeds. And when they eat the seeds  their foie gras turns yellow. Radioactive yellow. Bright yellow. Of the highest quality foie gras yellow I've ever seen. So I'm listening to all this  you know  and I'm like  is this guy for real  Is he making some of this up  Is he like  you know    because he seemed to have an answer for everything  and it was always nature. It was never him. And I was like  you know  I always get a little  like  weirded out by people who deflect everything away from themselves. Because  really  they want you to look at themselves  right  But he deflected everything away from his ingenuity into working with his landscape. So it's like  here I am  I'm on the fence about this guy  but increasingly  eating up his every word. And we're sitting there  and I hear  clapping  from a distance  so I look over. And he grabs my arm and the translator's  and ducks us under a bush and says   Watch this.   Shush   he says again for the    th time to me.  Shush  watch this.  And this squadron of geese come over.  Clapping  And they're getting louder  louder  louder  like really loud  right over us. And like airport traffic control  as they start to go past us they're called back    and they're called back and back and back. And then they circle around. And his geese are calling up now to the wild geese.  Clapping  And the wild geese are calling down.  Clapping  And it's getting louder and louder and they circle and circle and they land. And I'm just saying   No way.  No way. And I look at Eduardo  who's near tears looking at this  and I say   You're telling me that your geese are calling to the wild geese to say come for a visit   And he says   No  no  no. They've come to stay.  They've come to stay  It's like the DNA of a goose is to fly south in the winter  right  I said that. I said  Isn't that what they're put on this Earth for  To fly south in the winter and north when it gets warm   He said   No  no  no. Their DNA is to find the conditions that are conducive to life. To happiness. They find it here. They don't need anything more.  They stop. They mate with his domesticated geese  and his flock continues. Think about that for a minute. It's brilliant  right  Imagine    I don't know  imagine a hog farm in  like  North Carolina  and a wild pig comes upon a factory farm and decides to stay. So how did it taste  I finally got to taste it before I left. He took me to his neighborhood restaurant and he served me some of his foie gras  confit de foie gras. It was incredible. And the problem with saying that  of course  is that you know  at this point it risks hyperbole really easily. And I'd like to make a metaphor  but I don't have one really. I was drinking this guy's Kool Aid so much  he could have served me goose feathers and I would have been like  this guy's a genius  you know  I'm really in love with him at this point. But it truly was the best foie gras of my life. So much so that I don't think I had ever really had foie gras until that moment. I'd had something that was called foie gras. But this was transformative. Really transformative. And I say to you  I might not stick to this  but I don't think I'll ever serve foie gras on my menu again because of that taste experience with Eduardo. It was sweet  it was unctuous. It had all the qualities of foie gras  but its fat had a lot of integrity and a lot of honesty. And you could taste herbs  you could taste spices. And I kept    I said  you know  I swear to God I tasted star anise. I was sure of it. And I'm not like some super taster  you know  But I can taste things. There's     percent star anise in there. And he says   No.  And I ended up like going down the spices  and finally  it was like  OK  salt and pepper  thinking he's salted and peppered his liver. But no. He takes the liver when he harvests the foie gras  he sticks them in this jar and he confits it. No salt  no pepper  no oil  no spices. What  We went back out for the final tour of the farm  and he showed me the wild pepper plants and the plants that he made sure existed on his farm for salinity. He doesn't need salt and pepper. And he doesn't need spices  because he's got this potpourri of herbs and flavors that his geese love to gorge on. I turned to him at the end of the meal  and it's a question I asked several times  and he hadn't  kind of  answered me directly  but I said   Now look  you're in Spain  some of the greatest chefs in the world are    Ferran Adria  the preeminent chef of the world today  not that far from you. How come you don't give him this  How come no one's really heard of you   And it may be because of the wine  or it may be because of my excitement  he answered me directly and he said   Because chefs don't deserve my foie gras.  And he was right. He was right. Chefs take foie gras and they make it their own. They create a dish where all the vectors point at us. With Eduardo it's about the expression of nature. And as he said  I think fittingly  it's a gift from God  with God saying  you've done good work. Simple. I flew home  I'm on the flight with my little black book and I took  you know  pages and pages of notes about it. I really was moved. And in the corner of one of these    one of my notes  is this note that says  when asked  what do you think of conventional foie gras  What do you think of foie gras that   .      percent of the world eats  He said   I think it's an insult to history.  And I wrote  insult to history. I'm on the plane and I'm just tearing my hair out. It's like  why didn't I follow up on that  What the hell does that mean  Insult to history. So I did some research when I got back  and here's what I found. The history of foie gras. Jews invented foie gras. True story. True story. By accident. They were looking for an alternative to schmaltz. Gotten sick of the chicken fat. They were looking for an alternative. And they saw in the fall that there was this natural  beautiful  sweet  delicious fat from geese. And they slaughtered them  used the fat throughout the winter for cooking. The Pharaoh got wind of this    This is true  right off the Internet. The Pharaoh got     Laughter  I swear to God. The Pharaoh got wind of this and wanted to taste it. He tasted it and fell in love with it. He started demanding it. And he didn't want it just in the fall  he wanted it all year round. And he demanded that the Jews supply enough for everyone. And the Jews  fearing for their life  had to come up with an ingenious idea  or at least try and satisfy the Pharaoh's wishes  of course. And they invented  what  Gavage. They invented gavage in a great moment of fear for their lives  and they provided the Pharaoh with gavage liver  and the good stuff they kept for themselves. Supposedly  anyway. I believe that one. That's the history of foie gras. And if you think about it  it's the history of industrial agriculture. It's the history of what we eat today. Most of what we eat today. Mega farms  feed lots  chemical amendments  long distance travel  food processing. All of it  our food system. That's also an insult to history. It's an insult to the basic laws of nature and of biology. Whether we're talking about beef cattle or we're talking about chickens  or we're talking about broccoli or Brussels sprouts  or in the case of this morning's New York Times  catfish    which wholesale are going out of business. Whatever it is  it's a mindset that is reminiscent of General Motors. It's rooted in extraction. Take more  sell more  waste more. And for the future it won't serve us. Jonas Salk has a great quote. He said   If all the insects disappeared  life on Earth as we know it would disappear within    years. If human beings disappeared  life on Earth as we know it would flourish.  And he's right. We need now to adopt a new conception of agriculture. Really new. One in which we stop treating the planet as if it were some kind of business in liquidation. And stop degrading resources under the guise of cheap food. We can start by looking to farmers like Eduardo. Farmers that rely on nature for solutions  for answers  rather than imposing solutions on nature. Listening as Janine Benyus  one of my favorite writers and thinkers about this topic says   Listening to nature's operating instructions.  That's what Eduardo does  and does so brilliantly. And what he showed me and what he can show all of us  I think  is that the great thing for chefs  the great blessing for chefs  and for people that care about food and cooking  is that the most ecological choice for food is also the most ethical choice for food. Whether we're talking about Brussels sprouts or foie gras. And it's also almost always  and I haven't found an example otherwise  but almost always  the most delicious choice. That's serendipitous. Thank you. Great creativity. In times of need  we need great creativity. Discuss. Great creativity is astonishingly  absurdly  rationally  irrationally powerful. Great creativity can spread tolerance  champion freedom  make education seem like a bright idea. Great creativity can turn a spotlight on deprivation  or show that deprivation ain't necessarily so. Great creativity can make politicians electable  or parties unelectable. It can make war seem like tragedy or farce. Creativity is the meme maker that puts slogans on our t shirts and phrases on our lips. It's the pathfinder that shows us a simple road through an impenetrable moral maze. Science is clever  but great creativity is something less knowable  more magical. And now we need that magic. This is a time of need. Our climate is changing quickly  too quickly. And great creativity is needed to do what it does so well  to provoke us to think differently with dramatic creative statements. To tempt us to act differently with delightful creative scraps. Here is one such scrap from an initiative I'm involved in using creativity to inspire people to be greener. Narrator  And so he walked  and as he walked he saw things. Strange and wonderful things he would not otherwise have seen. A deer with an itchy leg. A flying motorcycle. A father and daughter separated from a bicycle by a mysterious wall. And then he stopped. Walking in front of him was her. The woman who as a child had skipped with him through fields and broken his heart. Sure  she had aged a little. In fact  she had aged a lot. But he felt all his old passion for her return.  Ford   he called softly. For that was her name.  Don't say another word  Gusty   she said  for that was his name.  I know a tent next to a caravan  exactly     yards from here. Let's go there and make love. In the tent.  Ford undressed. She spread one leg  and then the other. Gusty entered her boldly and made love to her rhythmically while she filmed him  because she was a keen amateur pornographer. The earth moved for both of them. And they lived together happily ever after. And all because he decided to walk that day. Andy Hobsbawm  We've got the science  we've had the debate. The moral imperative is on the table. Great creativity is needed to take it all  make it simple and sharp. To make it connect. To make it make people want to act. So this is a call  a plea  to the incredibly talented TED community. Let's get creative against climate change. And let's do it soon. Thank you. Unless we do something to prevent it  over the next    years we re facing an epidemic of neurologic diseases on a global scale. A cheery thought. On this map  every country that s colored blue has more than    percent of its population over the age of   . This is the world we live in. And this is the world your children will live in. For        years  the distribution of ages in the human population has looked like a pyramid  with the oldest on top. It s already flattening out. By       it s going to be a column and will start to invert. This is why it s happening. The average lifespan s more than doubled since       and it s increasing currently at the rate of about five hours every day. And this is why that s not entirely a good thing  because over the age of     your risk of getting Alzheimer s or Parkinson s disease will increase exponentially. By       there ll be about    million people in the United States over the age of     and unless we do something about it  half of them will have Alzheimer s disease and three million more will have Parkinson s disease. Right now  those and other neurologic diseases    for which we have no cure or prevention    cost about a third of a trillion dollars a year. It will be well over a trillion dollars by     . Alzheimer s disease starts when a protein that should be folded up properly misfolds into a kind of demented origami. So one approach we re taking is to try to design drugs that function like molecular Scotch tape  to hold the protein into its proper shape. That would keep it from forming the tangles that seem to kill large sections of the brain when they do. Interestingly enough  other neurologic diseases which affect very different parts of the brain also show tangles of misfolded protein  which suggests that the approach might be a general one  and might be used to cure many neurologic diseases  not just Alzheimer s disease. There s also a fascinating connection to cancer here  because people with neurologic diseases have a very low incidence of most cancers. And this is a connection that most people aren t pursuing right now  but which we re fascinated by. Most of the important and all of the creative work in this area is being funded by private philanthropies. And there s tremendous scope for additional private help here  because the government has dropped the ball on much of this  I m afraid. In the meantime  while we re waiting for all these things to happen  here s what you can do for yourself. If you want to lower your risk of Parkinson s disease  caffeine is protective to some extent  nobody knows why. Head injuries are bad for you. They lead to Parkinson s disease. And the Avian Flu is also not a good idea. As far as protecting yourself against Alzheimer s disease  well  it turns out that fish oil has the effect of reducing your risk for Alzheimer s disease. You should also keep your blood pressure down  because chronic high blood pressure is the biggest single risk factor for Alzheimer s disease. It s also the biggest risk factor for glaucoma  which is just Alzheimer s disease of the eye. And of course  when it comes to cognitive effects   use it or lose it  applies  so you want to stay mentally stimulated. But hey  you re listening to me. So you ve got that covered. And one final thing. Wish people like me luck  okay  Because the clock is ticking for all of us. Thank you. The north coast of California has rainforests    temperate rainforests    where it can rain more than     inches a year. This is the realm of the Coast Redwood tree. Its species name is Sequoia sempervirens. Sequoia sempervirens is the tallest living organism on Earth. The range of the species goes up to as much as     feet tall. That's    stories tall. These are trees that would stand out in midtown Manhattan. Nobody knows how old the oldest living Coast Redwoods are because nobody has ever drilled into any of them to count their annual growth rings  and  in any case  the centers of the oldest individuals appear to be hollow. But it's believed that the oldest living Redwoods are perhaps       years old    roughly the age of the Parthenon    although it's also suspected that there may be individual trees that are older than that. You can see the range of the Coast Redwoods. It's here  in red. The largest individuals of this species  the dreadnoughts of their kind  live just on the north coast of California  where the rain is really intense. In recent historic times  about    percent of the Coast Redwood forest was cut down  especially in a series of bursts of intense liquidation logging  clear cutting that took place in the     s through the early     s. Even so  about four percent of the primeval Redwood rainforest remains intact  wild and now protected    entirely protected    in a chain of small parks strung out like pearls along the north coast of California  including Redwood National Park. But curiously  Redwood rainforests  the fragments that we have left  to this day remain under explored. Redwood rainforest is incredibly difficult to move through  and even today  individual trees are being discovered that have never been seen before  including  in the summer of       Hyperion  the world's tallest tree. I'm going to do a little Gedanken experiment. I'm going to ask you to imagine what a Redwood really is as a living organism. And  Chris  if I could have you up here  I have a tape measure. It's a kind loaner from TED. And Chris  if you could take the end of that tape measure  We're going to show you what the diameter at breast height of a big Redwood is. Unfortunately  this tape isn't long enough    it's only a    foot tape. Chris  could you extend your arm out that way  There we go. OK. And maybe about here  about    feet  is the diameter of a big Redwood. Now  let your imagination go upward into space. Think about this tree  rising upward into Redwood space      feet     stories  an individual living organism articulating its forms upward into space over long periods of time. The Redwood species seems to exist in another kind of time  not human time  but what we might call Redwood time. Redwood time moves at a more stately pace than human time. To us  when we look at a Redwood tree  it seems to be motionless and still  and yet Redwoods are constantly in motion  moving upward into space  articulating themselves and filling Redwood space over Redwood time  over thousands of years. Plant this small seed  wait       years  and you get this  the Lost Monarch. It dwells in the Grove of Titans on the north coast  and was discovered in     . And yet  when you look at the base of a Redwood tree  you're not seeing the organism. You're like a mouse looking at the foot of an elephant  and most of the organism is overhead  unseen. I became very interested  and I wrote about a couple. Steve Sillett and Marie Antoine are the principal explorers of the Redwood forest canopy. They're world class athletes  and they also are world class forest ecology scientists. Steve Sillett  when he was a    year old college student at Reed College  had heard that the Redwood forest canopy is considered to be a so called Redwood desert. That is to say  at that time it was believed that there was nothing up there except the branches of Redwood trees. And with a friend of his  he took it upon himself to free climb a Redwood without ropes or any equipment to see what was up there. He climbed up a small tree next to this giant Redwood  and then he leaped through space and grabbed a branch with his hands  and ended up hanging  like catching a bar of a trapeze. And then  from there  he climbed directly up the bark until he got to the top of the tree. His friend  a guy named Marwood Harris  was following behind. Neither one of them had noticed that there was a Yellow Jacket wasp's nest the size of a bowling ball hanging from the branch that Steve had jumped into. And when Marwood made the jump  he was covered with wasps stinging him in the face and eyes. He nearly let go. He would have fallen to his death  being    feet above the ground. But they made it to the top  and what they found was not a Redwood desert  but a lost world    a kind of three dimensional labyrinth in the air  filled with unknown life. Now  I had been working on other topics  the emergence of infectious diseases  which come out of the natural ecosystems of the Earth  make a trans species jump  and get into humans. After three books on this  it got to be a bit much  in a way. My wife and I adore our children. And I began climbing trees with my kids as just something to do with them  using the so called arborist climbing technique  with ropes. You use ropes to get yourself up into the crown of a tree. Children are incredibly adept at climbing trees. That's my son  Oliver. They don't seem to suffer from the same fear of heights that humans do. If ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny  then children are somewhat closer to our roots as primates in the arboreal forest. Humans appear to be the only primates that I know of that are afraid of heights. All other primates  when they're scared  they run up a tree  where they feel safe. We camped overnight in the trees  in tree boats. This is my daughter Laura  then     looking out of a tree boat. She's  by the way  tied in with a rope so she can't fall. Looking out of a tree boat in the morning and hearing birdsong coming in three dimensions around us. We had been visited in the night by flying squirrels  who don't seem to recognize humans for what they are because they've never seen them in the canopy before. And we practiced advanced techniques like sky walking  where you can move from tree to tree through space  rather like Spiderman. It became a writing project. When Steve Sillett gets up into a big Redwood  he fires an arrow  which trails a fishing line  which gets over a branch in the tree  and then you ascend up a rope which has been dragged into the tree by the line. You ascend    stories. There are two people climbing this tree  Gaya  which is thought to be one of the oldest Redwoods. There they are. They are only one seventh of the way up that tree. You do feel a sense of exposure. There is a small person right down there on the ground. You feel like you're climbing a wall of wood. But then you enter the Redwood canopy  and it's like coming through a layer of clouds. And all of a sudden  you lose sight of the ground  and you also lose sight of the sky  and you're in a three dimensional labyrinth in the air filled with hanging gardens of ferns growing out of soil  which is populated with all kinds of small organisms. There are epiphytes  plants that grow on trees. These are huckleberry bushes. Many species of mosses  and then all sorts of lichens just plastering the tree. When you get near the top of the tree  you feel like you can't fall    in fact  it's difficult to move. You're worming your way through branches which are crowded with living things that don't occur near the ground. It's like scuba diving into a coral reef  except you're going upward instead of downward. And then the trees tend to flare out into platform like areas at the top. Maria's sitting on one of them. These limbs could be five to six hundred years old. Redwoods grow very slowly in their tops. They also have a feature  thickets of huckleberry bushes that grow out of the tops of Redwood trees that are technically known as huckleberry afros  and you can sit there and snack on the berries while you're resting. Redwoods have an enormous surface area that extends upward into space because they have a propensity to do something called reiteration. A Redwood is a fractal. And as they put out limbs  the limbs burst into small trees  copies of the Redwood. Now  here we see a reiteration in Chronos  one of the older Redwoods. This reiteration is a huge flying buttress that comes out the tree itself. This buttress is less than halfway up the tree. And then it bursts into a forest of Redwoods. This particular extra trunk is a meter across at the base and extends upward for     feet. It's as big as any of the biggest trees east of the Mississippi River  and yet it's only a minor feature on Chronos. This three dimensional map of the crown structure of a Redwood named Iluvatar  made by Steve Sillett  Marie Antoine and their colleagues  gives you an idea. What you're seeing here is a hierarchical schematic development of the trunks of this tree as it has elaborated itself over time into six layers of fractal  of trunks springing from trunks springing from trunks. I asked Steve to put a human being in this to give a sense of scale. There's the person  right there. The person is waving to us. I've wanted to ask Craig Venter if it would be possible to insert a synthetic chromosome into a human so that we could reiterate ourselves if we wanted to. And if we were able to reiterate  then the fingers of our hand would be people who looked like us  and they would have people on their hands and so on. And if we had Redwood like biology  we would have six layers of people on our hands  as it were. And it would be a lovely thing to be able to wave to someone and have all our reiterations wave at the same time. To reiterate the point  let's go closer into Iluvatar. We're looking at that yellow box. And this hallucinatory drawing shows you    everything you see in this drawing is Iluvatar. These are millennial structures    portions of the tree that are believed to be more than       years old. There are four humans in this shot    one  two  three  four. And there's also something that I want to show you. This is a flying buttress. Redwoods grow back into themselves as they expand into space  and this flying buttress is a limb shot out of that small trunk  going back into the main trunk and fusing with it. Flying buttresses  just as in a cathedral  help strengthen the crown of the tree and help the tree exist longer through time. The scientists are doing all kinds of experiments in these trees. They've wired them like patients in an ICU. They're finding out that Redwoods can move moisture out of the air and down into their trunks  possibly all the way into their root systems. They also have the ability to put roots anywhere in the tree itself. If a portion of a Redwood is rotting  the Redwood will send roots into its own form and draw nutrients out of itself as it falls apart. If we had Redwood like biology  if we got a touch of gangrene in our arm then we could just  you know  extract the nutrients extract the nutrients and the moisture out of it until it fell off. Canopy soil can occur up to a meter deep  hundreds of feet above the ground  and there are organisms in this soil that have  as yet  no names. This is an unnamed species of copepod. A copepod is a crustacean. These copepods are a major constituent of the oceans  and they are a major part of the diet of grazing baleen whales. What they're doing in the Redwood forest canopy soil hundreds of feet above the ocean  or how they got there  is completely unknown. There are some interesting theories that  if I had time  I would tell you about. But as you go and you look closer at a tree  what you see is  you see increasing complexity. We're looking at the very top of Gaya  which is thought to be the oldest Redwood. Gaya may be       to       years old  no one really knows  but its top has broken off and it's been rotting back now. This little Japanese garden like creation probably took     years to form in its complexity that we see right now. As you look at a tree  it takes a magnifying glass to see a giant tree. I have to show you something unfortunately very sad at the conclusion of this talk. The Eastern Hemlock tree has often been described as the Redwood of the East. And we're moving in a full circle now. In the     s  a small organism appeared in Richmond  Virginia  called the Hemlock woolly adelgid. It made a trans species jump out of some other organism in Asia  where it was living on Hemlock trees in Asia. When it moved into its new host  the Eastern Hemlock tree  it escaped its predators  and the new tree had no resistance to it. The Eastern Hemlock forest is being considered in some ways the last fragments of primeval rainforest east of the Mississippi River. I hadn't even known that there were rainforests in the east  but in Great Smoky Mountains National Park it can rain up to     inches of rain a year. And in the last two to three summers  these invasive organisms  this kind of Ebola of the trees  as it were  has swept through the primeval Hemlock forest of the east  and has absolutely wiped it out. I climbed there this past summer. This is Great Smoky Mountains National Park  and the Hemlocks are dead as far as the eye can see. And what we're seeing is not just the potential death of the Eastern Hemlock species    that is to say  its extinction from nature due to this invading parasite    but we're also seeing the death of an incredibly complex ecosystem for which these trees are merely the substrate for the aerial labyrinth of the sky that exists in their crowns. It's absolutely heartbreaking to see. One of the things that is just    I almost can't conceive it    is the idea that the national news media hasn't picked this up at all  and this is the devastation of one of the most important ecosystems in North America. What can the Redwoods tell us about ourselves  Well  I think they can tell us something about human time. The flickering  transitory quality of human time and the brevity of human life    the necessity to love. But we're different from trees  and they can also teach us something about ourselves in the differences that we have. We are human  and we have the capacity to love  we have the capacity to wonder  and we have a sort of boundless curiosity  a restless inquisitiveness that so suits us as primates  I think. And at least for me  personally  the trees have taught me an entirely new way of loving my children. Exploring with them the forest canopy has been one of the most lovely things of my existence on Earth. And I think that one of the happiest things is the sense that with my children I've been able to introduce them into the very small circle of humans who are lucky enough  or possibly stupid enough  to still climb trees. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  I think at a previous TED  I think it was Nathan Myhrvold who told me that it was thought that because these trees are like        years and older  on many of them there are ecosystems where there are species that are not found anywhere on the Earth except on that one tree. Is that correct  Richard Preston  Yes  that is correct. I mentioned Hyperion  the world's tallest tree. And I was a member of a climbing team that made the first climb of it  in     . And while we were climbing Hyperion  Marie Antoine spotted an unknown species of golden brown ant about halfway up the trunk. Ants are not known to occur in Redwood trees  curiously enough  and we wondered whether this ant  this species of ant  was only endemic to that one tree  or possibly to that grove. And in subsequent climbs they could never find that ant again  and so no specimens have ever been collected. We don't know what it is    we just know it's there. CA  So  you have to wonder when  you know  if some other species than us was recording the stories that mattered on Earth  you know  our stories are about Iraq and war and politics and celebrity gossip. You've just told us a different story of this tragic arms race that's happening  and maybe whole ecosystems gone forever. It's an amazing sense of wonder you've given me  and a sense of just how fragile this whole thing is. RP  It is fragile  and you know  I think about emerging human diseases    parasites that move into the human species. But that's just a very small facet of a much greater problem of invasions of species worldwide  all through the ecosystems  and you know  the Earth itself    CA  Partly caused by us  inadvertently. RP  Caused by humans. Caused by the movement of humans. You can think of the Earth's biosphere as a palace  and the continents are rooms in the palace  and the islands are small rooms. But lately  the doors of the palace have been flung open  and the walls are coming down. CA  Richard Preston  thank you very much  I think. RP  Thank you. You know  we're going to do things a little differently. I'm not going to show you a presentation. I'm going to talk to you. And at the same time  we're going to look at just images from a photo stream that is pretty close to live of things that    snapshots from Second Life. So hopefully this will be fascinating. You can    I can compete for your attention with the strange pictures that you see on screen that come from there. I thought I'd talk a little bit about some just big ideas about this  and then get John back out here so we can talk interactively a little bit more and think and ask questions. You know  I guess the first question is  why build a virtual world at all  And I think the answer to that is always going to be at least driven to a certain extent by the people initially crazy enough to start the project  you know. So I can give you a little bit of first background just on me and what moved me as a    really going back as far as a teenager and then an adult  to actually try and build this kind of thing. I was a very creative kid who read a lot  and got into electronics first  and then later  programming computers  when I was really young. I was just always trying to make things. I was just obsessed with taking things apart and building things  and just anything I could do with my hands or with wood or electronics or metal or anything else. And so  for example    and it's a great Second Life thing    I had a bedroom. And every kid  you know  as a teenager  has got his bedroom he retreats to    but I wanted my door  I thought it would be cool if my door went up rather than opened  like on Star Trek. I thought it would be neat to do that. And so I got up in the ceiling and I cut through the ceiling joists  much to my parents' delight  and put the door  you know  being pulled up through the ceiling. I built    I put a garage door opener up in the attic that would pull this door up. You can imagine the amount of time that it took me to do this to the house and the displeasure of my parents. The thing that was always striking to me was that we as people could have so many really amazing ideas about things we'd like to do  but are so often unable  in the real world  to actually do those things    to actually cobble together the materials and go through the actual execution phase of building something that you imagine from a design perspective. And so for me  I know that when the Internet came around and I was doing computer programming and just  you know  just generally trying to run my own little company and figure out what to do with the Internet and with computers  I was just immediately struck by how the ultimate thing that you would really want to do with the Internet and with computers would be to use the Internet and connected computers to simulate a world to sort of recreate the laws of physics and the rules of how things went together    the sort of    the idea of atoms and how to make things  and do that inside a computer so that we could all get in there and make stuff. And so for me that was the thing that was so enticing. I just wanted this place where you could build things. And so I think you see that in the genesis of what has happened with Second Life  and I think it's important. I also think that more generally  the use of the Internet and technology as a kind of a space between us for creativity and design is a general trend. It is a    sort of a great human progress. Technology is just generally being used to allow us to create in as shared and social a way as possible. And I think that Second Life and virtual worlds more generally represent the best we can do to achieve that right now. You know  another way to look at that  and related to the content and  you know  thinking about space  is to connect sort of virtual worlds to space. I thought that might be a fun thing to talk about for a second. If you think about going into space  it's a fascinating thing. So many movies  so many kids  we all sort of dream about exploring space. Now  why is that  Stop for a moment and ask  why that conceit  Why do we as people want to do that  I think there's a couple of things. It's what we see in the movies    you know  it's this dream that we all share. One is that if you went into space you'd be able to begin again. In some sense  you would become someone else in that journey  because there wouldn't be    you'd leave society and life as you know it  behind. And so inevitably  you would transform yourself    irreversibly  in all likelihood    as you began this exploration. And then the second thing is that there's this tangible sense that if you travel far enough  you can find out there    oh  yeah    you have no idea what you're going to find once you get there  into space. It's going to be different than here. And in fact  it's going to be so different than what we see here on earth that anything is going to be possible. So that's kind of the idea    we as humans crave the idea of creating a new identity and going into a place where anything is possible. And I think that if you really sit and think about it  virtual worlds  and where we're going with more and more computing technology  represent essentially the likely  really tactically possible version of space exploration. We are moved by the idea of virtual worlds because  like space  they allow us to reinvent ourselves and they contain anything and everything  and probably anything could happen there. You know  to give you a size idea about scale  you know  comparing space to Second Life  most people don't realize  kind of    and then this is just like the Internet in the early '  s. In fact  Second Life virtual worlds are a lot like the Internet in the early '  s today  everybody's very excited  there's a lot of hype and excitement about one idea or the next from moment to moment  and then there's despair and everybody thinks the whole thing's not going to work. Everything that's happening with Second Life and more broadly with virtual worlds  all happened in the early '  s. We always play a game at the office where you can take any article and find the same article where you just replace the words  Second Life  with  Web   and  virtual reality  with  Internet.  You can find exactly the same articles written about everything that people are observing. To give you an idea of scale  Second Life is about        CPUs at this point. It's about        computers connected together in three facilities in the United States right now  that are simulating this virtual space. And the virtual space itself    there's about         people a day that are wandering around in there  so the kind of  active population is something like a smallish city. The space itself is about    times the size of San Francisco  and it's about as densely built out. So it gives you an idea of scale. Now  it's expanding very rapidly    about five percent a month or so right now  in terms of new servers being added. And so of course  radically unlike the real world  and like the Internet  the whole thing is expanding very  very quickly  and historically exponentially. So that sort of space exploration thing is matched up here by the amount of content that's in there  and I think that amount is critical. It was critical with the virtual world that it be this space of truly infinite possibility. We're very sensitive to that as humans. You know  you know when you see it. You know when you can do anything in a space and you know when you can't. Second Life today is this        machines  and it's about     million or so user created objects where  you know  an object would be something like this  possibly interactive. Tens of millions of them are thinking all the time  they have code attached to them. So it's a really large world already  in terms of the amount of stuff that's there and that's very important. If anybody plays  like  World of Warcraft  World of Warcraft comes on  like  four DVDs. Second Life  by comparison  has about     terabytes of user created data  making it about        times larger. So again  like the Internet compared to AOL  and the sort of chat rooms and content on AOL at the time  what's happening here is something very different  because the sheer scale of what people can do when they're enabled to do anything they want is pretty amazing. The last big thought is that it is almost certainly true that whatever this is going to evolve into is going to be bigger in total usage than the Web itself. And let me justify that with two statements. Generically  what we use the Web for is to organize  exchange  create and consume information. It's kind of like Irene talking about Google being data driven. I'd say I kind of think about the world as being information. Everything that we interact with  all the experiences that we have  is kind of us flowing through a sea of information and interacting with it in different ways. The Web puts information in the form of text and images. The topology  the geography of the Web is text to text links for the most part. That's one way of organizing information  but there are two things about the way you access information in a virtual world that I think are the important ways that they're very different and much better than what we've been able to do to date with the Web. The first is that  as I said  the    well  the first difference for virtual worlds is that information is presented to you in the virtual world using the most powerful iconic symbols that you can possibly use with human beings. So for example  C H A I R is the English word for that  but a picture of this is a universal symbol. Everybody knows what it means. There's no need to translate it. It's also more memorable if I show you that picture  and I show you C H A I R on a piece of paper. You can do tests that show that you'll remember that I was talking about a chair a couple of days later a lot better. So when you organize information using the symbols of our memory  using the most common symbols that we've been immersed in all our lives  you maximally both excite  stimulate  are able to remember  transfer and manipulate data. And so virtual worlds are the best way for us to essentially organize and experience information. And I think that's something that people have talked about for    years    you know  that  D  that lifelike environments are really important in some magical way to us. But the second thing    and I think this one is less obvious    is that the experience of creating  consuming  exploring that information is in the virtual world implicitly and inherently social. You are always there with other people. And we as humans are social creatures and must  or are aided by  or enjoy more  the consumption of information in the presence of others. It's essential to us. You can't escape it. When you're on Amazon.com and you're looking for digital cameras or whatever  you're on there right now  when you're on the site  with like       other people  but you can't talk to them. You can't just turn to the people that are browsing digital cameras on the same page as you  and ask them   Hey  have you seen one of these before  Because I'm thinking about buying it.  That experience of like  shopping together  just as a simple example  is an example of how as social creatures we want to experience information in that way. So that second point  that we inherently experience information together or want to experience it together  is critical to essentially  kind of  this trend of where we're going to use technology to connect us. And so I think  again  that it's likely that in the next decade or so these virtual worlds are going to be the most common way as human beings that we kind of use the electronics of the Internet  if you will  to be together  to consume information. You know  mapping in India    that's such a great example. Maybe the solution there involves talking to other people in real time. Asking for advice  rather than any possible way that you could just statically organize a map. So I think that's another big point. I think that wherever this is all going  whether it's Second Life or its descendants  or something broader that happens all around the world at a lot of different points    this is what we're going to see the Internet used for  and total traffic and total unique users is going to invert  so that the Web and its bibliographic set of text and graphical information is going to become a tool or a part of that consumption pattern  but the pattern itself is going to happen mostly in this type of an environment. Big idea  but I think highly defensible. So let me stop there and bring John back  and maybe we can just have a longer conversation. Thank you. John. That's great. John Hockenberry  Why is the creation  the impulse to create Second Life  not a utopian impulse  Like for example  in the   th century  any number of works of literature that imagined alternative worlds were explicitly utopian. Philip Rosedale  I think that's great. That's such a deep question. Yeah. Is a virtual world likely to be a utopia  would be one way I'd say it. The answer is no  and I think the reason why is because the Web itself as a good example is profoundly bottoms up. That idea of infinite possibility  that magic of anything can happen  only happens in an environment where you really know that there's a fundamental freedom at the level of the individual actor  at the level of the Lego blocks  if you will  that make up the virtual world. You have to have that level of freedom  and so I'm often asked that  you know  is there a  kind of  utopian or  is there a utopian tendency to Second Life and things like it  that you would create a world that has a grand scheme to it  Those top down schemes are alienating to just about everybody  even if you mean well when you build them. And what's more  human society  when it's controlled  when you set out a grand scheme of rules  a new way of people interacting  or a new way of laying out a city  or whatever  that stuff historically has never scaled much beyond  you know    I always laughingly say    the Mall of America  you know  which is like  the largest piece of centrally designed architecture that  you know  has been built. JH  The Kremlin was pretty big. PR  The Kremlin  yeah. That's true. The whole complex. JH  Give me a story of a tool you created at the beginning in Second Life that you were pretty sure people would want to use in the creation of their avatars or in communicating that people actually in practice said  no  I'm not interested in that at all  and name something that you didn't come up with that almost immediately people began to demand. PR  I'm sure I can think of multiple examples of both of those. One of my favorites. I had this feature that I built into Second Life    I was really passionate about it. It was an ability to kind of walk up close to somebody and have a more private conversation  but it wasn't instant messaging because you had to sort of befriend somebody. It was just this idea that you could kind of have a private chat. I just remember it was one of those examples of data driven design. I thought it was such a good idea from my perspective  and it was just absolutely never used  and we ultimately    I think we've now turned it off  if I remember. We finally gave up  took it out of the code. But more generally  you know  one other example I think about this  which is great relative to the utopian idea. Second Life originally had    simulators. It now has       . So when it only had     it was only about as big as this college campus. And we had    we zoned it  you know  we put a nightclub  we put a disco where you could dance  and then we had a place where you could fight with guns if you wanted to  and we had another place that was like a boardwalk  kind of a Coney Island. And we laid out the zoning  but of course  people could build all around it however they wanted to. And what was so amazing right from the start was that the idea that we had put out in the zoning concept  basically  was instantly and thoroughly ignored  and like  two months into the whole thing     which is really a small amount of time  even in Second Life time    I remember the users  the people who were then using Second Life  the residents came to me and said  we want to buy the disco    because I had built it    we want to buy that land and raze it and put houses on it. And I sold it to them    I mean  we transferred ownership and they had a big party and blew up the entire building. And I remember that that was just so telling  you know  that you didn't know exactly what was going to happen. When you think about stuff that people have built that's popular    JH  CBGB's has to close eventually  you know. That's the rule. PR  Exactly. And it    but it closed on day one  basically  in Internet time. You know  an example of something    pregnancy. You can have a baby in Second Life. This is done entirely using  kind of  the tools that are built into Second Life  so the innate concept of becoming pregnant and having a baby  of course    Second Life is  at the platform level  at the level of the company    at Linden Lab    Second Life has no game properties to it whatsoever. There is no attempt to structure the experience  to make it utopian in that sense that we put into it. So of course  we never would have put a mechanism for having babies or  you know  taking two avatars and merging them  or something. But people built the ability to have babies and care for babies as a purchasable experience that you can have in Second Life and so    I mean  that's a pretty fascinating example of  you know  what goes on in the overall economy. And of course  the existence of an economy is another idea. I didn't talk about it  but it's a critical feature. When people are given the opportunity to create in the world  there's really two things they want. One is fair ownership of the things they create. And then the second one is    if they feel like it  and they're not going to do it in every case  but in many they are    they want to actually be able to sell that creation as a way of providing for their own livelihood. True on the Web    also true in Second Life. And so the existence of an economy is critical. JH  Questions for Philip Rosedale  Right here. JH  The observation is  Philip has been accused of looking like a character  an avatar  in Second Life. Respond  and then we'll get the rest of your question. PR  But I don't look like my avatar. How many people here know what my avatar looks like  That's probably not very many. JH  Are you ripping off somebody else's avatar with that  sort of    PR  No  no. I didn't. One of the other guys at work had a fantastic avatar    a female avatar    that I used to be once in a while. But my avatar is a guy wearing chaps. Spiky hair    spikier than this. Kind of orange hair. Handlebar mustache. Kind of a Village People sort of a character. So  very cool. JH  And your question  JH  The question is  there appears to be a lack of cultural fine tuning in Second Life. It doesn't seem to have its own culture  and the sort of differences that exist in the real world aren't translated into the Second Life map. PR  Well  first of all  we're very early  so this has only been going on for a few years. And so part of what we see is the same evolution of human behavior that you see in emerging societies. So a fair criticism    is what it is    of Second Life today is that it's more like the Wild West than it is like Rome  from a cultural standpoint. That said  the evolution of  and the nuanced interaction that creates culture  is happening at    times the speed of the real world  and in an environment where  if you walk into a bar in Second Life     percent of the people there are not in the United States  and in fact are speaking their  you know  various and different languages. In fact  one of the ways to make money in Second Life is to make really cool translators that you drag onto your body and they basically  kind of  pop up on your screen and allow you to use Google or Babel Fish or one of the other online text translators to on the fly translate spoken    I'm sorry    typed text between individuals. And so  the multicultural nature and the sort of cultural melting pot that's happening inside Second Life is quite    I think  quite remarkable relative to what in real human terms in the real world we've ever been able to achieve. So  I think that culture will fine tune  it will emerge  but we still have some years to wait while that happens  as you would naturally expect. JH  Other questions  Right here. JH  What's your demographic  PR  So  the question is  what's the demographic. So  the average age of a person in Second Life is     however  the use of Second Life increases dramatically as your physical age increases. So as you go from age    to age       and there are many people in their sixties using Second Life    this is also not a sharp curve    it's very  very distributed    usage goes up in terms of  like  hours per week by    percent as you go from age    to age    in real life  so there's not    many people make the mistake of believing that Second Life is some kind of an online game. Actually it's generally unappealing    I'm just speaking broadly and critically    it's not very appealing to people that play online video games  because the graphics are not yet equivalent to    I mean  these are very nice pictures  but in general the graphics are not quite equivalent to the fine tuned graphics that you see in a Grand Theft Auto  . So average age    . I mentioned    percent of the users are not in the United States. The distribution amongst countries is extremely broad. There's users from  you know  virtually every country in the world now in Second Life. The dominant ones are    if you take the UK and Europe  together they make up about    percent of the usage base in Second Life. In terms of psychographic    oh  men and women  men and women are almost equally matched in Second Life  so about    percent of the people online right now on Second Life are women. Women use Second Life  though  about    to    percent more  on an hours basis  than men do  meaning that more men sign up than women  and more women stay and use it than men. So that's another demographic fact. In terms of psychographic  you know  the people in Second Life are remarkably dissimilar relative to what you might think  when you go in and talk to them and meet them  and I would  you know  challenge you to just do this and find out. But it's not a bunch of programmers. It's not easy to describe as a demographic. If I had to just sort of paint a broad picture  I'd say  remember the people who were really getting into eBay in the first few years of eBay  Maybe a little bit like that  in other words  people who are early adopters. They tend to be creative. They tend to be entrepreneurial. A lot of them    about        people so far    are cash flow positive  they're making money from what    I mean  real world money    from what they're doing in Second Life  so it's a very build    still a creative  building things  build your own business type of an orientation. So  that's it. JH  You describe yourself  Philip  as someone who was really creative when you were young and  you know  liked to make things. I mean  it's not often that you hear somebody describe themselves as really creative. I suspect that's possibly a euphemism for C student who spent a lot of time in his room  Is it possible  PR  I was a    there were times I was a C student. You know  it's funny. When I got to college    I studied physics in college    and I got really    it was funny  because I was definitely a more antisocial kid. I read all the time. I was shy. I don't seem like it now  but I was very shy. Moved around a bunch    had that experience too. So I did  kind of  I think  live in my own world  and obviously that helps  you know  engage your real interest in something. JH  So you're on your fifth life at this point  PR  If you count  yeah  cities. So    but I did    and I didn't do    I think I didn't do as well in school as I could have. I think you're right. I wasn't  like  an obsessed    you know  get A's kind of guy. I was going to say  I had a great social experience when I went to college that I hadn't had before  a more fraternal experience  where I met six or seven other guys who I studied physics with  and I was very competitive with them  so then I started to get A's. But you're right  I wasn't an A student. JH  Last question. Right here. JH  You want to paraphrase that  PR  Yeah  so let me restate that. So  you're saying that in the pamphlet there's a statement that we may come to prefer our digital selves to our real ones    our more malleable or manageable digital identities to our real identities    and that in fact  much of human life and human experience may move into the digital realm. And then that's kind of a horrifying thought  of course. That's a frightening change  frightening disruption. I guess  and you're asking  what do I think about that  How do I    JH  What's your response to the people who would say  that's horrifying  what would be your response   PR  Well  I'd say a couple of things. One is  it's disturbing like the Internet or electricity was. That is to say  it's a big change  but it isn't avoidable. So  no amount of backpedaling or intentional behavior or political behavior is going to keep these technology changes from connecting us together  because the basic motive that people have    to be creative and entrepreneurial    is going to drive energy into these virtual worlds in the same way that it has with the Web. So this change  I believe  is a huge disruptive change. Obviously  I'm the optimist and a big believer in what's going on here  but I think that as    even a sober  you know  the most sober  disconnected thinker about this  looking at it from the side  has to conclude  based on the data  that with those kinds of economic forces at play  there is definitely going to be a sea change  and that change is going to be intensely disruptive relative to our concept of our very lives and being  and our identities  as well. I don't think we can get away from those changes. I think generally  we were talking about this    I think that generally being present in a virtual world and being challenged by it  being    surviving there  having a good life there  so to speak  is a challenge because of the multiculturality of it  because of the languages  because of the entrepreneurial richness of it  the sort of flea market nature  if you will  of the virtual world today. It puts challenges on us to rise to. We must be better than ourselves  in many ways. We must learn things and  you know  be more tolerant  and be smarter and learn faster and be more creative  perhaps  than we are typically in our real lives. And I think that if that is true of virtual worlds  then these changes  though scary    and  I say  inevitable    are ultimately for the better  and therefore something that we should ride out. But I would say that    and many other authors and speakers about this  other than me  have said  you know  fasten your seat belts because the change is coming. There are going to be big changes. JH  Philip Rosedale  thank you very much. People love their automobiles. They allow us to go where we want to when we want to. They're a form of entertainment  they're a form of art  a pride of ownership. Songs are written about cars. Prince wrote a great song   Little Red Corvette.  He didn't write  Little Red Laptop Computer  or  Little Red Dirt Devil.  He wrote about a car. And one of my favorites has always been   Make love to your man in a Chevy van   because that was my vehicle when I was in college. The fact is  when we do our market research around the world  we see that there's nearly a universal aspiration on the part of people to own an automobile. And     million people in the world today own a car. And you say  boy  that's a lot. But you know what  That's just    percent of the population. We really have to ask the question  Can the world sustain that number of automobiles  And if you look at projections over the next    to    to    years  it looks like the world car park could grow to on the order of  .  billion vehicles. Now  if you parked those end to end and wrapped them around the Earth  that would stretch around the Earth     times. Now  we've made great progress with automobile technology over the last     years. Cars are dramatically cleaner  dramatically safer  more efficient and radically more affordable than they were     years ago. But the fact remains  the fundamental DNA of the automobile has stayed pretty much the same. If we are going to reinvent the automobile today  rather than     years ago  knowing what we know about the issues associated with our product and about the technologies that exist today  what would we do  We wanted something that was really affordable. The fuel cell looked great  one tenth as many moving parts and a fuel cell propulsion system as an internal combustion engine    and it emits just water. And we wanted to take advantage of Moore's Law with electronic controls and software  and we absolutely wanted our car to be connected. So we embarked upon the reinvention around an electrochemical engine  the fuel cell  hydrogen as the energy carrier. First was Autonomy. Autonomy really set the vision for where we wanted to head. We embodied all of the key components of a fuel cell propulsion system. We then had Autonomy drivable with Hy Wire  and we showed Hy Wire here at this conference last year. Hy Wire is the world's first drivable fuel cell  and we have followed up that now with Sequel. And Sequel truly is a real car. So if we would run the video    But the real key question I'm sure that's on your mind  where's the hydrogen going to come from  And secondly  when are these kinds of cars going to be available  So let me talk about hydrogen first. The beauty of hydrogen is it can come from so many different sources  it can come from fossil fuels  it can come from any way that you can create electricity  including renewables. And it can come from biofuels. And that's quite exciting. The vision here is to have each local community play to its natural strength in creating the hydrogen. A lot of hydrogen's produced today in the world. It's produced to get sulfur out of gasoline    which I find is somewhat ironic. It's produced in the fertilizer industry  it's produced in the chemical manufacturing industry. That hydrogen's being made because there's a good business reason for its use. But it tells us that we know how to create it  we know how to create it cost effectively  we know how to handle it safely. We did an analysis where you would have a station in each city with each of the     largest cities in the United States  and located the stations so you'd be no more than two miles from a station at any time. We put one every    miles on the freeway  and it turns out that translates into about        stations. And at a million dollars each  that would be about    billion dollars. Now that's a lot of money. But if you built the Alaskan pipeline today  that's half of what the Alaskan pipeline would cost. But the real exciting vision that we see truly is home refueling  much like recharging your laptop or recharging your cellphone. So we're pretty excited about the future of hydrogen. We think it's a question of not whether  but a question of when. What we've targeted for ourselves    and we're making great progress for this goal    is to have a propulsion system based on hydrogen and fuel cells  designed and validated  that can go head to head with the internal combustion engine    we're talking about obsoleting the internal combustion engine    and do it in terms of its affordability  add skill volumes  its performance and its durability. So that's what we're driving to for     . We haven't seen anything yet in our development work that says that isn't possible. We actually think the future's going to be event driven. So since we can't predict the future  we want to spend a lot of our time trying to create that future. I'm very  very intrigued by the fact that our cars and trucks sit idle    percent of the time  they're parked  they're parked all around us. They're usually parked within     feet of the people that own them. Now  if you take the power generating capability of an automobile and you compare that to the electric grid in the United States  it turns out that four percent of the automobiles  the power in four percent of the automobiles  equals that of the electric grid of the US. that's a huge power generating capability  a mobile power generating capability. And hydrogen and fuel cells give us that opportunity to actually use our cars and trucks when they're parked to generate electricity for the grid. And we talked about swarm networks earlier. And talking about the ultimate swarm  about having all of the processors and all of the cars when they're sitting idle being part of a global grid for computing capability. We find that premise quite exciting. The automobile becomes  then  an appliance  not in a commodity sense  but an appliance  mobile power  mobile platform for information and computing and communication  as well as a form of transportation. And the key to all of this is to make it affordable  to make it exciting  to get it on a pathway where there's a way to make money doing it. And again  this is a pretty big march to take here. And a lot of people say  how do you sleep at night when you're rustling with a problem of that magnitude  And I tell them I sleep like a baby  I wake up crying every two hours. Actually the theme of this conference  I think  has hit on really one of the major keys to pull that off    and that's relationships and working together. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Larry  Larry  wait  wait  wait  wait  Larry  wait  wait one sec. Just    I've got so many questions I could ask you. I just want to ask one. You know  I could be wrong about this  but my sense is that in the public mind  today  that GM is not viewed as serious about some of these environmental ideas as some of your Japanese competitors  maybe even as Ford. Are you serious about it  and not just  you know  when the consumers want it  when the regulators force us to do it we will go there  Are you guys going to really try and show leadership on this  Larry Burns  Yeah  we're absolutely serious. We're into this over a billion dollars already  so I would hope people would think we're serious when we're spending that kind of money. And secondly  it's a fundamental business proposition. I'll be honest with you  we're into it because of business growth opportunities. We can't grow our business unless we solve these problems. The growth of the auto industry will be capped by sustainability issues if we don't solve the problems. And there's a simple principle of strategy that says  Do unto yourself before others do unto you. If we can see this possible future  others can too. And we want to be the first one to create it  Chris. In       Buckminster Fuller presented the particularly audacious proposal for the Geoscope. It was a     foot diameter geodesic sphere to be suspended over the East River in New York City  in full view of the United Nations. It was a big idea  for sure  and it was one that he felt could truly inform and deeply affect the decision making of this body through animations of global data  trends and other information regarding the globe  on this sphere. And today     years later  we clearly have no less need for this kind of clarity and perspective  but what we do have is improved technology. Today we don't need one million light bulbs to create a spherical display. We can use LEDs. LEDs are smaller  they're cheaper  they're longer lasting  they're more efficient. Most importantly for this  they're faster. And this speed  combined with today's high performance micro controllers  allows us to actually simulate  in this piece  over        LEDs    using just   . And the way this happens is through the phenomenon of persistence of vision. But as this ring rotates at about       rpm    that's    times per second. The equator's speed is actually about    miles per hour. There are four on board micro controllers that  each time this ring rotates it  as it passes the rear of the display  it picks up a position signal. And from that  the on board micro controllers can extrapolate the position of the ring at all points around the revolution and display arbitrary bitmap images and animations. But this is really just the beginning. In addition to higher resolution versions of this display  my father and I are working on a new patent pending design for a fully volumetric display using the same phenomenon. It achieves this by rotating LEDs about two axes. So as you can see here  this is a  eleven inch diameter circuit board. These blocks represent LEDs. And so you could see that as this disc rotates about this axis  it will create a disc of light that we can control. That's nothing new  that's a propeller clock  that's the rims that you can buy for your car. But what is new is that  when we rotate this disc about this axis  this disc of light actually becomes a sphere of light. And so we can control that with micro controllers and create a fully volumetric  three dimensional display with just     LEDs. Now this piece is currently in process    due out in May    but what we've done is we've put together a small demo  just to show the geometric translation of points into a sphere. I've got a little video to show you  but keep in mind that this is with no electronic control  and this is also with only four LEDs. This is actually only about  .  percent of what the final display will be in May. So  take a look. And here you can see it's rotating about the vertical axis only  creating circles. And then  as the other axis kicks in  those actually blur into a volume. And the shutter speed of the camera actually makes it slightly less effective in this case. But this piece is due out in May. It'll be on display at the Interactive Telecommunications Spring Show in Greenwich Village in New York City    that's open to the public  definitely invite you all to come and attend    it's a fantastic show. There are hundreds of student innovators with fantastic projects. This piece  actually  will be on display down in the Sierra Simulcast Lounge in the breaks between now and the end of the show. So I'd love to talk to you all  and invite you to come down and take a closer look. It's an honor to be here. Thanks very much. This is Aunt Zip from Sodom  North Carolina. She was     years old when I took this picture. She was always saying things that made me stop and think  like   Time may be a great healer  but it ain't no beauty specialist.  She said   Be good to your friends. Why  without them  you'd be a total stranger.  This is one of her songs. Let's see if we can get into the flow here and all do this one together. And I'm going to have Michael Manring play bass with me. Give him a big old hand. One  two  three  four. Well  my true love's a black eyed daisy  if I don't see her  I go crazy. My true love lives up the river  a few more jumps and I'll be with her. Hey  hey  black eyed Susie  Hey  hey  black eyed Susie  Hey  hey black eyed Susie  hey. Now you've got to picture Aunt Zip at     years old in Sodom  North Carolina. I'd go up and learn these old songs from her. She couldn't sing much  couldn't play anymore. And I'd pull her out on the front porch. Down below  there was her grandson plowing the tobacco field with a mule. A double outhouse over here on the side. And we'd sing this old song. She didn't have a whole lot of energy  so I'd sing   Hey  hey   and she'd just answer back with   Black eyed Susie.  Oh  hey  hey  black eyed Susie  Hey  hey  black eyed Susie  Hey  hey  black eyed Susie  hey. Well  she and I went blackberry picking. She got mad  I took a licking. Ducks on the millpond  geese in the ocean  Devil in the pretty girl when she takes a notion. Hey  hey  black eyed Susie  Hey  hey  black eyed Susie  Hey  hey black eyed Susie  hey. Let's have the banjo. Well  we'll get married next Thanksgiving. I'll lay around  she'll make a living. She'll cook blackjacks  I'll cook gravy  we'll have chicken someday  maybe. Hey  hey  hey  hey. Hey  hey  black eyed Susie  hey  One more time now. Oh  hey  hey  black eyed Susie  Hey  hey  black eyed Susie  Hey  hey  black eyed Susie  hey. Thank you  Michael. This is Ralph Stanley. When I was going to college at University of California at Santa Barbara in the College of Creative Studies  taking majors in biology and art  he came to the campus. This was in       I guess it was. And he played his bluegrass style of music  but near the end of the concert  he played the old timing style of banjo picking that came from Africa  along with the banjo. It's called claw hammer style  that he had learned from his mother and grandmother. I fell in love with that. I went up to him and said  how can I learn that  He said  well  you can go back to Clinch Mountain  where I'm from  or Asheville or Mount Airy  North Carolina    some place that has a lot of music. Because there's a lot of old people still living that play that old style. So I went back that very summer. I just fell in love with the culture and the people. And you know  I came back to school  I finished my degrees and told my parents I wanted to be a banjo player. You can imagine how excited they were. So I thought I would just like to show you some of the pictures I've taken of some of my mentors. Just a few of them  but maybe you'll get just a little hint of some of these folks. And play a little banjo. Let's do a little medley. Those last few pictures were of Ray Hicks  who just passed away last year. He was one of the great American folk tale tellers. The Old Jack tales that he had learned    he talked like this  you could hardly understand him. But it was really wonderful. And he lived in that house that his great grandfather had built. No running water  no electricity. A wonderful  wonderful guy. And you can look at more pictures. I've actually got a website that's got a bunch of photos that I've done of some of the other folks I didn't get a chance to show you. This instrument came up in those pictures. It's called the mouth bow. It is definitely the first stringed instrument ever in the world  and still played in the Southern mountains. Now  the old timers didn't take a fancy guitar string and make anything like this. They would just take a stick and a catgut and string it up. It was hard on the cats  but it made a great little instrument. It sounds something like this. Well  have you heard the many stories told by young and old with joy about the many deeds of daring that were done by the Johnson boys  You take Kate  I'll take Sal  we'll both have a Johnson gal. You take Kate  I'll take Sal  we'll both have a Johnson gal. Now  they were scouts in the rebels' army  they were known both far and wide. When the Yankees saw them coming  they'd lay down their guns and hide. You take Kate  I'll take Sal  we'll both have a Johnson gal. You take Kate  I'll take Sal  we'll both have a Johnson gal. Ain't that a sound  Well  it was       I guess it was. We were driving in the car outside of Gatesville  Texas  where I grew up in the early part of my life. Outside of Gatesville we were coming back from the grocery store. My mom was driving  my brother and I were in the back seat. We were really mad at my mom. We looked out the window. We were surrounded by thousands of acres of cotton fields. You see  we'd just been to the grocery store  and my mom refused to buy us the jar of Ovaltine that had the coupon for the Captain Midnight decoder ring in it. And  buddy  that made us mad. Well  my mom didn't put up with much either  and she was driving  and she said   You boys  You think you can have anything you want. You don't know how hard it is to earn money. Your dad works so hard. You think money grows on trees. You've never worked a day in your lives. You boys make me so mad. You're going to get a job this summer.  She pulled the car over  she said   Get out of the car.  My brother and I stepped out of the car. We were standing on the edge of thousands of acres of cotton. There were about a hundred black folks out there picking. My mom grabbed us by the shoulders. She marched us out in the field. She went up to the foreman  she said   I've got these two little boys never worked a day in their lives.  Of course  we were just eight and   . She said   Would you put them to work   Well  that must have seemed like a funny idea to that foreman  put these two middle class little white boys out in a cotton field in August in Texas    it's hot. So he gave us each a cotton sack  about    feet long  about that big around  and we started picking. Now  cotton is soft but the outside of the plant is just full of stickers. And if you don't know what you're doing  your hands are bleeding in no time. And my brother and I started to pick it  and our hands were startin' to bleed  and then     Mom   And Mom was just sitting by the car like this. She wasn't going to give up. Well  the foreman could see he was in over his head  I guess. He kind of just snuck up behind us and he sang out in a low voice. He just sang   Well  there's a long white robe in heaven  I know. Don't want it to leave me behind. Well  there's a long white robe in heaven  I know. Don't want it to leave me behind.  And from all around as people started singing and answering back  he sang   Good news  good news  Chariot's coming. Good news  Chariot's coming. Good news  Chariot's coming. And I don't want it to leave me behind.  Now  my brother and I had never heard anything like that in our whole lives. It was so beautiful. We sat there all day picking cotton  without complaining  without crying  while they sang things like   Oh  Mary  don't you weep  don't you moan  and  Wade in the water   and  I done done    This little light of mine.  Finally  by the end of the day  we'd each picked about a quarter of a bag of cotton. But the foreman was kind enough to give us each a check for a dollar  but my mother would never let us cash it. I'm     still have the check. Now  my mother hoped that we learned from that the value of hard work. But if you have children  you know it doesn't often work that way. No  we learned something else. The first thing I learned that day was that I never ever wanted to work that hard again. And pretty much never did. But I also learned that some people in this world do have to work that hard every day  and that was an eye opener. And I also learned that a great song can make hard work go a little easier. And it also can bring the group together in a way that nothing else can. Now  I was just a little eight year old boy that day when my mama put me out of the car in that hot Texas cotton field. I wasn't even aware of music    not even aware of it. But that day in the cotton field out there picking  when those people started singing  I realized I was in the very heart of real music  and that's where I've wanted to be ever since. Try this old song with me. I sing  Well  there's a long white robe in heaven  I know. You sing  Don't want it to leave me behind. Well  there's a long white robe in heaven  I know. Don't want it to leave me behind. Good news  good news  Chariot's coming. Good news  Chariot's coming. Good news  Chariot's coming. And I don't want it to leave me    It's been a while since you guys have been picking your last bale of cotton  isn't it  Let's try it one more time. There's a starry crown in heaven  I know. Don't want it to leave me behind. There's a starry crown in heaven  I know. Don't want it to leave me behind. Good news  Chariot's coming. Good news  Chariot's coming. Good news  Chariot's coming. And I don't want it to leave me behind. It was a few years ago  but I sort of remembered this story  and I told it at a concert. My mom was in the audience. After the    she was glad to have a story about herself  of course  but after the concert she came up and she said   David  I've got to tell you something. I set that whole thing up. I set it up with the foreman. I set it up with the owner of the land. I just wanted you boys to learn the value of hard work. I didn't know it was going to make you fall in love with music though.  Let's try. Good news  Chariot's coming. Good news  Chariot's coming. Good news  Chariot's coming. And I don't want it to leave me behind. Well  this is the steel guitar. It's an American made instrument. It was originally made by the Dopyera Brothers  who later on made the Dobro  which is a wood bodied instrument with a metal cone for    where the sound comes from. It's usually played flat on your lap. It was made to play Hawaiian music back in the     s  before they had electric guitars  trying to make a loud guitar. And then African American folks figured out you could take a broken bottle neck  just like that    a nice Merlot works very well. That wine we had yesterday would have been perfect. Break it off  put it on your finger  and slide into the notes. This instrument pretty much saved my life. Fifteen years ago     years ago  I guess  this year  my wife and I lost our daughter  Sarah Jane  in a car accident  and it was the most    it almost took me out    it almost took me out of this world. And I think I learned a lot about what happiness was by going through such unbelievable grief  just standing on the edge of that abyss and just wanting to jump in. I had to make lists of reasons to stay alive. I had to sit down and make lists  because I was ready to go  I was ready to check out of this world. And you know  at the top of the list  of course  were Jenny  and my son  Zeb  my parents    I didn't want to hurt them. But then  when I thought about it beyond that  it was very simple things. I didn't care about    I had a radio show  I have a radio show on public radio   Riverwalk   I didn't care about that. I didn't care about awards or money or anything. Nothing. Nothing. On the list it would be stuff like  seeing the daffodils bloom in the spring  the smell of new mown hay  catching a wave and bodysurfing  the touch of a baby's hand  the sound of Doc Watson playing the guitar  listening to old records of Muddy Waters and Uncle Dave Macon. And for me  the sound of a steel guitar  because one of my parents' neighbors just gave me one of these things. And I would sit around with it  and I didn't know how to play it  but I would just play stuff as sad as I could play. And it was the only instrument that  of all the ones that I play  that would really make that connection. This is a song that came out of that. Well  I hear you're having trouble. Lord  I hate to hear that news. If you want to talk about it  you know  I will listen to you through. Words no longer say it  let me tell you what I always do. I just break off another bottleneck and play these steel guitar blues. People say   Oh  snap out of it   Oh yeah  that's easier said than done. While you can hardly move  they're running around having all kinds of fun. Sometimes I think it's better just to sink way down in your funky mood 'til you can rise up humming these steel guitar blues. Now  you can try to keep it all inside with drink and drugs and cigarettes  but you know that's not going to get you where you want to get. But I got some medicine here that just might shake things loose. Call me in the morning after a dose of these steel guitar blues. Open up now. Oh  I think I've got time to tell you about this. My dad was an inventor. We moved to California when Sputnik went up  in     . And he was working on gyroscopes  he has a number of patents for that kind of thing. And we moved across the street from Michael and John Whitney. They were about my age. John went on  and Michael did too  to become some of the inventors of computer animation. Michael's dad was working on something called the computer. This was       I was a little    year old kid  I didn't know what that was. But he took me down to see one  you know  what they were making. It was like a library  just full of vacuum tubes as far as you could see  just floors and floors of these things  and one of the engineers said  some day you're going to be able to put this thing in your pocket. I thought  damn  those are going to be some big pants  So that Christmas    maybe I've got time for this    that Christmas I got the Mister Wizard Fun o Rama chemistry set. Well  I wanted to be an inventor just like my dad  so did Michael. His great granddad had been Eli Whitney  the inventor of the cotton gin. So we looked in that    this was a commercial chemistry set. It had three chemicals we were really surprised to see  sulfur  potassium nitrate and charcoal. Man  we were only     but we knew that made gunpowder. We made up a little batch and we put it on the driveway and we threw a match and phew  it flared up. Ah  it was great. Well  obviously the next thing to do was build a cannon. So we went over into Michael's garage    his dad had all kinds of stuff  and we put a pipe in the vice there  and screwed a cap on the end of the pipe  drilled a hole in the back of the pipe  took some of our firecrackers  pulled out the fuses  tied them together  put them in the back there  and    down in that hole    and then stuffed some of our gunpowder down that pipe and put three ball bearings on the top  in the garage. We weren't stupid  we put up a sheet of plywood about five feet in front of it. We stood back  we lit that thing  and they flew out of there    they went through that plywood like it was paper. Through the garage. Two of them landed in the side door of his new Citroen. We tore everything down and buried it in his backyard. That was Pacific Palisades  it probably is still there  back there. Well  my brother heard that we had made gunpowder. He and his buddies  they were older  and they were pretty mean. They said they were going to beat us up if we didn't make some gunpowder for them. We said  well  what are you going to do with it  They said  we're going to melt it down and make rocket fuel. Sure. We'll make you a big batch. So we made them a big batch  and it was in my    now  we'd just moved here. We'd just moved to California. Mom had redone the kitchen  Mom was gone that day. We had a pie tin. It became Chris Berquist's job to do the melting down. Michael and I were standing way at the side of the kitchen. He said   Yeah  hey  it's melting. Yeah  the sulfur's melting. No problem. Yeah  you know.  It just flared up  and he turned around  and he looked like this. No hair  no eyelashes  no nothing. There were big welts all over my mom's kitchen cabinet  the air was the just full of black smoke. She came home  she took that chemistry set away  and we never saw it again. But we thought of it often  because every time she'd cook tuna surprise it made    tasted faintly of gunpowder. So I like to invent things too  and I think I'll close out my set with something I invented a good while back. When drum machines were new  I got to thinking  why couldn't you take the oldest form of music  the hambone rhythms  and combine it with the newest technology  I call this Thunderwear. At that time  drum triggers were new. And so I put them all together and sewed    of them in this suit. I showed you some of the hambone rhythms yesterday  I'm going to be doing some of the same ones. I have a trigger here  trigger here  here  here. Right there. It's going to really hurt if I don't take that off. Okay. Now  the drum triggers go out my tail here  into the drum machine  and they can make various sounds  like drums. So let me put them all together. And also  I can change the sounds by stepping on this pedal right here  and    let me just close out here by doing you a little hambone solo or something like this. Thank you  folks. So I understand that this meeting was planned  and the slogan was From Was to Still. And I am illustrating Still. Which  of course  I am not agreeing with because  although I am     I am not still working. And anybody who asks me   Are you still doing this or that   I don't answer because I'm not doing things still  I'm doing it like I always did. I still have    or did I use the word still  I didn't mean that. I have my file which is called To Do. I have my plans. I have my clients. I am doing my work like I always did. So this takes care of my age. I want to show you my work so you know what I am doing and why I am here. This was about     . All of these things were made during the last    years. But  of course  I'm working since     doing more or less what you see here. This is Castleton China. This was an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art. This is now for sale at the Metropolitan Museum. This is still at the Metropolitan Museum now for sale. This is a portrait of my daughter and myself. These were just some of the things I've made. I made hundreds of them for the last    years. I call myself a maker of things. I don't call myself an industrial designer because I'm other things. Industrial designers want to make novel things. Novelty is a concept of commerce  not an aesthetic concept. The industrial design magazine  I believe  is called  Innovation.  Innovation is not part of the aim of my work. Well  makers of things  they make things more beautiful  more elegant  more comfortable than just the craftsmen do. I have so much to say. I have to think what I am going to say. Well  to describe our profession otherwise  we are actually concerned with the playful search for beauty. That means the playful search for beauty was called the first activity of Man. Sarah Smith  who was a mathematics professor at MIT  wrote   The playful search for beauty was Man's first activity    that all useful qualities and all material qualities were developed from the playful search for beauty.  These are tiles. The word   playful  is a necessary aspect of our work because  actually  one of our problems is that we have to make  produce  lovely things throughout all of life  and this for me is now    years. So how can you  without drying up  make things with the same pleasure  as a gift to others  for so long  The playful is therefore an important part of our quality as designer. Let me tell you some about my life. As I said  I started to do these things    years ago. My first exhibition in the United States was at the Sesquicentennial exhibition in         that the Hungarian government sent one of my hand drawn pieces as part of the exhibit. My work actually took me through many countries  and showed me a great part of the world. This is not that they took me    the work didn't take me    I made the things particularly because I wanted to use them to see the world. I was incredibly curious to see the world  and I made all these things  which then finally did take me to see many countries and many cultures. I started as an apprentice to a Hungarian craftsman  and this taught me what the guild system was in Middle Ages. The guild system  that means when I was an apprentice  I had to apprentice myself in order to become a pottery master. In my shop where I studied  or learned  there was a traditional hierarchy of master  journeyman and learned worker  and apprentice  and I worked as the apprentice. The work as an apprentice was very primitive. That means I had to actually learn every aspect of making pottery by hand. We mashed the clay with our feet when it came from the hillside. After that  it had to be kneaded. It had to then go in  kind of  a mangle. And then finally it was prepared for the throwing. And there I really worked as an apprentice. My master took me to set ovens because this was part of oven making  oven setting  in the time. And finally  I had received a document that I had accomplished my apprenticeship successfully  that I had behaved morally  and this document was given to me by the Guild of Roof Coverers  Rail Diggers  Oven Setters  Chimney Sweeps and Potters. I also got at the time a workbook which explained my rights and my working conditions  and I still have that workbook. First I set up a shop in my own garden  and made pottery which I sold on the marketplace in Budapest. And there I was sitting  and my then boyfriend    I didn't mean it was a boyfriend like it is meant today    but my boyfriend and I sat at the market and sold the pots. My mother thought that this was not very proper  so she sat with us to add propriety to this activity. However  after a while there was a new factory being built in Budapest  a pottery factory  a large one. And I visited it with several ladies  and asked all sorts of questions of the director. Then the director asked me  why do you ask all these questions  I said  I also have a pottery. So he asked me  could he please visit me  and then finally he did  and explained to me that what I did now in my shop was an anachronism  that the industrial revolution had broken out  and that I rather should join the factory. There he made an art department for me where I worked for several months. However  everybody in the factory spent his time at the art department. The director there said there were several women casting and producing my designs now in molds  and this was sold also to America. I remember that it was quite successful. However  the director  the chemist  model maker    everybody    concerned himself much more with the art department    that means  with my work    than making toilets  so finally they got a letter from the center  from the bank who owned the factory  saying  make toilet setting behind the art department  and that was my end. So this gave me the possibility because now I was a journeyman  and journeymen also take their satchel and go to see the world. So as a journeyman  I put an ad into the paper that I had studied  that I was a down to earth potter's journeyman and I was looking for a job as a journeyman. And I got several answers  and I accepted the one which was farthest from home and practically  I thought  halfway to America. And that was in Hamburg. Then I first took this job in Hamburg  at an art pottery where everything was done on the wheel  and so I worked in a shop where there were several potters. And the first day  I was coming to take my place at the turntable    there were three or four turntables    and one of them  behind where I was sitting  was a hunchback  a deaf mute hunchback  who smelled very bad. So I doused him in cologne every day  which he thought was very nice  and therefore he brought bread and butter every day  which I had to eat out of courtesy. The first day I came to work in this shop there was on my wheel a surprise for me. My colleagues had thoughtfully put on the wheel where I was supposed to work a very nicely modeled natural man's organs. After I brushed them off with a hand motion  they were very    I finally was now accepted  and worked there for some six months. This was my first job. If I go on like this  you will be here till midnight. So I will try speed it up a little Moderator  Eva  we have about five minutes. Eva Zeisel  Are you sure  Moderator  Yes  I am sure. EZ  Well  if you are sure  I have to tell you that within five minutes I will talk very fast. And actually  my work took me to many countries because I used my work to fill my curiosity. And among other things  other countries I worked  was in the Soviet Union  where I worked from '   to '      actually  to '  . I was finally there  although I had nothing to do    I was a foreign expert. I became art director of the china and glass industry  and eventually under Stalin's purges    at the beginning of Stalin's purges  I didn't know that hundreds of thousands of innocent people were arrested. So I was arrested quite early in Stalin's purges  and spent    months in a Russian prison. The accusation was that I had successfully prepared an Attentat on Stalin's life. This was a very dangerous accusation. And if this is the end of my five minutes  I want to tell you that I actually did survive  which was a surprise. But since I survived and I'm here  and since this is the end of the five minutes  I will    Moderator  Tell me when your last trip to Russia was. Weren't you there recently  EZ  Oh  this summer  in fact  the Lomonosov factory was bought by an American company  invited me. They found out that I had worked in '   at this factory  and they came to my studio in Rockland County  and brought the    of their artists to visit me here. And they invited myself to come to the Russian factory last summer  in July  to make some dishes  design some dishes. And since I don't like to travel alone  they also invited my daughter  son in law and granddaughter  so we had a lovely trip to see Russia today  which is not a very pleasant and happy view. Here I am now  if this is the end  Thank you. What I'd like you to do is  just really quickly  is just  sort of  nod to the person on your right  and then nod to the person on your left. Now  chances are that over the last winter  if you had been a beehive  either you or one of the two people you just nodded at would have died. Now  that's an awful lot of bees. And this is the second year in a row we have lost over    percent of the colonies  or we estimate we've lost    percent of the colonies over the winter. Now  that's a lot  a lot of bees  and that's really important. And most of those losses are because of things we know. We know that there are these varroa mites that have introduced and caused a lot of losses  and we also have this new phenomenon  which I talked about last year  Colony Collapse Disorder. And here we see a picture on top of a hill in Central Valley last December. And below  you can see all these out yards  or temporary yards  where the colonies are brought in until February  and then they're shipped out to the almonds. And one documentary writer  who was here and looked at this two months after I was here  described this not as beehives but as a graveyard  with these empty white boxes with no bees left in them. Now  I'm going to sum up a year's worth of work in two sentences to say that we have been trying to figure out what the cause of this is. And what we know is that it's as if the bees have caught a flu. And this flu has wiped through the population of bees. In some cases  and in fact in most cases in one year  this flu was caused by a new virus to us  or newly identified by us  called Israeli Acute Paralysis virus. It was called that because a guy in Israel first found it  and he now regrets profoundly calling it that disease  because  of course  there's the implication. But we think this virus is pretty ubiquitous. It's also pretty clear that the bees sometimes catch other viruses or other flus  and so the question we're still struggling with  and the question that keeps us up at night  is why have the bees suddenly become so susceptible to this flu  and why are they so susceptible to these other diseases  And we don't have the answer to that yet  and we spend a lot of time trying to figure that out. We think perhaps it's a combination of factors. We know from the work of a very large and dynamic working team that  you know  we're finding a lot of different pesticides in the hive  and surprisingly  sometimes the healthiest hives have the most pesticides. And so we discover all these very strange things that we can't begin to understand. And so this opens up the whole idea of looking at colony health. Now of course  if you lose a lot of colonies  beekeepers can replace them very quickly. And that's why we've been able to recover from a lot of loss. If we lost one in every three cows in the winter  you know  the National Guard would be out. But what beekeepers can do is  if they have one surviving colony  they can split that colony in two. And then the one half that doesn't have a queen  they can buy a queen. It comes in the mail  it can come from Australia or Hawaii or Florida  and you can introduce that queen. And in fact  America was the first country that ever did mail delivery queens and in fact  it's part of the postal code that you have to deliver queens by mail in order to make sure that we have enough bees in this country. If you don't just want a queen  you can buy  actually  a three pound package of bees  which comes in the mail  and of course  the Postal Office is always very concerned when they get  you know  your three pound packages of bees. And you can install this in your hive and replace that dead out. So it means that beekeepers are very good at replacing dead outs  and so they've been able to cover those losses. So even though we've lost    percent of the colonies every year  the same number of colonies have existed in the country  at about  .  million colonies. Now  those losses are tragic on many fronts  and one of those fronts is for the beekeeper. And it's really important to talk about beekeepers first  because beekeepers are among the most fascinating people you'll ever meet. If this was a group of beekeepers  you would have everyone from the card carrying NRA member who's  you know  live free or die  to the  you know  the self expressed quirky San Francisco backyard pig farmer. And you get all of these people in the same room  and they're all engaged and they're getting along  and they're all there because of the passion for bees. Now  there's another part of that community which are the commercial beekeepers  the ones who make their livelihood from beekeeping alone. And these tend to be some of the most independent  tenacious  intuitive  you know  inventive people you will ever meet. They're just fascinating. And they're like that all over the world. I had the privilege of working in Haiti just for two weeks earlier this year. And Haiti  if you've ever been there  is just a tragedy. I mean  there may be     explanations for why Haiti is the impoverished nation it is  but there is no excuse to see that sort of squalor. But you meet this beekeeper  and I met this beekeeper here  and he is one of the most knowledgeable beekeepers I've ever met. No formal education  but very knowledgeable. We needed beeswax for a project we were working on  he was so capable  he was able to render the nicest block of beeswax I have ever seen from cow dung  tin cans and his veil  which he used as a screening  right in this meadow. And so that ingenuity is inspiring. We also have Dave Hackenberg  who is the poster child of CCD. He's the one who first identified this condition and raised the alarm bells. And he has a history of these trucks  and he's moved these bees up and down the coast. And a lot of people talk about trucks and moving bees  and that being bad  but we've done that for thousands of years. The ancient Egyptians used to move bees up and down the Nile on rafts  so this idea of a movable bee force is not new at all. And one of our real worries with Colony Collapse Disorder is the fact that it costs so much money to replace those dead out colonies. And you can do that one year in a row  you may be able to do it two years in a row. But if you're losing    percent to    percent of your colonies  you can't survive three years in a row. And we're really worried about losing this segment of our industry. And that's important for many fronts  and one of them is because of that culture that's in agriculture. And these migratory beekeepers are the last nomads of America. You know  they pick up their hives  they move their families once or twice in a year. And if you look at Florida  in Dade City  Florida  that's where all the Pennsylvania beekeepers go. And then    miles down the road is Groveland  and that's where all the Wisconsin beekeepers go. And if you're ever in Central Valley in February  you go to this caf  at    o'clock in the morning  Kathy and Kate's. And that's where all the beekeepers come after a night of moving bees into the almond groves. They all have their breakfast and complain about everyone right there. And it's a great experience  and I really encourage you to drop in at that diner during that time  because that's quite essential American experience. And we see these families  these nomadic families  you know  father to son  father to son  and these guys are hurting. And they're not people who like to ask for help  although they are the most helpful people ever. If there's one guy who loses all his bees because of a truck overhaul  everyone pitches in and gives    hives to help him replace those lost colonies. And so  it's a very dynamic  and I think  historic and exciting community to be involved with. Of course  the real importance for bees is not the honey. And although I highly encourage you  all use honey. I mean  it's the most ethical sweetener  and you know  it's a dynamic and fun sweetener. But we estimate that about one in three bites of food we eat is directly or indirectly pollinated by honeybees. Now  I want to just illustrate that in the fact that if we look at the breakfast I had yesterday morning    a little cranberry juice  some fruits  some granola  I should have had whole wheat bread  I realized  but you know  jam on my Wonderbread  and some coffee    and had we taken out all those ingredients     except for the almonds I wasn't going to pick out from the granola    if we had taken out all those ingredients the bees had indirectly or directly pollinated  we wouldn't have much on our plate. So if we did not have bees  it's not like we would starve  but clearly our diet would be diminished. It's said that for bees  the flower is the fountain of life  and for flowers bees are the messengers of love. And that's a really great expression  because really  bees are the sex workers for flowers. They are  you know    they get paid for their services. They get paid by pollen and nectar  to move that male sperm  the pollen  from flower to flower. And there are flowers that are self infertile. That means they can't    the pollen in their bloom can't fertilize themselves. So in an apple orchard  for instance  you'll have rows of    apples of one variety  and then you have another apple tree that's a different type of pollen. And bees are very faithful. When they're out pollinating or gathering pollen from one flower  they stay to that crop exclusively  in order to help generate. And of course  they're made to carry this pollen. They build up a static electric charge and the pollen jumps on them and helps spread that pollen from bloom to bloom. However  honeybees are a minority. Honeybees are not native to America  they were introduced with the colonialists. And there are actually more species of bees than there are mammals and birds combined. In Pennsylvania alone  we have been surveying bees for     years  and very intensely in the last three years. We have identified over     species of bees in Pennsylvania. Thirty two species have not been identified or found in the state since     . Now  that could be because we haven't been sampling right  but it does  I think  suggest that something's wrong with the pollinator force. And these bees are fascinating. We have bumblebees on the top. And bumblebees are what we call eusocial  they're not truly social  because only the queen is  over winter. We also have the sweat bees  and these are little gems flying around. They're like tiny little flies and they fly around. And then you have another type of bee  which we call kleptoparasites  which is a very fancy way of saying  bad minded  murdering    what's the word I'm looking for  Murdering    Audience  Bee  Dennis vanEngelsdorp  Bee. Okay  thanks. What these bees do is  they sit there. These solitary bees  they drill a hole in the ground or drill a hole in a branch  and they collect pollen and make it into a ball  and they lay an egg on it. Well  these bees hang out at that hole  and they wait for that mother to fly away  they go in  eat the egg  and lay their own egg there. So they don't do any work. And so  in fact  if you know you have these kleptoparasitic bees  you know that your environment is healthy  because they're top of the food chain bees. And in fact  there is now a red list of pollinators that we're worried have disappeared  and on top of that list are a lot of these kleptoparasites  but also these bumblebees. And in fact  if you guys live on the West Coast  go to these websites here  and they're really looking for people to look for some of these bumblebees  because we think some have gone extinct. Or some  the population has declined. And so it's not just honeybees that are in trouble  but we don't understand these native pollinators or all those other parts of our community. And of course  bees are not the only important factor here. There are other animals that pollinate  like bats  and bats are in trouble too. And I'm glad I'm a bee man and not a bat man  because there's no money to research the bat problems. And bats are dying at an extraordinary rate. White nose syndrome has wiped out populations of bats. If there's a cave in New York that had        bats in it  and there are       left. That's like San Francisco becoming the population of half of this county in three years. And so that's incredible. And there's no money to do that. But I'm glad to say that I think we know the cause of all these conditions  and that cause is NDD  Nature Deficit Disorder. And that is that I think that what we have in our society is  we forgot our connection with nature. And I think if we reconnect to nature  we'll be able to have the resources and that interest to solve these problems. And I think that there is an easy cure for NDD. And that is  make meadows and not lawns. And I think we have lost our connection  and this is a wonderful way of reconnecting to our environment. I've had the privilege of living by a meadow for the last little while  and it is terribly engaging. And if we look at the history of lawns  it's actually rather tragic. It used to be  two  three hundred years ago  that a lawn was a symbol of prestige  and so it was only the very rich that could keep these green actually  deserts  they're totally sterile. Americans spent  in            percent of all pesticide use was done on lawns. Five percent of our greenhouse gases are produced by mowing our lawns. And so it's incredible the amount of resources we've spent keeping our lawns  which are these useless biosystems. And so we need to rethink this idea. In fact  you know  the White House used to have sheep in front in order to help fund the war effort in World War I  which probably is not a bad idea  it wouldn't be a bad idea. I want to say this not because I'm opposed completely to mowing lawns. I think that there is perhaps some advantage to keeping lawns at a limited scale  and I think we're encouraged to do that. But I also want to reinforce some of the ideas we've heard here  because having a meadow or living by a meadow is transformational. That it is amazing that connection we can have with what's there. These milkweed plants have grown up in my meadow over the last four years. Add to watch the different plants  or insects  that come to these flowers  to watch that    and we've heard about  you know  this relationship you can have with wine  this companion you can have as it matures and as it has these different fragrances. And this is a companion  and this is a relationship that never dries up. You never run out of that companion as you drink this wine  too. And I encourage you to look at that. Now  not all of us have meadows  or lawns that we can convert  and so you can always  of course  grow a meadow in a pot. Bees apparently  can be the gateway to  you know  other things. So I'm not saying that you should plant a meadow of pot  but a pot in a meadow. But you can also have this great community of city or building top beekeepers  these beekeepers that live    This is in Paris where these beekeepers live. And everyone should open a beehive  because it is the most amazing  incredible thing. And if we want to cure ourselves of NDD  or Nature Deficit Disorder  I think this is a great way of doing it. Get a beehive and grow a meadow  and watch that life come back into your life. And so with that  I think that what we can do  if we do this  we can make sure that our future    our more perfect future    includes beekeepers and it includes bees and it includes those meadows. And that journey    that journey of transformation that occurs as you grow your meadow and as you keep your bees or you watch those native bees there    is an extremely exciting one. And I hope that you experience it and I hope you tell me about it one day. So thank you very much for being here.  Thank you very much. These rocks have been hitting our earth for about three billion years  and are responsible for much of what s gone on on our planet. This is an example of a real meteorite  and you can see all the melting of the iron from the speed and the heat when a meteorite hits the earth  and just how much of it survives and melts. From a meteorite from space  we re over here with an original Sputnik. This is one of the seven surviving Sputniks that was not launched into space. This is not a copy. The space age began    years ago in October  and that s exactly what Sputnik looked like. And it wouldn t be fun to talk about the space age without seeing a flag that was carried to the moon and back  on Apollo   . The astronauts each got to carry about ten silk flags in their personal kits. They would bring them back and mount them. So this has actually been carried to the moon and back. So that s for fun. The dawn of books is  of course  important. And it wouldn t be interesting to talk about the dawn of books without having a copy of a Guttenberg Bible. You can see how portable and handy it was to have your own Guttenberg in     . But what s interesting about the Guttenberg Bible  and the dawn of this technology  is not the book. You see  the book was not driven by reading. In       nobody could read. So why did the printing press succeed  This is an original page of a Guttenberg Bible. So you re looking here at one of the first printed books using movable type in the history of man      years ago. We are living at the age here at the end of the book  where electronic paper will undoubtedly replace it. But why is this so interesting  Here s the quick story. It turns out that in the     s  the Catholic Church needed money  and so they actually hand wrote these things called indulgences  which were forgiveness s on pieces of paper. They traveled all around Europe and sold by the hundreds or by the thousands. They got you out of purgatory faster. And when the printing press was invented what they found was they could print indulgences  which was the equivalent of printing money. And so all of Western Europe started buying printing presses in         to print out thousands  and then hundreds of thousands  and then ultimately millions of single  small pieces of paper that got you out of middle hell and into heaven. That is why the printing press succeeded  and that is why Martin Luther nailed his    theses to the door  because he was complaining that the Catholic Church had gone amok in printing out indulgences and selling them in every town and village and city in all of Western Europe. So the printing press  ladies and gentlemen  was driven entirely by the printing of forgivenesses and had nothing to do with reading. More tomorrow. I also have pictures coming of the library for those of you that have asked for pictures. We re going to have some tomorrow. Instead of showing an object from the stage I m going to do something special for the first time. We are going to show  actually  what the library looks like  OK  So  I am married to the most wonderful woman in the world. You re going to find out why in a minute  because when I went to see Eileen  this is what I said I wanted to build. This is the Library of Human Imagination. The room itself is three stories tall. In the glass panels are       years of human imagination that are computer controlled. The room is a theatre. It changes colors. And all throughout the library are different objects  different spaces. It s designed like an Escher print. Here is some of the lower level of the library  where the exhibits constantly change. You can walk through. You can touch. You can see exactly how many of these types of items would fit in a room. There s my very own Saturn V. Everybody should have one  OK   Laughter  So you can see here in the lower level of the library the books and the objects. In the glass panels all along is sort of the history of imagination. There is a glass bridge that you walk across that s suspended in space. So it s a leap of imagination. How do we create  Part of the question that I have answered is  is we create by surrounding ourselves with stimuli  with human achievement  with history  with the things that drive us and make us human    the passionate discovery  the bones of dinosaurs long gone  the maps of space that we ve experienced  and ultimately the hallways that stimulate our mind and our imagination. So hopefully tomorrow I ll show one or two more objects from the stage  but for today I just wanted to say thank you for all the people that came and talked to us about it. And Eileen and I are thrilled to open our home and share it with the TED community. TED is all about patterns in the clouds. It s all about connections. It s all about seeing things that everybody else has seen before but thinking about them in ways that nobody has thought of them before. And that s really what discovery and imagination is all about. For example  we can look at a DNA molecule model here. None of us really have ever seen one  but we know it exists because we ve been taught to understand this molecule. But we can also look at an Enigma machine from the Nazis in World War II that was a coding and decoding machine. Now  you might say  what does this have to do with this  Well  this is the code for life  and this is a code for death. These two molecules code and decode. And yet  looking at them  you would see a machine and a molecule. But once you ve seen them in a new way  you realize that both of these things really are connected. And they re connected primarily because of this here. You see  this is a human brain model  OK  And it s rare  because we never really get to see a brain. We get to see a skull. But there it is. All of imagination    everything that we think  we feel  we sense    comes through the human brain. And once we create new patterns in this brain  once we shape the brain in a new way  it never returns to its original shape. And I ll give you a quick example. We think about the Internet  we think about information that goes across the Internet. And we never think about the hidden connection. But I brought along here a lump of coal    right here  one lump of coal. And what does a lump of coal have to do with the Internet  You see  it takes the energy in one lump of coal to move one megabyte of information across the net. So every time you download a file  each megabyte is a lump of coal. What that means is  a     megabyte file looks like this  ladies and gentlemen. OK  So the next time you download a gigabyte  or two gigabytes  it s not for free  OK  The connection is the energy it takes to run the web   and to make everything we think possible  possible. Thanks  Chris. We all make decisions every day  we want to know what the right thing is to do    in domains from the financial to the gastronomic to the professional to the romantic. And surely  if somebody could really tell us how to do exactly the right thing at all possible times  that would be a tremendous gift. It turns out that  in fact  the world was given this gift in      by a Dutch polymath named Daniel Bernoulli. And what I want to talk to you about today is what that gift is  and I also want to explain to you why it is that it hasn't made a damn bit of difference. Now  this is Bernoulli's gift. This is a direct quote. And if it looks like Greek to you  it's because  well  it's Greek. But the simple English translation    much less precise  but it captures the gist of what Bernoulli had to say    was this  The expected value of any of our actions    that is  the goodness that we can count on getting    is the product of two simple things  the odds that this action will allow us to gain something  and the value of that gain to us. In a sense  what Bernoulli was saying is  if we can estimate and multiply these two things  we will always know precisely how we should behave. Now  this simple equation  even for those of you who don't like equations  is something that you're quite used to. Here's an example  if I were to tell you  let's play a little coin toss game  and I'm going to flip a coin  and if it comes up heads  I'm going to pay you    dollars  but you have to pay four dollars for the privilege of playing with me  most of you would say  sure  I'll take that bet. Because you know that the odds of you winning are one half  the gain if you do is    dollars  that multiplies to five  and that's more than I'm charging you to play. So  the answer is  yes. This is what statisticians technically call a damn fine bet. Now  the idea is simple when we're applying it to coin tosses  but in fact  it's not very simple in everyday life. People are horrible at estimating both of these things  and that's what I want to talk to you about today. There are two kinds of errors people make when trying to decide what the right thing is to do  and those are errors in estimating the odds that they're going to succeed  and errors in estimating the value of their own success. Now  let me talk about the first one first. Calculating odds would seem to be something rather easy  there are six sides to a die  two sides to a coin     cards in a deck. You all know what the likelihood is of pulling the ace of spades or of flipping a heads. But as it turns out  this is not a very easy idea to apply in everyday life. That's why Americans spend more    I should say  lose more    gambling than on all other forms of entertainment combined. The reason is  this isn't how people do odds. The way people figure odds requires that we first talk a bit about pigs. Now  the question I'm going to put to you is whether you think there are more dogs or pigs on leashes observed in any particular day in Oxford. And of course  you all know that the answer is dogs. And the way that you know that the answer is dogs is you quickly reviewed in memory the times you've seen dogs and pigs on leashes. It was very easy to remember seeing dogs  not so easy to remember pigs. And each one of you assumed that if dogs on leashes came more quickly to your mind  then dogs on leashes are more probable. That's not a bad rule of thumb  except when it is. So  for example  here's a word puzzle. Are there more four letter English words with R in the third place or R in the first place  Well  you check memory very briefly  make a quick scan  and it's awfully easy to say to yourself  Ring  Rang  Rung  and very hard to say to yourself  Pare  Park  they come more slowly. But in fact  there are many more words in the English language with R in the third than the first place. The reason words with R in the third place come slowly to your mind isn't because they're improbable  unlikely or infrequent. It's because the mind recalls words by their first letter. You kind of shout out the sound  S    and the word comes. It's like the dictionary  it's hard to look things up by the third letter. So  this is an example of how this idea that the quickness with which things come to mind can give you a sense of their probability    how this idea could lead you astray. It's not just puzzles  though. For example  when Americans are asked to estimate the odds that they will die in a variety of interesting ways    these are estimates of number of deaths per year per     million U.S. citizens. And these are just ordinary people like yourselves who are asked to guess how many people die from tornado  fireworks  asthma  drowning  etc. Compare these to the actual numbers. Now  you see a very interesting pattern here  which is first of all  two things are vastly over estimated  namely tornadoes and fireworks. Two things are vastly underestimated  dying by drowning and dying by asthma. Why  When was the last time that you picked up a newspaper and the headline was   Boy dies of Asthma   It's not interesting because it's so common. It's very easy for all of us to bring to mind instances of news stories or newsreels where we've seen tornadoes devastating cities  or some poor schmuck who's blown his hands off with a firework on the Fourth of July. Drownings and asthma deaths don't get much coverage. They don't come quickly to mind  and as a result  we vastly underestimate them. Indeed  this is kind of like the Sesame Street game of  Which thing doesn't belong   And you're right to say it's the swimming pool that doesn't belong  because the swimming pool is the only thing on this slide that's actually very dangerous. The way that more of you are likely to die than the combination of all three of the others that you see on the slide. The lottery is an excellent example  of course    an excellent test case of people's ability to compute probabilities. And economists    forgive me  for those of you who play the lottery    but economists  at least among themselves  refer to the lottery as a stupidity tax  because the odds of getting any payoff by investing your money in a lottery ticket are approximately equivalent to flushing the money directly down the toilet    which  by the way  doesn't require that you actually go to the store and buy anything. Why in the world would anybody ever play the lottery  Well  there are many answers  but one answer surely is  we see a lot of winners. Right  When this couple wins the lottery  or Ed McMahon shows up at your door with this giant check    how the hell do you cash things that size  I don't know. We see this on TV  we read about it in the paper. When was the last time that you saw extensive interviews with everybody who lost  Indeed  if we required that television stations run a    second interview with each loser every time they interview a winner  the     million losers in the last lottery would require nine and a half years of your undivided attention just to watch them say   Me  I lost.   Me  I lost.  Now  if you watch nine and a half years of television    no sleep  no potty breaks    and you saw loss after loss after loss  and then at the end there's    seconds of   and I won   the likelihood that you would play the lottery is very small. Look  I can prove this to you  here's a little lottery. There's    tickets in this lottery. Nine of them have been sold to these individuals. It costs you a dollar to buy the ticket and  if you win  you get    bucks. Is this a good bet  Well  Bernoulli tells us it is. The expected value of this lottery is two dollars  this is a lottery in which you should invest your money. And most people say   OK  I'll play.  Now  a slightly different version of this lottery  imagine that the nine tickets are all owned by one fat guy named Leroy. Leroy has nine tickets  there's one left. Do you want it  Most people won't play this lottery. Now  you can see the odds of winning haven't changed  but it's now fantastically easy to imagine who's going to win. It's easy to see Leroy getting the check  right  You can't say to yourself   I'm as likely to win as anybody   because you're not as likely to win as Leroy. The fact that all those tickets are owned by one guy changes your decision to play  even though it does nothing whatsoever to the odds. Now  estimating odds  as difficult as it may seem  is a piece of cake compared to trying to estimate value  trying to say what something is worth  how much we'll enjoy it  how much pleasure it will give us. I want to talk now about errors in value. How much is this Big Mac worth  Is it worth    dollars  Most of you have the intuition that it's not    you wouldn't pay that for it. But in fact  to decide whether a Big Mac is worth    dollars requires that you ask one  and only one question  which is  What else can I do with    dollars  If you've ever gotten on one of those long haul flights to Australia and realized that they're not going to serve you any food  but somebody in the row in front of you has just opened the McDonald's bag  and the smell of golden arches is wafting over the seat  you think  I can't do anything else with this    dollars for    hours. I can't even set it on fire    they took my cigarette lighter  Suddenly     dollars for a Big Mac might be a good deal. On the other hand  if you're visiting an underdeveloped country  and    dollars buys you a gourmet meal  it's exorbitant for a Big Mac. Why were you all sure that the answer to the question was no  before I'd even told you anything about the context  Because most of you compared the price of this Big Mac to the price you're used to paying. Rather than asking   What else can I do with my money   comparing this investment to other possible investments  you compared to the past. And this is a systematic error people make. What you knew is  you paid three dollars in the past     is outrageous. This is an error  and I can prove it to you by showing the kinds of irrationalities to which it leads. For example  this is  of course  one of the most delicious tricks in marketing  is to say something used to be higher  and suddenly it seems like a very good deal. When people are asked about these two different jobs  a job where you make   K  then   K  then   K  a job where you're getting a salary cut each year  and one in which you're getting a salary increase  people like the second job better than the first  despite the fact they're all told they make much less money. Why  Because they had the sense that declining wages are worse than rising wages  even when the total amount of wages is higher in the declining period. Here's another nice example. Here's a        Hawaiian vacation package  it's now on sale for      . Assuming you wanted to go to Hawaii  would you buy this package  Most people say they would. Here's a slightly different story         Hawaiian vacation package is now on sale for     dollars  so you decide to mull it over for a week. By the time you get to the ticket agency  the best fares are gone    the package now costs      . Would you buy it  Most people say  no. Why  Because it used to cost      and there's no way I'm paying       for something that was     last week. This tendency to compare to the past is causing people to pass up the better deal. In other words  a good deal that used to be a great deal is not nearly as good as an awful deal that was once a horrible deal. Here's another example of how comparing to the past can befuddle our decisions. Imagine that you're going to the theater. You're on your way to the theater. In your wallet you have a ticket  for which you paid    dollars. You also have a    dollar bill. When you arrive at the theater  you discover that somewhere along the way you've lost the ticket. Would you spend your remaining money on replacing it  Most people answer  no. Now  let's just change one thing in this scenario. You're on your way to the theater  and in your wallet you have two    dollar bills. When you arrive you discover you've lost one of them. Would you spend your remaining    dollars on a ticket  Well  of course  I went to the theater to see the play. What does the loss of    dollars along the way have to do  Now  just in case you're not getting it  here's a schematic of what happened  OK  Along the way  you lost something. In both cases  it was a piece of paper. In one case  it had a U.S. president on it  in the other case it didn't. What the hell difference should it make  The difference is that when you lost the ticket you say to yourself  I'm not paying twice for the same thing. You compare the cost of the play now       dollars    to the cost that it used to have       dollars    and you say it's a bad deal. Comparing with the past causes many of the problems that behavioral economists and psychologists identify in people's attempts to assign value. But even when we compare with the possible  instead of the past  we still make certain kinds of mistakes. And I'm going to show you one or two of them. One of the things we know about comparison  that when we compare one thing to the other  it changes its value. So in       this fellow  George Bush  for those of us who were kind of on the liberal side of the political spectrum  didn't seem like such a great guy. Suddenly  we're almost longing for him to return. The comparison changes how we evaluate him. Now  retailers knew this long before anybody else did  of course  and they use this wisdom to help you    spare you the undue burden of money. And so a retailer  if you were to go into a wine shop and you had to buy a bottle of wine  and you see them here for eight     and    dollars  what would you do  Most people don't want the most expensive  they don't want the least expensive. So  they will opt for the item in the middle. If you're a smart retailer  then  you will put a very expensive item that nobody will ever buy on the shelf  because suddenly the     wine doesn't look as expensive in comparison. So I'm telling you something you already knew  namely  that comparison changes the value of things. Here's why that's a problem  the problem is that when you get that     bottle of wine home  it won't matter what it used to be sitting on the shelf next to. The comparisons we make when we are appraising value  where we're trying to estimate how much we'll like things  are not the same comparisons we'll be making when we consume them. This problem of shifting comparisons can bedevil our attempts to make rational decisions. Let me just give you an example. I have to show you something from my own lab  so let me sneak this in. These are subjects coming to an experiment to be asked the simplest of all questions  How much will you enjoy eating potato chips one minute from now  They're sitting in a room with potato chips in front of them. For some of the subjects  sitting in the far corner of a room is a box of Godiva chocolates  and for others is a can of Spam. In fact  these items that are sitting in the room change how much the subjects think they're going to enjoy the potato chips. Namely  those who are looking at Spam think potato chips are going to be quite tasty  those who are looking at Godiva chocolate think they won't be nearly so tasty. Of course  what happens when they eat the potato chips  Well  look  you didn't need a psychologist to tell you that when you have a mouthful of greasy  salty  crispy  delicious snacks  what's sitting in the corner of the room makes not a damn bit of difference to your gustatory experience. Nonetheless  their predictions are perverted by a comparison that then does not carry through and change their experience. You've all experienced this yourself  even if you've never come into our lab to eat potato chips. So here's a question  You want to buy a car stereo. The dealer near your house sells this particular stereo for     dollars  but if you drive across town  you can get it for     bucks. So would you drive to get    percent off  saving     dollars  Most people say they would. They can't imagine buying it for twice the price when  with one trip across town  they can get it for half off. Now  let's imagine instead you wanted to buy a car that had a stereo  and the dealer near your house had it for       . But if you drove across town  you could get it for       . Would you drive to get it  At this point   .    savings    the     dollars. Most people say  no  I'm going to schlep across town to save     bucks on the purchase of a car  This kind of thinking drives economists crazy  and it should. Because this     dollars that you save    hello     doesn't know where it came from. It doesn't know what you saved it on. When you go to buy groceries with it  it doesn't go  I'm the money saved on the car stereo  or  I'm the dumb money saved on the car. It's money. And if a drive across town is worth     bucks  it's worth     bucks no matter what you're saving it on. People don't think that way. That's why they don't know whether their mutual fund manager is taking  .  percent or  .   percent of their investment  but they clip coupons to save one dollar off of toothpaste. Now  you can see  this is the problem of shifting comparisons  because what you're doing is  you're comparing the     bucks to the purchase that you're making  but when you go to spend that money you won't be making that comparison. You've all had this experience. If you're an American  for example  you've probably traveled in France. And at some point you may have met a couple from your own hometown  and you thought   Oh  my God  these people are so warm. They're so nice to me. I mean  compared to all these people who hate me when I try to speak their language and hate me more when I don't  these people are just wonderful.  And so you tour France with them  and then you get home and you invite them over for dinner  and what do you find  Compared to your regular friends  they are boring and dull  right  Because in this new context  the comparison is very  very different. In fact  you find yourself disliking them enough almost to qualify for French citizenship. Now  you have exactly the same problem when you shop for a stereo. You go to the stereo store  you see two sets of speakers    these big  boxy  monoliths  and these little  sleek speakers  and you play them  and you go  you know  I do hear a difference  the big ones sound a little better. And so you buy them  and you bring them home  and you entirely violate the d cor of your house. And the problem  of course  is that this comparison you made in the store is a comparison you'll never make again. What are the odds that years later you'll turn on the stereo and go   Sounds so much better than those little ones   which you can't even remember hearing. The problem of shifting comparisons is even more difficult when these choices are arrayed over time. People have a lot of trouble making decisions about things that will happen at different points in time. And what psychologists and behavioral economists have discovered is that by and large people use two simple rules. So let me give you one very easy problem  a second very easy problem and then a third  hard  problem. Here's the first easy problem  You can have    dollars now or    dollars now. Which would you prefer  This is what we call a one item IQ test  OK  All of us  I hope  prefer more money  and the reason is  we believe more is better than less. Here's the second problem  You can have    dollars today or    dollars in a month. Which would you prefer  Again  an easy decision  because we all know that now is better than later. What's hard in our decision making is when these two rules conflict. For example  when you're offered    dollars now or    dollars in a month. This typifies a lot of situations in life in which you will gain by waiting  but you have to be patient. What do we know  What do people do in these kinds of situations  Well  by and large people are enormously impatient. That is  they require interest rates in the hundred or thousands of percents in order to delay gratification and wait until next month for the extra    dollars. Maybe that isn't so remarkable  but what is remarkable is how easy it is to make this impatience go away by simply changing when the delivery of these monetary units will happen. Imagine that you can have    dollars in a year    that's    months    or    dollars in    months. What do we find now  People are gladly willing to wait  as long as they're waiting     they might as well wait   . What makes this dynamic inconsistency happen  Comparison. Troubling comparison. Let me show you. This is just a graph showing the results that I just suggested you would show if I gave you time to respond  which is  people find that the subjective value of    is higher than the subjective value of    when they'll be delivered in now or one month  respectively    a    day delay    but they show the reverse pattern when you push the entire decision off into the future a year. Now  why in the world do you get this pattern of results  These guys can tell us. What you see here are two lads  one of them larger than the other  the fireman and the fiddler. They are going to recede towards the vanishing point in the horizon  and I want you to notice two things. At no point will the fireman look taller than the fiddler. No point. However  the difference between them seems to be getting smaller. First it's an inch in your view  then it's a quarter inch  then a half inch  and then finally they go off the edge of the earth. Here are the results of what I just showed you. This is the subjective height    the height you saw of these guys at various points. And I want you to see that two things are true. One  the farther away they are  the smaller they look  and two  the fireman is always bigger than the fiddler. But watch what happens when we make some of them disappear. Right. At a very close distance  the fiddler looks taller than the fireman  but at a far distance their normal  their true  relations are preserved. As Plato said  what space is to size  time is to value. These are the results of the hard problem I gave you     now or    in a month  And these are subjective values  and what you can see is  our two rules are preserved. People always think more is better than less     is always better than     and they always think now is better than later  the bars on this side are higher than the bars on this side. Watch what happens when we drop some out. Suddenly we have the dynamic inconsistency that puzzled us. We have the tendency for people to go for    dollars now over waiting a month  but not if that decision is far in the future. Notice something interesting that this implies    namely  that when people get to the future  they will change their minds. That is  as that month    approaches  you will say  what was I thinking  waiting an extra month for    dollars  I'll take the    dollars now. Well  the question with which I'd like to end is this  If we're so damn stupid  how did we get to the moon  Because I could go on for about two hours with evidence of people's inability to estimate odds and inability to estimate value. The answer to this question  I think  is an answer you've already heard in some of the talks  and I dare say you will hear again  namely  that our brains were evolved for a very different world than the one in which we are living. They were evolved for a world in which people lived in very small groups  rarely met anybody who was terribly different from themselves  had rather short lives in which there were few choices and the highest priority was to eat and mate today. Bernoulli's gift  Bernoulli's little formula  allows us  it tells us how we should think in a world for which nature never designed us. That explains why we are so bad at using it  but it also explains why it is so terribly important that we become good  fast. We are the only species on this planet that has ever held its own fate in its hands. We have no significant predators  we're the masters of our physical environment  the things that normally cause species to become extinct are no longer any threat to us. The only thing    the only thing    that can destroy us and doom us are our own decisions. If we're not here in        years  it's going to be because we could not take advantage of the gift given to us by a young Dutch fellow in       because we underestimated the odds of our future pains and overestimated the value of our present pleasures. Thank you. Chris Anderson  That was remarkable. We have time for some questions for Dan Gilbert. One and two. Bill Lyell  Would you say that this mechanism is in part how terrorism actually works to frighten us  and is there some way that we could counteract that  Dan Gilbert  I actually was consulting recently with the Department of Homeland Security  which generally believes that American security dollars should go to making borders safer. I tried to point out to them that terrorism was a name based on people's psychological reaction to a set of events  and that if they were concerned about terrorism they might ask what causes terror and how can we stop people from being terrified  rather than    not rather than  but in addition to stopping the atrocities that we're all concerned about. Surely the kinds of play that at least American media give to    and forgive me  but in raw numbers these are very tiny accidents. We already know  for example  in the United States  more people have died as a result of not taking airplanes    because they were scared    and driving on highways  than were killed in     . OK  If I told you that there was a plague that was going to kill        Americans next year  you might be alarmed if you didn't find out it was the flu. These are small scale accidents  and we should be wondering whether they should get the kind of play  the kind of coverage  that they do. Surely that causes people to overestimate the likelihood that they'll be hurt in these various ways  and gives power to the very people who want to frighten us. CA  Dan  I'd like to hear more on this. So  you're saying that our response to terror is  I mean  it's a form of mental bug  Talk more about it. DG  It's out sized. I mean  look. If Australia disappears tomorrow  terror is probably the right response. That's an awful large lot of very nice people. On the other hand  when a bus blows up and    people are killed  more people than that were killed by not using their seatbelts in the same country. Is terror the right response  CA  What causes the bug  Is it the drama of the event    that it's so spectacular  Is it the fact that it's an intentional attack by  quote  outsiders  What is it  DG  Yes. It's a number of things  and you hit on several of them. First  it's a human agent trying to kill us    it's not a tree falling on us by accident. Second  these are enemies who may want to strike and hurt us again. People are being killed for no reason instead of good reason    as if there's good reason  but sometimes people think there are. So there are a number of things that together make this seem like a fantastic event  but let's not play down the fact that newspapers sell when people see something in it they want to read. So there's a large role here played by the media  who want these things to be as spectacular as they possibly can. CA  I mean  what would it take to persuade our culture to downplay it  DG  Well  go to Israel. You know  go to Israel. And a mall blows up  and then everybody's unhappy about it  and an hour and a half later    at least when I was there  and I was     feet from the mall when it blew up    I went back to my hotel and the wedding that was planned was still going on. And as the Israeli mother said  she said   We never let them win by stopping weddings.  I mean  this is a society that has learned    and there are others too    that has learned to live with a certain amount of terrorism and not be quite as upset by it  shall I say  as those of us who have not had many terror attacks. CA  But is there a rational fear that actually  the reason we're frightened about this is because we think that the Big One is to come  DG  Yes  of course. So  if we knew that this was the worst attack there would ever be  there might be more and more buses of    people    we would probably not be nearly so frightened. I don't want to say    please  I'm going to get quoted somewhere as saying   Terrorism is fine and we shouldn't be so distressed.  That's not my point at all. What I'm saying is that  surely  rationally  our distress about things that happen  about threats  should be roughly proportional to the size of those threats and threats to come. I think in the case of terrorism  it isn't. And many of the things we've heard about from our speakers today    how many people do you know got up and said  Poverty  I can't believe what poverty is doing to us. People get up in the morning  they don't care about poverty. It's not making headlines  it's not making news  it's not flashy. There are no guns going off. I mean  if you had to solve one of these problems  Chris  which would you solve  Terrorism or poverty  That's a tough one. CA  There's no question. Poverty  by an order of magnitude  a huge order of magnitude  unless someone can show that there's  you know  terrorists with a nuke are really likely to come. The latest I've read  seen  thought is that it's incredibly hard for them to do that. If that turns out to be wrong  we all look silly  but with poverty it's a bit    DG  Even if that were true  still more people die from poverty. CA  We've evolved to get all excited about these dramatic attacks. Is that because in the past  in the ancient past  we just didn't understand things like disease and systems that cause poverty and so forth  and so it made no sense for us as a species to put any energy into worrying about those things  People died  so be it. But if you got attacked  that was something you could do something about. And so we evolved these responses. Is that what happened  DG  Well  you know  the people who are most skeptical about leaping to evolutionary explanations for everything are the evolutionary psychologists themselves. My guess is that there's nothing quite that specific in our evolutionary past. But rather  if you're looking for an evolutionary explanation  you might say that most organisms are neo phobic    that is  they're a little scared of stuff that's new and different. And there's a good reason to be  because old stuff didn't eat you. Right  Any animal you see that you've seen before is less likely to be a predator than one that you've never seen before. So  you know  when a school bus is blown up and we've never seen this before  our general tendency is to orient towards that which is new and novel is activated. I don't think it's quite as specific a mechanism as the one you alluded to  but maybe a more fundamental one underlying it. Jay Walker  You know  economists love to talk about the stupidity of people who buy lottery tickets. But I suspect you're making the exact same error you're accusing those people of  which is the error of value. I know  because I've interviewed about       lottery buyers over the years. It turns out that the value of buying a lottery ticket is not winning. That's what you think it is. All right  The average lottery buyer buys about     tickets a year  so the buyer knows full well that he or she is going to lose  and yet she buys     tickets a year. Why is that  It's not because she is stupid or he is stupid. It's because the anticipation of possibly winning releases serotonin in the brain  and actually provides a good feeling until the drawing indicates you've lost. Or  to put it another way  for the dollar investment  you can have a much better feeling than flushing the money down the toilet  which you cannot have a good feeling from. Now  economists tend to       economists tend to view the world through their own lenses  which is  this is just a bunch of stupid people. And as a result  many people look at economists as stupid people. And so fundamentally  the reason we got to the moon is  we didn't listen to the economists. Thank you very much. DG  Well  no  it's a great point. It remains to be seen whether the joy of anticipation is exactly equaled by the amount of disappointment after the lottery. Because remember  people who didn't buy tickets don't feel awful the next day either  even though they don't feel great during the drawing. I would disagree that people know they're not going to win. I think they think it's unlikely  but it could happen  which is why they prefer that to the flushing. But certainly I see your point  that there can be some utility to buying a lottery ticket other than winning. Now  I think there's many good reasons not to listen to economists. That isn't one of them  for me  but there's many others. CA  Last question. Aubrey de Grey  My name's Aubrey de Grey  from Cambridge. I work on the thing that kills more people than anything else kills    I work on aging    and I'm interested in doing something about it  as we'll all hear tomorrow. I very much resonate with what you're saying  because it seems to me that the problem with getting people interested in doing anything about aging is that by the time aging is about to kill you it looks like cancer or heart disease or whatever. Do you have any advice  DG  For you or for them  AdG  In persuading them. DG  Ah  for you in persuading them. Well  it's notoriously difficult to get people to be farsighted. But one thing that psychologists have tried that seems to work is to get people to imagine the future more vividly. One of the problems with making decisions about the far future and the near future is that we imagine the near future much more vividly than the far future. To the extent that you can equalize the amount of detail that people put into the mental representations of near and far future  people begin to make decisions about the two in the same way. So  would you like to have an extra         dollars when you're    is a question that's very different than  imagine who you'll be when you're     will you be living  what will you look like  how much hair will you have  who will you be living with. Once we have all the details of that imaginary scenario  suddenly we feel like it might be important to save so that that guy has a little retirement money. But these are tricks around the margins. I think in general you're battling a very fundamental human tendency  which is to say   I'm here today  and so now is more important than later.  CA  Dan  thank you. Members of the audience  that was a fantastic session. Thank you. I'm just going to play a brief video clip. Video  On the fifth of December       a bottle of      Lafitte was sold for         pounds    nine times the previous world record. The buyer was Kip Forbes  son of one of the most flamboyant millionaires of the   th century. The original owner of the bottle turned out to be one of the most enthusiastic wine buffs of the   th century. Ch teau Lafitte is one of the greatest wines in the world  the prince of any wine cellar. Benjamin Wallace  Now  that's about all the videotape that remains of an event that set off the longest running mystery in the modern wine world. And the mystery existed because of a gentleman named Hardy Rodenstock. In       he announced to his friends in the wine world that he had made this incredible discovery. Some workmen in Paris had broken through a brick wall  and happened upon this hidden cache of wines    apparently the property of Thomas Jefferson.           . He wouldn't reveal the exact number of bottles  he would not reveal exactly where the building was and he would not reveal exactly who owned the building. The mystery persisted for about    years. It finally began to get resolved in      because of this guy. Bill Koch is a Florida billionaire who owns four of the Jefferson bottles  and he became suspicious. And he ended up spending over a million dollars and hiring ex FBI and ex Scotland Yard agents to try to get to the bottom of this. There's now ample evidence that Hardy Rodenstock is a con man  and that the Jefferson bottles were fakes. But for those    years  an unbelievable number of really eminent and accomplished figures in the wine world were sort of drawn into the orbit of these bottles. I think they wanted to believe that the most expensive bottle of wine in the world must be the best bottle of wine in the world  must be the rarest bottle of wine in the world. I became increasingly  kind of voyeuristically interested in the question of you know  why do people spend these crazy amounts of money  not only on wine but on lots of things  and are they living a better life than me  So  I decided to embark on a quest. With the generous backing of a magazine I write for sometimes  I decided to sample the very best  or most expensive  or most coveted item in about a dozen categories  which was a very grueling quest   as you can imagine. This was the first one. A lot of the Kobe beef that you see in the U.S. is not the real thing. It may come from Wagyu cattle  but it's not from the original  Appalachian Hyogo Prefecture in Japan. There are very few places in the U.S. where you can try real Kobe  and one of them is Wolfgang Puck's restaurant  Cut  in Los Angeles. I went there  and I ordered the eight ounce rib eye for     dollars. And it arrived  and it was tiny. And I was outraged. It was like      dollars for this  And then I took a bite  and I wished that it was tinier  because Kobe beef is so rich. It's like foie gras    it's not even like steak. I almost couldn't finish it. I was really happy when I was done. Now  the photographer who took the pictures for this project for some reason posed his dog in a lot of them  so that's why you're going to see this recurring character. Which  I guess  you know  communicates to you that I did not think that one was really worth the price. White truffles. One of the most expensive luxury foods by weight in the world. To try this  I went to a Mario Batali restaurant in Manhattan    Del Posto. The waiter  you know  came out with the white truffle knob and his shaver  and he shaved it onto my pasta and he said  you know   Would Signore like the truffles   And the charm of white truffles is in their aroma. It's not in their taste  really. It's not in their texture. It's in the smell. These white pearlescent flakes hit the noodles  this haunting  wonderful  nutty  mushroomy smell wafted up.    seconds passed and it was gone. And then I was left with these little ugly flakes on my pasta that  you know  their purpose had been served  and so I'm afraid to say that this was also a disappointment to me. There were several    several of these items were disappointments. Yeah. The magazine wouldn't pay for me to go there. They did give me a tour  though. And this hotel suite is       square feet. It has     degree views. It has four balconies. It was designed by the architect I.M. Pei. It comes with its own Rolls Royce and driver. It comes with its own wine cellar that you can draw freely from. When I took the tour  it actually included some Opus One  I was glad to see.        dollars for a night in a hotel. This is soap that's made from silver nanoparticles  which have antibacterial properties. I washed my face with this this morning in preparation for this. And it  you know  tickled a little bit and it smelled good  but I have to say that nobody here has complimented me on the cleanliness of my face today. But then again  nobody has complimented me on the jeans I'm wearing. These ones GQ did spring for    I own these    but I will tell you  not only did I not get a compliment from any of you  I have not gotten a compliment from anybody in the months that I have owned and worn these. I don't think that whether or not you're getting a compliment should be the test of something's value  but I think in the case of a fashion item  an article of clothing  that's a reasonable benchmark. That said  a lot of work goes into these. They are made from handpicked organic Zimbabwean cotton that has been shuttle loomed and then hand dipped in natural indigo    times. But no compliments. Thank you. Armando Manni is a former filmmaker who makes this olive oil from an olive that grows on a single slope in Tuscany. And he goes to great lengths to protect the olive oil from oxygen and light. He uses tiny bottles  the glass is tinted  he tops the olive oil off with an inert gas. And he actually    once he releases a batch of it  he regularly conducts molecular analyses and posts the results online  so you can go online and look at your batch number and see how the phenolics are developing  and  you know  gauge its freshness. I did a blind taste test of this with    people and five other olive oils. It tasted fine. It tasted interesting. It was very green  it was very peppery. But in the blind taste test  it came in last. The olive oil that came in first was actually a bottle of Whole Foods     olive oil which had been oxidizing next to my stove for six months. A recurring theme is that a lot of these things are from Japan    you'll start to notice. I don't play golf  so I couldn't actually road test these  but I did interview a guy who owns them. Even the people who market these clubs    I mean  they'll say these have four axis shafts which minimize loss of club speed and thereby drive the ball farther    but they'll say  look  you know  you're not getting        dollars worth of performance from these clubs. You're paying for the bling  that they're encrusted with gold and platinum. The guy who I interviewed who owns them did say that he's gotten a lot of pleasure out of them  so ... Oh  yeah  you know this one  This is a coffee made from a very unusual process. The luwak is an Asian Palm Civet. It's a cat that lives in trees  and at night it comes down and it prowls the coffee plantations. And apparently it's a very picky eater and it  you know  hones in on only the ripest coffee cherries. And then an enzyme in its digestive tract leeches into the beans  and people with the unenviable job of collecting these cats' leavings then go through the forest collecting the  you know  results and processing it into coffee    although you actually can buy it in the unprocessed form. That's right. Unrelatedly    Japan is doing crazy things with toilets. There is now a toilet that has an MP  player in it. There's one with a fragrance dispenser. There's one that actually analyzes the contents of the bowl and transmits the results via email to your doctor. It's almost like a home medical center    and that is the direction that Japanese toilet technology is heading in. This one does not have those bells and whistles  but for pure functionality it's pretty much the best    the Neorest    . And to try this    I couldn't get a loaner  but I did go into the Manhattan showroom of the manufacturer  Toto  and they have a bathroom off of the showroom that you can use  which I used. It's fully automated    you walk towards it  and the seat lifts. The seat is preheated. There's a water jet that cleans you. There's an air jet that dries you. You get up  it flushes by itself. The lid closes  it self cleans. Not only is it a technological leap forward  but I really do believe it's a bit of a cultural leap forward. I mean  a no hands  no toilet paper toilet. And I want to get one of these. This was another one I could not get a loaner of. Tom Cruise supposedly owns this bed. There's a little plaque on the end that  you know  each buyer gets their name engraved on it. To try this one  the maker of it let me and my wife spend the night in the Manhattan showroom. Lights glaring in off the street  and we had to hire a security guard and all these things. But anyway  we had a great night's sleep. And you spend a third of your life in bed. I don't think it's that bad of a deal. This was a fun one. This is the fastest street legal car in the world and the most expensive production car. I got to drive this with a chaperone from the company  a professional race car driver  and we drove around the canyons outside of Los Angeles and down on the Pacific Coast Highway. And  you know  when we pulled up to a stoplight the people in the adjacent cars kind of gave us respectful nods. And it was really amazing. It was such a smooth ride. Most of the cars that I drive  if I get up to    they start to rattle. I switched lanes on the highway and the driver  this chaperone  said   You know  you were just going     miles an hour.  And I had no idea that I was one of those obnoxious people you occasionally see weaving in and out of traffic  because it was just that smooth. And if I was a billionaire  I would get one. This is a completely gratuitous video I'm just going to show of one of the pitfalls of advanced technology. This is Tom Cruise arriving at the  Mission  Impossible III  premiere. When he tries to open the door  you could call it  Mission  Impossible IV.  There was one object that I could not get my hands on  and that was the      Cheval Blanc. The '   Cheval Blanc is probably the most mythologized wine of the   th century. And Cheval Blanc is kind of an unusual wine for Bordeaux in having a significant percentage of the Cabernet Franc grape. And      was a legendary vintage  especially in the right bank of Bordeaux. And just together  that vintage and that chateau took on this aura that eventually kind of gave it this cultish following. But it's    years old. There's not much of it left. What there is of it left you don't know if it's real    it's considered to be the most faked wine in the world. Not that many people are looking to pop open their one remaining bottle for a journalist. So  I'd about given up trying to get my hands on one of these. I'd put out feelers to retailers  to auctioneers  and it was coming up empty. And then I got an email from a guy named Bipin Desai. Bipin Desai is a U.C. Riverside theoretical physicist who also happens to be the preeminent organizer of rare wine tastings  and he said   I've got a tasting coming up where we're going to serve the '   Cheval Blanc.  And it was going to be a double vertical    it was going to be    vintages of Cheval Blanc  and    vintages of Yquem. And it was an invitation you do not refuse. I went. It was three days  four meals. And at lunch on Saturday  we opened the '  . And you know  it had this fragrant softness  and it smelled a little bit of linseed oil. And then I tasted it  and it  you know  had this kind of unctuous  porty richness  which is characteristic of that wine    that it sort of resembles port in a lot of ways. There were people at my table who thought it was  you know  fantastic. There were some people who were a little less impressed. And I wasn't that impressed. And I don't    call my palate a philistine palate    so it doesn't necessarily mean something that I wasn't impressed  but I was not the only one there who had that reaction. And it wasn't just to that wine. Any one of the wines served at this tasting  if I'd been served it at a dinner party  it would have been  you know  the wine experience of my lifetime  and incredibly memorable. But drinking    great wines over three days  they all just blurred together  and it became almost a grueling experience. And I just wanted to finish by mentioning a very interesting study which came out earlier this year from some researchers at Stanford and Caltech. And they gave subjects the same wine  labeled with different price tags. A lot of people  you know  said that they liked the more expensive wine more    it was the same wine  but they thought it was a different one that was more expensive. But what was unexpected was that these researchers did MRI brain imaging while the people were drinking the wine  and not only did they say they enjoyed the more expensively labeled wine more    their brain actually registered as experiencing more pleasure from the same wine when it was labeled with a higher price tag. Thank you. The career that I started early on in my life was looking for exotic life forms in exotic places  and at that time I was working in the Antarctic and the Arctic  and high deserts and low deserts. Until about a dozen years ago  when I was really captured by caves  and I really re focused most of my research in that direction. So I have a really cool day job   I get to do some really amazing stuff. I work in some of the most extreme cave environments on the planet. Many of them are trying to kill us from the minute we go into them  but nevertheless  they're absolutely gripping  and contain unbelievable biological wonders that are very  very different from those that we have on the planet. Apart from the intrinsic value of the biology and mineralogy and geo microbiology that we do there  we're also using these as templates for figuring out how to go look for life on other planets. Particularly Mars  but also Europa  the small  icy moon around Jupiter. And perhaps  someday  far beyond our solar system itself. I'm very passionately interested in the human future  on the Moon and Mars particularly  and elsewhere in the solar system. I think it's time that we transitioned to a solar system going civilization and species. And  as an outgrowth of all of this then  I wonder about whether we can  and whether we even should  think about transporting Earth type life to other planets. Notably Mars  as a first example. Something I never talk about in scientific meetings is how I actually got to this state and why I do the work that I do. Why don't I have a normal job  a sensible job  And then of course  I blame the Soviet Union. Because in the mid     s  when I was a tiny child  they had the audacity to launch a very primitive little satellite called Sputnik  which sent the Western world into a hysterical tailspin. And a tremendous amount of money went into the funding of science and mathematics skills for kids. And I'm a product of that generation  like so many other of my peers. It really caught hold of us  and caught fire  and it would be lovely if we could reproduce that again now. Of course  refusing to grow up       even though I impersonate a grown up in daily life  but I do a fairly good job of that    but really retaining that childlike quality of not caring what other people think about what you're interested in  is really critical. The next element is the fact that I have applied a value judgment and my value judgment is that the presence of life is better than no life. And so  life is more valuable than no life. And so I think that that holds together a great deal of the work that people in this audience approach. I'm very interested in Mars  of course  and that was a product of my being a young undergraduate when the Viking Landers landed on Mars. And that took what had been a tiny little astronomical object in the sky  that you would see as a dot  and turned it completely into a landscape  as that very first primitive picture came rastering across the screen. And when it became a landscape  it also became a destination  and altered  really  the course of my life. In my graduate years I worked with my colleague and mentor and friend  Steve Schneider  at the National Center for Atmospheric Research  working on global change issues. We've written a number of things on the role of Gaia hypothesis    whether or not you could consider Earth as a single entity in any meaningful scientific sense  and then  as an outgrowth of that  I worked on the environmental consequences of nuclear war. So  wonderful things and grim things. But what it taught me was to look at Earth as a planet with external eyes  not just as our home. And that is a wonderful stepping away in perspective  to try to then think about the way our planet behaves  as a planet  and with the life that's on it. And all of this seems to me to be a salient point in history. We're getting ready to begin to go through the process of leaving our planet of origin and out into the wider solar system and beyond. So  back to Mars. How hard is it going to be to find life on Mars  Well  sometimes it's really very hard for us to find each other  even on this planet. So  finding life on another planet is a non trivial occupation and we spend a lot of time trying to think about that. Whether or not you think it's likely to be successful sort of depends on what you think about the chances of life in the universe. I think  myself  that life is a natural outgrowth of the increasing complexification of matter over time. So  you start with the Big Bang and you get hydrogen  and then you get helium  and then you get more complicated stuff  and you get planets forming    and life is a common  planetary based phenomenon  in my view. Certainly  in the last    years  we've seen increasing numbers of planets outside of our solar system being confirmed  and just last month  a couple of weeks ago  a planet in the size class of Earth has actually been found. And so this is very exciting news. So  my first bold prediction is that  is that in the universe  life is going to be everywhere. It's going to be everywhere we look    where there are planetary systems that can possibly support it. And those planetary systems are going to be very common. So  what about life on Mars  Well  if somebody had asked me about a dozen years ago what I thought the chances of life on Mars would be  I would've probably said  a couple of percent. And even that was considered outrageous at the time. I was once sneeringly introduced by a former NASA official  as the only person on the planet who still thought there was life on Mars. Of course  that official is now dead  and I'm not  so there's a certain amount of glory in outliving your adversaries. But things have changed greatly over the last dozen years. And the reason that they have changed is because we now have new information. The amazing Pathfinder mission that went in '    and the MER Rover missions that are on Mars as we speak now and the European Space Agency's Mars Express  has taught us a number of amazing things. There is sub surface ice on that planet. And so where there is water  there is a very high chance of our kind of life. There's clearly sedimentary rocks all over the place   one of the landers is sitting in the middle of an ancient seabed  and there are these amazing structures called blueberries  which are these little  rocky concretions that we are busy making biologically in my lab right now. So  with all of these things put together  I think that the chances of life are much greater than I would've ever thought. I think that the chance of life having arisen on Mars  sometime in its past  is maybe one in four to maybe even half and half. So this is a very bold statement. I think it's there  and I think we need to go look for it  and I think it's underground. So the game's afoot  and this is the game that we play in astro biology. How do you try to get a handle on extraterrestrial life  How do you plan to look for it  How do you know it when you find it  Because if it's big and obvious  we would've already found it    it would've already bitten us on the foot  and it hasn't. So  we know that it's probably quite cryptic. Very critically  how do we protect it  if we find it  and not contaminate it  And also  even perhaps more critically  because this is the only home planet we have  how do we protect us from it  while we study it  So why might it be hard to find  Well  it's probably microscopic  and it's never easy to study microscopic things  although the amazing tools that we now have to do that allow us to study things in much greater depth  at much smaller scales than ever before. But it's probably hiding  because if you are out sequestering resources from your environment  that makes you yummy  and other things might want to eat you  or consume you. And so  there's a game of predator prey that's going to be  essentially  universal  really  in any kind of biological system. It also may be very  very different in its fundamental properties   its chemistry  or its size. We say small  but what does that mean  Is it virus sized  Is it smaller than that  Is it bigger than the biggest bacterium  We don't know. And speed of activity  which is something that we face in our work with sub surface organisms  because they grow very  very slowly. If I were to take a swab off your teeth and plate it on a Petri plate  within about four or five hours  I would have to see growth. But the organisms that we work with  from the sub surface of Earth  very often it's months    and in many cases  years    before we see any growth whatsoever. So they are  intrinsically  a slower life form. But the real issue is that we are guided by our limited experience  and until we can think out of the box of our cranium and what we know  then we can't recognize what to look for  or how to plan for it. So  perspective is everything and  because of the history that I've just briefly talked to you about  I have learned to think about Earth as an extraterrestrial planet. And this has been invaluable in our approach to try to study these things. This is my favorite game on airplanes  where you're in an airplane and you look out the window  you see the horizon. I always turn my head on the side  and that simple change makes me go from seeing this planet as home  to seeing it as a planet. It's a very simple trick  and I never fail to do it when I'm sitting in a window seat. Well  this is what we apply to our work. This shows one of the most extreme caves that we work in. This is Cueva de Villa Luz in Tabasco  in Mexico  and this cave is saturated with sulfuric acid. There is tremendous amounts of hydrogen sulfide coming into this cave from volcanic sources and from the breakdown of evaporite    minerals below the carbonates in which this cave is formed    and it is a completely hostile environment for us. We have to go in with protective suits and breathing gear  and    parts per million of H S will kill you. This is regularly several hundred parts per million. So  it's a very hazardous environment  with CO as well  and many other gases. These extreme physical and chemical parameters make the biology that grows in these places very special. Because contrary to what you might think  this is not devoid of life. This is one of the richest caves that we have found on the planet  anywhere. It's bursting with life. The extremes on Earth are interesting in their own right  but one of the reasons that we're interested in them is because they represent  really  the average conditions that we may expect on other planets. So  this is part of the ability that we have  to try to stretch our imagination  in terms of what we may find in the future. There's so much life in this cave  and I can't even begin to scratch the surface of it with you. But one of the most famous objects out of this are what we call Snottites  for obvious reasons. This stuff looks like what comes out of your two year old's nose when he has a cold. And this is produced by bacteria who are actually making more sulfuric acid  and living at pHs right around zero. And so  this stuff is like battery acid. And yet  everything in this cave has adapted to it. In fact  there's so much energy available for biology in this cave  that there's actually a huge number of cavefish. And the local Zoque Indians harvest this twice a year  as part of their Easter week celebration and Holy Week celebration. This is very unusual for caves. In some of the other amazing caves that we work in    this is in Lechuguilla cave in New Mexico near Carlsbad  and this is one of the most famous caves in the world. It's     miles of mapped passage  it's pristine  it has no natural opening and it's a gigantic biological  geo microbiological laboratory. In this cave  great areas are covered by this reddish material that you see here  and also these enormous crystals of selenite that you can see dangling down. This stuff is produced biologically. This is the breakdown product of the bedrock  that organisms are busy munching their way through. They take iron and manganese minerals within the bedrock and they oxidize them. And every time they do that  they get a tiny little packet of energy. And that tiny little packet of energy is what they use  then  to run their life processes. Interestingly enough  they also do this with uranium and chromium  and various other toxic metals. And so  the obvious avenue for bio remediation comes from organisms like this. These organisms we now bring into the lab  and you can see some of them growing on Petri plates  and get them to reproduce the precise biominerals that we find on the walls of these caves. So  these are signals that they leave in the rock record. Well  even in basalt surfaces in lava tube caves  which are a by product of volcanic activity  we find these walls totally covered  in many cases  by these beautiful  glistening silver walls  or shiny pink or shiny red or shiny gold. And these are mineral deposits that are also made by bacteria. And you can see in these central images here  scanning electron micrographs of some of these guys    these are gardens of these bacteria. One of the interesting things about these particular guys is that they're in the actinomycete and streptomycete groups of the bacteria  which is where we get most of our antibiotics. The sub surface of Earth contains a vast biodiversity. And these organisms  because they're very separate from the surface  make a vast array of novel compounds. And so  the potential for exploiting this for pharmaceutical and industrial chemical uses is completely untapped  but probably exceeds most of the rest of the biodiversity of the planet. So  lava tube caves   I've just told you about organisms that live here on this planet. We know that on Mars and the Moon there are tons of these structures. We can see them. On the left you can see a lava tube forming at a recent eruption    Mount Etna in Sicily    and this is the way these tubes form. And when they hollow out  then they become habitats for organisms. These are all over the planet Mars  and we're busy cataloguing them now. And so  there's very interesting cave real estate on Mars  at least of that type. In order to access these sub surface environments that we're interested in  we're very interested in developing the tools to do this. You know  it's not easy to get into these caves. It requires crawling  climbing  rope work  technical rope work and many other complex human motions in order to access these. We face the problem of  how can we do this robotically  Why would we want to do it robotically  Well  we're going to be sending robotic missions to Mars long in advance of human missions. And then  secondly  getting back to that earlier point that I made about the preciousness of any life that we may find on Mars  we don't want to contaminate it. And one of the best ways to study something without contaminating it is to have an intermediary. And in this case  we're imagining intermediary robotic devices that can actually do some of that front end work for us  to protect any potential life that we find. I'm not going to go through all of these projects now  but we're involved in about half a dozen robotic development projects  in collaboration with a number of different groups. I want to talk specifically about the array that you see on the top. These are hopping microbot swarms. I'm working on this with the Field and Space Robotics Laboratory and my friend Steve Dubowsky at MIT  and we have come up with the idea of having little  jumping bean like robots that are propelled by artificial muscle  which is one of the Dubowsky Lab's specialties    are the EPAMs  or artificial muscles. And these allow them to hop. They behave with a swarm behavior  where they relate to each other  modeled after insect swarm behavior  and they could be made very numerous. And so  one can send a thousand of them  as you can see in this upper left hand picture  a thousand of them could fit into the payload bay that was used for one of the current MER Rovers. And these little guys    you could lose many of them. If you send a thousand of them  you could probably get rid of    percent of them and still have a mission. And so  that allows you the flexibility to go into very challenging terrain and actually make your way where you want to go. Now  to wrap this up  I want to talk for two seconds about caves and the human expansion beyond Earth as a natural outgrowth of the work that we do in caves. It occurred to us a number of years ago that caves have many properties that people have used and other organisms have used as habitat in the past. And perhaps it's time we started to explore those  in the context of future Mars and the Moon exploration. So  we have just finished a NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts Phase II study  looking at the irreducible set of technologies that you would need in order to actually allow people to inhabit lava tubes on the Moon or Mars. It turns out to be a fairly simple and small list  and we have gone in the relatively primitive technology direction. So  we're talking about things like inflatable liners that can conform to the complex topological shape on the inside of a cave  foamed in place airlocks to deal with this complex topology  various ways of getting breathing gases made from the intrinsic materials of these bodies. And the future is there for us to use these lava tube caves on Mars. And right now we're in caves  and we're doing science and recreation  but I think in the future we'll be using them for habitat and science on these other bodies. Now  my view of what the current status of potential life on Mars is that it's probably been on the planet  maybe one in two chances. The question as to whether there is life on Mars that is related to life on Earth has now been very muddied  because we now know  from Mars meteorites that have made it to Earth  that there's material that can be exchanged between those two planets. One of the burning questions  of course  is if we go there and find life in the sub surface  as I fully expect that we will  is that a second genesis of life  Did life start here and was it transported there  Did it start there and get transported here  This will be a fascinating puzzle as we go into the next half century  and where I expect that we will have more and more Mars missions to answer these questions. Thank you. I was trying to think  how is sync connected to happiness  and it occurred to me that for some reason we take pleasure in synchronizing. We like to dance together  we like singing together. And so  if you'll put up with this  I would like to enlist your help with a first experiment today. The experiment is    and I notice  by the way  that when you applauded  that you did it in a typical North American way  that is  you were raucous and incoherent. You were not organized. It didn't even occur to you to clap in unison. Do you think you could do it  I would like to see if this audience would    no  you haven't practiced  as far as I know    can you get it together to clap in sync  Whoa  Now  that's what we call emergent behavior. So I didn't expect that  but    I mean  I expected you could synchronize. It didn't occur to me you'd increase your frequency. It's interesting. So what do we make of that  First of all  we know that you're all brilliant. This is a room full of intelligent people  highly sensitive. Some trained musicians out there. Is that what enabled you to synchronize  So to put the question a little more seriously  let's ask ourselves what are the minimum requirements for what you just did  for spontaneous synchronization. Do you need  for instance  to be as smart as you are  Do you even need a brain at all just to synchronize  Do you need to be alive  I mean  that's a spooky thought  right  Inanimate objects that might spontaneously synchronize themselves. It's real. In fact  I'll try to explain today that sync is maybe one of  if not one of the most  perhaps the most pervasive drive in all of nature. It extends from the subatomic scale to the farthest reaches of the cosmos. It's a deep tendency toward order in nature that opposes what we've all been taught about entropy. I mean  I'm not saying the law of entropy is wrong    it's not. But there is a countervailing force in the universe    the tendency towards spontaneous order. And so that's our theme. Now  to get into that  let me begin with what might have occurred to you immediately when you hear that we're talking about synchrony in nature  which is the glorious example of birds that flock together  or fish swimming in organized schools. So these are not particularly intelligent creatures  and yet  as we'll see  they exhibit beautiful ballets. This is from a BBC show called  Predators   and what we're looking at here are examples of synchrony that have to do with defense. When you're small and vulnerable  like these starlings  or like the fish  it helps to swarm to avoid predators  to confuse predators. Let me be quiet for a second because this is so gorgeous. For a long time  biologists were puzzled by this behavior  wondering how it could be possible. We're so used to choreography giving rise to synchrony. These creatures are not choreographed. They're choreographing themselves. And only today is science starting to figure out how it works. I'll show you a computer model made by Iain Couzin  a researcher at Oxford  that shows how swarms work. There are just three simple rules. First  all the individuals are only aware of their nearest neighbors. Second  all the individuals have a tendency to line up. And third  they're all attracted to each other  but they try to keep a small distance apart. And when you build those three rules in  automatically you start to see swarms that look very much like fish schools or bird flocks. Now  fish like to stay close together  about a body length apart. Birds try to stay about three or four body lengths apart. But except for that difference  the rules are the same for both. Now  all this changes when a predator enters the scene. There's a fourth rule  when a predator's coming  get out of the way. Here on the model you see the predator attacking. The prey move out in random directions  and then the rule of attraction brings them back together again  so there's this constant splitting and reforming. And you see that in nature. Keep in mind that  although it looks as if each individual is acting to cooperate  what's really going on is a kind of selfish Darwinian behavior. Each is scattering away at random to try to save its scales or feathers. That is  out of the desire to save itself  each creature is following these rules  and that leads to something that's safe for all of them. Even though it looks like they're thinking as a group  they're not. You might wonder what exactly is the advantage to being in a swarm  so you can think of several. As I say  if you're in a swarm  your odds of being the unlucky one are reduced as compared to a small group. There are many eyes to spot danger. And you'll see in the example with the starlings  with the birds  when this peregrine hawk is about to attack them  that actually waves of panic can propagate  sending messages over great distances. You'll see    let's see  it's coming up possibly at the very end    maybe not. Information can be sent over half a kilometer away in a very short time through this mechanism. Yes  it's happening here. See if you can see those waves propagating through the swarm. It's beautiful. The birds are  we sort of understand  we think  from that computer model  what's going on. As I say  it's just those three simple rules  plus the one about watch out for predators. There doesn't seem to be anything mystical about this. We don't  however  really understand at a mathematical level. I'm a mathematician. We would like to be able to understand better. I mean  I showed you a computer model  but a computer is not understanding. A computer is  in a way  just another experiment. We would really like to have a deeper insight into how this works and to understand  you know  exactly where this organization comes from. How do the rules give rise to the patterns  There is one case that we have begun to understand better  and it's the case of fireflies. If you see fireflies in North America  like so many North American sorts of things  they tend to be independent operators. They ignore each other. They each do their own thing  flashing on and off  paying no attention to their neighbors. But in Southeast Asia    places like Thailand or Malaysia or Borneo    there's a beautiful cooperative behavior that occurs among male fireflies. You can see it every night along the river banks. The trees  mangrove trees  are filled with fireflies communicating with light. Specifically  it's male fireflies who are all flashing in perfect time together  in perfect synchrony  to reinforce a message to the females. And the message  as you can imagine  is  Come hither. Mate with me.  In a second I'm going to show you a slow motion of a single firefly so that you can get a sense. This is a single frame. Then on  and then off    a   th of a second  there. And then watch this whole river bank  and watch how precise the synchrony is. On  more on and then off. The combined light from these beetles    these are actually tiny beetles    is so bright that fishermen out at sea can use them as navigating beacons to find their way back to their home rivers. It's stunning. For a long time it was not believed when the first Western travelers  like Sir Francis Drake  went to Thailand and came back with tales of this unbelievable spectacle. No one believed them. We don't see anything like this in Europe or in the West. And for a long time  even after it was documented  it was thought to be some kind of optical illusion. Scientific papers were published saying it was twitching eyelids that explained it  or  you know  a human being's tendency to see patterns where there are none. But I hope you've convinced yourself now  with this nighttime video  that they really were very well synchronized. Okay  well  the issue then is  do we need to be alive to see this kind of spontaneous order  and I've already hinted that the answer is no. Well  you don't have to be a whole creature. You can even be just a single cell. Like  take  for instance  your pacemaker cells in your heart right now. They're keeping you alive. Every beat of your heart depends on this crucial region  the sinoatrial node  which has about        independent cells that would each beep  have an electrical rhythm    a voltage up and down    to send a signal to the ventricles to pump. Now  your pacemaker is not a single cell. It's this democracy of        cells that all have to fire in unison for the pacemaker to work correctly. I don't want to give you the idea that synchrony is always a good idea. If you have epilepsy  there is an instance of billions of brain cells  or at least millions  discharging in pathological concert. So this tendency towards order is not always a good thing. You don't have to be alive. You don't have to be even a single cell. If you look  for instance  at how lasers work  that would be a case of atomic synchrony. In a laser  what makes laser light so different from the light above my head here is that this light is incoherent    many different colors and different frequencies  sort of like the way you clapped initially    but if you were a laser  it would be rhythmic applause. It would be all atoms pulsating in unison  emitting light of one color  one frequency. Now comes the very risky part of my talk  which is to demonstrate that inanimate things can synchronize. Hold your breath for me. What I have here are two empty water bottles. This is not Keith Barry doing a magic trick. This is a klutz just playing with some water bottles. I have some metronomes here. Can you hear that  All right  so  I've got a metronome  and it's the world's smallest metronome  the    well  I shouldn't advertise. Anyway  so this is the world's smallest metronome. I've set it on the fastest setting  and I'm going to now take another one set to the same setting. We can try this first. If I just put them on the table together  there's no reason for them to synchronize  and they probably won't. Maybe you'd better listen to them. I'll stand here. What I'm hoping is that they might just drift apart because their frequencies aren't perfectly the same. Right  They did. They were in sync for a while  but then they drifted apart. And the reason is that they're not able to communicate. Now  you might think that's a bizarre idea. How can metronomes communicate  Well  they can communicate through mechanical forces. So I'm going to give them a chance to do that. I also want to wind this one up a bit. How can they communicate  I'm going to put them on a movable platform  which is the  Guide to Graduate Study at Cornell.  Okay  So here it is. Let's see if we can get this to work. My wife pointed out to me that it will work better if I put both on at the same time because otherwise the whole thing will tip over. All right. So there we go. Let's see. OK  I'm not trying to cheat    let me start them out of sync. No  hard to even do that. All right. So before any one goes out of sync  I'll just put those right there. Now  that might seem a bit whimsical  but this pervasiveness of this tendency towards spontaneous order sometimes has unexpected consequences. And a clear case of that  was something that happened in London in the year     . The Millennium Bridge was supposed to be the pride of London    a beautiful new footbridge erected across the Thames  first river crossing in over     years in London. There was a big competition for the design of this bridge  and the winning proposal was submitted by an unusual team    in the TED spirit  actually    of an architect    perhaps the greatest architect in the United Kingdom  Lord Norman Foster    working with an artist  a sculptor  Sir Anthony Caro  and an engineering firm  Ove Arup. And together they submitted a design based on Lord Foster's vision  which was    he remembered as a kid reading Flash Gordon comic books  and he said that when Flash Gordon would come to an abyss  he would shoot what today would be a kind of a light saber. He would shoot his light saber across the abyss  making a blade of light  and then scamper across on this blade of light. He said   That's the vision I want to give to London. I want a blade of light across the Thames.  So they built the blade of light  and it's a very thin ribbon of steel  the world's    probably the flattest and thinnest suspension bridge there is  with cables that are out on the side. You're used to suspension bridges with big droopy cables on the top. These cables were on the side of the bridge  like if you took a rubber band and stretched it taut across the Thames    that's what's holding up this bridge. Now  everyone was very excited to try it out. On opening day  thousands of Londoners came out  and something happened. And within two days the bridge was closed to the public. So I want to first show you some interviews with people who were on the bridge on opening day  who will describe what happened. Man  It really started moving sideways and slightly up and down  rather like being on the boat. Woman  Yeah  it felt unstable  and it was very windy  and I remember it had lots of flags up and down the sides  so you could definitely    there was something going on sideways  it felt  maybe. Interviewer  Not up and down  Boy  No. Interviewer  And not forwards and backwards  Boy  No. Interviewer  Just sideways. About how much was it moving  do you think  Boy  It was about    Interviewer  I mean  that much  or this much  Boy  About the second one. Interviewer  This much  Boy  Yeah. Man  It was at least six  six to eight inches  I would have thought. Interviewer  Right  so  at least this much  Man  Oh  yes. Woman  I remember wanting to get off. Interviewer  Oh  did you  Woman  Yeah. It felt odd. Interviewer  So it was enough to be scary  Woman  Yeah  but I thought that was just me. Interviewer  Ah  Now  tell me why you had to do this  Boy  We had to do this because  to keep in balance because if you didn't keep your balance  then you would just fall over about  like  to the left or right  about    degrees. Interviewer  So just show me how you walk normally. Right. And then show me what it was like when the bridge started to go. Right. So you had to deliberately push your feet out sideways and    oh  and short steps  Man  That's right. And it seemed obvious to me that it was probably the number of people on it. Interviewer  Were they deliberately walking in step  or anything like that  Man  No  they just had to conform to the movement of the bridge. Steven Strogatz  All right  so that already gives you a hint of what happened. Think of the bridge as being like this platform. Think of the people as being like metronomes. Now  you might not be used to thinking of yourself as a metronome  but after all  we do walk like    I mean  we oscillate back and forth as we walk. And especially if we start to walk like those people did  right  They all showed this strange sort of skating gait that they adopted once the bridge started to move. And so let me show you now the footage of the bridge. But also  after you see the bridge on opening day  you'll see an interesting clip of work done by a bridge engineer at Cambridge named Allan McRobie  who figured out what happened on the bridge  and who built a bridge simulator to explain exactly what the problem was. It was a kind of unintended positive feedback loop between the way the people walked and the way the bridge began to move  that engineers knew nothing about. Actually  I think the first person you'll see is the young engineer who was put in charge of this project. Okay. Interviewer  Right. So it was quite small    Engineer  Yes. Interviewer     but real  Engineer  Absolutely. Interviewer  You thought   Oh  bother.  Engineer  I felt I was disappointed about it. We'd spent a lot of time designing this bridge  and we'd analyzed it  we'd checked it to codes    to heavier loads than the codes    and here it was doing something that we didn't know about. Interviewer  You didn't expect. Engineer  Exactly. Narrator  The most dramatic and shocking footage shows whole sections of the crowd    hundreds of people    apparently rocking from side to side in unison  not only with each other  but with the bridge. This synchronized movement seemed to be driving the bridge. But how could the crowd become synchronized  Was there something special about the Millennium Bridge that caused this effect  This was to be the focus of the investigation. Interviewer  Well  at last the simulated bridge is finished  and I can make it wobble. Now  Allan  this is all your fault  isn't it  Allan McRobie  Yes. Interviewer  You designed this  yes  this simulated bridge  and this  you reckon  mimics the action of the real bridge  AM  It captures a lot of the physics  yes. Interviewer  Right. So if we get on it  we should be able to wobble it  yes  Allan McRobie is a bridge engineer from Cambridge who wrote to me  suggesting that a bridge simulator ought to wobble in the same way as the real bridge    provided we hung it on pendulums of exactly the right length. AM  This one's only a couple of tons  so it's fairly easy to get going. Just by walking. Interviewer  Well  it's certainly going now. AM  It doesn't have to be a real dangle. Just walk. It starts to go. Interviewer  It's actually quite difficult to walk. You have to be careful where you put your feet down  don't you  because if you get it wrong  it just throws you off your feet. AM  It certainly affects the way you walk  yes. You can't walk normally on it. Interviewer  No. If you try and put one foot in front of another  it's moving your feet away from under you. AM  Yes. Interviewer  So you've got to put your feet out sideways. So already  the simulator is making me walk in exactly the same way as our witnesses walked on the real bridge. AM  ... ice skating gait. There isn't all this sort of snake way of walking. Interviewer  For a more convincing experiment  I wanted my own opening day crowd  the sound check team. Their instructions  just walk normally. It's really intriguing because none of these people is trying to drive it. They're all having some difficulty walking. And the only way you can walk comfortably is by getting in step. But then  of course  everyone is driving the bridge. You can't help it. You're actually forced by the movement of the bridge to get into step  and therefore to drive it to move further. SS  All right  well  with that from the Ministry of Silly Walks  maybe I'd better end. I see I've gone over. But I hope that you'll go outside and see the world in a new way  to see all the amazing synchrony around us. Thank you. It's amazing  when you meet a head of state and you say   What is your most precious natural resource      they will not say children at first. And then when you say children  they will pretty quickly agree with you. the Minister of Defense of Colombia  head of the army and the head of the police  and we're dropping off     laptops today to children who have no television  no telephone and have been in a community cut off from the rest of the world for the past    years. The importance of delivering laptops to this region is connecting kids who have otherwise been unconnected because of the FARC  the guerrillas that started off    years ago as a political movement and then became a drug movement. There are one billion children in the world  and    percent of them don't have electricity at home or at school. And in some countries    let me pick Afghanistan       percent of the little girls don't go to school. And I don't mean that they drop out of school in the third or fourth grade    they don't go. So in the three years since I talked at TED and showed a prototype  it's gone from an idea to a real laptop. We have half a million laptops today in the hands of children. We have about a quarter of a million in transit to those and other children  and then there are another quarter of a million more that are being ordered at this moment. So  in rough numbers  there are a million laptops. That's smaller than I predicted    I predicted three to    million    but is still a very large number. In Colombia  we have about       laptops. It's the Minister of Defense with whom we're working  not the Minister of Education  because it is seen as a strategic defense issue in the sense of liberating these zones that had been completely closed off  in which the people who had been causing  if you will     years' worth of bombings and kidnappings and assassinations lived. And suddenly  the kids have connected laptops. They've leapfrogged. The change is absolutely monumental  because it's not just opening it up  but it's opening it up to the rest of the world. So yes  they're building roads  yes  they're putting in telephone  yes  there will be television. But the kids six to    years old are surfing the Internet in Spanish and in local languages  so the children grow up with access to information  with a window into the rest of the world. Before  they were closed off. Interestingly enough  in other countries  it will be the Minister of Finance who sees it as an engine of economic growth. And that engine is going to see the results in    years. It's not going to happen  you know  in one year  but it's an important  deeply economic and cultural change that happens through children. Thirty one countries in total are involved  and in the case of Uruguay  half the children already have them  and by the middle of       every single child in Uruguay will have a laptop    a little green laptop. Now what are some of the results  Some of the results that go across every single country include teachers saying they have never loved teaching so much  and reading comprehension measured by third parties    not by us    skyrockets. Probably the most important thing we see is children teaching parents. They own the laptops. They take them home. And so when I met with three children from the schools  who had traveled all day to come to Bogota  one of the three children brought her mother. And the reason she brought her mother is that this six year old child had been teaching her mother how to read and write. Her mother had not gone to primary school. And this is such an inversion  and such a wonderful example of children being the agents of change. So now  in closing  people say  now why laptops  Laptops are a luxury  it's like giving them iPods. No. The reason you want laptops is that the word is education  not laptop. This is an education project  not a laptop project. They need to learn learning. And then  just think    they can have  let's say      books. In a village  you have     laptops  each with a different set of     books  and so that village suddenly has        books. You and I didn't have        books when we went to primary school. Sometimes school is under a tree  or in many cases  the teacher has only a fifth grade education  so you need a collaborative model of learning  not just building more schools and training more teachers  which you have to do anyway. So we're once again doing  Give One  Get One.  Last year  we ran a  Give One  Get One  program  and it generated over         laptops that we were then able to give free. And by being a zero dollar laptop  we can go to countries that can't afford it at all. And that's what we did. We went to Haiti  we went to Rwanda  Afghanistan  Ethiopia  Mongolia. Places that are not markets  seeding it with the principles of saturation  connectivity  low ages  etc. And then we can actually roll out large numbers. So think of it this way  think of it as inoculating children against ignorance. And think of the laptop as a vaccine. You don't vaccinate a few children. You vaccinate all the children in an area. There are more Chinese restaurants in this country than McDonald's  Burger King  Kentucky Fried Chicken and Wendy's  combined            actually. Chinese restaurants have played an important role in American history  as a matter of fact. The Cuban missile crisis was resolved in a Chinese restaurant called Yenching Palace in Washington  D.C.  which unfortunately is closed now  and about to be turned into Walgreen's. And the house that John Wilkes Booth planned the assassination of Abraham Lincoln is actually also now a Chinese restaurant called Wok 'n Roll  on H Street in Washington. And it's not completely gratuitous  because wok and roll    Chinese food and Japanese foods  so it kind of works out. And Americans love their Chinese food so much they've actually brought it into space. NASA  for example  serves thermal stabilized sweet and sour pork on its shuttle menu for its astronauts. So  let me present the question to you  If our benchmark for Americanness is apple pie  you should ask yourself  how often do you eat apple pie  versus how often do you eat Chinese food. Right  And if you think about it  a lot of the foods that you think of or we think of or Americans think of as Chinese food are barely recognizable to Chinese  for example  beef with broccoli  egg rolls  General Tso's Chicken  fortune cookies  chop suey  the take out boxes. For example  I took a whole bunch of fortune cookies back to China  gave them to Chinese to see how they would react. What is this  Should I try it  Try it  What is it called  Fortune cookie. There's a piece of paper inside  What is this  You've won a prize  What is this  It's a fortune  Tasty  So  where are they from  The short answer is  actually  they're from Japan. And in Kyoto  outside  there are still small family run bakeries that make fortune cookies  as they did over     years ago     years before fortune cookies were introduced in the United States. If you see them side by side  there's yellow and brown. Theirs are actually flavored with miso and sesame paste  so they're not as sweet as our version. So  how did they get to the United States  Well  the short answer is  the Japanese immigrants came over  and a bunch of the bakers introduced them    including at least one in Los Angeles  and one here in San Francisco called Benkyo do  which is on the corner of Sutter and Buchanan. They back then  actually  made fortune cookies using very much the similar kind of irons that we saw back in Kyoto. So  the interesting question is  how do you go from fortune cookies being something that is Japanese to being something that is Chinese  Well  the short answer is  we locked up all the Japanese during World War II  including those that made fortune cookies  so that's the time when the Chinese moved in  kind of saw a market opportunity and took over. So  fortune cookies  invented by the Japanese  popularized by the Chinese  but ultimately consumed by Americans. They are more American than anything else. Another one of my favorite dishes  General Tso's Chicken    which  by the way  in the US Naval Academy is called Admiral Tso's Chicken. I love this dish. The original name in my book was actually called The Long March of General Tso  and he has marched very far indeed  because he is sweet  he is fried  and he is chicken    all things that Americans love. He has marched so far  actually  that the chef who originally invented the dish doesn't recognize it  he's kind of horrified. He's in Taiwan right now. He's retired  deaf and plays a lot of Mahjong. So  he    after this I showed him  he got up  and he's like   Mominqimiao   which means   This is all nonsense   and goes back to play his Mahjong game during the afternoon. So  another dish. One of my favorites. Beef with broccoli. Broccoli is not a Chinese vegetable  in fact  it is originally an Italian vegetable. It was introduced into the United States in the     s  but became popularized in the     s and the     s. In fact  the Chinese had their own version of broccoli  which is called Chinese broccoli  but right now  what    they've now discovered American broccoli  and are importing it as a  sort of  exotic delicacy. I guarantee you  General Tso never saw a stalk of broccoli in his life    and indeed  that actually was a picture of General Tso. I went to his home town. This is a billboard that says   Welcome to the birthplace of General Tso.  And I went looking for chicken. Finally found a cow    and did find chicken. Believe it or not  these guys were actually crossing the road. And       I actually found a whole bunch of General Tso's relatives who are still in the little town. This guy is now five generations removed from the General  this guy is about seven. Showed them all the pictures of General Tso Chicken that I showed you  and they're like  we don't know this dish. And then they're like  is this Chinese food  Because it doesn't look like Chinese food to them. But they weren't kind of surprised I traveled around the world to visit them  because in their eyes he is  after all  a famous Qing dynasty military hero. He played an important role in the Taiping rebellion  which was a war started by a guy who thought he was the son of God and the baby brother of Jesus Christ. And caused the war that killed    million people    still the deadliest civil war in the world to this day. So  you know  I realized when I was there  General Tso is kind of a lot like Colonel Sanders in America  in that he's known for chicken and not war. But in China  this guy's actually known for war and not chicken. But the granddaddy of all the Chinese American dishes we probably ought to talk about is chop suey  which was introduced around the turn of the   th century. And according to New York Times  in       there was an outbreak of Chinese restaurants all over town  and  the city has gone 'chop suey' mad.  So it took about    years before the Americans realized that  whoa  chop suey is actually not known in China. And as this article points out   The average native of any city in China knows nothing of chop suey.  You know  back then it was a way to show that you were sophisticated and cosmopolitan  if you were a guy and you wanted to impress a girl  you could take her out on a chop suey date. I like to say chop suey's the biggest culinary joke that one culture has ever played on another  because chop suey  if you translate into Chinese  means tsap sui  which  if you translate back  means  odds and ends.  So  these people are going around China asking for chop suey  which is sort of like a Japanese guy coming here and saying  I understand you have a very popular dish in your country called  leftovers   and it is particularly       right  And not only that  this dish is particularly popular after that holiday you call Thanksgiving. So  why    why and where    did chop suey come from  Let's go back to mid     s when the Chinese first came to America. Now back then  the Americans were not clamoring to eat Chinese food. In fact  they saw this people who landed at their shores as alien. These people weren't eating dogs    they were eating cats    and they weren't eating cats    they were eating rats. In fact  The New York Times  my esteemed employer  in      ran an article that asked   Do Chinese eat rats   And not the most PC question to be asked today  but if you kind of look at the popular imagery of the time  not so outlandish. This is actually a real advertisement for rat poison from the late     s  and if you see  under the word  Clears     very small    it says   They must go   which refers not only to the rats  but to the Chinese in their midst  because the way that the food was perceived was that these people who ate foods different from us must be different from us. And another way that you saw  sort of  this sort of  this antipathy towards the Chinese is through documents like this. This is actually in the Library of Congress  it is a pamphlet published by Samuel Gompers  hero of our American labor movement  and it's called   Some Reason for Chinese Exclusion  Meat versus Rice  American Manhood against Asiatic Coolieism  Which shall survive  And it basically made the argument that Chinese men who ate rice would necessarily bring down the standard of living for American men who ate meat. And as a matter of fact  then  this is one of the reasons why we must exclude them from this country So  with sentiments like these  the Chinese Exclusion Act was sort of passed between      and       the only time in American history when a group was specifically excluded for its national origin or ethnicity. So  in a way  because the Chinese were attacked  chop suey was created as a defense mechanism. Now  who came up with the idea of chop suey  There's a lot of different mysteries  a lot of different legends  but of the ones that I've found that I thought was most interesting is this article from     . A Chinese guy named Lem Sen shows up in Chinatown  New York City  and says  I want you guys all to stop making chop suey  because I am the original creator and sole proprietor of the dish known as chop suey. And the way that he tells it  there was a guy  there was a famous Chinese diplomat that showed up  and he was told to make a dish that looked very popular and could  quote   pass  as Chinese. And as he said    we would never print this today    but basically  the American man has become very rich. Lem Sen  who's this guy  I would have made this money  too  but I've spent all this time looking for the American man who stole my recipe. Now I've come and found him  and I want my recipe back and I want everyone to stop making chop suey  or pay me for the right to do the same. So it was an early exercise of intellectual property rights. So the thing is  this kind of idea of Chinese American food doesn't exist only in America. In fact  if you think about it  Chinese food is the most pervasive food on the planet  served on all seven continents  even Antarctica  because Monday night is Chinese food night at McMurdo Station  which is the main scientific station in Antarctica. So  you see different varieties of Chinese food. For example  there is French Chinese food  where they serve salt and pepper frog legs. There is Italian Chinese food  where they don't have fortune cookies  so they serve fried gelato. My downstairs neighbor  Alessandra  was completely shocked when I told her   Dude  fried gelato is not Chinese.  She's like   It's not  But they serve it in all the Chinese restaurants in Italy.  And even the Brits have their own version. This is a dish called crispy shredded beef  which has a lot of crisp  a lot of shred  and not a lot of beef. There is West Indian Chinese food  there's Jamaican Chinese food  there is Middle Eastern Chinese food  there's Mauritian Chinese food. This is a dish called Magic Bowl that I discovered. There's Indian Chinese food  Korean Chinese food  Japanese Chinese food  where they take the bao  the little buns  and they make them into pizza versions  and they take    and they    like  totally randomly they'll take Chinese noodle dishes  and they'll just Ramen ize them. This is  like  this is something that in the Chinese version has no soup. So  there's Peruvian Chinese food  which should not be mixed with Mexican Chinese food  where they basically take things and make it look like fajitas. And then    one thing  they have things like risotto chop suey. My personal favorite of all the restaurants I've encountered around the world was this one in Brazil  called  Kung Food.  So  let's take a step back  and kind of  understand what is to be appreciated in America. McDonald's has  sort of  garnered a lot of attention  a lot of respect  for basically standardizing the menu  d cor and dining experience in post World War II America. But you know what  They actually did so through a centralized headquarters out of Illinois  right  Chinese restaurants have done largely the same thing  I would argue  with the menu and the d cor    even the restaurant name    but without a centralized headquarters. So  this actually became very clear to me with the March          Powerball drawing  where  you know  they expected  based on the number of ticket sales they had  to have three or four second place winners    those are the people who match five or six Powerball numbers. Instead  they had      and they were completely shocked. They looked all across the country  and discovered it couldn't necessarily be fraud  because it happened  you know  in different states  across different computer systems. So whatever it was  it caused people to sort of behave in a mass synchronized way. So  like  OK  maybe it had to do with the patterns on the little pieces of paper    you know  like  it was a diamond  or  you know  diagonal. It wasn't that. It wasn't that  so they're like  OK  let's look at television  so they looked at an episode of  Lost.  Now  I don't have a TV  which makes me a freak  but very productive  and       and this episode of  Lost   I understand  where the overweight guy has a lucky number which was not a lucky number  which was how long they'd been on the island  but they looked  and the numbers did not match. So they looked at  The Young and The Restless   and it wasn't that  either. So  it wasn't until the first guy shows up the next day  and they ask him   Where did you get your number from   He's like   Oh  I got it from a fortune cookie.  This actually is a slip that one of the winners had  because the Tennessee lottery security officials were like  oh  no    like  this can't be true. But it was true  and basically  of those     people  and     of them or so had gotten their number from the fortune cookie. Yeah. So  I went and started looking. I went across the country  looking for these restaurants where these people had gotten their fortune cookies from. You know  there are a bunch of them  including Lee's China in Omaha    which is actually run by Koreans  but that's another point    and a bunch of them named China Buffet. So  what's interesting is that their stories were similar  but they were different. It was lunch  it was take out  it was sit down  it was buffet  it was three weeks ago  it was three months ago. But at some point  all these people had a very similar experience that converged at a fortune cookie and at a Chinese restaurant  and all these Chinese restaurants were serving fortune cookies  which  of course we know aren't even Chinese to begin with. So it's kind of part of the phenomenon I called spontaneous self organization  right  where  like in ant colonies  where little decisions made by    on the micro level actually have a big impact on the macro level. So  a good sort of contrast is Chicken McNuggets. McDonald's actually spent    years coming out with a chicken like product. They did chicken pot pie  they did fried chicken  and then they finally introduced Chicken McNuggets. And the great innovation of Chicken McNuggets was not nuggetfying them  because that's kind of an easy concept  but the trick behind Chicken McNuggets was  they were able to remove the chicken from the bone in a cost effective manner  which is why it took so long for other people to copy them. It took    years  and then within a couple of months  it was such a hit they just introduced it and rolled it across the entire system of McDonald's in the country. In contrast  we have General Tso's Chicken  which actually started in New York City in the early     s  as I was also starting in the university in New York City in the early     s  so ... And this logo  So me  General Tso's Chicken and this logo are all karmacally related. But that dish also took about    years to spread across America from a random restaurant in New York City. Someone's like  oh  God    it's sweet  it's fried  it's chicken  Americans will love this. So  what I like to say  you know  this being sort of Bay Area  Silicon Valley    is that we think of McDonald's as sort of the Microsoft of the dining experiences. We can think of Chinese restaurants perhaps as Linux  sort of an open source thing  right  where ideas from one person can be copied and propagated across the entire system  that there can be specialized versions of Chinese food  you know  depending on the region. For example  you know  in New Orleans we have Cajun Chinese food  where they serve Sichuan alligator and sweet and sour crawfish  right  And in Philadelphia  you have Philadelphia cheesesteak roll  which looks like an egg roll on the outside  but a cheesesteak on the inside. I was really surprised to discover that  not only in Philadelphia  but also in Atlanta  because what had happened was that a Chinese family had moved from Atlanta to    sorry  from Philadelphia to Atlanta  and brought that with them. So  the thing is  our historical lore  because of the way we like narratives  are full of vast characters such as  you know  Howard Schultz of Starbucks and Ray Kroc with McDonald's and Asa Chandler with Coca Cola. But  you know  it's very easy to overlook the smaller characters    oops    for example  like Lem Sen  who introduced chop suey  Chef Peng  who introduced General Tso Chicken  and all the Japanese bakers who introduced fortune cookies. So  the point of my presentation is to make you think twice  that those whose names are forgotten in history can often have had as much  if not more  impact on what we eat today. So. Thank you very much. I'll just start talking about the   th century. I hope nobody finds that offensive. I    you know  when I    after I had invented PCR  I kind of needed a change. And I moved down to La Jolla and learned how to surf. And I started living down there on the beach for a long time. And when surfers are out waiting for waves  you probably wonder  if you've never been out there  what are they doing  You know  sometimes there's a         minute break out there when you're waiting for a wave to come in. They usually talk about the   th century. You know  they get a real bad rap in the world. People think they're sort of lowbrows. One day  somebody suggested I read this book. It was called    it was called  The Air Pump   or something like  The Leviathan and The Air Pump.  It was a real weird book about the   th century. And I realized  the roots of the way I sort of thought was just the only natural way to think about things. That    you know  I was born thinking about things that way  and I had always been like a little scientist guy. And when I went to find out something  I used scientific methods. I wasn't real surprised  you know  when they first told me how    how you were supposed to do science  because I'd already been doing it for fun and whatever. But it didn't    it never occurred to me that it had to be invented and that it had been invented only     years ago. You know  it was    like it happened in England  and Germany  and Italy sort of all at the same time. And the story of that  I thought  was really fascinating. So I'm going to talk a little bit about that  and what exactly is it that scientists are supposed to do. And it's  it's a kind of    You know  Charles I got beheaded somewhere early in the   th century. And the English set up Cromwell and a whole bunch of Republicans or whatever  and not the kind of Republicans we had. They changed the government  and it didn't work. And Charles II  the son  was finally put back on the throne of England. He was really nervous  because his dad had been  you know  beheaded for being the King of England And he was nervous about the fact that conversations that got going in  like  bars and stuff would turn to    this is kind of    it's hard to believe  but people in the   th century in England were starting to talk about  you know  philosophy and stuff in bars. They didn't have TV screens  and they didn't have any football games to watch. And they would get really pissy  and all of a sudden people would spill out into the street and fight about issues like whether or not it was okay if Robert Boyle made a device called the vacuum pump. Now  Boyle was a friend of Charles II. He was a Christian guy during the weekends  but during the week he was a scientist. Which was    back then it was sort of  you know  well  you know    if you made this thing    he made this little device  like kind of like a bicycle pump in reverse that could suck all the air out of    you know what a bell jar is  One of these things  you pick it up  put it down  and it's got a seal  and you can see inside of it  so you can see what's going on inside this thing. But what he was trying to do was to pump all the air out of there  and see what would happen inside there. I mean  the first    I think one of the first experiments he did was he put a bird in there. And people in the   th century  they didn't really understand the same way we do about you know  this stuff is a bunch of different kinds of molecules  and we breathe it in for a purpose and all that. I mean  fish don't know much about water  and people didn't know much about air. But both started exploring it. One thing  he put a bird in there  and he pumped all the air out  and the bird died. So he said  hmm... He said    he called what he'd done as making    they didn't call it a vacuum pump at the time. Now you call it a vacuum pump  he called it a vacuum. Right  And immediately  he got into trouble with the local clergy who said  you can't make a vacuum. Ah  uh    Aristotle said that nature abhors one. I think it was a poor translation  probably  but people relied on authorities like that. And you know  Boyle says  well  shit. I make them all the time. I mean  whatever that is that kills the bird    and I'm calling it a vacuum. And the religious people said that if God wanted you to make    I mean  God is everywhere  that was one of their rules  is God is everywhere. And a vacuum    there's nothing in a vacuum  so you've    God couldn't be in there. So therefore the church said that you can't make a vacuum  you know. And Boyle said  bullshit. I mean  you want to call it Godless  you know  you call it Godless. But that's not my job. I'm not into that. I do that on the weekend. And like    what I'm trying to do is figure out what happens when you suck everything out of a compartment. And he did all these cute little experiments. Like he did one with    he had a little wheel  like a fan  that was sort of loosely attached  so it could spin by itself. He had another fan opposed to it that he had like a    I mean  the way I would have done this would be  like  a rubber band  and  you know  around a tinker toy kind of fan. I know exactly how he did it  I've seen the drawings. It's two fans  one which he could turn from outside after he got the vacuum established  and he discovered that if he pulled all the air out of it  the one fan would no longer turn the other one  right  Something was missing  you know. I mean  these are    it's kind of weird to think that someone had to do an experiment to show that  but that was what was going on at the time. And like  there was big arguments about it in the    you know  the gin houses and in the coffee shops and stuff. And Charles started not liking that. Charles II was kind of saying  you know  you should keep that    let's make a place where you can do this stuff where people don't get so    you know  we don't want the    we don't want to get the people mad at me again. And so    because when they started talking about religion and science and stuff like that  that's when it had sort of gotten his father in trouble. And so  Charles said  I'm going to put up the money give you guys a building  come here and you can meet in the building  but just don't talk about religion in there. And that was fine with Boyle. He said  OK  we're going to start having these meetings. And anybody who wants to do science is    this is about the time that Isaac Newton was starting to whip out a lot of really interesting things. And there was all kind of people that would come to the Royal Society  they called it. You had to be dressed up pretty well. It wasn't like a TED conference. That was the only criteria  was that you be    you looked like a gentleman  and they'd let anybody could come. You didn't have to be a member then. And so  they would come in and you would do    Anybody that was going to show an experiment  which was kind of a new word at the time  demonstrate some principle  they had to do it on stage  where everybody could see it. So they were    the really important part of this was  you were not supposed to talk about final causes  for instance. And God was out of the picture. The actual nature of reality was not at issue. You're not supposed to talk about the absolute nature of anything. You were not supposed to talk about anything that you couldn't demonstrate. So if somebody could see it  you could say  here's how the machine works  here's what we do  and then here's what happens. And seeing what happens  it was OK to generalize  and say  I'm sure that this will happen anytime we make one of these things. And so you can start making up some rules. You say  anytime you have a vacuum state  you will discover that one wheel will not turn another one  if the only connection between them is whatever was there before the vacuum. That kind of thing. Candles can't burn in a vacuum  therefore  probably sparklers wouldn't either. It's not clear  actually sparklers will  but they didn't know that. They didn't have sparklers. But  they       you can make up rules  but they have to relate only to the things that you've been able to demonstrate. And most the demonstrations had to do with visuals. Like if you do an experiment on stage  and nobody can see it  they can just hear it  they would probably think you were freaky. I mean  reality is what you can see. That wasn't an explicit rule in the meeting  but I'm sure that was part of it  you know. If people hear voices  and they can't see and associate it with somebody  that person's probably not there. But the general idea that you could only    you could only really talk about things in that place that had some kind of experimental basis. It didn't matter what Thomas Hobbes  who was a local philosopher  said about it  you know  because you weren't going to be talking final causes. What's happening here  in the middle of the   th century  was that what became my field    science  experimental science    was pulling itself away  and it was in a physical way  because we're going to do it in this room over here  but it was also what    it was an amazing thing that happened. Science had been all interlocked with theology  and philosophy  and    and    and mathematics  which is really not science. But experimental science had been tied up with all those things. And the mathematics part and the experimental science part was pulling away from philosophy. And    things    we never looked back. It's been so cool since then. I mean  it just    it just    untangled a thing that was really impeding technology from being developed. And  I mean  everybody in this room    now  this is     short years ago. Remember  that's a short time. It was          probably  years ago that most of us  the ancestors of most of us in this room came up out of Africa and turned to the left. You know  the ones that turned to the right  there are some of those in the Japanese translation. But that happened very    a long time ago compared to     short years ago. But in that     years  the place has just undergone a lot of changes. In fact  everybody in this room probably  especially if you picked up your bag    some of you  I know  didn't pick up your bags    but if you picked up your bag  everybody in this room has got in their pocket  or back in their room  something that     years ago  kings would have gone to war to have. I mean  if you can think how important    If you have a GPS system and there are no satellites  it's not going to be much use. But  like    but  you know  if somebody had a GPS system in the   th century some king would have gotten together an army and gone to get it  you know. If that person    Audience  For the teddy bear  The teddy bear  Kary Mullis  They might have done it for the teddy bear  yeah. But    all of us own stuff. I mean  individuals own things that kings would have definitely gone to war to get. And this is just     years. Not a whole lot of people doing this stuff. You know  the important people    you can almost read about their lives  about all the really important people that made advances  you know. And  I mean    this kind of stuff  you know  all this stuff came from that separation of this little sort of thing that we do    now I  when I was a boy was born sort of with this idea that if you want to know something    you know  maybe it's because my old man was gone a lot  and my mother didn't really know much science  but I thought if you want to know something about stuff  you do it    you make an experiment  you know. You get    you get  like    I just had a natural feeling for science and setting up experiments. I thought that was the way everybody had always thought. I thought that anybody with any brains will do it that way. It isn't true. I mean  there's a lot of people    You know  I was one of those scientists that was    got into trouble the other night at dinner because of the post modernism thing. And I didn't mean  you know    where is that lady  Audience  Here. KM  I mean  I didn't really think of that as an argument so much as just a lively discussion. I didn't take it personally  but    I just    I had    I naively had thought  until this surfing experience started me into the   th century  I'd thought that's just the way people thought  and everybody did  and they recognized reality by what they could see or touch or feel or hear. At any rate  when I was a boy  I  like  for instance  I had this    I got this little book from Fort Sill  Oklahoma    This is about the time that George Dyson's dad was starting to blow nuclear    thinking about blowing up nuclear rockets and stuff. I was thinking about making my own little rockets. And I knew that frogs    little frogs    had aspirations of space travel  just like people. And I    I was looking for a    a propulsion system that would like  make a rocket  like  maybe about four feet high go up a couple of miles. And  I mean  that was my sort of goal. I wanted it to go out of sight and then I wanted this little parachute to come back with the frog in it. And    I    I    I got this book from Fort Sill  Oklahoma  where there's a missile base. They send it out for amateur rocketeers  and it said in there do not ever heat a mixture of potassium perchlorate and sugar. You know  that's what you call a lead. You sort of    now you say  well  let's see if I can get hold of some potassium chlorate and sugar  perchlorate and sugar  and heat it  it would be interesting to see what it is they don't want me to do  and what it is going to    and how is it going to work. And we didn't have    like  my mother presided over the back yard from an upstairs window  where she would be ironing or something like that. And she was usually just sort of keeping an eye on  and if there was any puffs of smoke out there  she'd lean out and admonish us all not to blow our eyes out. That was her    You know  that was kind of the worst thing that could happen to us. That's why I thought  as long as I don't blow my eyes out... I may not care about the fact that it's prohibited from heating this solution. I'm going to do it carefully  but I'll do it. It's like anything else that's prohibited  you do it behind the garage. So  I went to the drug store and I tried to buy some potassium perchlorate and it wasn't unreasonable then for a kid to walk into a drug store and buy chemicals. Nowadays  it's no ma'am  check your shoes. And like    But then it wasn't    they didn't have any  but the guy had    I said  what kind of salts of potassium do you have  You know. And he had potassium nitrate. And I said  that might do the same thing  whatever it is. I'm sure it's got to do with rockets or it wouldn't be in that manual. And so I    I did some experiments. You know  I started off with little tiny amounts of potassium nitrate and sugar  which was readily available  and I mixed it in different proportions  and I tried to light it on fire. Just to see what would happen  if you mixed it together. And it    they burned. It burned kind of slow  but it made a nice smell  compared to other rocket fuels I had tried  that all had sulfur in them. And  it smelt like burnt candy. And then I tried the melting business  and I melted it. And then it melted into a little sort of syrupy liquid  brown. And then it cooled down to a brick hard substance  that when you lit that  it went off like a bat. I mean  the little bowl of that stuff that had cooled down    you'd light it  and it would just start dancing around the yard. And I said  there is a way to get a frog up to where he wants to go. So I started developing    you know  George's dad had a lot of help. I just had my brother. But I    it took me about    it took me about  I'd say  six months to finally figure out all the little things. There's a lot of little things involved in making a rocket that it will actually work  even after you have the fuel. But you do it  by    what I just   you know  you do experiments  and you write down things sometimes  you make observations  you know. And then you slowly build up a theory of how this stuff works. And it was    I was following all the rules. I didn't know what the rules were  I'm a natural born scientist  I guess  or some kind of a throwback to the   th century  whatever. But at any rate  we finally did have a device that would reproduceably put a frog out of sight and get him back alive. And we had not    I mean  we weren't frightened by it. We should have been  because it made a lot of smoke and it made a lot of noise  and it was powerful  you know. And once in a while  they would blow up. But I wasn't worried  by the way  about  you know  the explosion causing the destruction of the planet. I hadn't heard about the    ways that we should be afraid of the    By the way  I could have thought  I'd better not do this because they say not to  you know. And I'd better get permission from the government. If I'd have waited around for that  I would have never    the frog would have died  you know. At any rate  I bring it up because it's a good story  and he said  tell personal things  you know  and that's a personal    I was going to tell you about the first night that I met my wife  but that would be too personal  wouldn't it. So  so I've got something else that's not personal. But that... process is what I think of as science  see  where you start with some idea  and then instead of  like  looking up  every authority that you've ever heard of I    sometimes you do that  if you're going to write a paper later  you want to figure out who else has worked on it. But in the actual process  you get an idea    like  when I got the idea one night that I could amplify DNA with two oligonucleotides  and I could make lots of copies of some little piece of DNA  you know  the thinking for that was about    minutes while I was driving my car  and then instead of going    I went back and I did talk to people about it  but if I'd listened to what I heard from all my friends who were molecular biologists    I would have abandoned it. You know  if I had gone back looking for an authority figure who could tell me if it would work or not  he would have said  no  it probably won't. Because the results of it were so spectacular that if it worked it was going to change everybody's goddamn way of doing molecular biology. Nobody wants a chemist to come in and poke around in their stuff like that and change things. But if you go to authority  and you always don't    you don't always get the right answer  see. But I knew  you'd go into the lab and you'd try to make it work yourself. And then you're the authority  and you can say  I know it works  because right there in that tube is where it happened  and here  on this gel  there's a little band there that I know that's DNA  and that's the DNA I wanted to amplify  so there  So it does work. You know  that's how you do science. And then you say  well  what can make it work better  And then you figure out better and better ways to do it. But you always work from  from like  facts that you have made available to you by doing experiments  things that you could do on a stage. And no tricky shit behind the thing. I mean  it's all    you've got to be very honest with what you're doing if it really is going to work. I mean  you can't make up results  and then do another experiment based on that one. So you have to be honest. And I'm basically honest. I have a fairly bad memory  and dishonesty would always get me in trouble  if I  like    so I've just sort of been naturally honest and naturally inquisitive  and that sort of leads to that kind of science. Now  let's see... I've got another five minutes  right  OK. All scientists aren't like that. You know    and there is a lot    There is a lot    a lot has been going on since Isaac Newton and all that stuff happened. One of the things that happened right around World War II in that same time period before  and as sure as hell afterwards  government got    realized that scientists aren't strange dudes that  you know  hide in ivory towers and do ridiculous things with test tube. Scientists  you know  made World War II as we know it quite possible. They made faster things. They made bigger guns to shoot them down with. You know  they made drugs to give the pilots if they were broken up in the process. They made all kinds of    and then finally one giant bomb to end the whole thing  right  And everybody stepped back a little and said  you know  we ought to invest in this shit  because whoever has got the most of these people working in the places is going to have a dominant position  at least in the military  and probably in all kind of economic ways. And they got involved in it  and the scientific and industrial establishment was born  and out of that came a lot of scientists who were in there for the money  you know  because it was suddenly available. And they weren't the curious little boys that liked to put frogs up in the air. They were the same people that later went in to medical school  you know  because there was money in it  you know. I mean  later  then they all got into business    I mean  there are waves of    going into your high school  person saying  you want to be rich  you know  be a scientist. You know  not anymore. You want to be rich  you be a businessman. But a lot of people got in it for the money and the power and the travel. That's back when travel was easy. And those people don't think    they don't    they don't always tell you the truth  you know. There is nothing in their contract  in fact  that makes it to their advantage always  to tell you the truth. And the people I'm talking about are people that like    they say that they're a member of the committee called  say  the Inter Governmental Panel on Climate Change. And they    and they have these big meetings where they try to figure out how we're going to    how we're going to continually prove that the planet is getting warmer  when that's actually contrary to most people's sensations. I mean  if you actually measure the temperature over a period    I mean  the temperature has been measured now pretty carefully for about        years    longer than that it's been measured  but in really nice  precise ways  and records have been kept for    or    years  and in fact  the temperature hadn't really gone up. It's like  the average temperature has gone up a tiny little bit  because the nighttime temperatures at the weather stations have come up just a little bit. But there's a good explanation for that. And it's that the weather stations are all built outside of town  where the airport was  and now the town's moved out there  there's concrete all around and they call it the skyline effect. And most responsible people that measure temperatures realize you have to shield your measuring device from that. And even then  you know  because the buildings get warm in the daytime  and they keep it a little warmer at night. So the temperature has been  sort of  inching up. It should have been. But not a lot. Not like  you know    the first guy    the first guy that got the idea that we're going to fry ourselves here  actually  he didn't think of it that way. His name was Sven Arrhenius. He was Swedish  and he said  if you double the CO  level in the atmosphere  which he thought might    this is in         the temperature ought to go up about  .  degrees  he calculated. He was thinking of the earth as  kind of like  you know  like a completely insulated thing with no stuff in it  really  just energy coming down  energy leaving. And so he came up with this theory  and he said  this will be cool  because it'll be a longer growing season in Sweden  you know  and the surfers liked it  the surfers thought  that's a cool idea  because it's pretty cold in the ocean sometimes  and    but a lot of other people later on started thinking it would be bad  you know. But nobody actually demonstrated it  right  I mean  the temperature as measured    and you can find this on our wonderful Internet  you just go and look for all NASAs records  and all the Weather Bureau's records  and you'll look at it yourself  and you'll see  the temperature has just    the nighttime temperature measured on the surface of the planet has gone up a tiny little bit. So if you just average that and the daytime temperature  it looks like it went up about .  degrees in this century. But in fact  it was just coming up    it was the nighttime  the daytime temperatures didn't go up. So    and Arrhenius' theory    and all the global warmers think    they would say  yeah  it should go up in the daytime  too  if it's the greenhouse effect. Now  people like things that have  like  names like that  that they can envision it  right  I mean    but people don't like things like this  so    most    I mean  you don't get all excited about things like the actual evidence  you know  which would be evidence for strengthening of the tropical circulation in the     s. It's a paper that came out in February  and most of you probably hadn't heard about it.  Evidence for Large Decadal Variability in the Tropical Mean Radiative Energy Budget.  Excuse me. Those papers were published by NASA  and some scientists at Columbia  and Viliki and a whole bunch of people  Princeton. And those two papers came out in Science Magazine  February the first  and these    the conclusion in both of these papers  and in also the Science editor's  like  descriptions of these papers  for  you know  for the quickie  is that our theories about global warming are completely wrong. I mean  what these guys were doing  and this is what    the NASA people have been saying this for a long time. They say  if you measure the temperature of the atmosphere  it isn't going up    it's not going up at all. We've doing it very carefully now for    years  from satellites  and it isn't going up. And in this paper  they show something much more striking  and that was that they did what they call a radiation    and I'm not going to go into the details of it  actually it's quite complicated  but it isn't as complicated as they might make you think it is by the words they use in those papers. If you really get down to it  they say  the sun puts out a certain amount of energy    we know how much that is    it falls on the earth  the earth gives back a certain amount. When it gets warm it generates    it makes redder energy    I mean  like infra red  like something that's warm gives off infra red. The whole business of the global warming    trash  really  is that    if the    if there's too much CO  in the atmosphere  the heat that's trying to escape won't be able to get out. But the heat coming from the sun  which is mostly down in the    it's like     nanometers  which is where it's centered    that goes right through CO . So you still get heated  but you don't dissipate any. Well  these guys measured all of those things. I mean  you can talk about that stuff  and you can write these large reports  and you can get government money to do it  but these    they actually measured it  and it turns out that in the last    years    that's why they say  decadal  there    that the energy    that the level of what they call  imbalance  has been way the hell over what was expected. Like  the amount of imbalance    meaning  heat's coming in and it's not going out that you would get from having double the CO   which we're not anywhere near that  by the way. But if we did  in      or something  have double the CO  as we had in       they say it would be increase the energy budget by about    in other words  one watt per square centimeter more would be coming in than going out. So the planet should get warmer. Well  they found out in this study    these two studies by two different teams    that five and a half watts per square meter had been coming in from             and the place didn't get warmer. So the theory's kaput    it's nothing. These papers should have been called   The End to the Global Warming Fiasco   you know. They're concerned  and you can tell they have very guarded conclusions in these papers  because they're talking about big laboratories that are funded by lots of money and by scared people. You know  if they said  you know what  There isn't a problem with global warming any longer  so we can    you know  they're funding. And if you start a grant request with something like that  and say  global warming obviously hadn't happened... if they    if they    if they actually    if they actually said that  I'm getting out. I'll stand up too  and    They have to say that. They had to be very cautious. But what I'm saying is  you can be delighted  because the editor of Science  who is no dummy  and both of these fairly professional    really professional teams  have really come to the same conclusion and in the bottom lines in their papers they have to say  what this means is  that what we've been thinking  was the global circulation model that we predict that the earth is going to get overheated that it's all wrong. It's wrong by a large factor. It's not by a small one. They just    they just misinterpreted the fact that the earth    there's obviously some mechanisms going on that nobody knew about  because the heat's coming in and it isn't getting warmer. So the planet is a pretty amazing thing  you know  it's big and horrible    and big and wonderful  and it does all kinds of things we don't know anything about. So I mean  the reason I put those things all together  OK  here's the way you're supposed to do science    some science is done for other reasons  and just curiosity. And there's a lot of things like global warming  and ozone hole and you know  a whole bunch of scientific public issues  that if you're interested in them  then you have to get down the details  and read the papers called   Large Decadal Variability in the...  You have to figure out what all those words mean. And if you just listen to the guys who are hyping those issues  and making a lot of money out of it  you'll be misinformed  and you'll be worrying about the wrong things. Remember the    things that are going to get you. The    one of them    And the asteroids is the one I really agree with there. I mean  you've got to watch out for asteroids. OK  thank you for having me here. I'm kind of tired of talking about simplicity  actually  so I thought I'd make my life more complex  as a serious play. So  I'm going to  like  go through some slides from way back when  and walk through them to give you a sense of how I end up here. So  basically it all began with this whole idea of a computer. Who has a computer  Yeah. O.K.  so  everyone has a computer. Even a mobile phone  it's a computer. And    anyone remember this workbook   Instant Activities for Your Apple     free poster in each book  This was how computing began. Don't forget  a computer came out  it had no software. You'd buy that thing  you'd bring it home  you'd plug it in  and it would do absolutely nothing at all. So  you had to program it  and there were great programming  like  tutorials  like this. I mean  this was great. It's  like  you know  Herbie the Apple II. It's such a great way to    I mean  they should make Java books like this  and we've have no problem learning a program. But this was a great  grand time of the computer  when it was just a raw  raw  what is it  kind of an era. And  you see  this era coincided with my own childhood. I grew up in a tofu factory in Seattle. Who of you grew up in a family business  suffered the torture  Yes  yes. The torture was good. Wasn't it good torture  It was just life changing  you know. And so  in my life  you know  I was in the tofu  it was a family business. And my mother was a kind of a designer  also. She'd make this kind of  like  wall of tofu cooking  and it would confuse the customers  because they all thought it was a restaurant. A bad sort of branding thing  or whatever. But  anyway  that's where I grew up  in this little tofu factory in Seattle  and it was kind of like this  a small room where I kind of grew up. I'm big there in that picture. That's my dad. My dad was kind of like MacGyver  really  he would invent  like  ways to make things heavy. Like back here  there's like  concrete block technology here  and he would need the concrete blocks to press the tofu  because tofu is actually kind of a liquidy type of thing  and so you have to have heavy stuff to push out the liquid and make it hard. Tofu comes out in these big batches  and my father would sort of cut them by hand. I can't tell you    family business story  you'd understand this    my father was the most sincere man possible. He walked into a Safeway once on a rainy day  slipped  broke his arm  rushed out  he didn't want to inconvenience Safeway. So  instead  you know  my father's  like  arm's broken for two weeks in the store  and that week    now  those two weeks were when my older brother and I had to do everything. And that was torture  real torture. Because  you see  we'd seen my father taking the big block of tofu and cutting it  like  knife in  zap  zap  zap. We thought  wow. So  the first time I did that  I went  like  whoa  Like this. Bad blocks. But anyways  the tofu to me was kind of my origin  basically. And because working in a store was so hard  I liked going to school  it was like heaven. And I was really good at school. So  when I got to MIT  you know  as most of you who are creatives  your parents all told you not to be creative  right  So  same way  you know  I was good at art and good at math  and my father says  he's    John's good at math. I went to MIT  did my math  but I had this wonderful opportunity  because computers had just become visual. The Apple    Macintosh just came out  I had a Mac in hand when I went to MIT. And it was a time when a guy who  kind of  could cross the two sides    it was a good time. And so  I remember that my first major piece of software was on a direct copy of then Aldus PageMaker. I made a desktop publishing system way back when  and that was  kind of  my first step into figuring out how to    oh  these two sides are kind of fun to mix. And the problem when you're younger    for all you students out there    is  your head gets kind of big really easy. And when I was making icons  I was  like  the icon master  and I was  like  yeah  I'm really good at this  you know. And then luckily  you know  I had the fortune of going to something called a library  and in the library I came upon this very book. I found this book. It's called   Thoughts on Design   by a man named Paul Rand. It's a little slim volume  I'm not sure if you've seen this. It's a very nice little book. It's about this guy  Paul Rand  who was one of the greatest graphic designers  and also a great writer as well. And when I saw this man's work  I realized how bad I was at design  or whatever I called it back then  and I suddenly had a kind of career goal  kind of in hot pursuit. So I kind of switched. I went to MIT  finished. I got my masters  and then went to art school after that. And just began to design stuff  like chopstick wrappers  napkins  menus    whatever I could get a handle on  sort of wheel and deal  move up in the design world  whatever. And isn't it that strange moment when you publish your design  Remember that moment    publishing your designs  Remember that moment  It felt so good  didn't it  So  I was published  you know  so  wow  my design's in a book  you know  After that  things kind of got strange  and I got thinking about the computer  because the computer to me always  kind of  bothered me. I didn't quite get it. And Paul Rand was a kind of crusty designer  you know  a crusty designer  like a good    kind of like a good French bread  You know  he wrote in one of his books   A Yale student once said  'I came here to learn how to design  not how to use a computer.' Design schools take heed.  This is in the '  s  in the great clash of computer non computer people. A very difficult time  actually. And this to me was an important message from Rand. And so I began to sort of mess with the computer at the time. This is the first sort of play thing I did  my own serious play. I built a working version of an Adobe Illustrator ish thing. It looks like Illustrator  it can  like  draw. It was very hard to make this  actually. It took a month to make this part. And then I thought  what if I added this feature  where I can say  this point  you can fly like a bird. You're free  kind of thing. So I could  sort of  change the kind of stability with a little control there on the dial  and I can sort of watch it flip around. And this is in     . And when my professors saw this  they were very upset at me. They were saying  Why's it moving  They were saying  Make it stop now. Now  I was saying  Well  that's the whole point  it's moving. And he says  Well  when's it going to stop  And I said  Never. And he said  Even worse. Stop it now. I started studying this whole idea  of like  what is this computer  It's a strange medium. It's not like print. It's not like video. It lasts forever. It's a very strange medium. So  I went off with this  and began to look for things even more. And so in Japan  I began to experiment with people. This is actually bad  human experiments. I would do these things where I'd have students become pens  there's blue pen  red pen  green pen  black pen. And someone sits down and draws a picture. They're laughing because he said  draw from the middle right to the middle  and he kind of messed up. See  humans don't know how to take orders  the computer's so good at it. This guy figured out how to get the computer to draw with two pens at once  you know  you  pen  do this  and you  pen  do this. And so began to have multiple pens on the page    again  hard to do with our hands. And then someone discovered this  a ha moment  where you could use coordinate systems. We thought  ah  this is when it's going to happen. In the end  he drew a house. It was the most boring thing. It became computerish  we began to think computerish    the X  Y system    and so that was kind of a revelation. And after this I wanted to build a computer out of people  called a human powered computer. So  this happened in     . Sound down  please. It's a computer where the people are the parts. I have behind this wall a disk drive  a CPU  a graphics card  a memory system. They're picking up a giant floppy disk made of cardboard. It's put inside the computer. And that little program's on that cardboard disk. So  she wears the disk  and reads the data off the sectors of the disk  and the computer starts up  it sort of boots up  really. And it's a sort of a working computer. And when I built this computer  I had a moment of    what is it called     the epiphany where I realized that the computer's just so fast. This computer appears to be fast   she's working pretty hard  and people are running around  and we think  wow  this is happening at a fast rate. And this computer's programmed to do only one thing  which is  if you move your mouse  the mouse changes on the screen. On the computer  when you move your mouse  that arrow moves around. On this computer  if you move the mouse  it takes half an hour for the mouse cursor to change. To give you a sense of the speed  the scale  the computer is just so amazingly fast  O.K.  And so  after this I began to do experiments for different companies. This is something I did for Sony in     . It was three Sony  H  devices that responded to sound. So  if you talk into the mike  you'll hear some music in your headphones  if you talk in the phone  then video would happen. So  I began to experiment with industry in different ways with this kind of mixture of skills. I did this ad. I don't believe in this kind of alcohol  but I do drink sometimes. And Chanel. So  getting to do different projects. And also  one thing I realized is that I like to make things. We like to make things. It's fun to make things. And so I never developed the ability to have a staff. I have no staff  it's all kind of made by hand    these sort of broken hands. And these hands were influenced by this man  Mr. Inami Naomi. This guy was my kind of like mentor. He was the first digital media producer in Tokyo. He's the guy that kind of discovered me  and kind of got me going in digital media. He was such an inspirational guy. I remember  like  we'd be in his studio  like  at   a.m.  and then he'd show up from some client meeting. He'd come in and say  you know  If I am here  everything is okay. And you'd feel so much better  you know. And I'll never forget how  like  but    I'll never forget how  like  he had a sudden situation with his    he had an aneurysm. He went into a coma. And so  for three years he was out  and he could only blink  and so I realized at this moment  I thought  wow    how fragile is this thing we're wearing  this body and mind we're wearing  and so I thought  How do you go for it more  How do you take that time you have left and go after it  So  Naomi was pivotal in that. And so  I began to think more carefully about the computer. This was a moment where I was thinking about  so  you have a computer program  it responds to motion    X and Y    and I realized that each computer program has all these images inside the program. So  if you can see here  you know  that program you're seeing in the corner  if you spread it out  it's all these things all at once. It's real simultaneity. It's nothing we're used to working with. We're so used to working in one vector. This is all at the same time. The computer lives in so many dimensions. And also  at the same time I was frustrated  because I would go to all these art and design schools everywhere  and there were these  like   the computer lab   you know  and this is  like  in the late     s  and this is in Basel  a great graphic design school. And here's this  like  dirty  kind of  shoddy  kind of  dark computer room. And I began to wonder  Is this the goal  Is this what we want  you know  And also  I began to be fascinated by machines    you know  like copy machines    and so this is actually in Basel. I noticed how we spent so much time on making it interactive    this is  like  a touch screen    and I noticed how you can only touch five places  and so   why are we wasting so much interactivity everywhere   became a question. And also  the sound  I discovered I can make my ThinkPad pretend it's a telephone. You get it  No  O.K. And also  I discovered in Logan airport  this was  like  calling out to me. Do you hear that  It's like cows. This is at   a.m. at Logan. So  I was wondering  like  what is this thing in front of me  this computer thing  It didn't make any sense. So  I began to make things again. This is another series of objects made of old computers from my basement. I made    I took my old Macintoshes and made different objects out of them from Tokyo. I began to be very disinterested in computers themselves  so I began to make paintings out of PalmPilots. I made this series of works. They're paintings I made and put a PalmPilot in the middle as a kind of display that's sort of thinking  I'm abstract art. What am I  I'm abstract. And so it keeps thinking out loud of its own abstraction. I began to be fascinated by plastic  so I spent four months making eight plastic blocks perfectly optically transparent  as a kind of release of stress. Because of that  I became interested in blue tape  so in San Francisco  at C.C.  I had a whole exhibition on blue tape. I made a whole installation out of blue tape    blue painters' tape. And at this point my wife kind of got worried about me  so I stopped doing blue tape and began to think  Well  what else is there in life  And so computers  as you know  these big computers  there are now tiny computers. They're littler computers  so the one chip computers  I began to program one chip computers and make objects out of P.C. boards  LEDs. I began to make LED sculptures that would live inside little boxes out of MDF. This is a series of light boxes I made for a show in Italy. Very simple boxes  you just press one button and some LED interaction occurs. This is a series of lamps I made. This is a Bento box lamp  it's sort of a plastic rice lamp  it's very friendly. I did a show in London last year made out of iPods    I used iPods as a material. So I took    iPod Nanos and made a kind of a Nano fish  basically. Recently  this is for Reebok. I've done shoes for Reebok as well  as a kind of a hobby for apparel. So anyways  there are all these things you can do  but the thing I love the most is to experience  taste the world. The world is just so tasty. We think we'll go to a museum  that's where all the tastes are. No  they're all out there. So  this is  like  in front of the Eiffel Tower  really  actually  around the Louvre area. This I found  where nature had made a picture for me. This is a perfect    degree angle by nature. In this strange moment where  like  these things kind of appeared. We all are creative people. We have this gene defect in our mind. We can't help but stop  right  This feeling's a wonderful thing. It's the forever always on museum. This is from the Cape last year. I discovered that I had to find the equation of art and design  which we know as circle triangle square. It's everywhere on the beach  I discovered. I began to collect every instance of circle triangle square. I put these all back  by the way. And I also discovered how . some rocks are twins separated at birth. This is also out there  you know. I'm  like  how did this happen  kind of thing  I brought you guys together again. So  three years ago I discovered  the letters M I T occurring in simplicity and complexity. My alma mater  MIT  and I had this moment    a kind of M. Night Shayamalan moment    where I thought  Whoa  I have to do this. And I went after it with passion. However  recently this RISD opportunity kind of arose    going to RISD    and I couldn't reconcile this real easy  because the letters had told me  MIT forever. But I discovered in the French word raison d' tre. I was  like  aha  wait a second. And there RISD appeared. And so I realized it was O.K. to go. So  I'm going to RISD  actually. Who's a RISD alum out there  RISD alums  Yeah  RISD. There we go  RISD. Woo  RISD. I'm sorry  I'm sorry  Art Center    Art Center is good  too. RISD is kind of my new kind of passion  and I'll tell you a little bit about that. So  RISD is    I was outside RISD  and some student wrote this on some block  and I thought  Wow  RISD wants to know what itself is. And I have no idea what RISD should be  actually  or what it wants to be  but one thing I have to tell you is that although I'm a technologist  I don't like technology very much. It's a  kind of  the qi thing  or whatever. People say  Are you going to bring RISD into the future  And I say  well  I'm going to bring the future back to RISD. There's my perspective. Because in reality  the problem isn't how to make the world more technological. It's about how to make it more humane again. And if anything  I think RISD has a strange DNA. It's a strange exuberance about materials  about the world  a fascination that I think the world needs quite very much right now. So  thank you everyone. Sixty five million years ago  a very important and catastrophic event changed the course of life on land. And although we know that the land animals I'm going to talk about are just the scum of the Earth on the land    the little bits of land floating around    but they are important to us because they're sort of in our scale of experience from millimeters to meters. And these animals disappeared  and a separate life  mammals  radiated out to take their place. And so  we know this in extraordinary detail. And so this is a core from near Bermuda. We know that the tsunamis  the earthquakes  and the things that we've experienced in the entire record of humankind history can't really quite get around the kind of disaster that this represented for the Earth. So even before that impact was known  even before scientists in general came to an agreement over the theory of evolution  scientists and natural historians of all kinds of stripes actually had divided Earth's life's history into these two episodes  Mesozoic  the middle life  and the Cenozoic  the recent life. And as it turns out  it actually corresponds really nicely with geologic history. So we have a Mesozoic period  an age of fragmentation  and a Cenozoic period  an age of reconnection    South America to North America  India to Asia. And so my work  really  is trying to understand the character of that Mesozoic radiation compared to the Cenozoic radiation to see what mysteries we can understand from dinosaurs and from other animals about what life on drifting continents really can tell us about evolution. The work immediately begs the question   Why didn't they go into the waters   I mean  certainly mammals did. This is one example. You can go outside    see many other examples. Within five     million years of the bolide impact we had a whole variety of animals going into the water. Why didn't they do that  Why didn't they hang around in trees at good size  and why didn't they burrow  Why didn't they do all these things  and if they didn't do all these things  what kinds of animals were in those spaces  And if there were no animals in those spaces  what does that tell us about  you know  how evolution works on land  Really interesting questions. I think a lot of it has to do with body size. In fact  I think that most of it has to do with body size    the size you are when you inherit a vacant ecospace from whatever natural disaster. Looking at dinosaur evolution and studying it  digging it up for many years  I end up looking at the mammal radiation  and it seems as though everything is quick time  just like technology  advancing by an order of magnitude. Dinosaur evolution proceeded at a stately pace  an order of magnitude slower on any way you want to measure it. You want to measure it by diversity  You want to measure it by the time it took to reach maximum body size  Yes  they do have larger body size  but many of them are smaller  but we're interested in the time it took them to achieve that. Fifty million years to achieve this maximum body size. And that is    times longer than it took the mammals to achieve maximum body size and invade all those habitats. So there's lessons to learn  and there's lessons to learn from the exception  the exception that we know very well today from the discoveries we've made  and many other scholars have made around the world. This slide was shown before. This is the famous Jurassic bird Archaeopteryx. We now know this transition is the one time that dinosaurs actually went below that body size    we're going to see where they began in a minute    and it is the one time that they rapidly invaded all the habitats I just told you that dinosaurs weren't in. They became marine. We now know them today from the ice caps. There's burrowing birds. They inhabit the trees at all body sizes  and  of course  they inhabit the land. So we were the first to actually name a bird from the famous series that later exploded onto the pages of Science and Nature. We called this bird Sinornis. It's a little bit more advanced than Archaeopteryx  and if you go to different layers  you find things that are less advanced than Archaeopteryx  and every grade in between  so that if you find something today  we're usually splitting hairs    or  more appropriately  feathers    as to decide whether it's actually a non avian or an avian. It is the greatest transition that we have  actually  on land from one habitat to another  bar none  to understand how a bony  fairly heavy  kilogram or a couple of kilogram animal could make such a transition. It is really our greatest    one of our greatest    evolutionary sequences. Now  my work began at the beginning. I thought if I'm going to understand dinosaur evolution  I'd have to go back to those beds where they had picked up fragments  go back to a time and a place where the earliest dinosaurs existed. I'd like to call for this little video clip to give you some idea of  sort of  what we face. Normally  we get asked a lot of questions   Well  how do you find fossils in areas that look like this   If we could roll that first video clip. This is sort of a nice helicopter ride through those early beds  and they're located in Northeastern Argentina. And we're coming over a cliff  and at the top of that cliff  dinosaurs had basically taken over. At the bottom of the cliff  we find that they're rare as hens' teeth. That's where dinosaur origins is to be found  at the bottom of the cliff. You go into an area like this  you get a geologic map  you get a topographic map  and the best  most inspired team you can bring to the area. And the rest is up to you. You've got to find fossils. You've got to dig a hole that's usually quite a bit bigger than that to get it out  you've got to climb those cliffs and find  really  everything that existed    not just the dinosaurs  but the entire story. If you're lucky  and you dig a place like that  you actually find the ash bed to dig it  and we did.     million years old  we found what really is the most primitive dinosaur  that's the Ur dinosaur. A three and a half foot thing  beautiful skull  predator  meat eater  a two legged animal. So  all the other dinosaurs that you know  or your kids know  at least  on four legs. This is sort of a look at the skull  and it's an absolutely fantastic thing about five or six inches long. It looks rather bird like because it is. It's bird like and hollow. A predator. Maybe    pounds  or    kilograms. That's where dinosaurs began. That's where the radiation began. That is    times larger than the mammal radiation  which was a four legged radiation. We are extremely dinosaur like  and unusual in our two legged approach to life. Now  if you want to understand what happened then when the continents broke apart  and dinosaurs found    landlubbers  as they are    found themselves adrift. There's some missing puzzle pieces. Most of those missing puzzle pieces are southern continents  because it was those continents that are least explored. If you want to add to this picture and try and sketch it globally  you really have to force yourself to go down to the four corners of the Earth    Africa  India  Antarctica  Australia    and start putting together some of these pieces. I've been to some of those continents  but Africa was  in the words of Steven Pinker  was a blank slate  largely. But one with an immense chalkboard in the middle  with lots of little areas of dinosaur rock if you could survive an expedition. There's no roads into the Sahara. It's an enormous place. To be able to excavate the    tons of dinosaurs that we have in the Sahara and take them out  you really have to put together an expedition team that can handle the conditions. Some of them are political. Many of them are physical. Some of them    the most important    are mental. And you really have to be able to withstand conditions    you have to drive into the desert  you will see landscapes in many cases    you can see from what we've discovered    that nobody else has ever seen. And the kinds of teams they bring in  Well  they're composed of people who understand science as adventure with a purpose. They're usually students who've never seen a desert. Some of them are more experienced. Your job as a leader    this is definitely a team sport    your job as a leader is to try to inspire them to do more work than they've ever done in their life under conditions that they can't imagine. So      degrees is normal. The ground surface at        typical. So  you can't leave your normal metal tools out because you'll get a first degree burn if you grab them sometimes. So  you are finding yourself also in an amazing cultural milieu. You're really rubbing shoulders with the world's last great nomadic people. These are the Tuareg nomads  and they're living their lives much as they have for centuries. Your job is to excavate things like this in the foreground  and make them enter the pages of history. To do that  you've got to actually transport them thousands of miles out of the desert. We're talking about Ethiopia  but let's talk about Niger    or Niger  in our English language    north of Nigeria    that's where this photograph was taken. Basically you're talking about a country that  when we started working there  did not have container traffic. You transported the bones out yourself to the coast of Africa  onto a boat  if you wanted to get them out of the middle of the Sahara. That's a       mile journey. So enormous excavations and a lot of work  and out of essentially a partial herd of dinosaurs that you saw buried there       tons of material    we erect Jobaria  a sauropod dinosaur like we haven't seen on some other continents. It really is a little bit out of place temporally. It looks nothing like what we would find if we dug in contemporary beds in North America. Here's the animal that was causing it trouble. And  you know  on and on    a whole menagerie. When you pick up something like this    and some of you have had the chance to touch it    this is a piece of history. You're touching something that's     million years old. This is a thumb claw. There it was  moments after it was discovered. It is an incredible view of life  and it really began when we began to understand the depth of time. It's only been with us for less than a century  and in that time  that fourth dimension  when radioactive dating came about  less than a century ago  and we could actually tell how old some of these things were  is probably the most profound transformation  because it changes the way we look at ourselves and the world dramatically. When you pick up a piece of history like that  I think it can transform kids that are possibly interested in science. That's the animal that thumb claw came from  Suchomimus. Here's some others. This is something we found in Morocco  an immense animal. We prototyped by CAT scanning the brain out of this animal. It turns out to have a forebrain one fifteenth the size of a human. This was the cover of Science  because they thought that humans were more intelligent than these animals  but we can see by some in our administration that despite the enormous advantage in brain volume some of the attitudes remain the same. Anyway  smaller raptors. All the stuff from Jurassic Park that you know of    all those small animals    they all come from northern continents. This is the first skeleton from a southern continent  and guess what  You start preparing it. It has no big claw on its hind foot. It doesn't look like a Velociraptor. It's really a wholly separate radiation. So what we're trying to piece together here is a story. It involves flying reptiles like this Pterosaur that we reconstructed from Africa. Crocodiles  of course  and that's a nasty one we haven't named yet. And huge things    I mean  this is a lower jaw just laying there in the desert of this enormous crocodile. The crocodile is technically called Sarcosuchus. That's an adult Orinoco crocodile in its jaws. We had to try and reconstruct this. We had to actually look at recent crocodiles to understand how crocodiles scale. Could I have the second little video clip  Now  this field is just    and  of course  science in general    is just    adventure. We had to find and measure the largest crocodiles living today. Narrator  ... as long as their boat. Man  Look at that set of choppers  Yeah  he's a big one. Narrator  If they can just land it  this croc will provide useful data  helping Paul in his quest to understand Sarcosuchus. Man  OK  hand me some more here. Man    OK. Narrator  It falls to Paul to cover its eyes. Man  Watch out  Watch out  No  no  no  no. You're going to have to get on the back legs. Man  I got the back legs. Man    You have the back legs  No  you have the front legs  my friend. I've got it. I've got the back legs. Somebody get the front legs. Paul Sereno  Let's get this tape measure on him. Put it right there. Wow. Sixty five. Wow. That's a big skull. Narrator  Big  but less than half the size of supercroc's skull. Man  Enormous. PS  You've got a ...    foot croc. Man  I knew it was big. PS  Don't get off. You don't get off  but don't worry about me. Narrator  Paul has his data  so they decide to release the animal back into the river. PS  Don't get off  Don't get off  Don't get off  Narrator  Paul has never seen a fossil do that. PS  Okay  when I say three  we move. One  two  three  Whoa  So    there were    Well  you know  the    the fossil record is truly amazing because it really forces you to look at living animals in a new way. We proved with those measurements that crocodiles scaled isometrically. It depended on the shape of their skull  though  so we had to actually get those measurements to be sure that we had reconstructed and could prove to the scientific world that supercroc in fact is a    foot crocodile  probably a male. Anyway  you find other things  too. I'm going to lead an expedition to the Sahara to dig up Africa's largest neolithic site. We found this last year. Two hundred skeletons  tools  jewelry. This is a ceremonial disk. An amazing record of the colonization of the Sahara       years ago is been sitting out there waiting for us to go back. So  really exciting. And then work later is going to take us to Tibet. Now  we normally think of Tibet as a highland. It's really an island continent. It was a precursor to India  a messenger from Gondwana    a lost paradise of dinosaurs isolated for millions of years. No one's found them. We know where they are  and we're going to go and get them next year. They're only between    and        feet  but if you go in the warm part of the year  it's O.K. Now  I tried to suture together a dinosaur evolutionary history so that we can try to understand some basic patterns of evolution. I've talked about a few of them. We really need to take that further. We need to delve into this mass of anatomy that we've been compiling to understand where the changes are occurring and what this means. We can't predict  necessarily  what will happen in evolution  but we can learn some of the rules of the game  and that's really what we're trying to do. With regard to the biogeographic question  the Earth is dividing. These are all landlubbing animals. There's a couple of choices. You get divided  and a continent's division corresponds to a fork in the evolutionary tree  or you're crafty  and you manage to escape from one to the other and erase that division  or you're living peacefully on each side  and on one side you just go extinct  and you survive on the other side and create a difference. And the fourth thing is that you actually did one or the other of those three things  but the paleontologist never found you. And you take those four instances and you realize you have a complex problem. And so  in addition to digging  I think we have some answers from the dinosaur record. I think these dinosaurs migrated    we call it dispersal    around the globe  with the slightest land bridge. They did it within two or three degrees of the pole  to maintain similarity between continents. But when they were divided  indeed they were divided  and we do see the continents carving differences among dinosaurs. But there's one thing that's even more important  and I think that's extinction. We have downgraded this factor. It carves up the history of life  and gives us the differences that we see in the dinosaur world towards the end  right before the bolide impact. The best way to test this is to actually create a model. So if we move back  this is a two dimensional typical tree of life. I want to give you three dimensions. So you see the tree of life  but now I've added the dimension of area. So the tree of life is normally divergence over time. Now we have divergence over time  but we've created the third dimension of area. This is a computer program which has three knobs. We can control those things that we're worried about  extinction  sampling  dispersal    going from one area to another. And ultimately we can control the branching to mimic what we think the continents were like  and run it a thousand times  so we can estimate the parameters  to answer the question whether we are on the mark or not  at least to know the barriers of the problems. So that's a little bit about the science. Today I'm going to spend the rest of my few minutes up here talking about the other stuff that I do in Chicago  which is related to the fact that I never    and actually  in talking to a lot of TEDsters  there's a number of you out there    I don't know that I'd get an answer honestly  if I asked you to raise your hand  but there are a number of you out there that started your scientific  technical  entertainment career as failures  by society's standards  as failures by schools. I was one of those. I was failed by my school    my school failed me. Who's pointing fingers  Several teachers nearly killed me. I found myself in art. I was a total failure in school  not really headed to graduate high school. And I went on    that's my first painting on canvas. I read a dictionary. I got into college. I became an artist. O.K.  and started drawing. It became abstract. I worked up a portfolio  and I was headed to New York. Sometimes I would see bones when there was a body there. Something was going on in the background. I headed to New York to a studio. I took a side trip to the American Museum  and I never recovered. But really it's the same discipline    they're kindred disciplines. I mean  is there anything that is not visualizing what can't be seen  in terms of discovering this dinosaur bone from a small piece of it that's out there  or seeing the distortion that we try to see as evolutionary distortion in one animal to another  This is a very extraordinarily visual. I give you a human face because you're experts at that. It takes us years to understand how to do that with dinosaurs. They're really kindred disciplines. But what we're trying to create in Chicago is a way to get  collect together  those students who are least represented in our science and technology spheres. We all know  and there's been several allusions to it  that we are failing in our ability to produce enough scientists  engineers and technicians. We've known that for a long time. We've gone through the Sputnik phase  and now  as you see the increase in the pace of what we're doing  it becomes even more prominent.  Where are all these people going to come from  And a more general question for our society is  what's going to happen to all the rest that are left behind  What about all the kids like me that were in school    kids like some of you out there    that were in school and didn't get a chance and will never get a chance to participate in science and technology  Those are the questions I ask. And we talk about Ethiopia  and it's very important. Niger is equally important  and I'm trying desperately to do something in Niger. They have an AIDS problem. I asked    the U.S. State Department asked the government recently  What do you want to do  And they gave them two problems. Dinosaurs was one of them. Give us a museum of dinosaurs  and we will attract tourists  which is our number two industry. And I hope to God the United States government  me  or TED  or somebody helps us do that  because that would be an incredible thing for their country. But when we look back at our own country  we're looking back at our cities  the cities where most of you come from    certainly the city I come from    there's legions of kids out there like these. And the question is    and we started to address this question for centuries    as to how we get these kids involved in science. We've started in Chicago an organization    a non profit organization    called Project Exploration. These are two kids from Project Exploration. We met them in their early stages in high school. They were    failing to poor students  and they are now    one at the University of Chicago  another in Illinois. We've got students at Harvard. We're six years old. And we created a track record. Because when you go out there as a scholar  and you try to find out longitudinal studies  track records like that  there essentially are very few  if none. So  we've created an incredible track record of     percent graduation     percent going to college  many first generation     percent of those choosing science as a career. It's an impressive track record  and so we look back and we say  well  we didn't really exactly work this out theoretically from the start  but when we look back  there are theoretical movements in science education. It's gone through science as an inquiry  which was a big advance  and Dewey back at Chicago    you learn by doing. To    you learn by envisioning yourself as a scientist  and then you learn to envision yourself as a scientist. The next step is to learn the capability to make yourself a scientist. You have to have those steps. If you have    It's easy to get kids interested in science. It's hard to get them to envision themselves as a scientist  which involves standing up in front of people like we're doing here at this symposium and presenting something as a knowledgeable person  and then seeing yourself in the role as a scientist and giving yourself the tools to pursue that. And so  that's what we're going to do. We're planning a permanent home in Chicago. We have lots of ideas  but I guarantee you this one thing    and I've talked to some people here at TED    it's not going to look like anything you've seen before. It's going to be part school  part museum hall  part conservatory  part zoo  and part of an answer to the problem of how you interest kids in science. Thank you very much. Many of you could ask the question  you know  why is a flying car  or maybe more accurately  a roadable aircraft  possible at this time  A number of years ago  Mr. Ford predicted that flying cars of some form would be available. Now     years later  I'm here to tell you why it's possible. When I was about five years old  not very much    about a year after Mr. Ford made his predictions  I was living in a rural part of Canada  on the side of a mountain in a very isolated area. Getting to school  for a kid that was actually pretty short for his age  through the Canadian winter  was not a pleasant experience. It was a trying and scary thing for a young kid to be going through. At the end of my first year in school  in the summer of that year  I discovered a couple hummingbirds that were caught in a shed near my home. They'd worn themselves out  beating themselves against the window  and  well  they were easy to capture. I took them outside and as I let them go  that split second  even though they were very tired  that second I let them go they hovered for a second  then zipped off into the distance. I thought  what a great way to get to school. For a kid at that age  this was like infinite speed  disappearing  and I was very inspired by that. And so the next    over the next six decades  believe it or not  I've built a number of aircraft  with the goal of creating something that could do for you  or me  what the hummingbird does  and give you that flexibility. I've called this vehicle  generically  a volantor  after the Latin word  volant   meaning  to fly in a light  nimble manner. Volantor like helicopter  perhaps. The FAA  the controlling body above all  calls it a  powered lift aircraft.  And they've actually issued a pilot's license    a powerlift pilot's license    for this type of aircraft. It's closer than you think. It's kind of remarkable when you consider that there are no operational powered lift aircraft. So for once  perhaps  the government is ahead of itself. The press calls my particular volantor a  Skycar.  This is a little bit earlier version of it  that's why it's given the X designation  but it's a four passenger aircraft that could take off vertically  like a helicopter    therefore it doesn't need an airfield. On the ground  it's powered electrically. It's actually classified as a motorcycle because of the three wheels  which is a great asset because it allows you  theoretically  to use this on the highways in most states  and actually in all cities. So that's an asset because if you've got to deal with the crash protection issues of the automobile  forget it    you're never going to fly it. One could say that a helicopter does pretty much what the hummingbird does  and gets around in much the same way  and it's true  but a helicopter is a very complex device. It's expensive    so expensive that very few people could own or use it. It's often been described because of its fragile nature and its complexity  as a series of parts    a large number of parts    flying in formation. Another difference  and I have to describe this  because it's very personal  another great difference between the helicopter and the volantor    in my case the Skycar volantor    is the experience that I've had in flying both of those. In a helicopter you feel    and it's still a remarkable sensation    you feel like you're being hauled up from above by a vibrating crane. When you get in the Skycar    and I can tell you  there's only one other person that's flown it  but he had the same sensation    you really feel like you're being lifted up by a magic carpet  without any vibration whatsoever. The sensation is unbelievable. And it's been a great motivator. I only get to fly this vehicle occasionally  and only when I can persuade my stockholders to let me do so  but it's still one of those wonderful experiences that reward you for all that time. What we really need is something to replace the automobile for those    plus mile trips. Very few people realize that    mile plus trips make up    percent of the miles traveled in America. If we can get rid of that  then the highways will now be useful to you  as contrasted by what's happening in many parts of the world today. On this next slide  is an interesting history of what we really have seen in infrastructure  because whether I give you a perfect Skycar  the perfect vehicle for use  it's going to have very little value to you unless you've got a system to use it in. I'm sure any of you have asked the question  yeah  are there great things up there    what am I going to do  get up there  It's bad enough on a highway  what's it going to be like to be in the air  This world that you're going to be talking about tomorrow is going to be completely integrated. You're not going to be a pilot  you're going to be a passenger. And it's the infrastructure that really determines whether this process goes forward. I can tell you  technically we can build Skycars    my God  we went to the moon  The technology there was much more difficult than what I'm dealing with here. But we have to have these priority changes  we have to have infrastructure to go with this. Historically you see that we got around     years ago by canals  and as that system disappeared  were replaced by railroads. As that disappeared we came in with highways. But if you look at that top corner    the highway system    you see where we are today. Highways are no longer being built  and that's a fact. You won't see any additional highways in the next    years. However  the next    years  if like the last    years  we're going to see    percent more traffic. And where is that going to lead you to  So the issue then  I've often asked  is when is it going to happen  When are we going to be able to have these vehicles  And of course  if you ask me  I'm going to give you a really optimistic view. After all  I've been spending    years here believing it's going to happen tomorrow. So  I'm not going to quote myself on this. I'd prefer to quote someone else  who testified with me before Congress  and in his position as head of NASA put forward this particular vision of the future of this type of aircraft. Now I would argue  actually  if you look at the fact that on the highways today  you're only averaging about    miles per hour    on average  according to the DOT    the Skycar travels at over     miles an hour  up to        feet. And so  in effect  you could see perhaps a tenfold increase in the ability to get around as far as speed is concerned. Unbeknownst to many of you  the highway in the sky that I'm talking about here has been under construction for    years. It makes use of the GPS    you're familiar with GPS in your automobile  but you may not be familiar with the fact that there's a GPS U.S.  there's a Russian GPS  and there's a new GPS system going to Europe  called Galileo. With those three systems  you have what is always necessary    a level of redundancy that says  if one system fails  you'll still have a way to make sure that you're being controlled. Because if you're in this world  where computers are controlling what you're doing  it's going to be very critical that something can't fail on you. How would a trip in a Skycar work  Well  you can't right now take off from your home because it's too noisy. I mean to be able to take off from your home  you'd have to be extremely quiet. But it's still fairly quiet. You'd motor  electrically  to a vertiport  which may be a few blocks  maybe even a few miles away. This is clearly  as I said earlier  a roadable aircraft  and you're not going to spend that much time on the road. After all  if you can fly like that  why are you going to drive around on a highway  Go to a local vertiport  plug in your destination  delivered almost like a passenger. You can play computer games  you can sleep  you can read on the way. This is the world    there won't be you as a pilot. And I know the pilots in the audience aren't going to like that    and I've had a lot of bad feedback from people who want to be up there  flying around and experiencing that. And of course  I suppose like recreational parks you can still do that. But the vehicle itself is going to be a very  very controlled environment. Or it's going to have no use to you as a person who might use such a system. We flew the first vehicle for the international press in       when I really got it started. I was a professor at the U.C. Davis System  and I got a lot of excitement around this  and I was able to fund the initiation of the program back in that time. And then through the various years we invented various vehicles. Actually the critical point was in       when we demonstrated the stability of this vehicle    how completely stable it was in all circumstances  which is of course very critical. Still not a practical vehicle during all of this  but moving in the right direction  we believe. Finally  in the early part of    or actually the middle of       we flew the        M     which was the four passenger vehicle. In this case here  we're flying it remotely  as we always did at the beginning. And we had very small power plants in it at this time. We are now installing larger powerplants  which will make it possible for me to get back on board. A vertical takeoff aircraft is not the safest vehicle during the test flight program. There's an old adage that applied for the years between     s and     s  when every aeronautical company was working on vertical takeoff aircraft. A vertical takeoff aircraft needs an artificial stabilization system    that's essential. At least for the hover  and the low speed flight. If that single stability system  that brain that flies that aircraft  fails  or if the engine fails  that vehicle crashes. There is no option to that. And the adage that I'm referring to  that applied at that time  was that nothing comes down faster than a VTOL aircraft upside down. That's a macabre comment because we lost a lot of pilots. In fact  the aircraft companies gave up on vertical takeoff aircraft more or less for a number of years. And there's really only one operational aircraft in the world today that's a vertical takeoff aircraft    as distinct from a helicopter    and that's the Hawker Harrier jump jet. A vertical takeoff aircraft  like the hummingbird  has a very high metabolism  which means it requires a lot of energy. Getting that energy is very  very difficult. It all comes down to that power plant    how to get a large amount of power in a small package. Fortunately  Dr. Felix Wankel invented the rotary engine. A very unique engine    it's round  it's small  it's vibration free. It fits exactly where we need to fit it  right in the center of the hubs of the ducts in the system    very critical. In fact that engine    for those who are into the automobile    know that it recently is applied to the RX     the Mazda. And that sportscar won Sports Car of the Year. Wonderful engine. In that application  it generates one horsepower per pound  which is twice as good as your car engine today  but only half of what we need. My company has spent    years and many millions of dollars taking that rotary engine  which was invented in the late '  s  and getting it to the point that we get over two horsepower per pound  reliably  and critical. We actually get     horsepower into one cubic foot. We have eight engines in this vehicle. We have four computers. We have two parachutes. Redundancy is the critical issue here. If you want to stay alive you've got to have backups. And we have actually flown this vehicle and lost an engine  and continued to hover. The computers back up each other. There's a voting system    if one computer is not agreeing with the other three  it's kicked out of the system. And then you have three    you still have the triple redundancy. If one of those fails  you still have a second chance. If you stick around  then good luck. There won't be a third chance. The parachutes are there    hopefully  more for psychological than real reasons  but they will be an ultimate backup if it comes to that. I'd like to show you an animation in this next one  which is one element of the Skycar's use  but it's one that demonstrates how it could be used. You could think of it personally in your own terms  of how you might use it. Video  Skycar dispatched  launch rescue vehicle for San Francisco. Paul Moller  I believe that personal transportation in something like the Skycar  probably in another volantor form as well  will be a significant part of our lives  as Dr. Goldin says  within the next    years. And it's going to change the demographics in a very significant way. If you can live    miles from San Francisco and get there in    minutes  you're going to sell your         dollar apartment  buy an upscale home on the side of a mountain  buy a Skycar  which I think would be priced at that time perhaps in the area of         dollars  put money in the bank ... that's a very significant incentive for getting out of San Francisco. But you better be the first one out of town as the real estate values go to hell. Developing the Skycar has been a real challenge. Obviously I'm dependent on a lot of other people believing in what I'm doing    both financially and in technical help. And that has    you run into situations where you have this great acceptance of what you're doing  and a lot of rejection of the same kind of thing. I characterized this emerging technology in an aphorism  as it's described  which really talks about what I've experienced  and I'm sure what other people may have experienced in emerging technologies. There's an interesting poll that came out recently under NAS    I think it's MSNBC    in which they asked the question   Are you in the market for a volantor   Twenty three percent said   Yes  as soon as possible.  Forty seven percent    yes  as soon as they could    price could come down. Twenty three percent said   As soon as it's proven safe.  Only seven percent said that they wouldn't consider buying a Skycar. I'm encouraged by that. At least it makes me feel like  to some extent  it is becoming self evident. That we need an alternative to the automobile  at least for those    mile trips and more  so that the highways become usable in today's world. Thank you. What I thought I would talk about today is the transition from one mode of thinking about nature to another that's tracked by architecture. What's interesting about architects is  we always have tried to justify beauty by looking to nature  and arguably  beautiful architecture has always been looking at a model of nature. So  for roughly     years  the hot debate in architecture was whether the number five or the number seven was a better proportion to think about architecture  because the nose was one fifth of your head  or because your head was one seventh of your body. And the reason that that was the model of beauty and of nature was because the decimal point had not been invented yet    it wasn't the   th century    and everybody had to dimension a building in terms of fractions  so a room would be dimensioned as one fourth of a facade  the structural dais of that might be dimensioned as    units  and you would get down to the small elements by fractional subdivision  finer and finer and finer. In the   th century  the decimal point was invented  architects stopped using fractions  and they had a new model of nature. So  what's going on today is that there's a model of natural form which is calculus based and which is using digital tools  and that has a lot of implications to the way we think about beauty and form  and it has a lot of implications in the way we think about nature. The best example of this would probably be the Gothic  and the Gothic was invented after the invention of calculus  although the Gothic architects weren't really using calculus to define their forms. But what was important is  the Gothic moment in architecture was the first time that force and motion was thought of in terms of form. So  examples like Christopher Wren's King's Cross  you can see that the structural forces of the vaulting get articulated as lines  so you're really actually seeing the expression of structural force and form. Much later  Robert Maillart's bridges  which optimize structural form with a calculus curvature almost like a parabola. The Hanging Chain models of Antonio Gaudi  the Catalan architect. The end of the   th century  beginning of the   th century  and how that Hanging Chain model translates into archways and vaulting. So  in all of these examples  structure is the determining force. Frei Otto was starting to use foam bubble diagrams and foam bubble models to generate his Mannheim Concert Hall. Interestingly  in the last    years Norman Foster used a similar heat thermal transfer model to generate the roof of the National Gallery  with the structural engineer Chris Williams. In all these examples  there's one ideal form  because these are thought in terms of structure. And as an architect  I've always found these kinds of systems very limiting  because I'm not interested in ideal forms and I'm not interested in optimizing to some perfect moment. So  what I thought I would bring up is another component that needs to be thought of  whenever you think about nature  and that's basically the invention of generic form in genetic evolution. My hero is actually not Darwin  it's a guy named William Bateson  father of Greg Bateson  who was here for a long time in Monterey. And he was what you'd call a teratologist  he looked at all of the monstrosities and mutations to find rules and laws  rather than looking at the norms. So  instead of trying to find the ideal type or the ideal average  he'd always look for the exception. So  in this example  which is an example of what's called Bateson's Rule  he has two kinds of mutations of a human thumb. When I first saw this image     years ago  I actually found it very strange and beautiful at the same time. Beautiful  because it has symmetry. So  what he found is that in all cases of thumb mutations  instead of having a thumb  you would either get another opposable thumb  or you would get four fingers. So  the mutations reverted to symmetry. And Bateson invented the concept of symmetry breaking  which is that wherever you lose information in a system  you revert back to symmetry. So  symmetry wasn't the sign of order and organization    which is what I was always understanding  and as is an architect    symmetry was the absence of information. So  whenever you lost information  you'd move to symmetry  whenever you added information to a system  you would break symmetry. So  this whole idea of natural form shifted at that moment from looking for ideal shapes to looking for a combination of information and generic form. You know  literally after seeing that image  and finding out what Bateson was working with  we started to use these rules for symmetry breaking and branching to start to think about architectural form. To just talk for a minute about the digital mediums that we're using now and how they integrate calculus  the fact that they're calculus based means that we don't have to think about dimension in terms of ideal units or discreet elements. So  in architecture we deal with big assemblies of components  so there might be up to  say         pieces of material in this room you're sitting in right now that all need to get organized. Now  typically you'd think that they would all be the same  like  the chairs you're sitting in would all be the same dimension. You know  I haven't verified this  but it's the norm that every chair would be a slightly different dimension  because you'd want to space them all out for everybody's sight lines. The elements that make up the ceiling grid and the lighting  they're all losing their modular quality  and moving more and more to these infinitesimal dimensions. That's because we're all using calculus tools for manufacturing and for design. Calculus is also a mathematics of curves. So  even a straight line  defined with calculus  is a curve. It's just a curve without inflection. So  a new vocabulary of form is now pervading all design fields  whether it's automobiles  architecture  products  etc.  it's really being affected by this digital medium of curvature. The intricacies of scale that come out of that    you know  in the example of the nose to the face  there's a fractional part to whole idea. With calculus  the whole idea of subdivision is more complex  because the whole and the parts are one continuous series. It's too early in the morning for a lecture on calculus  so I brought some images to just describe how that works. This is a Korean church that we did in Queens. And in this example  you can see that the components of this stair are repetitive  but they're repetitive without being modular. Each one of the elements in this structure is a unique distance and dimension  and all of the connections are unique angles. Now  the only way we could design that  or possibly construct it  is by using a calculus based definition of the form. It also is much more dynamic  so that you can see that the same form opens and closes in a very dynamic way as you move across it  because it has this quality of vector in motion built into it. So the same space that appears to be a kind of closed volume  when seen from the other side becomes a kind of open vista. And you also get a sense of visual movement in the space  because every one of the elements is changing in a pattern  so that pattern leads your eye towards the altar. I think that's one of the main changes  also  in architecture  that we're starting to look now not for some ideal form  like a Latin cross for a church  but actually all the traits of a church  so  light that comes from behind from an invisible source  directionality that focuses you towards an altar. It turns out it's not rocket science to design a sacred space. You just need to incorporate a certain number of traits in a very kind of genetic way. So  these are the different perspectives of that interior  which has a very complex set of orientations all in a simple form. In terms of construction and manufacturing  this is a kilometer long housing block that was built in the '  s in Amsterdam. And here we've broken the     apartments up into small neighborhoods  and differentiated those neighborhoods. I won't go into too much description of any of these projects  but what you can see is that the escalators and elevators that circulate people along the face of the building are all held up by     structural trusses. Because we're using escalators to move people  all of these trusses are picking up diagonal loads. So  every one of them is a little bit different shaped as you move down the length of the building. So  working with Bentley and MicroStation  we've written a custom piece of software that networks all of the components together into these chunks of information  so that if we change any element along the length of the building  not only does that change distribute through each one of the trusses  but each one of the trusses then distributes that information down the length of the entire facade of the building. So it's a single calculation for every single component of the building that we're adding onto. So  it's tens of millions of calculations just to design one connection between a piece of structural steel and another piece of structural steel. But what it gives us is a harmonic and synthesized relationship of all these components  one to another. This idea has  kind of  brought me into doing some product design  and it's because design firms that have connections to architects  like  I'm working with Vitra  which is a furniture company  and Alessi  which is a houseware company. They saw this actually solving a problem  this ability to differentiate components but keep them synthetic. So  not to pick on BMW  or to celebrate them  but take BMW as an example. They have to  in       have a distinct identity for all their models of cars. So  the     series  or whatever their newest car is  the     series that's coming out  has to look like the     series  at the other end of their product line  so they need a distinct  coherent identity  which is BMW. At the same time  there's a person paying        dollars for a     series car  and a person paying        dollars for a     series  and that person paying more than double doesn't want their car to look too much like the bottom of the market car. So they have to also discriminate between these products. So  as manufacturing starts to allow more design options  this problem gets exacerbated  of the whole and the parts. Now  as an architect  part to whole relationships is all I think about  but in terms of product design it's becoming more and more of an issue for companies. So  the first kind of test product we did was with Alessi  which was for a coffee and tea set. It's an incredibly expensive coffee and tea set  we knew that at the beginning. So  I actually went to some people I knew down south in San Diego  and we used an exploded titanium forming method that's used in the aerospace industry. Basically what we can do  is just cut a graphite mold  put it in an oven  heat it to       degrees  gently inflate titanium that's soft  and then explode it at the last minute into this form. But what's great about it is  the forms are only a few hundred dollars. The titanium's several thousand dollars  but the forms are very cheap. So  we designed a system here of eight curves that could be swapped  very similar to that housing project I showed you  and we could recombine those together  so that we always had ergonomic shapes that always had the same volume and could always be produced in the same way. That way  each one of these tools we could pay for with a few hundred dollars  and get incredible variation in the components. And this is one of those examples of the sets. So  for me  what was important is that this coffee set    which is just a coffee pot  a teapot  and those are the pots sitting on a tray    that they would have a coherence    so  they would be Greg Lynn Alessi coffee pots    but that everyone who bought one would have a one of a kind object that was unique in some way. To go back to architecture  what's organic about architecture as a field  unlike product design  is this whole issue of holism and of monumentality is really our realm. Like  we have to design things which are coherent as a single object  but also break down into small rooms and have an identity of both the big scale and the small scale. Architects tend to work with signature  so that an architect needs a signature and that signature has to work across the scale of houses up to  say  skyscrapers  and that problem of signatures is a thing we're very good at maintaining and working with  and intricacy  which is the relationship of  say  the shape of a building  its structure  its windows  its color  its pattern. These are real architectural problems. So  my kind of hero for this in the natural world are these tropical frogs. I got interested in them because they're the most extreme example of a surface where the texture and the    let's call it the decoration    I know the frog doesn't think of it as decoration  but that's how it works    are all intricately connected to one another. So a change in the form indicates a change in the color pattern. So  the pattern and the form aren't the same thing  but they really work together and are fused in some way. So  when doing a center for the national parks in Costa Rica  we tried to use that idea of a gradient color and a change in texture as the structure moves across the surface of the building. We also used a continuity of change from a main exhibition hall to a natural history museum  so it's all one continuous change in the massing  but within that massing are very different kinds of spaces and forms. In a housing project in Valencia  Spain  we're doing  the different towers of housing fused together in shared curves so you get a single mass  like a kind of monolith  but it breaks down into individual elements. And you can see that that change in massing also gives all    of the apartments a unique shape and size  but always within a  kind of  controlled limit  an envelope of change. I work with a group of other architects. We have a company called United Architects. We were one of the finalists for the World Trade Center site design. And I think this just shows how we were approaching the problem of incredibly large scale construction. We wanted to make a kind of Gothic cathedral around the footprints of the World Trade Center site. And to do that  we tried to connect up the five towers into a single system. And we looked at  from the     s on  there were numerous examples of other architects trying to do the same thing. We really approached it at the level of the typology of the building  where we could build these five separate towers  but they would all join at the   th floor and make a kind of single monolithic mass. With United Architects  also  we made a proposal for the European Central Bank headquarters that used the same system  but this time in a much more monolithic mass  like a sphere. But again  you can see this  kind of  organic fusion of multiple building elements to make a thing which is whole  but breaks down into smaller parts  but in an incredibly organic way. Finally  I'd like to just show you some of the effects of using digital fabrication. About six years ago  I bought one of these CNC mills  to just replace  kind of  young people cutting their fingers off all the time building models. And I also bought a laser cutter and started to fabricate within my own shop  kind of  large scale building elements and models  where we could go directly to the tooling. What I found out is that the tooling  if you intervened in the software  actually produced decorative effects. So  for these interiors  like this shop in Stockholm  Sweden  or this installation wall in the Netherlands at the Netherlands Architecture Institute  we could use the texture that the tool would leave to produce a lot of the spatial effects  and we could integrate the texture of the wall with the form of the wall with the material. So  in vacuum formed plastic  in fiberglass  and then even at the level of structural steel  which you think of as being linear and modular. The steel industry is so far ahead of the design industry that if you take advantage of it you can even start to think of beams and columns all rolled together into a single system which is highly efficient  but also produces decorative effects and formal effects that are very beautiful and organic. Thanks very much. I was listed on the online biography that said I was a design missionary. That's a bit lofty  I'm really more of something like a street walker. I spend a lot of time in urban areas looking for design  and studying design in the public sector. I take about       photographs a year  and I thought that I would edit from these  and try to come up with some images that might be appropriate and interesting to you. And I used three criteria  the first was  I thought I'd talk about real design within reach  design that's free  not design not quite within reach  as we're fondly known by our competition and competitors  but stuff that you can find on the streets  stuff that was free  stuff that was available to all people  and stuff that probably contains some other important messages. I'll use these sidewalks in Rio as an example. A very common public design done in the '  s. It's got a nice kind of flowing  organic form  very consistent with the Brazilian culture    I think good design adds to culture. Wholly inconsistent with San Francisco or New York. But I think these are my sort of information highways  I live in much more of an analog world  where pedestrian traffic and interaction and diversity exchange  and where I think the simple things under our feet have a great amount of meaning to us. How did I get started in this business  I was a ceramic designer for about    years  and just loved utilitarian form    simple things that we use every day  little compositions of color and surface on form. This led me to starting a company called Design Within Reach  a company dealing with simple forms  making good designers available to us  and also selling the personalities and character of the designers as well  and it seems to have worked. A couple of years into the process  I spent a lot of time in Europe traveling around  looking for design. And I had a bit of a wake up call in Amsterdam  I was there going into the design stores  and mixing with our crowd of designers  and I recognized that a whole lot of stuff pretty much looked the same  and the effect of globalization has had that in our community also. We know a lot about what's going on with design around the world  and it's getting increasingly more difficult to find design that reflects a unique culture. I was walking around on the streets of Amsterdam and I recognized  you know  the big story from Amsterdam isn't what's in the design stores  it's what's out on the streets  and maybe it's self explanatory  but a city that hasn't been taken over by modernism  that's preserved its kind of architecture and character  and where the bicycle plays an important part of the way in which people get around and where pedestrian rights are protected. And I write a newsletter that goes out every week  and I wrote an article about this  and it got such enormous response that I realized that design  that common design  that's in the public area means a lot to people  and establishes kind of a groundwork and a dialog. I then kind of thought about the other cities in Europe where I spend a lot of time looking for design  like Basel  where Vitra is located  or in northern Italy    all cities where there are a whole lot of bicycles  and where pedestrian areas    and I came to the conclusion that perhaps there was something about these important design centers that dealt with bicycles and foot traffic  and I'm sure the skeptic eye would say  no  the correlation there is that there are universities and schools where people can't afford cars  but it did seem that in many of these areas pedestrian traffic was protected. You wouldn't look at this and call this a designer bike  a designer bike is made of titanium or molybdenum. But I began looking at design in a place like Amsterdam and recognized  you know  the first job of design is to serve a social purpose. And so I look at this bike as not being a designer bike  but being a very good example of design. And since that time in Amsterdam  I spent an increasing amount of time in the cities  looking at design for common evidence of design that really isn't under so much of a designer's signature. I was in Buenos Aires very recently  and I went to see this bridge by Santiago Calatrava. He's a Spanish architect and designer. And the tourist brochures pointed me in the direction of this bridge    I love bridges  metaphorically and symbolically and structurally    and it was a bit of a disappointment  because of the sludge from the river was encrusted on it  it really wasn't in use. And I recognized that oftentimes design  when you're set up to see design  it can be a bit of a letdown. But there were lots of other things going on in this area  it was a kind of construction zone  a lot of buildings were going up. And  approaching a building from a distance  you don't see too much  you get a little closer  and you arrive at a nice little composition that might remind you of a Mondrian or a Diebenkorn or something. But to me it was an example of industrial materials with a little bit of colors and animation and a nice little still life    kind of unintended piece of design. And going a little closer  you get a different perspective. I find these little vignettes  these little accidental pieces of design  to be refreshing. They give me  I don't know  a sense of correctness in the world and some visual delight in the knowledge that the building will probably never look as good as this simple industrial scaffolding that is there to serve. Down the road  there was another building  a nice visual structure  horizontal  vertical elements  little decorative lines going across  these magenta squiggles  the workmen being reduced to decorative elements  just a nice  kind of  breakup of the urban place. And  you know  that no longer exists. You've captured it for a moment  and finding this little still life's like listening to little songs or something  it gives me an enormous amount of pleasure. Antoine Predock designed a wonderful ball stadium in San Diego called Petco Park. A terrific use of local materials  but inside you could find some interior compositions. Some people go to baseball stadiums to look at games  I go and see design relationships. Just a wonderful kind of breakup of architecture  and the way that the trees form vertical elements. Red is a color in the landscape that is often on stop signs. It takes your attention  it has a great amount of emotion  it stares back at you the way that a figure might. Just a piece of barrier tape construction stuff in Italy. Construction site in New York  red having this kind of emotional power that's almost an equivalent with the way in which    cuteness of puppies and such. Side street in Italy. Red drew me into this little composition  optimistic to me in the sense that maybe the public service's mailbox  door service  plumbing. It looks as if these different public services work together to create some nice little compositions. In Italy  you know  almost everything  kind of  looks good. Simple menus put on a board  achieving  kind of  the sort of balance. But I'm convinced that it's because you're walking around the streets and seeing things. Red can be comical  it can draw your attention to the poor little personality of the little fire hydrant suffering from bad civic planning in Havana. Color can animate simple blocks  simple materials  walking in New York  I'll stop. I don't always know why I take photographs of things. A nice visual composition of symmetry. Curves against sharp things. It's a comment on the way in which we deal with public seating in the city of New York. I've come across some other just  kind of  curious relationships of bollards on the street that have different interpretations  but    these things amuse me. Sometimes a trash can    this is just in the street in San Francisco    a trash can that's been left there for    months creates a nice    degree angle against these other relationships  and turns a common parking spot into a nice little piece of sculpture. So  there's this sort of silent hand of design at work that I see in places that I go. Havana is a wonderful area. It's quite free of commercial clutter  you don't see our logos and brands and names  and therefore you're alert to things physically. And this is a great protection of a pedestrian zone  and the repurposing of some colonial cannons to do that. And Cuba needs to be far more resourceful  because of the blockades and things  but a really wonderful playground. I've often wondered why Italy is really a leader in modern design. In our area  in furnishings  they're sort of way at the top. The Dutch are good also  but the Italians are good. And I came across this little street in Venice  where the communist headquarters were sharing a wall with this Catholic shrine. And I realized that  you know  Italy is a place where they can accept these different ideologies and deal with diversity and not have the problem  or they can choose to ignore them  but these    you don't have warring factions  and I think that maybe the tolerance of the absurdity which has made Italy so innovative and so tolerant. The past and the present work quite well together in Italy also  and I think that it's recognizable there  and has an important effect on culture  because their public spaces are protected  their sidewalks are protected  and you're actually able to confront these things physically  and I think this helps people get over their fear of modernism and other such things. A change might be a typical street corner in San Francisco. And I use this    this is  sort of  what I consider to be urban spam. I notice this stuff because I walk a lot  but here  private industry is really kind of making a mess of the public sector. And as I look at it  I sort of say  you know  the publications that report on problems in the urban area also contribute to it  and it's just my call to say to all of us  public policy won't change this at all  private industry has to work to take things like this seriously. The extreme might be in Italy where  again  there's kind of some type of control over what's happening in the environment is very evident  even in the way that they sell and distribute periodicals. I walk to work every day or ride my scooter  and I come down and park in this little spot. And I came down one day  and all the bikes were red. Now  this is not going to impress you guys who Photoshop  and can do stuff  but this was an actual moment when I got off my bike  and I looked and I thought  it's as if all of my biker brethren had kind of gotten together and conspired to make a little statement. And it reminded me that    to keep in the present  to look out for these kinds of things. It gave me possibilities for wonder    if maybe it's a yellow day in San Francisco  and we could all agree  and create some installations. But it also reminded me of the power of pattern and repetition to make an effect in our mind. And I don't know if there's a stronger kind of effect than pattern and the way it unites kind of disparate elements. I was at the art show in Miami in December  and spent a couple of hours looking at fine art  and amazed at the prices of art and how expensive it is  but having a great time looking at it. And I came outside  and the valets for this car service had created  you know  quite a nice little collage of these car keys  and my closest equivalent were a group of prayer tags that I had seen in Tokyo. And I thought that if pattern can unite these disparate elements  it can do just about anything. I don't have very many shots of people  because they kind of  get in the way of studying pure form. I was in a small restaurant in Spain  having lunch    one of those nice days where you had the place kind of to yourself  and you have a glass of wine  and enjoying the local area and the culture and the food and the quiet  and feeling very lucky  and a bus load of tourists arrived  emptied out  filled up the restaurant. In a very short period of time  completely changed the atmosphere and character with loud voices and large bodies and such  and we had to get up and leave  it was just that uncomfortable. And at that moment  the sun came out  and through this perforated screen  a pattern was cast over these bodies and they kind of faded into the rear  and we left the restaurant kind of feeling O.K. about stuff. And I do think pattern has the capability of eradicating some of the most evil forces of society  such as bad form in restaurants  but quite seriously  it was a statement to me that one thing that you do  sort of  see is the aggressive nature of the industrial world has produced    kind of  large masses of things  and when you    in monoculture  and I think the preservation of diversity in culture is something that's important to us. The last shots that I have deal with    coming back to this theme of sidewalks  and I wanted to say something here about    I'm  kind of  optimistic  you know. Post Second World War  the influence of the automobile has really been devastating in a lot of our cities. A lot of urban areas have been converted into parking lots in a sort of indiscriminate use. A lot of the planning departments became subordinated to the transportation department. It's as easy to rag on cars as it is on Wal Mart  I'm not going to do that. But they're real examples in urbanization and the change that's occurred in the last number of years  and the heightened sensitivity to the importance of our urban environments as cultural centers. I think that they are  that the statements that we make in this public sector are our contributions to a larger whole. Cities are the place where we're most likely to encounter diversity and to mix with other people. We go there for stimulation in art and all those other things. But I think people have recognized the sanctity of our urban areas. A place like Chicago has really reached kind of a level of international stature. The U.S. is actually becoming a bit of a leader in kind of enlightened urban planning and renewal  and I want to single out a place like Chicago  where I look at some guy like Mayor Daley as a bit of a design hero for being able to work through the political processes and all that to improve an area. You would expect a city like this to have upgraded flower boxes on Michigan Avenue where wealthy people shop  but if you actually go along the street you find the flower boxes change from street to street  there's actual diversity in the plants. And the idea that a city group can maintain different types of foliage is really quite exceptional. There are common elements of this that you'll see throughout Chicago  and then there are your big D design statements  the Pritzker Pavilion done by Frank Gehry. My measure of this as being an important bit of design is not so much the way that it looks  but the fact that it performs a very important social function. There are a lot of free concerts  for example  that go on in this area  it has a phenomenal acoustic system. But the commitment that the city has made to the public area is significant  and almost an international model. I work on the mayor's council in San Francisco  on the International Design Council for Mayors  and Chicago is looked at as the pinnacle  and I really would like to salute Mayor Daley and the folks there. I thought that I should include at least one shot of technology for you guys. This is also in Millennium Park in Chicago  where the Spanish artist designer Plensa has created  kind of  a digital readout in this park that reflects back the characters and personalities of the people in this area. And it's a welcoming area  I think  inclusive of diversity  reflective of diversity  and I think this marriage of both technology and art in the public sector is an area where the U.S. can really take a leadership role  and Chicago is one example. Thank you very much. Of the five senses  vision is the one that I appreciate the most  and it's the one that I can least take for granted. I think this is partially due to my father  who was blind. It was a fact that he didn't make much of a fuss about  usually. One time in Nova Scotia  when we went to see a total eclipse of the sun    yeah  same one as in the Carly Simon song  which may or may not refer to James Taylor  Warren Beatty or Mick Jagger  we're not really sure. They handed out these dark plastic viewers that allowed us to look directly at the sun without damaging our eyes. But Dad got really scared  he didn't want us doing that. He wanted us instead to use these cheap cardboard viewers so that there was no chance at all that our eyes would be damaged. I thought this was a little strange at the time. What I didn't know at the time was that my father had actually been born with perfect eyesight. When he and his sister Martha were just very little  their mom took them out to see a total eclipse    or actually  a solar eclipse    and not long after that  both of them started losing their eyesight. Decades later  it turned out that the source of their blindness was most likely some sort of bacterial infection. As near as we can tell  it had nothing whatsoever to do with that solar eclipse  but by then my grandmother had already gone to her grave thinking it was her fault. So  Dad graduated Harvard in       married my mom  and bought a house in Lexington  Massachusetts  where the first shots were fired against the British in       although we didn't actually hit any of them until Concord. He got a job working for Raytheon  designing guidance systems  which was part of the Route     high tech axis in those days    so the equivalent of Silicone Valley in the '  s. Dad wasn't a real militaristic kind of guy  he just really felt bad that he wasn't able to fight in World War II on account of his handicap  although they did let him get through the several hour long army physical exam before they got to the very last test  which was for vision. So  Dad started racking up all of these patents and gaining a reputation as a blind genius  rocket scientist  inventor. But to us he was just Dad  and our home life was pretty normal. As a kid  I watched a lot of television and had lots of nerdy hobbies like mineralogy and microbiology and the space program and a little bit of politics. I played a lot of chess. But at the age of     a friend of mine got me interested in comic books  and I decided that was what I wanted to do for a living. So  here's my dad  he's a scientist  he's an engineer and he's a military contractor. So  he has four kids  right  One grows up to become a computer scientist  one grows up to join the Navy  one grows up to become an engineer  and then there's me  the comic book artist. Which  incidentally  makes me the opposite of Dean Kamen  because I'm a comic book artist  son of an inventor  and he's an inventor  son of a comic book artist. Right  it's true. The funny thing is  Dad had a lot of faith in me. He had faith in my abilities as a cartoonist  even though he had no direct evidence that I was any good whatsoever  everything he saw was just a blur. Now  this gives a real meaning to the term  blind faith   which doesn't have the same negative connotation for me that it does for other people. Now  faith in things which cannot be seen  which cannot be proved  is not the sort of faith that I've ever really related to all that much. I tend to like science  where what we see and can ascertain are the foundation of what we know. But there's a middle ground  too. A middle ground tread by people like poor old Charles Babbage  and his steam driven computers that were never built. Nobody really understood what it was that he had in mind  except for Ada Lovelace  and he went to his grave trying to pursue that dream. Vannevar Bush with his Memex    this idea of all of human knowledge at your fingertips    he had this vision. And I think a lot of people in his day probably thought he was a bit of a kook. And  yeah  we can look back in retrospect and say  yeah  ha ha  you know    it's all microfilm. But that's    that's not the point. He understood the shape of the future. So did J.C.R. Licklider and his notions for computer human interaction. Same thing  he understood the shape of the future  even though it was something that would only be implemented by people much later. Or Paul Baran  and his vision for packet switching. Hardly anybody listened to him in his day. Or even the people who actually pulled it off  the people at Bolt  Beranek and Newman in Boston  who just would sketch out these structures of what would eventually become a worldwide network  and sketching things on the back of napkins and on note papers and arguing over dinner at Howard Johnson's    on Route     in Lexington  Massachusetts  just two miles from where I was studying the Queen's Gambit Deferred and listening to Gladys Knight   the Pips singing  Midnight Train to Georgia   while       in my dad's big easy chair  you know  So  three types of vision  right  Vision based on what one cannot see  the vision of that unseen and unknowable. The vision of that which has already been proven or can be ascertained. And this third kind of vision  of something which can be  which may be  based on knowledge  but is as yet unproven. Now  we've seen a lot of examples of people who are pursuing that sort of vision in science  but I think it's also true in the arts  it's true in politics  it's even true in personal endeavors. What it comes down to  really  is four basic principles  learn from everyone  follow no one  watch for patterns  and work like hell. I think these are the four principles that go into this. And it's that third one  especially  where visions of the future begin to manifest themselves. What's interesting is that this particular way of looking at the world  is  I think  only one of four different ways that manifest themselves in different fields of endeavor. In comics  I know that it results in sort of a formalist attitude towards trying to understand how it works. Then there's another  more classical  attitude which embraces beauty and craft. Another one which believes in the pure transparency of content. And then another which emphasizes the authenticity of human experience    and honesty  and rawness. These are four very different ways of looking at the world. I even gave them names. The classicist  the animist  and formalist and iconoclast. Interestingly  it seemed to correspond more or less to Jung's four subdivisions of human thought. And they reflect a dichotomy of art and delight on left and the right  tradition and revolution on the top and the bottom. And if you go on the diagonal  you get content and form    and then beauty and truth. And it probably applies just as much to music and to movies and to fine art  which has nothing whatsoever to do with vision at all  or for that matter  nothing to do with our conference theme of  Inspired by Nature     except to the extent of the fable of the frog who gives the ride to the scorpion on his back to get across the river because the scorpion promises not to sting him  but then the scorpion does sting him anyway and they both die  but not before the frog asks him why and the scorpion says   Because it's my nature     in that sense  yes. So    so this was my nature. The thing was  I saw that the route that I took to discovering this focus in my work and who I was  I saw it as just this road to discovery. Actually  it was just me embracing my nature  which means that I didn't actually fall that far from the tree after all. So what does a  scientific mind  do in the arts  Well  I started making comics  but I also started trying to understand them  almost immediately. And one of the most important things about comics  I discovered  was that comics are a visual medium  but they try to embrace all of the senses within it. So  the different elements of comics  like pictures and words  and the different symbols and everything in between that comics presents are all funneled through the single conduit of vision. So you have things like resemblance  where something which resembles the physical world can be abstracted in a couple of different directions  abstracted from resemblance  but still retaining the complete meaning  or abstracted away from both resemblance and meaning towards the picture plan. Put all these three together  and you have a nice little map of the entire boundary of visual iconography which comics can embrace. And if you move to the right you also get language  because that's abstracting even further from resemblance  but still maintaining meaning. Vision is called upon to represent sound and to understand the common properties of those two and their common heritage  as well. Also  to try to represent the texture of sound to capture its essential character through visuals. And there's also a balance between the visible and the invisible in comics. Comics is a kind of call and response in which the artist gives you something to see within the panels  and then gives you something to imagine between the panels. Also  another sense which comics' vision represents  and that's time. Sequence is a very important aspect of comics. Comics presents a kind of temporal map. And this temporal map was something that energizes modern comics  but I was wondering if perhaps it also energizes other sorts of forms  and I found some in history. And you can see this same principle operating in these ancient versions of the same idea. What's happening is  the art form is colliding with the given technology  whether it's paint on stone  like the Tomb of the Scribe in ancient Egypt  or a bas relief sculpture rising up a stone column  or a     foot long embroidery  or painted deerskin and tree bark running across    accordion folded pages. What's interesting is  once you hit print    and this is from       by the way    all of the artifacts of modern comics start to present themselves  rectilinear panel arrangements  simple line drawings without tone and a left to right reading sequence. And within     years  you already start to see word balloons and captions  and it's really just a hop  skip and a jump from here to here. So I wrote a book about this in '    but as I was finishing the book  I had to do a little bit of typesetting  and I was tired of going to my local copy shop to do it  so I bought a computer. And it was just a little thing    it wasn't good for much except text entry    but my father had told me about Moore's Law  about Moore's Law back in the '  s  and I knew what was coming. And so  I kept my eyes peeled to see if the sort of changes that happened when we went from pre print comics to print comics would happen when we went beyond  to post print comics. So  one of the first things that were proposed was that we could mix the visuals of comics with the sound  motion and interactivity of the CD ROMs that were being made in those days. This was even before the Web. And one of the first things they did was  they tried to take the comics page as is and transplant it to monitors  which was a classic McLuhanesque mistake of appropriating the shape of the previous technology as the content of the new technology. And so  what they would do is  they'd have these comic pages that resemble print comics pages  and they would introduce all this sound and motion. The problem was  that if you go with this idea    this basic idea that space equals time in comics    what happens is that when you introduce sound and motion  which are temporal phenomena that can only be represented through time  then they break with that continuity of presentation. Interactivity was another thing. There were hypertext comics. But the thing about hypertext is that everything in hypertext is either here  not here or connected to here  it's profoundly non spatial. The distance from Abraham Lincoln to a Lincoln penny  the Penny Marshall to the Marshall Plan to  Plan    to nine lives  it's all the same. And    but in comics  in comics  every aspect of the work  every element of the work has a spatial relationship to every other element at all times. So the question was  was there any way to preserve that spatial relationship while still taking advantage of all of the things that digital had to offer us  And I found my personal answer for this in those ancient comics that I was showing you. Each of them has a single unbroken reading line  whether it's going zigzag across the walls or spiraling up a column or just straight left to right  or even going in a backwards zigzag across those    accordion folded pages. The same thing is happening  and that is that the basic idea that as you move through space you move through time is being carried out without any compromise  but there were compromises when print hit. Adjacent spaces were no longer adjacent moments  so the basic idea of comics was being broken again and again and again and again. And I thought  O.K.  well  if that's true  is there any way  when we go beyond today's print  to somehow bring that back  Now  the monitor is just as limited as the page  technically  right  It's a different shape  but other than that it's the same basic limitation. But that's only if you look at the monitor as a page  but not if you look at the monitor as a window. And that's what I proposed  that perhaps we could create these comics on an infinite canvas  along the X axis and the Y axis and staircases. We could do circular narratives that were literally circular. We could do a turn in a story that was literally a turn. Parallel narratives could be literally parallel. X  Y and also Z. So I had all these notions. This was back in the late '  s  and other people in my business thought I was pretty crazy  but a lot of people then went on and actually did it. I'm going to show you a couple now. This was an early collage comic by a fellow named Jason Lex. And notice what's going on here. What I'm searching for is a durable mutation    that's what all of us are searching for. As media head into this new era  we are looking for mutations that are durable  that have some sort of staying power. Now  we're taking this basic idea of presenting comics in a visual medium  and then we're carrying it through all the way from beginning to end. That's that entire comic you just saw is up on the screen right now. But even though we're only experiencing it one piece at a time  that's just where the technology is right now. As the technology evolves  as you get full immersive displays and whatnot  this sort of thing will only grow. It will adapt. It will adapt to its environment  it's a durable mutation. Here's another one I'll show you. This is by Drew Weing  this is called   Pup Contemplates the Heat Death of the Universe.  See what's going on here as we draw these stories on an infinite canvas is you're creating a more pure expression of what this medium is all about. We'll go by this a little quickly    you get the idea. I just want to get to the last panel. There we go. Just one more. Talk about your infinite canvas. It's by a guy named Daniel Merlin Goodbrey in Britain. Why is this important  I think this is important because media  all media  provide us a window back into our world. Now  it could be that motion pictures    and eventually  virtual reality  or something equivalent to it    some sort of immersive display  is going to provide us with our most efficient escape from the world that we're in. That's why most people turn to storytelling  is to escape. But media provides us with a window back into the world that we live in. And when media evolve so that the identity of the media becomes increasingly unique. Because what you're looking at is  you're looking at comics cubed  you're looking at comics that are more comics like than they've ever been before. When that happens  you provide people with multiple ways of re entering the world through different windows  and when you do that  it allows them to triangulate the world that they live in and see its shape. And that's why I think this is important. One of many reasons  but I've got to go now. Thank you for having me. This is a wheat bread  a whole wheat bread  and it's made with a new technique that I've been playing around with  and developing and writing about which  for lack of a better name  we call the epoxy method. And I call it an epoxy method because    it's not very appetizing. I understand that    but    but if you think about epoxy  what's epoxy  It's two resins that are  sort of  in and of themselves    neither of which can make glue  but when you put the two together  something happens. A bond takes place  and you get this very strong  powerful adhesive. Well  in this technique  what I've tried to do is kind of gather all of the knowledge that the bread baking world  the artisan bread baking community  has been trying to accumulate over the last    years or so    since we've been engaged in a bread renaissance in America    and put it together to come up with a method that would help to take whole grain breads. And let's face it  everyone's trying to move towards whole grains. We finally  after    years of knowing that wholegrain was a healthier option  we're finally getting to the point where we actually are tipping over and attempting to actually eat them. The challenge  though  for a wholegrain baker is  you know  how do you make it taste good  Because whole grain    it's easy with white flour to make a good tasting bread. White flour is sweet. It's mainly starch  and starch  when you break it down    what is starch  It's    thank you    sugar  yes. So a baker  and a good baker  knows how to pull or draw forth the inherent sugar trapped in the starch. With whole grain bread  you have other obstacles. You've got bran  which is probably the healthiest part of the bread for us  or the fiber for us because it is just loaded with fiber  for the bran is fiber. It's got germ. Those are the good things  but those aren't the tastiest parts of the wheat. So whole grain breads historically have had sort of this onus of being health food breads  and people don't like to eat  quote  health food. They like to eat healthy and healthily  but when we think of something as a health food  we think of it as something we eat out of obligation  not out of passion and love for the flavor. And ultimately  the challenge of the baker  the challenge of every culinary student  of every chef  is to deliver flavor. Flavor is king. Flavor rules. I call it the flavor rule. Flavor rules. And    and you can get somebody to eat something that's good for them once  but they won't eat it again if they don't like it  right  So  this is the challenge for this bread. We're going to try this at lunch  and I'll explain a bit more about it  but it's made not only with two types of pre doughs    this attempt  again  at bringing out flavor is to make a piece of dough the day before that is not leavened. It's just dough that is wet. It's hydrated dough we call  the soaker     that helps to start enzyme activity. And enzymes are the secret  kind of  ingredient in dough that brings out flavor. It starts to release the sugars trapped in the starch. That's what enzymes are doing. And so  if we can release some of those  they become accessible to us in our palate. They become accessible to the yeast as food. They become accessible to the oven for caramelization to give us a beautiful crust. The other pre dough that we make is fermented    our pre ferment. And it's made    it can be a sourdough starter  or what we call a  biga  or any other kind of pre fermented dough with a little yeast in it  and that starts to develop flavor also. And on day two  we put those two pieces together. That's the epoxy. And we're hoping that  sort of  the enzyme piece of dough becomes the fuel pack for the leavened piece of dough  and when we put them together and add the final ingredients  we can create a bread that does evoke the full potential of flavor trapped in the grain. That's the challenge. Okay  so  now  what we    in the journey of wheat  let's go back and look at these    stages. I'm going to go through them very quickly and then revisit them. Okay  we're going to start with the first stage. And this is what every student has to begin with. Everyone who works in the culinary world knows that the first stage of cooking is  mise en place   which is just a French way of saying   get organized.  Everything in its place. First stage. So in baking we call it scaling    weighing out the ingredients. Stage two is mixing. We take the ingredients and we mix them. We have to develop the gluten. There's no gluten in flour. There's only the potential for gluten. Here's another kind of prefiguring of epoxy because we've got glutenin and gliadin  neither of which are strong enough to make a good bread. But when they get hydrated and they bond to each other  they create a stronger molecule  a stronger protein we call gluten. And so we  in the mixing process  have to develop the gluten  we have to activate the leaven or the yeast  and we have to essentially distribute all the ingredients evenly. Then we get into fermentation  the third stage  which is really where the flavor develops. The yeast comes alive and starts eating the sugars  creating carbon dioxide and alcohol    essentially it's burping and sweating  which is what bread is. It's yeast burps and sweat. And somehow  this is transformed    the yeast burps and sweats are later transformed    and this is really getting to the heart of what makes bread so special is that it is a transformational food  and we're going to explore that in a minute. But then  quickly through the next few stages. We  after it's fermented and it's developed  started to develop flavor and character  we divide it into smaller units. And then we take those units and we shape them. We give them a little pre shape  usually a round or a little torpedo shape  sometimes. That's called  rounding.  And there's a short rest period. It can be for a few seconds. It can be for    or    minutes. We call that resting or benching. Then we go into final shaping   panning     which means putting the shaped loaf on a pan. This takes a second  but it's a distinctive stage. It can be in a basket. It can be in a loaf pan  but we pan it. And then  stage nine. The fermentation which started at stage three is continuing through all these other stages. Again  developing more flavor. The final fermentation takes place in stage nine. We call it  proofing.  Proofing means to prove that the dough is alive. And at stage nine we get the dough to the final shape  and it goes into the oven    stage   . Three transformations take place in the oven. The sugars in the dough caramelize in the crust. They give us that beautiful brown crust. Only the crust can caramelize. It's the only place that gets hot enough. Inside  the proteins    this gluten    coagulates. When it gets to about     degrees  the proteins all line up  and they create structure  the gluten structure    what ultimately we will call the crumb of the bread. And the starches  when they reach about     degrees  gelatinize. And gelatinization is yet another oven transformation. Coagulation  caramelization and gelatinization    when the starch is thick and they absorb all the moisture that's around them  they    they kind of swell  and then they burst. And they burst  and they spill their guts into the bread. So basically now we're eating yeast sweats    sweat  burps and starch guts. Again  transformed in stage    in the oven because what went into the oven as dough comes out in stage    as bread. And stage     we call it cooling    because we never really eat the bread right away. There's a little carry over baking. The proteins have to set up  strengthen and firm up. And then we have stage     which the textbooks call  packaging   but my students call  eating.  And so  we're going to be on our own journey today from wheat to eat  and in a few minutes we will try this  and see if we have succeeded in fulfilling this baker's mission of pulling out flavor. But I want to go back now and revisit these steps  and talk about it from the standpoint of transformation  because I really believe that all things can be understood    and this is not my own idea. This goes back to the Scholastics and to the Ancients    that all things can be understood on four levels  the literal  the metaphoric or poetic level  the political or ethical level. And ultimately  the mystical or sometimes called the  anagogical  level. It's hard to get to those levels unless you go through the literal. In fact  Dante says you can't understand the three deeper levels unless you first understand the literal level  so that's why we're talking literally about bread. But let's kind of look at these stages again from the standpoint of connections to possibly a deeper level    all in my quest for answering the question   What is it about bread that's so special   And fulfilling this mission of evoking the full potential of flavor. Because what happens is  bread begins as wheat or any other grain. But what's wheat  Wheat is a grass that grows in the field. And  like all grasses  at a certain point it puts out seeds. And we harvest those seeds  and those are the wheat kernels. Now  in order to harvest it    I mean  what's harvesting  It's just a euphemism for killing  right  I mean  that's what's harvest    we say we harvest the pig  you know  Yes  we slaughter  you know. Yes  that's life. We harvest the wheat  and in harvesting it  we kill it. Now  wheat is alive  and as we harvest it  it gives up its seeds. Now  at least with seeds we have the potential for future life. We can plant those in the ground. And we save some of those for the next generation. But most of those seeds get crushed and turned into flour. And at that point  the wheat has suffered the ultimate indignity. It's not only been killed  but it's been denied any potential for creating future life. So we turn it into flour. So as I said  I think bread is a transformational food. The first transformation    and  by the way  the definition of transformation for me is a radical change from one thing into something else. O.K.  Radical  not subtle. Not like hot water made cold  or cold water turned hot  but water boiled off and becoming steam. That's a transformation  two different things. Well  in this case  the first transformation is alive to dead. I'd call that radical. So  we've got now this flour. And what do we do  We add some water. In stage one  we weigh it. In stage two  we add water and salt to it  mix it together  and we create something that we call  clay.  It's like clay. And we infuse that clay with an ingredient that we call  leaven.  In this case  it's yeast  but yeast is leaven. What does leaven mean  Leaven comes from the root word that means enliven    to vivify  to bring to life. By the way  what's the Hebrew word for clay  Adam. You see  the baker  in this moment  has become  in a sense  sort of  the God of his dough  you know  and his dough  well  while it's not an intelligent life form  is now alive. And we know it's alive because in stage three  it grows. Growth is the proof of life. And while it's growing  all these literal transformations are taking place. Enzymes are breaking forth sugars. Yeast is eating sugar and turning it into carbon dioxide and alcohol. Bacteria is in there  eating the same sugars  turning them into acids. In other words  personality and character's being developed in this dough under the watchful gaze of the baker. And the baker's choices all along the way determine the outcome of the product. A subtle change in temperature    a subtle change in time    it's all about a balancing act between time  temperature and ingredients. That's the art of baking. So all these things are determined by the baker  and the bread goes through some stages  and characters develop. And then we divide it  and this one big piece of dough is divided into smaller units  and each of those units are given shape by the baker. And as they're shaped  they're raised again  all along proving that they're alive  and developing character. And at stage     we take it to the oven. It's still dough. Nobody eats bread dough    a few people do  I think  but not too many. I've met some dough eaters  but    it's not the staff of life  right  Bread is the staff of life. But dough is what we're working with  and we take that dough to the oven  and it goes into the oven. As soon as the interior temperature of that dough crosses the threshold of     degrees  it passes what we call the  thermal death point.  Students love that TDP. They think it's the name of a video game. But it's the thermal death point    all life ceases there. The yeast  whose mission it has been up till now to raise the dough  to enliven it  to vivify it  in order to complete its mission  which is also to turn this dough into bread  has to give up its life. So you see the symbolism at work  It's starting to come forth a little bit  you know. It's starting to make sense to me    what goes in is dough  what comes out is bread    or it goes in alive  comes out dead. Third transformation. First transformation  alive to dead. Second transformation  dead brought back to life. Third transformation  alive to dead    but dough to bread. Or another analogy would be  a caterpillar has been turned into a butterfly. And it's what comes out of the oven that is what we call the staff of life. This is the product that everyone in the world eats  that is so difficult to give up. It's so deeply embedded in our psyches that bread is used as a symbol for life. It's used as a symbol for transformation. And so  as we get to stage    and we partake of that  again completing the life cycle  you know  we have a chance to essentially ingest that    it nurtures us  and we continue to carry on and have opportunities to ponder things like this. So this is what I've learned from bread. This is what bread has taught me in my journey. And what we're going to attempt to do with this bread here  again  is to use  in addition to everything we talked about  this bread we're going to call  spent grain bread  because  as you know  bread making is very similar to beer making. Beer is basically liquid bread  or bread is solid beer. And    they    they're invented around the same time. I think beer came first. And the Egyptian who was tending the beer fell asleep in the hot  Egyptian sun  and it turned into bread. But we've got this bread  and what I did here is to try to  again  evoke even more flavor from this grain  was we've added into it the spent grain from beer making. And if you make this bread  you can use any kind of spent grain from any type of beer. I like dark spent grain. Today we're using a light spent grain that's actually from  like  some kind of a lager of some sort    a light lager or an ale    that is wheat and barley that's been toasted. In other words  the beer maker knows also how to evoke flavor from the grains by using sprouting and malting and roasting. We're going to take some of that  and put it into the bread. So now we not only have a high fiber bread  but now fiber on top of fiber. And so this is  again  hopefully not only a healthy bread  but a bread that you will enjoy. So  if I  kind of  break this bread  maybe we can share this now a little bit here. We'll start a little piece here  and I'm going to take a little piece here    I think I'd better taste it myself before you have it at lunch. I'll leave you with what I call the baker's blessing. May your crust be crisp  and your bread always rise. Thank you. I'm going to talk about a very fundamental change that is going on in the very fabric of the modern economy. And to talk about that  I'm going to go back to the beginning  because in the beginning were commodities. Commodities are things that you grow in the ground  raise on the ground or pull out of the ground  basically  animal  mineral  vegetable. And then you extract them out of the ground  and sell them on the open marketplace. Commodities were the basis of the agrarian economy that lasted for millennia. But then along came the industrial revolution  and then goods became the predominant economic offering  where we used commodities as a raw material to be able to make or manufacture goods. So  we moved from an agrarian economy to an industrial economy. Well  what then happened over the last    or    years  is that goods have become commoditized. Commoditized  where they're treated like a commodity  where people don't care who makes them. They just care about three things and three things only  price  price and price. Now  there's an antidote to commoditization  and that is customization. My first book was called  Mass Customization     it came up a couple of times yesterday    and how I discovered this progression of economic value was realizing that customizing a good automatically turned it into a service  because it was done just for a particular person  because it wasn't inventoried  it was delivered on demand to that individual person. So  we moved from an industrial economy to a service based economy. But over the past    or    years  what's happened is that services are being commoditized as well. Long distance telephone service sold on price  price  price  fast food restaurants with all their value pricing  and even the Internet is commoditizing not just goods  but services as well. What that means is that it's time to move to a new level of economic value. Time to go beyond the goods and the services  and use  in that same heuristic  what happens when you customize a service  What happens when you design a service that is so appropriate for a particular person    that's exactly what they need at this moment in time  Then you can't help but make them go  wow   you can't help but turn it into a memorable event    you can't help but turn it into an experience. So we're shifting to an experience economy  where experiences are becoming the predominant economic offering. Now most places that I talk to  when I talk about experience  I talk about Disney    the world's premier experience stager. I talk about theme restaurants  and experiential retail  and boutique hotels  and Las Vegas    the experience capital of the world. But here  when you think about experiences  think about Thomas Dolby and his group  playing music. Think about meaningful places. Think about drinking wine  about a journey to the Clock of the Long Now. Those are all experiences. Think about TED itself. The experience capital in the world of conferences. All of these are experiences. Now  over the last several years I spent a lot of time in Europe  and particularly in the Netherlands  and whenever I talk about the experience economy there  I'm always greeted at the end with one particular question  almost invariably. And the question isn't really so much a question as an accusation. And the Dutch  when they usually put it  it always starts with the same two words. You know the words I mean  You Americans. They say  you Americans. You like your fantasy environments  your fake  your Disneyland experiences. They say  we Dutch  we like real  natural  authentic experiences. So much has that happened that I've developed a fairly praticed response  which is  I point out that first of all  you have to understand that there is no such thing as an inauthentic experience. Why  Because the experience happens inside of us. It's our reaction to the events that are staged in front of us. So  as long as we are in any sense authentic human beings  then every experience we have is authentic. Now  there may be more or less natural or artificial stimuli for the experience  but even that is a matter of degree  not kind. And there's no such thing as a     percent natural experience. Even if you go for a walk in the proverbial woods  there is a company that manufactured the car that delivered you to the edge of the woods  there's a company that manufactured the shoes that you have to protect yourself from the ground of the woods. There's a company that provides a cell phone service you have in case you get lost in the woods. Right  All of those are man made  artificiality brought into the woods by you  and by the very nature of being there. And then I always finish off by talking about    the thing that amazes me the most about this question  particularly coming from the Dutch  is that the Netherlands is every bit as manufactured as Disneyland. And the Dutch  they always go ... and they realize  I'm right  There isn't a square meter of ground in the entire country that hasn't been reclaimed from the sea  or otherwise moved  modified and manicured to look as if it had always been there. It's the only place you ever go for a walk in the woods and all the trees are lined up in rows. But nonetheless  not just the Dutch  but everyone has this desire for the authentic. And authenticity is therefore becoming the new consumer sensibility    the buying criteria by which consumers are choosing who are they going to buy from  and what they're going to buy. Becoming the basis of the economy. In fact  you can look at how each of these economies developed  that each one has their own business imperative  matched with a consumer sensibility. We're the agrarian economy  and we're supplying commodities. It's about supply and availability. Getting the commodities to market. With the industrial economy  it is about controlling costs    getting the costs down as low as possible so we can offer them to the masses. With the service economy  it is about improving quality. That has    the whole quality movement has risen with the service economy over the past    or    years. And now  with the experience economy  it's about rendering authenticity. Rendering authenticity    and the keyword is  rendering.  Right  Rendering  because you have to get your consumers    as business people    to percieve your offerings as authentic. Because there is a basic paradox  no one can have an inauthentic experience  but no business can supply one. Because all businesses are man made objects  all business is involved with money  all business is a matter of using machinery  and all those things make something inauthentic. So  how do you render authenticity  is the question. Are you rendering authenticity  When you think about that  let me go back to what Lionel Trilling  in his seminal book on authenticity   Sincerity and Authenticity     came out in         points to as the seminal point at which authenticity entered the lexicon  if you will. And that is  to no surprise  in Shakespeare  and in his play  Hamlet. And there is one part in this play  Hamlet  where the most fake of all the characters in Hamlet  Polonius  says something profoundly real. At the end of a laundry list of advice he's giving to his son  Laertes  he says this  And this above all  to thine own self be true. And it doth follow  as night the day  that thou canst not then be false to any man. And those three verses are the core of authenticity. There are two dimensions to authenticity  one  being true to yourself  which is very self directed. Two  is other directed  being what you say you are to others. And I don't know about you  but whenever I encounter two dimensions  I immediately go  ahh  two by two  All right  Anybody else like that  no  Well  if you think about that  you do  in fact  get a two by two. Where  on one dimension it's a matter of being true to yourself. As businesses  are the economic offerings you are providing    are they true to themselves  And the other dimension is  are they what they say they are to others  If not  you have   is not true to itself   and  is not what it says it is   yielding a two by two matrix. And of course  if you are both true to yourself  and are what you say you are  then you're real real  The opposite  of course  is    fake fake. All right  now  there is value for fake. There will always be companies around to supply the fake  because there will always be desire for the fake. Fact is  there's a general rule  if you don't like it  it's fake  if you do like it  it's faux. Now  the other two sides of the coin are  being a real fake    is what it says it is  but is not true to itself  or being a fake real  is true to itself  but not what it says it is. You can think about those two    you know  both of these better than being fake fake    not quite as good as being real real. You can contrast them by thinking about Universal City Walk versus Disney World  or Disneyland. Universal City Walk is a real fake    in fact  we got this very term from Ada Louise Huxtable's book   The Unreal America.  A wonderful book  where she talks about Universal City Walk as    you know  she decries the fake  but she says  at least that's a real fake  right  because you can see behind the facade  right  It is what it says it is  It's Universal Studio  it's in the city of Los Angeles  you're going to walk a lot. Right  You don't tend to walk a lot in Los Angeles  well  here's a place where you are going to walk a lot  outside in this city. But is it really true to itself  Right  Is it really in the city  Is it    you can see behind all of it  and see what is going on in the facades of it. So she calls it a real fake. Disney World  on the other hand  is a fake real  or a fake reality. Right  It's not what it says it is. It's not really the magic kingdom. But it is    oh  I'm sorry  I didn't mean to       sorry. We won't talk about Santa Claus then. But Disney World is wonderfully true to itself. Right  Just wonderfully true to itself. When you are there you are just immersed in this wonderful environment. So  it's a fake real. Now the easiest way to fall down in this  and not be real real  right  the easiest way not to be true to yourself is not to understand your heritage  and thereby repudiate that heritage. Right  the key of being true to yourself is knowing who you are as a business. Knowing where your heritage is  what you have done in the past. And what you have done in the past limits what you can do  what you can get away with  essentially  in the future. So  you have to understand that past. Think about Disney again. Disney     or    years ago  right  the Disney    the company that is probably best known for family values out there  Disney bought the ABC network. The ABC network  affectionately known in the trade as the T A network  right    that's not too much jargon  is it  Right  the T A network. Then it bought Miramax  known for its NC    fare  and all of a sudden  families everywhere couldn't really trust what they were getting from Disney. It was no longer true to its heritage  no longer true to Walt Disney. That's one of the reasons why they're having such trouble today  and why Roy Disney is out to get Michael Eisner. Because it is no longer true to itself. So  understand what    your past limits what you can do in the future. When it comes to being what you say you are  the easiest mistake that companies make is that they advertise things that they are not. That's when you're perceived as fake  as a phony company    advertizing things that you're not. Think about any hotel  any airline  any hospital. Right  if you could check into the ads  you'd have a great experience. But unfortunately  you have to experience the actual hotel  airline and hospital  and then you have that disconnect. Then you have that perception that you are phony. So  the number one thing to do when it comes to being what you say you are  is to provide places for people to experience who you are. For people to experience who you are. Right  it's not advertising does it. That's why you have companies like Starbucks  right  that doesn't advertise at all. They said  you want to know who we are  you have to come experience us. And think about the economic value they have provided by that experience. Right  Coffee  at its core  is what  Right  It's beans  right  It's coffee beans. You know how much coffee is worth  when treated as a commodity as a bean  Two or three cents per cup    that's what coffee is worth. But grind it  roast it  package it  put it on a grocery store shelf  and now it'll cost five         cents  when you treat it as a good. Take that same good  and perform the service of actually brewing it for a customer  in a corner diner  in a bodega  a kiosk somewhere  you get    cents  maybe a buck per cup of coffee. But surround the brewing of that coffee with the ambiance of a Starbucks  with the authentic cedar that goes inside of there  and now  because of that authentic experience  you can charge two  three  four  five dollars for a cup of coffee. So  authenticity is becoming the new consumer sensibility. Let me summarize it  for the business people in the audience  with three rules  three basic rules. One  don't say you're authentic unless you really are authentic. Two  it's easier to be authentic if you don't say you're authentic. And three  if you say you're authentic  you better be authentic. And then for the consumers  for everyone else in the audience  let me simply summarize it by saying  increasingly  what we    what will make us happy  is spending our time and our money satisfying the desire for authenticity. Thank you. My work is play. And I play when I design. I even looked it up in the dictionary  to make sure that I actually do that  and the definition of play  number one  was engaging in a childlike activity or endeavor  and number two was gambling. And I realize I do both when I'm designing. I'm both a kid and I'm gambling all the time. And I think that if you're not  there's probably something inherently wrong with the structure or the situation you're in  if you're a designer. But the serious part is what threw me  and I couldn't quite get a handle on it until I remembered an essay. And it's an essay I read    years ago. It was written by Russell Baker  who used to write an  Observer  column in the New York Times. He's a wonderful humorist. And I'm going to read you this essay  or an excerpt from it because it really hit home for me. Here is a letter of friendly advice. Be serious  it says. What it means  of course  is  be solemn. Being solemn is easy. Being serious is hard. Children almost always begin by being serious  which is what makes them so entertaining when compared with adults as a class. Adults  on the whole  are solemn. In politics  the rare candidate who is serious  like Adlai Stevenson  is easily overwhelmed by one who is solemn  like Eisenhower. That's because it is hard for most people to recognize seriousness  which is rare  but more comfortable to endorse solemnity  which is commonplace. Jogging  which is commonplace  and widely accepted as good for you  is solemn. Poker is serious. Washington  D.C. is solemn. New York is serious. Going to educational conferences to tell you anything about the future is solemn. Taking a long walk by yourself  during which you devise a foolproof scheme for robbing Tiffany's  is serious. Now  when I apply Russell Baker's definition of solemnity or seriousness to design  it doesn't necessarily make any particular point about quality. Solemn design is often important and very effective design. Solemn design is also socially correct  and is accepted by appropriate audiences. It's what right thinking designers and all the clients are striving for. Serious design  serious play  is something else. For one thing  it often happens spontaneously  intuitively  accidentally or incidentally. It can be achieved out of innocence  or arrogance  or out of selfishness  sometimes out of carelessness. But mostly  it's achieved through all those kind of crazy parts of human behavior that don't really make any sense. Serious design is imperfect. It's filled with the kind of craft laws that come from something being the first of its kind. Serious design is also    often    quite unsuccessful from the solemn point of view. That's because the art of serious play is about invention  change  rebellion    not perfection. Perfection happens during solemn play. Now  I always saw design careers like surreal staircases. If you look at the staircase  you'll see that in your   s the risers are very high and the steps are very short  and you make huge discoveries. You sort of leap up very quickly in your youth. That's because you don't know anything and you have a lot to learn  and so that anything you do is a learning experience and you're just jumping right up there. As you get older  the risers get shallower and the steps get wider  and you start moving along at a slower pace because you're making fewer discoveries. And as you get older and more decrepit  you sort of inch along on this sort of depressing  long staircase  leading you into oblivion. I find it's actually getting really hard to be serious. I'm hired to be solemn  but I find more and more that I'm solemn when I don't have to be. And in my    years of working experience  I think I was really serious four times. And I'm going to show them to you now  because they came out of very specific conditions. It's great to be a kid. Now  when I was in my early   s  I worked in the record business  designing record covers for CBS Records  and I had no idea what a great job I had. I thought everybody had a job like that. And what    the way I looked at design and the way I looked at the world was  what was going on around me and the things that came at the time I walked into design were the enemy. I really  really  really hated the typeface Helvetica. I thought the typeface Helvetica was the cleanest  most boring  most fascistic  really repressive typeface  and I hated everything that was designed in Helvetica. And when I was in my college days  this was the sort of design that was fashionable and popular. This is actually quite a lovely book jacket by Rudy de Harak  but I just hated it  because it was designed with Helvetica  and I made parodies about it. I just thought it was  you know  completely boring. So    so  my goal in life was to do stuff that wasn't made out of Helvetica. And to do stuff that wasn't made out of Helvetica was actually kind of hard because you had to find it. And there weren't a lot of books about the history of design in the early   s. There weren't    there wasn't a plethora of design publishing. You actually had to go to antique stores. You had to go to Europe. You had to go places and find the stuff. And what I responded to was  you know  Art Nouveau  or deco  or Victorian typography  or things that were just completely not Helvetica. And I taught myself design this way  and this was sort of my early years  and I used these things in really goofy ways on record covers and in my design. I wasn't educated. I just sort of put these things together. I mixed up Victorian designs with pop  and I mixed up Art Nouveau with something else. And I made these very lush  very elaborate record covers  not because I was being a post modernist or a historicist    because I didn't know what those things were. I just hated Helvetica. And that kind of passion drove me into very serious play  a kind of play I could never do now because I'm too well educated. And there's something wonderful about that form of youth  where you can let yourself grow and play  and be really a brat  and then accomplish things. By the end of the '  s  actually  the stuff became known. I mean  these covers appeared all over the world  and they started winning awards  and people knew them. And I was suddenly a post modernist  and I began a career as    in my own business. And first I was praised for it  then criticized for it  but the fact of the matter was  I had become solemn. I didn't do what I think was a piece of serious work again for about    years. I spent most of the '  s being quite solemn  turning out these sorts of designs that I was expected to do because that's who I was  and I was living in this cycle of going from serious to solemn to hackneyed to dead  and getting rediscovered all over again. So  here was the second condition for which I think I accomplished some serious play. There's a Paul Newman movie that I love called  The Verdict.  I don't know how many of you have seen it  but it's a beaut. And in the movie  he plays a down and out lawyer who's become an ambulance chaser. And he's taken on    he's given  actually    a malpractice suit to handle that's sort of an easy deal  and in the midst of trying to connect the deal  he starts to empathize and identify with his client  and he regains his morality and purpose  and he goes on to win the case. And in the depth of despair  in the midst of the movie  when it looks like he can't pull this thing off  and he needs this case  he needs to win this case so badly. There's a shot of Paul Newman alone  in his office  saying   This is the case. There are no other cases. This is the case. There are no other cases.  And in that moment of desire and focus  he can win. And that is a wonderful position to be in to create some serious play. And I had that moment in      when I met a theater director named George Wolfe  who was going to have me design an identity for the New York Shakespeare Festival  then known  and then became the Public Theater. And I began getting immersed in this project in a way I never was before. This is what theater advertising looked like at that time. This is what was in the newspapers and in the New York Times. So  this is sort of a comment on the time. And the Public Theater actually had much better advertising than this. They had no logo and no identity  but they had these very iconic posters painted by Paul Davis. And George Wolf had taken over from another director and he wanted to change the theater  and he wanted to make it urban and loud and a place that was inclusive. So  drawing on my love of typography  I immersed myself into this project. And what was different about it was the totality of it  was that I really became the voice  the visual voice  of a place in a way I had never done before  where every aspect    the smallest ad  the ticket  whatever it was    was designed by me. There was no format. There was no in house department that these things were pushed to. I literally for three years made everything    every scrap of paper  everything online  that this theater did. And it was the only job  even though I was doing other jobs. I lived and breathed it in a way I haven't with a client since. It enabled me to really express myself and grow. And I think that you know when you're going to be given this position  and it's rare  but when you get it and you have this opportunity  it's the moment of serious play. I did these things  and I still do them. I still work for the Public Theater. I'm on their board  and I still am involved with it. The high point of the Public Theater  I think  was in       two years after I designed it  which was the  Bring in 'da Noise  Bring in 'da Funk  campaign that was all over New York. But something happened to it  and what happened to it was  it became very popular. And that is a kiss of death for something serious because it makes it solemn. And what happened was that New York City  to a degree  ate my identity because people began to copy it. Here's an ad in the New York Times somebody did for a play called  Mind Games.  Then  Chicago  came out  used similar graphics  and the Public Theater's identity was just totally eaten and taken away  which meant I had to change it. So  I changed it so that every season was different  and I continued to do these posters  but they never had the seriousness of the first identity because they were too individual  and they didn't have that heft of everything being the same thing. Now    and I think since the Public Theater  I must have done more than a dozen cultural identities for major institutions  and I don't think I ever    I ever grasped that seriousness again    I do them for very big  important institutions in New York City. The institutions are solemn  and so is the design. They're better crafted than the Public Theater was  and they spend more money on them  but I think that that moment comes and goes. The best way to accomplish serious design    which I think we all have the opportunity to do    is to be totally and completely unqualified for the job. That doesn't happen very often  but it happened to me in the year       when for some reason or another  a whole pile of different architects started to ask me to design the insides of theaters with them  where I would take environmental graphics and work them into buildings. I'd never done this kind of work before. I didn't know how to read an architectural plan  I didn't know what they were talking about  and I really couldn't handle the fact that a job    a single job    could go on for four years because I was used to immediacy in graphic design  and that kind of attention to detail was really bad for somebody like me  with ADD. So  it was a rough    it was a rough go  but I fell in love with this process of actually integrating graphics into architecture because I didn't know what I was doing. I said   Why can't the signage be on the floor   New Yorkers look at their feet. And then I found that actors and actresses actually take their cues from the floor  so it turned out that these sorts of sign systems began to make sense. They integrated with the building in really peculiar ways. They ran around corners  they went up sides of buildings  and they melded into the architecture. This is Symphony Space on   th Street and Broadway  and the type is interwoven into the stainless steel and backlit with fiber optics. And the architect  Jim Polshek  essentially gave me a canvas to play typography out on. And it was serious play. This is the children's museum in Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania  made out of completely inexpensive materials. Extruded typography that's backlit with neon. Things I never did before  built before. I just thought they'd be kind of fun to do. Donors' walls made out of Lucite. And then  inexpensive signage. I think my favorite of these was this little job in Newark  New Jersey. It's a performing arts school. This is the building that    they had no money  and they had to recast it  and they said  if we give you         dollars  what can you do with it  And I did a little Photoshop job on it  and I said  Well  I think we can paint it. And we did. And it was play. And there's the building. Everything was painted    typography over the whole damn thing  including the air conditioning ducts. I hired guys who paint flats fixed on the sides of garages to do the painting on the building  and they loved it. They got into it    they took the job incredibly seriously. They used to climb up on the building and call me and tell me that they had to correct my typography    that my spacing was wrong  and they moved it  and they did wonderful things with it. They were pretty serious  too. It was quite wonderful. By the time I did Bloomberg's headquarters my work had begun to become accepted. People wanted it in big  expensive places. And that began to make it solemn. Bloomberg was all about numbers  and we did big numbers through the space and the numbers were projected on a spectacular LED that my partner  Lisa Strausfeld  programmed. But it became the end of the seriousness of the play  and it started to  once again  become solemn. This is a current project in Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania  where I got to be goofy. I was invited to design a logo for this neighborhood  called the North Side  and I thought it was silly for a neighborhood to have a logo. I think that's rather creepy  actually. Why would a neighborhood have a logo  A neighborhood has a thing    it's got a landmark  it's got a place  it's got a restaurant. It doesn't have a logo. I mean  what would that be  So I had to actually give a presentation to a city council and neighborhood constituents  and I went to Pittsburgh and I said   You know  really what you have here are all these underpasses that separate the neighborhood from the center of town. Why don't you celebrate them  and make the underpasses landmarks   So I began doing this crazy presentation of these installations    potential installations    on these underpass bridges  and stood up in front of the city council    and was a little bit scared  I have to admit. But I was so utterly unqualified for this project  and so utterly ridiculous  and ignored the brief so desperately that I think they just embraced it with wholeheartedness  just completely because it was so goofy to begin with. And this is the bridge they're actually painting up and preparing as we speak. It will change every six months  and it will become an art installation in the North Side of Pittsburgh  and it will probably become a landmark in the area. John Hockenberry told you a bit about my travail with Citibank  that is now a    year relationship  and I still work with them. And I actually am amused by them and like them  and think that as a very  very  very  very  very big corporation they actually keep their graphics very nice. I drew the logo for Citibank on a napkin in the first meeting. That was the play part of the job. And then I spent a year going to long  tedious  boring meetings  trying to sell this logo through to a huge corporation to the point of tears. I thought I was going to go crazy at the end of this year. We made idiotic presentations showing how the Citi logo made sense  and how it was really derived from an umbrella  and we made animations of these things  and we came back and forth and back and forth and back and forth. And it was worth it  because they bought this thing  and it played out on such a grand scale  and it's so internationally recognizable  but for me it was actually a very  very depressing year. As a matter of fact  they actually never bought onto the logo until Fallon put it on its very good  Live Richly  campaign  and then everybody accepted it all over the world. So during this time I needed some kind of counterbalance for this crazy  crazy existence of going to these long  idiotic meetings. And I was up in my country house  and for some reason  I began painting these very big  very involved  laborious  complicated maps of the entire world  and listing every place on the planet  and putting them in  and misspelling them  and putting things in the wrong spot  and completely controlling the information  and going totally and completely nuts with it. They would take me about six months initially  but then I started getting faster at it. Here's the United States. Every single city of the United States is on here. And it hung for about eight months at the Cooper Hewitt  and people walked up to it  and they would point to a part of the map and they'd say   Oh  I've been here.  And  of course  they couldn't have been because it's in the wrong spot. But what I liked about it was  I was controlling my own idiotic information  and I was creating my own palette of information  and I was totally and completely at play. One of my favorites was this painting I did of Florida after the      election that has the election results rolling around in the water. I keep that for evidence. Somebody was up at my house and saw the paintings and recommended them to a gallery  and I had a first show about two and a half years ago  and I showed these paintings that I'm showing you now. And then a funny thing happened    they sold. And they sold quickly  and became rather popular. We started making prints from them. This is Manhattan  one from the series. This is a print from the United States which we did in red  white and blue. We began doing these big silkscreen prints  and they started selling  too. So  the gallery wanted me to have another show in two years  which meant that I really had to paint these paintings much faster than I had ever done them. And I    they started to become more political  and I picked areas that sort of were in the news or that I had some feeling about  and I began doing these things. And then this funny thing happened. I found that I was no longer at play. I was actually in this solemn landscape of fulfilling an expectation for a show  which is not where I started with these things. So  while they became successful  I know how to make them  so I'm not a neophyte  and they're no longer serious    they have become solemn. And that's a terrifying factor    when you start something and it turns that way    because it means that all that's left for you is to go back and to find out what the next thing is that you can push  that you can invent  that you can be ignorant about  that you can be arrogant about  that you can fail with  and that you can be a fool with. Because in the end  that's how you grow  and that's all that matters. So  I'm plugging along here    and I'm just going to have to blow up the staircase. Thank you very much. I had requested slides  kind of adamantly  up till the    pretty much  last few days  but was denied access to a slide projector. I actually find them a lot more emotional       and personal  and the neat thing about a slide projector is you can actually focus the work  unlike PowerPoint and some other programs. Now  I agree that you have to    yeah  there are certain concessions and  you know  if you use a slide projector  you're not able to have the bad type swing in from the back or the side  or up or down  but maybe that's an O.K. trade off  to trade that off for a focus. It's a thought. Just a thought. And there's something nice about slides getting stuck. And the thing you really hope for is occasionally they burn up  which we won't see tonight. So. With that  let's get the first slide up here. This  as many of you have probably guessed  is a recently emptied beer can in Portugal. This    I had just arrived in Barcelona for the first time  and I thought    you know  fly all night  I looked up  and I thought  wow  how clean. You come into this major airport  and they simply have a B. I mean  how nice is that  Everything's gotten simpler in design  and here's this mega airport  and God  I just    I took a picture. I thought  God  that is the coolest thing I've ever seen at an airport. Till a couple months later  I went back to the same airport    same plane  I think    and looked up  and it said C. It was only then that I realized it was simply a gate that I was coming into. I'm a big believer in the emotion of design  and the message that's sent before somebody begins to read  before they get the rest of the information  what is the emotional response they get to the product  to the story  to the painting    whatever it is. That area of design interests me the most  and I think this for me is a real clear  very simplified version of what I'm talking about. These are a couple of garage doors painted identical  situated next to each other. So  here's the first door. You know  you get the message. You know  it's pretty clear. Take a look at the second door and see if there's any different message. O.K.  which one would you park in front of  Same color  same message  same words. The only thing that's different is the expression that the individual door owner here put into the piece    and  again  which is the psycho killer here  Yet it doesn't say that  it doesn't need to say that. I would probably park in front of the other one. I'm sure a lot of you are aware that graphic design has gotten a lot simpler in the last five years or so. It's gotten so simple that it's already starting to kind of come back the other way again and get a little more expressive. But I was in Milan and saw this street sign  and was very happy to see that apparently this idea of minimalism has even been translated by the graffiti artist. And this graffiti artist has come along  made this sign a little bit better  and then moved on. He didn't overpower it like they have a tendency to do. This is for a book by  Metropolis.  I took some photos  and this is a billboard in Florida  and either they hadn't paid their rent  or they didn't want to pay their rent again on the sign  and the billboard people were too cheap to tear the whole sign down  so they just teared out sections of it. And I would argue that it's possibly more effective than the original billboard in terms of getting your attention  getting you to look over that way. And hopefully you don't stop and buy those awful pecan things    Stuckey's. This is from my second book. The first book is called   The End of Print   and it was done along with a film  working with William Burroughs. And  The End of Print  is now in its fifth printing. When I first contacted William Burroughs about being part of it  he said no  he said he didn't believe it was the end of print. And I said  well  that's fine  I just would love to have your input on this film and this book  and he finally agreed to it. And at the end of the film  he says in this great voice that I can't mimic but I'll kind of try  but not really  he says   I remember attending an exhibition called  'Photography  The End of Painting.'  And then he says   And  of course  it wasn't at all.  So  apparently when photography was perfected  there were people going around saying  that's it  you've just ruined painting. People are just going to take pictures now. And of course  that wasn't the case. So  this is from   nd Sight   a book I did on intuition. I think it's not the only ingredient in design  but possibly the most important. It's something everybody has. It's not a matter of teaching it  in fact  most of the schools tend to discount intuition as an ingredient of your working process because they can't quantify it  it's very hard to teach people the four steps to intuitive design  but we can teach you the four steps to a nice business card or a newsletter. So it tends to get discounted. This is a quote from Albert Einstein  who says   The intellect has little to do on the road to discovery. There comes a leap in consciousness    call it intuition or what you will    and the solution just comes to you  and you don't know from where or why.  So  it's kind of like when somebody says  Who did that song  And the more you try to think about it  the further the answer gets from you  and the minute you stop thinking about it  your intuition gives you that answer  in a sense. I like this for a couple of reasons. If you've had any design courses  they would teach you you can't read this. I think you eventually can and  more importantly  I think it's true.  Don't mistake legibility for communication.  Just because something's legible doesn't means it communicates. More importantly  it doesn't mean it communicates the right thing. So  what is the message sent before somebody actually gets into the material  And I think that's sometimes an overlooked area. This is working with Marshall McLuhan. I stayed and worked with his wife and son  Eric  and we came up with close to     quotes from Marshall that are just amazing in terms of being ahead of the times  predicting so much of what has happened in the advertising  television  media world. And so this book is called  Probes.  It's another word for quotes. And it's    a lot of them are never    have never been published before  and basically  I've interpreted the different quotes. So  this was the contents page originally. When I got done it was     pages  and then the publisher  Gingko Press  ended up cutting it down considerably  it's just under     pages now. But I decided I liked this contents page    I liked the way it looks    so I kept it. It now has no relevance to the book whatsoever  but it's a nice spread  I think  in there. So  a couple spreads from the book  here McLuhan says   The new media are not bridges between Man and Nature  they are Nature.   The invention of printing did away with anonymity  fostering ideas of literary fame and the habit of considering intellectual effort as private property   which had never been done before printing.  When new technologies impose themselves on societies long habituated to older technologies  anxieties of all kinds result.   While people are engaged in creating a totally different world  they always form vivid images of the preceding world.  I hate this stuff. It's hard to read.  People in the electronic age have no possible environment except the globe  and no possible occupation except information gathering.  That was it. That's all he saw as the options. And not too far off. So  this is a project for Nine Inch Nails. And I only show it because it seemed like it got all this relevancy all of a sudden  and it was done right after     . And I had recently discovered a bomb shelter in the backyard of a house I had bought in LA that the real estate person hadn't pointed out. There was some bomb shelter built  apparently in the '  s Cuban missile crisis. And I asked the real estate guy what it was as we were walking by  and he goes   It's something to do with the sewage system.  I was  O.K.  that's fine. I finally went down there  and it was this old rusted circular thing  and two beds  and very kind of creepy and weird. And also  surprisingly  it was done in kind of a cheap metal  and it had completely rusted through  and water everywhere  and spiders. And I thought  you know  what were they thinking  You'd think maybe cement  possibly  or something. But anyway  I used this for a cover for the Nine Inch Nails DVD  and I've also now fixed the bomb shelter with duct tape  and it's ready. I think I'm ready. So. This is an experiment  really  for a client  Quicksilver  where we were taking what was a six shot sequence and trying to use print as a medium to get people to the Web. So  this is a six shot sequence. I've taken one shot  I cropped it a few different ways. And then the tiny line of copy says  If you want to see this entire sequence    how this whole ride was    go to the website. And my guess is that a lot of the surf kids did go to the site to get this entire picture. Got no way of tracking it  so I could be totally wrong. I don't have the site. It's just the piece itself. This is a group in New York called the Coalition for a Smoke free Environment    asked me to do these posters. They were wild posted around New York City. You can't really    well  you can't see it at all    but the second line is really the more kind of payoff  in a sense. It says   If the cigarette companies can lie  then so can we.  But       but I did. These were literally wild posted all over New York one night  and there were definitely some heads turning  you know  people smoking and   Huh   And it was purposely done to look fairly serious. It wasn't some  you know  weird grunge type or something  it looked like they might be real. Anyway. Poster for Atlantic Center for the Arts  a school in Florida. This amazes me. This is a product I just found out. I was in the Caribbean at Christmas  and I'm just blown away that in this day and age they will still sell    not that they will sell    that there is felt a need for people to lighten the color of their skin. This was either an old product with new packaging  or a brand new package  and I just thought  Yikes  How's that still happening  I do a lot of workshops all over the world  really  and this particular assignment was to come up with new symbols for the restroom doors. I felt this was one of the more successful solutions. The students actually cut them up and put them up around bars and restaurants that night  and I just always have this vision of this elderly couple going to use the restroom ... I did some work for Microsoft a few years back. It was a worldwide branding campaign. And it was interesting to me    my background is in sociology  I had no design training  and sometimes people say  well  that explains it    but it was a very interesting experiment because there's no product that I had to sell  it was simply the image of Microsoft they were trying to improve. They thought some people didn't like them. I found out that's very true  working on this campaign worldwide. And our goal was to try to humanize them a bit  and what I did was add type and people to the ad  which the previous campaign had not had  and nobody remembered them  and nobody referenced them. And we were trying to say that  hey  some of these guys that work there are actually OK  some of them actually have friends and family  and they're not all awful people. And the umbrella campaign was  Thank God it's Monday.  So  we tried to take this    what was perceived as a negative  their over competitiveness  their  you know  long working hours    and turn it into a positive and not run from it. You know  Thank God it's Monday    I get to go back to that little cubicle  those fake gray walls  and hear everybody else's conversations f or    hours and then go home. But anyway  this is one of the ads I was most pleased with  because they were all elaborately art directed  and this one I thought actually felt like the girl was looking at the computer. It says   Wonder Around.  And then it's a piece of the software. And this is how the ad ran around the world. In Germany  they made one small change without checking with me    nor did they have to  because it was done through agencies    but see if you can tell the difference. This is how the ad ran throughout the world  Germany made one slight change in the ad. Now  there's kind of two issues here. If you're going to put a kid in the ad  pick one that looks alive. I just have a feeling this kid's been there for a week  you know. He's just really hoping that boots up and  you know ... And then as the agency explained to me  they said   Look  we don't have little green people in our country  why would we put little green people in our ads  for instance   So  I understand their logic. I totally disagree with it  I think it's a very small minded approach  the world is certainly much more global  and I certainly think the people of Germany could have handled a little black girl sitting in front of a computer  though we'll never know. This is some work from Ray Gun. And the point of this magazine was to read the articles  listen to the music  and try to interpret it. There's no grid  there's no system  there's nothing set up in advance. This is an opener for Brian Eno  and it's just kind of my personal interpretation of the music. This is rockstars talking about teachers they had lusted after in school. There's a lot of great writing in  Ray Gun.  And I was fortunate to find a photograph of a teacher sitting on some books. Article on Bryan Ferry    just really boring article    so I set the whole article in Dingbat. You could    you could highlight it  you could make it Helvetica or something  it is the actual article. I suppose you could eventually decode it  but it's really not very well written  it really wouldn't be worthwhile. Having done a lot of magazines  I'm very curious how big magazines handle big stories  and I was very curious to see how Time and Newsweek would handle     . And I was basically pretty disappointed to see that they had chosen to show the photo we'd already seen a million times  which was basically the moment of impact. And People magazine  I thought  got probably the best shot. It's kind of horsey type  but the texture    the second plane not quite hitting  there was something more enticing  if that's the right    it's not the right word    but in this cover than Time or Newsweek. But when I got into this magazine  there's something kind of disturbing  and this continued. On the left we see people dying  we see people running for their lives. And on the right we learn that there's a new way to support your breast. The coveted right hand page was not given up to the whole issue. Look at the image of this lady    who knows what she's going through     and the copy says   He knows just how to give me goosebumps.  Yeah  he jumps out of buildings. It's    unfortunately  this one works  kind of  as a spread. And this continued through the entire magazine. It did not let up. This says   One clean fits all.  . There were a lot of orphans made this day  and here's a dead body being brought out. It just seems to me possibly even a blank page would have been more appropriate. And this one I think is possibly the worst  two ladies  both facing the same way  both wearing jeans. One    who knows what she's going through  the other one is worried about model behavior and milk. And    I gave a talk in New York a couple months after this  and afterwards somebody came up to me and they said that    they actually emailed me    and they said that they appreciated the talk  and when they got back to their car  they found a note on their car that made them think maybe New York was getting back to being New York again after this event    it had been a few months. This was what they found on their car. There's very few times you'd be happy to find this on your car  but it did seem to indicate that we were coming back. This is my desktop. Somebody told me today there was this thing called folders  but I don't know what they are. These are my notes for the talk    there might be a correlation here. We are wrapping up. This I saw on the plane  flying in  for hot new products. I'm not sure this is an improvement  or a good idea  because  like  if you don't spend quite enough time in front of your computer  you can now get a plate in the keyboard  so there's no more faking it    that you don't really sit at your desk all day and eat and work anyway. Now there's a plate  and it would be really  really convenient to get a piece of pizza  then type a little bit  then ... I'm just not sure this is improvement. If you ever doubt the power of graphic design  this is a very generic sign that literally says   Vote for Hitler.  It says nothing else. And this to me is an extreme case of the power of emotion  of graphic design  even though  in fact  was a very generic poster at the time. What's next  What's next is going to be people. As we get more technically driven  the importance of people becomes more than it's ever been before. You have to utilize who you are in your work. Nobody else can do that  nobody else can pull from your background  from your parents  your upbringing  your whole life experience. If you allow that to happen  it's really the only way you can do some unique work  and you're going to enjoy the work a lot more as well. This is    I like found art  hand lettering's coming back in a big way  and I thought this was a great example of both. This lady's advertising for her lost pit bull. It's friendly    she's underlined friendly    that's probably why she calls it Hercules or Hercles. She can't spell. But more importantly  she's willing to give you    bucks to go find this lost pit bull. And I'm thinking  yeah  right  I'll go look for a lost pit bill for    bucks. I have visions of people going down alleyways yelling out for Hercles  and you get charged by this thing and you go  oh  please be Hercles  please be the friendly one. I'm sure she never found the dog  because I took the sign. But I was asked to give a talk at a conference in Sacramento a few years back. And the theme was courage  and they asked me to talk about how courageous it is to be a graphic designer. And I remembered seeing this photograph of my father  who was a test pilot  and he told me that when you signed up to become a test pilot  they told you that there was a    to    percent chance of death on the job. That's pretty high for most occupations. But  you know  the government would make a plane  they'd say  go see if that one flies  would you  Some of them did  some of them didn't. And I started thinking about some of these decisions I have to make between  like  serif versus san serif. And for the most part  they're not real life threatening. Why not experiment  Why not have some fun  Why not put some of yourself into the work  And when I was teaching  I used to always ask the students  What's the definition of a good job  And as teachers  after you get all the answers  you like to give them the correct answer. And the best one I've heard    I'm sure some of you have heard this    the definition of a good job is  If you could afford to    if money wasn't an issue    would you be doing that same work  And if you would  you've got a great job. And if you wouldn't  what the heck are you doing  You're going to be dead a really long time. Thank you very much. The future that we will create can be a future that we'll be proud of. I think about this every day  it's quite literally my job. I'm co founder and senior columnist at Worldchanging.com. Alex Steffen and I founded Worldchanging in late       and since then we and our growing global team of contributors have documented the ever expanding variety of solutions that are out there  right now and on the near horizon. In a little over two years  we've written up about       items    replicable models  technological tools  emerging ideas    all providing a path to a future that's more sustainable  more equitable and more desirable. Our emphasis on solutions is quite intentional. There are tons of places to go  online and off  if what you want to find is the latest bit of news about just how quickly our hell bound handbasket is moving. We want to offer people an idea of what they can do about it. We focus primarily on the planet's environment  but we also address issues of global development  international conflict  responsible use of emerging technologies  even the rise of the so called Second Superpower and much  much more. The scope of solutions that we discuss is actually pretty broad  but that reflects both the range of challenges that need to be met and the kinds of innovations that will allow us to do so. A quick sampling really can barely scratch the surface  but to give you a sense of what we cover  tools for rapid disaster relief  such as this inflatable concrete shelter  innovative uses of bioscience  such as a flower that changes color in the presence of landmines  ultra high efficiency designs for homes and offices  distributed power generation using solar power  wind power  ocean power  other clean energy sources  ultra  ultra high efficiency vehicles of the future  ultra high efficiency vehicles you can get right now  and better urban design  so you don't need to drive as much in the first place  bio mimetic approaches to design that take advantage of the efficiencies of natural models in both vehicles and buildings  distributed computing projects that will help us model the future of the climate. Also  a number of the topics that we've been talking about this week at TED are things that we've addressed in the past on Worldchanging  cradle to cradle design  MIT's Fab Labs  the consequences of extreme longevity  the One Laptop per Child project  even Gapminder. As a born in the mid     s Gen X er  hurtling all too quickly to my fortieth birthday  I'm naturally inclined to pessimism. But working at Worldchanging has convinced me  much to my own surprise  that successful responses to the world's problems are nonetheless possible. Moreover  I've come to realize that focusing only on negative outcomes can really blind you to the very possibility of success. As Norwegian social scientist Evelin Lindner has observed   Pessimism is a luxury of good times ... In difficult times  pessimism is a self fulfilling  self inflicted death sentence.  The truth is  we can build a better world  and we can do so right now. We have the tools  we saw a hint of that a moment ago  and we're coming up with new ones all the time. We have the knowledge  and our understanding of the planet improves every day. Most importantly  we have the motive  we have a world that needs fixing  and nobody's going to do it for us. Many of the solutions that I and my colleagues seek out and write up every day have some important aspects in common  transparency  collaboration  a willingness to experiment  and an appreciation of science    or  more appropriately  science  The majority of models  tools and ideas on Worldchanging encompass combinations of these characteristics  so I want to give you a few concrete examples of how these principles combine in world changing ways. We can see world changing values in the emergence of tools to make the invisible visible    that is  to make apparent the conditions of the world around us that would otherwise be largely imperceptible. We know that people often change their behavior when they can see and understand the impact of their actions. As a small example  many of us have experienced the change in driving behavior that comes from having a real time display of mileage showing precisely how one's driving habits affect the vehicle's efficiency. The last few years have all seen the rise of innovations in how we measure and display aspects of the world that can be too big  or too intangible  or too slippery to grasp easily. Simple technologies  like wall mounted devices that display how much power your household is using  and what kind of results you'll get if you turn off a few lights    these can actually have a direct positive impact on your energy footprint. Community tools  like text messaging  that can tell you when pollen counts are up or smog levels are rising or a natural disaster is unfolding  can give you the information you need to act in a timely fashion. Data rich displays like maps of campaign contributions  or maps of the disappearing polar ice caps  allow us to better understand the context and the flow of processes that affect us all. We can see world changing values in research projects that seek to meet the world's medical needs through open access to data and collaborative action. Now  some people emphasize the risks of knowledge enabled dangers  but I'm convinced that the benefits of knowledge enabled solutions are far more important. For example  open access journals  like the Public Library of Science  make cutting edge scientific research free to all    everyone in the world. And actually  a growing number of science publishers are adopting this model. Last year  hundreds of volunteer biology and chemistry researchers around the world worked together to sequence the genome of the parasite responsible for some of the developing world's worst diseases  African sleeping sickness  leishmaniasis and Chagas disease. That genome data can now be found on open access genetic data banks around the world  and it's an enormous boon to researchers trying to come up with treatments. But my favorite example has to be the global response to the SARS epidemic in             which relied on worldwide access to the full gene sequence of the SARS virus. The U.S. National Research Council in its follow up report on the outbreak specifically cited this open availability of the sequence as a key reason why the treatment for SARS could be developed so quickly. And we can see world changing values in something as humble as a cell phone. I can probably count on my fingers the number of people in this room who do not use a mobile phone    and where is Aubrey  because I know he doesn't  For many of us  cell phones have really become almost an extension of ourselves  and we're really now beginning to see the social changes that mobile phones can bring about. You may already know some of the big picture aspects  globally  more camera phones were sold last year than any other kind of camera  and a growing number of people live lives mediated through the lens  and over the network    and sometimes enter history books. In the developing world  mobile phones have become economic drivers. A study last year showed a direct correlation between the growth of mobile phone use and subsequent GDP increases across Africa. In Kenya  mobile phone minutes have actually become an alternative currency. The political aspects of mobile phones can't be ignored either  from text message swarms in Korea helping to bring down a government  to the Blairwatch Project in the UK  keeping tabs on politicians who try to avoid the press. And it's just going to get more wild. Pervasive  always on networks  high quality sound and video  even devices made to be worn instead of carried in the pocket  will transform how we live on a scale that few really appreciate. It's no exaggeration to say that the mobile phone may be among the world's most important technologies. And in this rapidly evolving context  it's possible to imagine a world in which the mobile phone becomes something far more than a medium for social interaction. I've long admired the Witness project  and Peter Gabriel told us more details about it on Wednesday  in his profoundly moving presentation. And I'm just incredibly happy to see the news that Witness is going to be opening up a Web portal to enable users of digital cameras and camera phones to send in their recordings over the Internet  rather than just hand carrying the videotape. Not only does this add a new and potentially safer avenue for documenting abuses  it opens up the program to the growing global digital generation. Now  imagine a similar model for networking environmentalists. Imagine a Web portal collecting recordings and evidence of what's happening to the planet  putting news and data at the fingertips of people of all kinds  from activists and researchers to businesspeople and political figures. It would highlight the changes that are underway  but would more importantly give voice to the people who are willing to work to see a new world  a better world  come about. It would give everyday citizens a chance to play a role in the protection of the planet. It would be  in essence  an  Earth Witness  project. Now  just to be clear  in this talk I'm using the name  Earth Witness  as part of the scenario  simply as a shorthand  for what this imaginary project could aspire to  not to piggyback on the wonderful work of the Witness organization. It could just as easily be called   Environmental Transparency Project    Smart Mobs for Natural Security     but Earth Witness is a lot easier to say. Now  many of the people who participate in Earth Witness would focus on ecological problems  human caused or otherwise  especially environmental crimes and significant sources of greenhouse gases and emissions. That's understandable and important. We need better documentation of what's happening to the planet if we're ever going to have a chance of repairing the damage. But the Earth Witness project wouldn't need to be limited to problems. In the best Worldchanging tradition  it might also serve as a showcase for good ideas  successful projects and efforts to make a difference that deserve much more visibility. Earth Witness would show us two worlds  the world we're leaving behind  and the world we're building for generations to come. And what makes this scenario particularly appealing to me is we could do it today. The key components are already widely available. Camera phones  of course  would be fundamental to the project. And for a lot of us  they're as close as we have yet to always on  widely available information tools. We may not remember to bring our digital cameras with us wherever we go  but very few of us forget our phones. You could even imagine a version of this scenario in which people actually build their own phones. Over the course of last year  open source hardware hackers have come up with multiple models for usable  Linux based mobile phones  and the Earth Phone could spin off from this kind of project. At the other end of the network  there'd be a server for people to send photos and messages to  accessible over the Web  combining a photo sharing service  social networking platforms and a collaborative filtering system. Now  you Web  .  folks in the audience know what I'm talking about  but for those of you for whom that last sentence was in a crazy moon language  I mean simply this  the online part of the Earth Witness project would be created by the users  working together and working openly. That's enough right there to start to build a compelling chronicle of what's now happening to our planet  but we could do more. An Earth Witness site could also serve as a collection spot for all sorts of data about conditions around the planet picked up by environmental sensors that attach to your cell phone. Now  you don't see these devices as add ons for phones yet  but students and engineers around the world have attached atmospheric sensors to bicycles and handheld computers and cheap robots and the backs of pigeons    that being a project that's actually underway right now at U.C. Irvine  using bird mounted sensors as a way of measuring smog forming pollution. It's hardly a stretch to imagine putting the same thing on a phone carried by a person. Now  the idea of connecting a sensor to your phone is not new  phone makers around the world offer phones that sniff for bad breath  or tell you to worry about too much sun exposure. Swedish firm Uppsala Biomedical  more seriously  makes a mobile phone add on that can process blood tests in the field  uploading the data  displaying the results. Even the Lawrence Livermore National Labs have gotten into the act  designing a prototype phone that has radiation sensors to find dirty bombs. Now  there's an enormous variety of tiny  inexpensive sensors on the market  and you can easily imagine someone putting together a phone that could measure temperature  CO  or methane levels  the presence of some biotoxins    potentially  in a few years  maybe even H N  avian flu virus. You could see that some kind of system like this would actually be a really good fit with Larry Brilliant's InSTEDD project. Now  all of this data could be tagged with geographic information and mashed up with online maps for easy viewing and analysis. And that's worth noting in particular. The impact of open access online maps over the last year or two has been simply phenomenal. Developers around the world have come up with an amazing variety of ways to layer useful data on top of the maps  from bus routes and crime statistics to the global progress of avian flu. Earth Witness would take this further  linking what you see with what thousands or millions of other people see around the world. It's kind of exciting to think about what might be accomplished if something like this ever existed. We'd have a far better    far better knowledge of what's happening on our planet environmentally than could be gathered with satellites and a handful of government sensor nets alone. It would be a collaborative  bottom up approach to environmental awareness and protection  able to respond to emerging concerns in a smart mobs kind of way    and if you need greater sensor density  just have more people show up. And most important  you can't ignore how important mobile phones are to global youth. This is a system that could put the next generation at the front lines of gathering environmental data. And as we work to figure out ways to mitigate the worst effects of climate disruption  every little bit of information matters. A system like Earth Witness would be a tool for all of us to participate in the improvement of our knowledge and  ultimately  the improvement of the planet itself. Now  as I suggested at the outset  there are thousands upon thousands of good ideas out there  so why have I spent the bulk of my time telling you about something that doesn't exist  Because this is what tomorrow could look like  bottom up  technology enabled global collaboration to handle the biggest crisis our civilization has ever faced. We can save the planet  but we can't do it alone    we need each other. Nobody's going to fix the world for us  but working together  making use of technological innovations and human communities alike  we might just be able to fix it ourselves. We have at our fingertips a cornucopia of compelling models  powerful tools  and innovative ideas that can make a meaningful difference in our planet's future. We don't need to wait for a magic bullet to save us all  we already have an arsenal of solutions just waiting to be used. There's a staggering array of wonders out there  across diverse disciplines  all telling us the same thing  success can be ours if we're willing to try. And as we say at Worldchanging  another world isn't just possible  another world is here. We just need to open our eyes. Thank you very much. What's happening in genomics  and how this revolution is about to change everything we know about the world  life  ourselves  and how we think about them. If you saw       A Space Odyssey  and you heard the boom  boom  boom  boom  and you saw the monolith  you know  that was Arthur C. Clarke's representation that we were at a seminal moment in the evolution of our species. In this case  it was picking up bones and creating a tool  using it as a tool  which meant that apes just  sort of  running around and eating and doing each other figured out they can make things if they used a tool. And that moved us to the next level. And  you know  we in the last    years in particular have seen this acceleration in knowledge and technology  and technology has bred more knowledge and given us tools. And we've seen many seminal moments. We've seen the creation of small computers in the '  s and early '  s  and who would have thought back then that every single person would not have just one computer but probably     in your home  and in not just your P.C. but in every device    in your washing machine  your cell phone. You're walking around  your car has    microprocessors. Then we go along and create the Internet and connect the world together  we flatten the world. We've seen so much change  and we've given ourselves these tools now    these high powered tools    that are allowing us to turn the lens inward into something that is common to all of us  and that is a genome. How's your genome today  Have you thought about it lately  Heard about it  at least  You probably hear about genomes these days. I thought I'd take a moment to tell you what a genome is. It's  sort of  like if you ask people  Well  what is a megabyte or megabit  And what is broadband  People never want to say  I really don't understand. So  I will tell you right off of the bat. You've heard of DNA  you probably studied a little bit in biology. A genome is really a description for  all of the DNA that is in a living organism. And one thing that is common to all of life is DNA. It doesn't matter whether you're a yeast  it doesn't matter whether you're a mouse  doesn't matter whether you're a fly  we all have DNA. The DNA is organized in words  call them  genes and chromosomes. And when Watson and Crick in the '  s first decoded this beautiful double helix that we know as the DNA molecule    very long  complicated molecule    we then started on this journey to understand that inside of that DNA is a language that determines the characteristics  our traits  what we inherit  what diseases we may get. We've also along the way discovered that this is a very old molecule  that all of the DNA in your body has been around forever  since the beginning of us  of us as creatures. There is a historical archive. Living in your genome is the history of our species  and you as an individual human being  where you're from  going back thousands and thousands and thousands of years  and that's now starting to be understood. But also  the genome is really the instruction manual. It is the program. It is the code of life. It is what makes you function  it is what makes every organism function. DNA is a very elegant molecule. It's long and it's complicated. Really all you have to know about it is that there's four letters  A  T  C  G  they represent the name of a chemical. And with these four letters  you can create a language  a language that can describe anything  and very complicated things. You know  they are generally put together in pairs  creating a word or what we call base pairs. And you would  you know  when you think about it  four letters  or the representation of four things  makes us work. And that may not sound very intuitive  but let me flip over to something else you know about  and that's computers. Look at this screen here and  you know  you see pictures and you see words  but really all there are are ones and zeros. The language of technology is binary  you've probably heard that at some point in time. Everything that happens in digital is converted  or a representation  of a one and a zero. So  when you're listening to iTunes and your favorite music  that's really just a bunch of ones and zeros playing very quickly. When you're seeing these pictures  it's all ones and zeros  and when you're talking on your telephone  your cell phone  and it's going over the network  your voice is all being turned into ones and zeros and magically whizzed around. And look at all the complex things and wonderful things we've been able to create with just a one and a zero. Well  now you ramp that up to four  and you have a lot of complexity  a lot of ways to describe mechanisms. So  let's talk about what that means. So  if you look at a human genome  they consist of  .  billion of these base pairs. That's a lot. And they mix up in all different fashions  and that makes you a human being. If you convert that to binary  just to give you a little bit of sizing  we're actually smaller than the program Microsoft Office. It's not really all that much data. I will also tell you we're at least as buggy. This here is a bug in my genome that I have struggled with for a long  long time. When you get sick  it is a bug in your genome. In fact  many  many diseases we have struggled with for a long time  like cancer  we haven't been able to cure because we just don't understand how it works at the genomic level. We are starting to understand that. So  up to this point we tried to fix it by using what I call shit against the wall pharmacology  which means  well  let's just throw chemicals at it  and maybe it's going to make it work. But if you really understand why does a cell go from normal cell to cancer  What is the code  What are the exact instructions that are making it do that  then you can go about the process of trying to fix it and figure it out. So  for your next dinner over a great bottle of wine  here's a few factoids for you. We actually have about        genes that do things. We have about a hundred          others that don't appear to function every day  but represent this archival history of how we used to work as a species going back tens of thousands of years. You might also be interested in knowing that a mouse has about the same amount of genes. They recently sequenced Pinot Noir  and it also has about        genes  so the number of genes you have may not necessarily represent the complexity or the evolutionary order of any particular species. Now  look around  just look next to your neighbor  look forward  look backward. We all look pretty different. A lot of very handsome and pretty people here  skinny  chubby  different races  cultures. We are all   .   genetically equal. It is one one hundredth of one percent of genetic material that makes the difference between any one of us. That's a tiny amount of material  but the way that ultimately expresses itself is what makes changes in humans and in all species. So  we are now able to read genomes. The first human genome took    years  three billion dollars. It was done by Dr. Craig Venter. And then James Watson's    one of the co founders of DNA    genome was done for two million dollars  and in just two months. And if you think about the computer industry and how we've gone from big computers to little ones and how they get more powerful and faster all the time  the same thing is happening with gene sequencing now  we are on the cusp of being able to sequence human genomes for about       dollars in about an hour or a half hour  you will see that happen in the next five years. And what that means is  you are going to walk around with your own personal genome on a smart card. It will be here. And when you buy medicine  you won't be buying a drug that's used for everybody. You will give your genome to the pharmacist  and your drug will be made for you and it will work much better than the ones that were    you won't have side effects. All those side effects  you know  oily residue and  you know  whatever they say in those commercials  forget about that. They're going to make all that stuff go away. What does a genome look like  Well  there it is. It is a long  long series of these base pairs. If you saw the genome for a mouse or for a human it would look no different than this  but what scientists are doing now is they're understanding what these do and what they mean. Because what Nature is doing is double clicking all the time. In other words  the first couple of sentences here  assuming this is a grape plant  make a root  make a branch  create a blossom. In a human being  down in here it could be  make blood cells  start cancer. For me it may be  every calorie you consume  you conserve  because I come from a very cold climate. For my wife  eat three times as much and you never put on any weight. It's all hidden in this code  and it's starting to be understood at breakneck pace. So  what can we do with genomes now that we can read them  now that we're starting to have the book of life  Well  there's many things. Some are exciting. Some people will find very scary. I will tell you a couple of things that will probably make you want to projectile puke on me  but that's okay. So  you know  we now can learn the history of organisms. You can do a very simple test  scrape your cheek  send it off. You can find out where your relatives come from  you can do your genealogy going back thousands of years. We can understand functionality. This is really important. We can understand  for example  why we create plaque in our arteries  what creates the starchiness inside of a grain  why does yeast metabolize sugar and produce carbon dioxide. We can also look at  at a grander scale  what creates problems  what creates disease  and how we may be able to fix them. Because we can understand this  we can fix them  make better organisms. Most importantly  what we're learning is that Nature has provided us a spectacular toolbox. The toolbox exists. An architect far better and smarter than us has given us that toolbox  and we now have the ability to use it. We are now not just reading genomes  we are writing them. This company  Synthetic Genomics  I'm involved with  created the first full synthetic genome for a little bug  a very primitive creature called Mycoplasma genitalium. If you have a UTI  you've probably    or ever had a UTI    you've come in contact with this little bug. Very simple    only has about     genes    but we were able to completely synthesize that genome. Now  you have the genome and you say to yourself  So  if I plug this synthetic genome    if I pull the old one out and plug it in    does it just boot up and live  Well  guess what. It does. Not only does it do that  if you took the genome    that synthetic genome    and you plugged it into a different critter  like yeast  you now turn that yeast into Mycoplasma. It's  sort of  like booting up a PC with a Mac O.S. software. Well  actually  you could do it the other way. So  you know  by being able to write a genome and plug it into an organism  the software  if you will  changes the hardware. And this is extremely profound. So  last year the French and Italians announced they got together and they went ahead and they sequenced Pinot Noir. The genomic sequence now exists for the entire Pinot Noir organism  and they identified  once again  about        genes. They have discovered pathways that create flavors  although it's very important to understand that those compounds that it's cranking out have to match a receptor in our genome  in our tongue  for us to understand and interpret those flavors. They've also discovered that there's a heck of a lot of activity going on producing aroma as well. They've identified areas of vulnerability to disease. They now are understanding  and the work is going on  exactly how this plant works  and we have the capability to know  to read that entire code and understand how it ticks. So  then what do you do  Knowing that we can read it  knowing that we can write it  change it  maybe write its genome from scratch. So  what do you do  Well  one thing you could do is what some people might call Franken Noir. We can build a better vine. By the way  just so you know  you get stressed out about genetically modified organisms  there is not one single vine in this valley or anywhere that is not genetically modified. They're not grown from seeds  they're grafted into root stock  they would not exist in nature on their own. So  don't worry about  don't stress about that stuff. We've been doing this forever. So  we could  you know  focus on disease resistance  we can go for higher yields without necessarily having dramatic farming techniques to do it  or costs. We could conceivably expand the climate window  we could make Pinot Noir grow maybe in Long Island  God forbid. We could produce better flavors and aromas. You want a little more raspberry  a little more chocolate here or there  All of these things could conceivably be done  and I will tell you I'd pretty much bet that it will be done. But there's an ecosystem here. In other words  we're not  sort of  unique little organisms running around  we are part of a big ecosystem. In fact    I'm sorry to inform you    that inside of your digestive tract is about    pounds of microbes which you're circulating through your body quite a bit. Our ocean's teaming with microbes  in fact  when Craig Venter went and sequenced the microbes in the ocean  in the first three months tripled the known species on the planet by discovering all new microbes in the first    feet of water. We now understand that those microbes have more impact on our climate and regulating CO  and oxygen than plants do  which we always thought oxygenate the atmosphere. We find microbial life in every part of the planet  in ice  in coal  in rocks  in volcanic vents  it's an amazing thing. But we've also discovered  when it comes to plants  in plants  as much as we understand and are starting to understand their genomes  it is the ecosystem around them  it is the microbes that live in their root systems  that have just as much impact on the character of those plants as the metabolic pathways of the plants themselves. If you take a closer look at a root system  you will find there are many  many  many diverse microbial colonies. This is not big news to viticulturists  they have been  you know  concerned with water and fertilization. And  again  this is  sort of  my notion of shit against the wall pharmacology  you know certain fertilizers make the plant more healthy so you put more in. You don't necessarily know with granularity exactly what organisms are providing what flavors and what characteristics. We can start to figure that out. We all talk about terroir  we worship terroir  we say  Wow  is my terroir great  It's so special. I've got this piece of land and it creates terroir like you wouldn't believe. Well  you know  we really  we argue and debate about it    we say it's climate  it's soil  it's this. Well  guess what  We can figure out what the heck terroir is. It's in there  waiting to be sequenced. There are thousands of microbes there. They're easy to sequence  unlike a human  they  you know  have a thousand  two thousand genes  we can figure out what they are. All we have to do is go around and sample  dig into the ground  find those bugs  sequence them  correlate them to the kinds of characteristics we like and don't like    that's just a big database    and then fertilize. And then we understand what is terroir. So  some people will say  Oh  my God  are we playing God  Are we now  if we engineer organisms  are we playing God  And  you know  people would always ask James Watson    he's not always the most politically correct guy ... ... and they would say   Are  you know  are you playing God   And he had the best answer I ever heard to this question   Well  somebody has to.  I consider myself a very spiritual person  and without  you know  the organized religion part  and I will tell you  I don't believe there's anything unnatural. I don't believe that chemicals are unnatural. I told you I'm going to make some of you puke. It's very simple  we don't invent molecules  compounds. They're here. They're in the universe. We reorganize things  we change them around  but we don't make anything unnatural. Now  we can create bad impacts    we can poison ourselves  we can poison the Earth    but that's just a natural outcome of a mistake we made. So  what's happening today is  Nature is presenting us with a toolbox  and we find that this toolbox is very extensive. There are microbes out there that actually make gasoline  believe it or not. There are microbes  you know    go back to yeast. These are chemical factories  the most sophisticated chemical factories are provided by Nature  and we now can use those. There also is a set of rules. Nature will not allow you to    we could engineer a grape plant  but guess what. We can't make the grape plant produce babies. Nature has put a set of rules out there. We can work within the rules  we can't break the rules  we're just learning what the rules are. I just ask the question  if you could cure all disease    if you could make disease go away  because we understand how it actually works  if we could end hunger by being able to create nutritious  healthy plants that grow in very hard to grow environments  if we could create clean and plentiful energy    we  right in the labs at Synthetic Genomics  have single celled organisms that are taking carbon dioxide and producing a molecule very similar to gasoline. So  carbon dioxide    the stuff we want to get rid of    not sugar  not anything. Carbon dioxide  a little bit of sunlight  you end up with a lipid that is highly refined. We could solve our energy problems  we can reduce CO    we could clean up our oceans  we could make better wine. If we could  would we  Well  you know  I think the answer is very simple  working with Nature  working with this tool set that we now understand  is the next step in humankind's evolution. And all I can tell you is  stay healthy for    years. If you can stay healthy for    years  you'll see      maybe    . Thank you. You know  I am so bad at tech that my daughter    who is now       when she was five  was overheard by me to say to a friend of hers  If it doesn't bleed when you cut it  my daddy doesn't understand it. So  the assignment I've been given may be an insuperable obstacle for me  but I'm certainly going to try. What have I heard during these last four days  This is my third visit to TED. One was to TEDMED  and one  as you've heard  was a regular TED two years ago. I've heard what I consider an extraordinary thing that I've only heard a little bit in the two previous TEDs  and what that is is an interweaving and an interlarding  an intermixing  of a sense of social responsibility in so many of the talks    global responsibility  in fact  appealing to enlightened self interest  but it goes far beyond enlightened self interest. One of the most impressive things about what some  perhaps     of the speakers have been talking about is the realization  as you listen to them carefully  that they're not saying  Well  this is what we should do  this is what I would like you to do. It's  This is what I have done because I'm excited by it  because it's a wonderful thing  and it's done something for me and  of course  it's accomplished a great deal. It's the old concept  the real Greek concept  of philanthropy in its original sense  phil anthropy  the love of humankind. And the only explanation I can have for some of what you've been hearing in the last four days is that it arises  in fact  out of a form of love. And this gives me enormous hope. And hope  of course  is the topic that I'm supposed to be speaking about  which I'd completely forgotten about until I arrived. And when I did  I thought  well  I'd better look this word up in the dictionary. So  Sarah and I    my wife    walked over to the public library  which is four blocks away  on Pacific Street  and we got the OED  and we looked in there  and there are    definitions of hope  none of which really hits you between the eyes as being the appropriate one. And  of course  that makes sense  because hope is an abstract phenomenon  it's an abstract idea  it's not a concrete word. Well  it reminds me a little bit of surgery. If there's one operation for a disease  you know it works. If there are    operations  you know that none of them work. And that's the way it is with definitions of words. If you have appendicitis  they take your appendix out  and you're cured. If you've got reflux oesophagitis  there are    procedures  and Joe Schmo does it one way and Will Blow does it another way  and none of them work  and that's the way it is with this word  hope. They all come down to the idea of an expectation of something good that is due to happen. And you know what I found out  The Indo European root of the word hope is a stem  K E U    we would spell it K E U  it's pronounced koy    and it is the same root from which the word curve comes from. But what it means in the original Indo European is a change in direction  going in a different way. And I find that very interesting and very provocative  because what you've been hearing in the last couple of days is the sense of going in different directions  directions that are specific and unique to problems. There are different paradigms. You've heard that word several times in the last four days  and everyone's familiar with Kuhnian paradigms. So  when we think of hope now  we have to think of looking in other directions than we have been looking. There's another    not definition  but description  of hope that has always appealed to me  and it was one by V clav Havel in his perfectly spectacular book  Breaking the Peace   in which he says that hope does not consist of the expectation that things will come out exactly right  but the expectation that they will make sense regardless of how they come out. I can't tell you how reassured I was by the very last sentence in that glorious presentation by Dean Kamen a few days ago. I wasn't sure I heard it right  so I found him in one of the inter sessions. He was talking to a very large man  but I didn't care. I interrupted  and I said   Did you say this   He said   I think so.  So  here's what it is  I'll repeat it.  The world will not be saved by the Internet.  It's wonderful. Do you know what the world will be saved by  I'll tell you. It'll be saved by the human spirit. And by the human spirit  I don't mean anything divine  I don't mean anything supernatural    certainly not coming from this skeptic. What I mean is this ability that each of us has to be something greater than herself or himself  to arise out of our ordinary selves and achieve something that at the beginning we thought perhaps we were not capable of. On an elemental level  we have all felt that spirituality at the time of childbirth. Some of you have felt it in laboratories  some of you have felt it at the workbench. We feel it at concerts. I've felt it in the operating room  at the bedside. It is an elevation of us beyond ourselves. And I think that it's going to be  in time  the elements of the human spirit that we've been hearing about bit by bit by bit from so many of the speakers in the last few days. And if there's anything that has permeated this room  it is precisely that. I'm intrigued by a concept that was brought to life in the early part of the   th century    actually  in the second decade of the   th century    by a    year old poet whose name was Percy Shelley. Now  we all think that Shelley obviously is the great romantic poet that he was  many of us tend to forget that he wrote some perfectly wonderful essays  too  and the most well remembered essay is one called  A Defence of Poetry.  Now  it's about five  six  seven  eight pages long  and it gets kind of deep and difficult after about the third page  but somewhere on the second page he begins talking about the notion that he calls  moral imagination.  And here's what he says  roughly translated  A man    generic man    a man  to be greatly good  must imagine clearly. He must see himself and the world through the eyes of another  and of many others. See himself and the world    not just the world  but see himself. What is it that is expected of us by the billions of people who live in what Laurie Garrett the other day so appropriately called despair and disparity  What is it that they have every right to ask of us  What is it that we have every right to ask of ourselves  out of our shared humanity and out of the human spirit  Well  you know precisely what it is. There's a great deal of argument about whether we  as the great nation that we are  should be the policeman of the world  the world's constabulary  but there should be virtually no argument about whether we should be the world's healer. There has certainly been no argument about that in this room in the past four days. So  if we are to be the world's healer  every disadvantaged person in this world    including in the United States    becomes our patient. Every disadvantaged nation  and perhaps our own nation  becomes our patient. So  it's fun to think about the etymology of the word  patient.  It comes initially from the Latin patior  to endure  or to suffer. So  you go back to the old Indo European root again  and what do you find  The Indo European stem is pronounced payen    we would spell it P A E N    and  lo and behold  mirabile dictu  it is the same root as the word compassion comes from  P A E N. So  the lesson is very clear. The lesson is that our patient    the world  and the disadvantaged of the world    that patient deserves our compassion. But beyond our compassion  and far greater than compassion  is our moral imagination and our identification with each individual who lives in that world  not to think of them as a huge forest  but as individual trees. Of course  in this day and age  the trick is not to let each tree be obscured by that Bush in Washington that can get    can get in the way. So  here we are. We are  should be  morally committed to being the healer of the world. And we have had examples over and over and over again    you've just heard one in the last    minutes    of people who have not only had that commitment  but had the charisma  the brilliance    and I think in this room it's easy to use the word brilliant  my God    the brilliance to succeed at least at the beginning of their quest  and who no doubt will continue to succeed  as long as more and more of us enlist ourselves in their cause. Now  if we're talking about medicine  and we're talking about healing  I'd like to quote someone who hasn't been quoted. It seems to me everybody in the world's been quoted here  Pogo's been quoted  Shakespeare's been quoted backwards  forwards  inside out. I would like to quote one of my own household gods. I suspect he never really said this  because we don't know what Hippocrates really said  but we do know for sure that one of the great Greek physicians said the following  and it has been recorded in one of the books attributed to Hippocrates  and the book is called  Precepts.  And I'll read you what it is. Remember  I have been talking about  essentially philanthropy  the love of humankind  the individual humankind and the individual humankind that can bring that kind of love translated into action  translated  in some cases  into enlightened self interest. And here he is        years ago   Where there is love of humankind  there is love of healing.  We have seen that here today with the sense  with the sensitivity    and in the last three days  and with the power of the indomitable human spirit. Thank you very much. I became an inventor by accident. I was out of the air force in     . No  no  that's not true  I went in in       came out in       was working at the University of Washington  and I came up with an idea  from reading a magazine article  for a new kind of a phonograph tone arm. Now  that was before cassette tapes  C.D.s  DVDs    any of the cool stuff we've got now. And it was an arm that  instead of hinging and pivoting as it went across the record  went straight  a radial  linear tracking tone arm. And it was the hardest invention I ever made  but it got me started  and I got really lucky after that. And without giving you too much of a tirade  I want to talk to you about an invention I brought with me today  my   th invention. No  that's not true either. Golly  I'm just totally losing it. My   th patent  about the   th invention. I call this hypersonic sound. I'm going to play it for you in a couple minutes  but I want to make an analogy before I do to this. I usually show this hypersonic sound and people will say  That's really cool  but what's it good for  And I say  What is the light bulb good for  Sound  light  I'm going to draw the analogy. When Edison invented the light bulb  pretty much looked like this. Hasn't changed that much. Light came out of it in every direction. Before the light bulb was invented  people had figured out how to put a reflector behind it  focus it a little bit  put lenses in front of it  focus it a little bit better. Ultimately we figured out how to make things like lasers that were totally focused. Now  think about where the world would be today if we had the light bulb  but you couldn't focus light  if when you turned one on it just went wherever it wanted to. That's the way loudspeakers pretty much are. You turn on the loudspeaker  and after almost    years of having those gadgets  the sound just kind of goes where it wants. Even when you're standing in front of a megaphone  it's pretty much every direction. A little bit of differential  but not much. If the light bulb was the way the speaker is  and you couldn't focus or sharpen the edges or define it  we wouldn't have that  or movies in general  or computers  or T.V. sets  or C.D.s  or DVDs    and just go down the list of what the importance is of being able to focus light. Now  after almost    years of having sound  I thought it was about time that we figure out a way to put sound where you want to. I have a couple of units. That guy there was made for a demo I did yesterday early in the day for a big car maker in Detroit who wants to put them in a car    small version  over your head    so that you can actually get binaural sound in a car. What if I could aim sound the way I aim light  I got this waterfall I recorded in my back yard. Now  you're not going to hear a thing unless it hits you. Maybe if I hit the side wall it will bounce around the room. The sound is being made right next to your ears. Is that cool  Because I have some limited time  I'll cut it off for a second  and tell you about how it works and what it's good for. Course  like light  it's great to be able to put sound to highlight a clothing rack  or the cornflakes  or the toothpaste  or a talking plaque in a movie theater lobby. Sony's got an idea    Sony's our biggest customers right now. They tried this back in the '  s and were too smart  and so they gave up. But they want to use it    seriously. There's a mix an inventor has to have. You have to be kind of smart  and though I did not graduate from college doesn't mean I'm stupid  because you cannot be stupid and do very much in the world today. Too many other smart people out there. So. I just happened to get my education in a little different way. I'm not at all against education. I think it's wonderful  I think sometimes people  when they get educated  lose it  they get so smart they're unwilling to look at things that they know better than. And we're living in a great time right now  because almost everything's being explored anew. I have this little slogan that I use a lot  which is  virtually nothing    and I mean this honestly    has been invented yet. We're just starting. We're just starting to really discover the laws of nature and science and physics. And this is  I hope  a little piece of it. Sony's got this vision back    to get myself on track    that when you stand in the checkout line in the supermarket  you're going to watch a new T.V. channel. They know that when you watch T.V. at home  because there are so many choices you can change channels  miss their commercials. A hundred and fifty one million people every day stand in the line at the supermarket. Now  they've tried this a couple years ago and it failed  because the checker gets tired of hearing the same message every    minutes  and reaches out  turns off the sound. And  you know  if the sound isn't there  the sale typically isn't made. For instance  like  when you're on an airplane  they show the movie  you get to watch it for free  when you want to hear the sound  you pay. And so ABC and Sony have devised this new thing where when you step in the line in the supermarket    initially it'll be Safeways. It is Safeways  they're trying this in three parts of the country right now    you'll be watching TV. And hopefully they'll be sensitive that they don't want to offend you with just one more outlet. But what's great about it  from the tests that have been done  is  if you don't want to hear it  you take about one step to the side and you don't hear it. So  we create silence as much as we create sound. ATMs that talk to you  nobody else hears it. Sit in bed  two in the morning  watch TV  your spouse  or someone  is next to you  asleep  doesn't hear it  doesn't wake up. We're also working on noise canceling things like snoring  noise from automobiles. I have been really lucky with this technology  all of a sudden as it is ready  the world is ready to accept it. They have literally beat a path to our door. We've been selling it since about last September  October  and it's been immensely gratifying. If you're interested in what it costs    I'm not selling them today    but this unit  with the electronics and everything  if you buy one  is around a thousand bucks. We expect by this time next year  it'll be hundreds  a few hundred bucks  to buy it. It's not any more pricey than regular electronics. Now  when I played it for you  you didn't hear the thunderous bass. This unit that I played goes from about     hertz to above the range of hearing. It's actually emitting ultrasound    low level ultrasound    that's about         vibrations per second. And the sound that you're hearing  unlike a regular speaker on which all the sound is made on the face  is made out in front of it  in the air. The air is not linear  as we've always been taught. You turn up the volume just a little bit    I'm talking about a little over    decibels    and all of a sudden the air begins to corrupt signals you propagate. Here's why  the speed of sound is not a constant. It's fairly slow. It changes with temperature and with barometric pressure. Now  imagine  if you will  without getting too technical  I'm making a little sine wave here in the air. Well  if I turn up the amplitude too much  I'm having an effect on the pressure  which means during the making of that sine wave  the speed at which it is propagating is shifting. All of audio as we know it is an attempt to be more and more perfectly linear. Linearity means higher quality sound. Hypersonic sound is exactly the opposite  it's     percent based on non linearity. An effect happens in the air  it's a corrupting effect of the sound    the ultrasound in this case    that's emitted  but it's so predictable that you can produce very precise audio out of that effect. Now  the question is  where's the sound made  Instead of being made on the face of the cone  it's made at literally billions of little independent points along this narrow column in the air  and so when I aim it towards you  what you hear is made right next to your ears. I said we can shorten the column  we can spread it out to cover the couch. I can put it so that one ear hears one speaker  the other ear hears the other. That's true binaural sound. When you listen to stereo on your home system  your both ears hear both speakers. Turn on the left speaker sometime and notice you're hearing it also in your right ear. So  the stage is more restricted    the sound stage that's supposed to spread out in front of you. Because the sound is made in the air along this column  it does not follow the inverse square law  which says it drops off about two thirds every time you double the distance   dB every time you go from one meter  for instance  to two meters. That means you go to a rock concert or a symphony  and the guy in the front row gets the same level as the guy in the back row  now  all of a sudden. Isn't that terrific  So  we've been  as I say  very successful  very lucky  in having companies catch the vision of this  from cars    car makers who want to put a stereo system in the front for the kids  and a separate system in the back    oh  no  the kids aren't driving today. I was seeing if you were listening. Actually  I haven't had breakfast yet. A stereo system in the front for mom and dad  and maybe there's a little DVD player in the back for the kids  and the parents don't want to be bothered with that  or their rap music or whatever. So  again  this idea of being able to put sound anywhere you want to is really starting to catch on. It also works for transmitting and communicating data. It also works five times better underwater. We've got the military    have just deployed some of these into Iraq  where you can put fake troop movements quarter of a mile away on a hillside. Or you can whisper in the ear of a supposed terrorist some Biblical verse. I'm serious. And they have these infrared devices that can look at their countenance  and see a fraction of a degree Kelvin in temperature shift from     yards away when they play this thing. And so  another way of hopefully determining who's friendly and who isn't. We make a version with this which puts out     decibels. Pain is    . So it allows you to go nearly a mile away and communicate with people  and there can be a public beach just off to the side  and they don't even know it's turned on. We sell those to the military presently for about        dollars  and they're buying them as fast as we can make them. We put it on a turret with a camera  so that when they shoot at you  you're over there  and it's there. I have a bunch of other inventions. I invented a plasma antenna  to shift gears. Looked up at the ceiling of my office one day    I was working on a ground penetrating radar project    and my physicist CEO came in and said   We have a real problem. We're using very short wavelengths. We've got a problem with the antenna ringing. When you run very short wavelengths  like a tuning fork the antenna resonates  and there's more energy coming out of the antenna than there is the backscatter from the ground that we're trying to analyze  taking too much processing.  I says   Why don't we make an antenna that only exists when you want it  Turn it on  turn it off. That's a fluorescent tube refined.  I just sold that for a million and a half dollars  cash. I took it back to the Pentagon after it got declassified  when the patent issued  and told the people back there about it  and they laughed  and then I took them back a demo and they bought. Any of you ever wore a Jabber headphone    the little cell headphones  That's my invention. I sold that for seven million dollars. Big mistake  it just sold for    million dollars two years ago. I actually drew that up on a little crummy Mac computer in my attic at my house  and one of the many designs which they have now is still the same design I drew way back when. So  I've been really lucky as an inventor. I'm the happiest guy you're ever going to meet. And my dad died before he realized anybody in the family would maybe  hopefully  make something out of themselves. You've been a great audience. I know I've jumped all over the place. I usually figure out what my talk is when I get up in front of a group. Let me give you  in the last minute  one more quick demo of this guy  for those of you that haven't heard it. Can never tell if it's on. If you haven't heard it  raise your hand. Getting it over there  Get the cameraman. Yeah  there you go. I've got a Coke can opening that's right in your head  that's really cool. Thank you once again. Appreciate it very much. So  I want to start out with this beautiful picture from my childhood. I love the science fiction movies. Here it is   This Island Earth.  And leave it to Hollywood to get it just right. Two and a half years in the making. I mean  even the creationists give us        but Hollywood goes to the chase. And in this movie  we see what we think is out there  flying saucers and aliens. Every world has an alien  and every alien world has a flying saucer  and they move about with great speed. Aliens. Well  Don Brownlee  my friend  and I finally got to the point where we got tired of turning on the TV and seeing the spaceships and seeing the aliens every night  and tried to write a counter argument to it  and put out what does it really take for an Earth to be habitable  for a planet to be an Earth  to have a place where you could probably get not just life  but complexity  which requires a huge amount of evolution  and therefore constancy of conditions. So  in      we wrote  Rare Earth.  In       we then asked  let's not think about where Earths are in space  but how long has Earth been Earth  If you go back two billion years  you're not on an Earth like planet any more. What we call an Earth like planet is actually a very short interval of time. Well   Rare Earth  actually taught me an awful lot about meeting the public. Right after  I got an invitation to go to a science fiction convention  and with all great earnestness walked in. David Brin was going to debate me on this  and as I walked in  the crowd of a hundred started booing lustily. I had a girl who came up who said   My dad says you're the devil.  You cannot take people's aliens away from them and expect to be anybody's friends. Well  the second part of that  soon after    and I was talking to Paul Allen  I saw him in the audience  and I handed him a copy of  Rare Earth.  And Jill Tarter was there  and she turned to me  and she looked at me just like that girl in  The Exorcist.  It was   It burns  It burns   Because SETI doesn't want to hear this. SETI wants there to be stuff out there. I really applaud the SETI efforts  but we have not heard anything yet. And I really do think we have to start thinking about what's a good planet and what isn't. Now  I throw this slide up because it indicates to me that  even if SETI does hear something  can we figure out what they said  Because this was a slide that was passed between the two major intelligences on Earth    a Mac to a PC    and it can't even get the letters right       so how are we going to talk to the aliens  And if they're    light years away  and we call them up  and you blah  blah  blah  blah  blah  and then    years later it comes back and they say  Please repeat  I mean  there we are. Our planet is a good planet because it can keep water. Mars is a bad planet  but it's still good enough for us to go there and to live on its surface if we're protected. But Venus is a very bad    the worst    planet. Even though it's Earth like  and even though early in its history it may very well have harbored Earth like life  it soon succumbed to runaway greenhouse    that's an     degrees  Fahrenheit  surface    because of rampant carbon dioxide. Well  we know from astrobiology that we can really now predict what's going to happen to our particular planet. We are right now in the beautiful Oreo of existence    of at least life on Planet Earth    following the first horrible microbial age. In the Cambrian explosion  life emerged from the swamps  complexity arose  and from what we can tell  we're halfway through. We have as much time for animals to exist on this planet as they have been here now  till we hit the second microbial age. And that will happen  paradoxically    everything you hear about global warming    when we hit CO  down to    parts per million  we are no longer going to have to have plants that are allowed to have any photosynthesis  and there go animals. So  after that we probably have seven billion years. The Sun increases in its intensity  in its brightness  and finally  at about    billion years after it first started  the Earth is consumed by a large Sun  and this is what's left. So  a planet like us is going to have an age and an old age  and we are in its golden summer age right now. But there's two fates to everything  isn't there  Now  a lot of you are going to die of old age  but some of you  horribly enough  are going to die in an accident. And that's the fate of a planet  too. Earth  if we're lucky enough    if it doesn't get hit by a Hale Bopp  or gets blasted by some supernova nearby in the next seven billion years    we'll find under your feet. But what about accidental death  Well  paleontologists for the last     years have been charting death. It's strange    extinction as a concept wasn't even thought about until Baron Cuvier in France found this first mastodon. He couldn't match it up to any bones on the planet  and he said  Aha  It's extinct. And very soon after  the fossil record started yielding a very good idea of how many plants and animals there have been since complex life really began to leave a very interesting fossil record. In that complex record of fossils  there were times when lots of stuff seemed to be dying out very quickly  and the father mother geologists called these  mass extinctions.  All along it was thought to be either an act of God or perhaps long  slow climate change  and that really changed in       in this rocky outcrop near Gubbio  where Walter Alvarez  trying to figure out what was the time difference between these white rocks  which held creatures of the Cretaceous period  and the pink rocks above  which held Tertiary fossils. How long did it take to go from one system to the next  And what they found was something unexpected. They found in this gap  in between  a very thin clay layer  and that clay layer    this very thin red layer here    is filled with iridium. And not just iridium  it's filled with glassy spherules  and it's filled with quartz grains that have been subjected to enormous pressure  shock quartz. Now  in this slide the white is chalk  and this chalk was deposited in a warm ocean. The chalk itself's composed by plankton which has fallen down from the sea surface onto the sea floor  so that    percent of the sediment here is skeleton of living stuff  and then you have that millimeter thick red layer  and then you have black rock. And the black rock is the sediment on the sea bottom in the absence of plankton. And that's what happens in an asteroid catastrophe  because that's what this was  of course. This is the famous K T. A    kilometer body hit the planet. The effects of it spread this very thin impact layer all over the planet  and we had very quickly the death of the dinosaurs  the death of these beautiful ammonites  Leconteiceras here  and Celaeceras over here  and so much else. I mean  it must be true  because we've had two Hollywood blockbusters since that time  and this paradigm  from      to about       totally changed how we geologists thought about catastrophes. Prior to that  uniformitarianism was the dominant paradigm  the fact that if anything happens on the planet in the past  there are present day processes that will explain it. But we haven't witnessed a big asteroid impact  so this is a type of neo catastrophism  and it took about    years for the scientific establishment to finally come to grips  yes  we were hit  and yes  the effects of that hit caused a major mass extinction. Well  there are five major mass extinctions over the last     million years  called the Big Five. They range from     million years ago to the last  the K T  number four  but the biggest of all was the P  or the Permian extinction  sometimes called the mother of all mass extinctions. And every one of these has been subsequently blamed on large body impact. But is this true  The most recent  the Permian  was thought to have been an impact because of this beautiful structure on the right. This is a Buckminsterfullerene  a carbon   . Because it looks like those terrible geodesic domes of my late beloved '  s  they're called  buckyballs.  This evidence was used to suggest that at the end of the Permian      million years ago  a comet hit us. And when the comet hits  the pressure produces the buckyballs  and it captures bits of the comet. Helium    very rare on the surface of the Earth  very common in space. But is this true  In       working on the K T extinction for    years  I moved to South Africa to begin work twice a year in the great Karoo desert. I was so lucky to watch the change of that South Africa into the new South Africa as I went year by year. And I worked on this Permian extinction  camping by this Boer graveyard for months at a time. And the fossils are extraordinary. You know  you're gazing upon your very distant ancestors. These are mammal like reptiles. They are culturally invisible. We do not make movies about these. This is a Gorgonopsian  or a Gorgon. That's an    inch long skull of an animal that was probably seven or eight feet  sprawled like a lizard  probably had a head like a lion. This is the top carnivore  the T Rex of its time. But there's lots of stuff. This is my poor son  Patrick. This is called paleontological child abuse. Hold still  you're the scale. There was big stuff back then. Fifty five species of mammal like reptiles. The age of mammals had well and truly started     million years ago ... ... and then a catastrophe happened. And what happens next is the age of dinosaurs. It was all a mistake  it should have never happened. But it did. Now  luckily  this Thrinaxodon  the size of a robin egg here  this is a skull I've discovered just before taking this picture    there's a pen for scale  it's really tiny    this is in the Lower Triassic  after the mass extinction has finished. You can see the eye socket and you can see the little teeth in the front. If that does not survive  I'm not the thing giving this talk. Something else is  because if that doesn't survive  we are not here  there are no mammals. It's that close  one species ekes through. Well  can we say anything about the pattern of who survives and who doesn't  Here's sort of the end of that    years of work. The ranges of stuff    the red line is the mass extinction. But we've got survivors and things that get through  and it turns out the things that get through preferentially are cold bloods. Warm blooded animals take a huge hit at this time. The survivors that do get through produce this world of crocodile like creatures. There's no dinosaurs yet  just this slow  saurian  scaly  nasty  swampy place with a couple of tiny mammals hiding in the fringes. And there they would hide for     million years  until liberated by that K T asteroid. So  if not impact  what  And the what  I think  is that we returned  over and over again  to the Pre Cambrian world  that first microbial age  and the microbes are still out there. They hate we animals. They really want their world back. And they've tried over and over and over again. This suggests to me that life causing these mass extinctions because it did is inherently anti Gaian. This whole Gaia idea  that life makes the world better for itself    anybody been on a freeway on a Friday afternoon in Los Angeles believing in the Gaia theory  No. So  I really suspect there's an alternative  and that life does actually try to do itself in    not consciously  but just because it does. And here's the weapon  it seems  that it did so over the last     million years. There are microbes which  through their metabolism  produce hydrogen sulfide  and they do so in large amounts. Hydrogen sulfide is very fatal to we humans. As small as     parts per million will kill you. You only have to go to the Black Sea and a few other places    some lakes    and get down  and you'll find that the water itself turns purple. It turns purple from the presence of numerous microbes which have to have sunlight and have to have hydrogen sulfide  and we can detect their presence today    we can see them    but we can also detect their presence in the past. And the last three years have seen an enormous breakthrough in a brand new field. I am almost extinct    I'm a paleontologist who collects fossils. But the new wave of paleontologists    my graduate students    collect biomarkers. They take the sediment itself  they extract the oil from it  and from that they can produce compounds which turn out to be very specific to particular microbial groups. It's because lipids are so tough  they can get preserved in sediment and last the hundreds of millions of years necessary  and be extracted and tell us who was there. And we know who was there. At the end of the Permian  at many of these mass extinction boundaries  this is what we find  isorenieratene. It's very specific. It can only occur if the surface of the ocean has no oxygen  and is totally saturated with hydrogen sulfide    enough  for instance  to come out of solution. This led Lee Kump  and others from Penn State and my group  to propose what I call the Kump Hypothesis  many of the mass extinctions were caused by lowering oxygen  by high CO . And the worst effect of global warming  it turns out  hydrogen sulfide being produced out of the oceans. Well  what's the source of this  In this particular case  the source over and over has been flood basalts. This is a view of the Earth now  if we extract a lot of it. And each of these looks like a hydrogen bomb  actually  the effects are even worse. This is when deep Earth material comes to the surface  spreads out over the surface of the planet. Well  it's not the lava that kills anything  it's the carbon dioxide that comes out with it. This isn't Volvos  this is volcanoes. But carbon dioxide is carbon dioxide. So  these are new data Rob Berner and I    from Yale    put together  and what we try to do now is track the amount of carbon dioxide in the entire rock record    and we can do this from a variety of means    and put all the red lines here  when these    what I call greenhouse mass extinctions    took place. And there's two things that are really evident here to me  is that these extinctions take place when CO  is going up. But the second thing that's not shown on here  the Earth has never had any ice on it when we've had       parts per million CO . We are at     and climbing. We should be up to a thousand in three centuries at the most  but my friend David Battisti in Seattle says he thinks a     years. So  there goes the ice caps  and there comes     feet of sea level rise. I live in a view house now  I'm going to have waterfront. All right  what's the consequence  The oceans probably turn purple. And we think this is the reason that complexity took so long to take place on planet Earth. We had these hydrogen sulfide oceans for a very great long period. They stop complex life from existing. We know hydrogen sulfide is erupting presently a few places on the planet. And I throw this slide in    this is me  actually  two months ago    and I throw this slide in because here is my favorite animal  chambered nautilus. It's been on this planet since the animals first started        million years. This is a tracking experiment  and any of you scuba divers  if you want to get involved in one of the coolest projects ever  this is off the Great Barrier Reef. And as we speak now  these nautilus are tracking out their behaviors to us. But the thing about this is that every once in a while we divers can run into trouble  so I'm going to do a little thought experiment here. This is a Great White Shark that ate some of my traps. We pulled it up  up it comes. So  it's out there with me at night. So  I'm swimming along  and it takes off my leg. I'm    miles from shore  what's going to happen to me  Well now  I die. Five years from now  this is what I hope happens to me  I'm taken back to the boat  I'm given a gas mask     parts per million hydrogen sulfide. I'm then thrown in an ice pond  I'm cooled    degrees lower and I could be taken to a critical care hospital. And the reason I could do that is because we mammals have gone through a series of these hydrogen sulfide events  and our bodies have adapted. And we can now use this as what I think will be a major medical breakthrough. This is Mark Roth. He was funded by DARPA. Tried to figure out how to save Americans after battlefield injuries. He bleeds out pigs. He puts in    parts per million hydrogen sulfide    the same stuff that survived these past mass extinctions    and he turns a mammal into a reptile.  I believe we are seeing in this response the result of mammals and reptiles having undergone a series of exposures to H S.  I got this email from him two years ago  he said   I think I've got an answer to some of your questions.  So  he now has taken mice down for as many as four hours  sometimes six hours  and these are brand new data he sent me on the way over here. On the top  now  that is a temperature record of a mouse who has gone through    the dotted line  the temperatures. So  the temperature starts at    centigrade  and down it goes  down it goes. Six hours later  up goes the temperature. Now  the same mouse is given    parts per million hydrogen sulfide in this solid graph  and look what happens to its temperature. Its temperature drops. It goes down to    degrees centigrade from     and comes out of this perfectly fine. Here is a way we can get people to critical care. Here's how we can bring people cold enough to last till we get critical care. Now  you're all thinking  yeah  what about the brain tissue  And so this is one of the great challenges that is going to happen. You're in an accident. You've got two choices  you're going to die  or you're going to take the hydrogen sulfide and  say     percent of you is saved  mentally. What are you going to do  Do we all have to have a little button saying  Let me die  This is coming towards us  and I think this is going to be a revolution. We're going to save lives  but there's going to be a cost to it. The new view of mass extinctions is  yes  we were hit  and  yes  we have to think about the long term  because we will get hit again. But there's a far worse danger confronting us. We can easily go back to the hydrogen sulfide world. Give us a few millennia    and we humans should last those few millennia    will it happen again  If we continue  it'll happen again. How many of us flew here  How many of us have gone through our entire Kyoto quota just for flying this year  How many of you have exceeded it  Yeah  I've certainly exceeded it. We have a huge problem facing us as a species. We have to beat this. I want to be able to go back to this reef. Thank you. Chris Anderson  I've just got one question for you  Peter. Am I understanding you right  that what you're saying here is that we have in our own bodies a biochemical response to hydrogen sulfide that in your mind proves that there have been past mass extinctions due to climate change  Peter Ward  Yeah  every single cell in us can produce minute quantities of hydrogen sulfide in great crises. This is what Roth has found out. So  what we're looking at now  does it leave a signal  Does it leave a signal in bone or in plant  And we go back to the fossil record and we could try to detect how many of these have happened in the past. CA  It's simultaneously an incredible medical technique  but also a terrifying ... PW  Blessing and curse. Sheryl Shade  Hi  Aimee. Aimee Mullins  Hi. SS  Aimee and I thought we'd just talk a little bit  and I wanted her to tell all of you what makes her a distinctive athlete. AM  Well  for those of you who have seen the picture in the little bio    it might have given it away    I'm a double amputee  and I was born without fibulas in both legs. I was amputated at age one  and I've been running like hell ever since  all over the place. SS  Well  why don't you tell them how you got to Georgetown    why don't we start there  Why don't we start there  AM  I'm a senior in Georgetown in the Foreign Service program. I won a full academic scholarship out of high school. They pick three students out of the nation every year to get involved in international affairs  and so I won a full ride to Georgetown and I've been there for four years. Love it. SS  When Aimee got there  she decided that she's  kind of  curious about track and field  so she decided to call someone and start asking about it. So  why don't you tell that story  AM  Yeah. Well  I guess I've always been involved in sports. I played softball for five years growing up. I skied competitively throughout high school  and I got a little restless in college because I wasn't doing anything for about a year or two sports wise. And I'd never competed on a disabled level  you know    I'd always competed against other able bodied athletes. That's all I'd ever known. In fact  I'd never even met another amputee until I was   . And I heard that they do these track meets with all disabled runners  and I figured   Oh  I don't know about this  but before I judge it  let me go see what it's all about.  So  I booked myself a flight to Boston in '       years old and definitely the dark horse candidate at this race. I'd never done it before. I went out on a gravel track a couple of weeks before this meet to see how far I could run  and about    meters was enough for me  panting and heaving. And I had these legs that were made of a wood and plastic compound  attached with Velcro straps    big  thick  five ply wool socks on    you know  not the most comfortable things  but all I'd ever known. And I'm up there in Boston against people wearing legs made of all things    carbon graphite and  you know  shock absorbers in them and all sorts of things    and they're all looking at me like  OK  we know who's not going to win this race. And  I mean  I went up there expecting    I don't know what I was expecting    but  you know  when I saw a man who was missing an entire leg go up to the high jump  hop on one leg to the high jump and clear it at six feet  two inches ... Dan O'Brien jumped  '    in '   in Atlanta  I mean  if it just gives you a comparison of    these are truly accomplished athletes  without qualifying that word  athlete.  And so I decided to give this a shot  heart pounding  I ran my first race and I beat the national record holder by three hundredths of a second  and became the new national record holder on my first try out. And  you know  people said   Aimee  you know  you've got speed    you've got natural speed    but you don't have any skill or finesse going down that track. You were all over the place. We all saw how hard you were working.  And so I decided to call the track coach at Georgetown. And I thank god I didn't know just how huge this man is in the track and field world. He's coached five Olympians  and the man's office is lined from floor to ceiling with All America certificates of all these athletes he's coached. He's just a rather intimidating figure. And I called him up and said   Listen  I ran one race and I won ...   I want to see if I can  you know    I need to just see if I can sit in on some of your practices  see what drills you do and whatever.  That's all I wanted    just two practices.  Can I just sit in and see what you do   And he said   Well  we should meet first  before we decide anything.  You know  he's thinking   What am I getting myself into   So  I met the man  walked in his office  and saw these posters and magazine covers of people he has coached. And we got to talking  and it turned out to be a great partnership because he'd never coached a disabled athlete  so therefore he had no preconceived notions of what I was or wasn't capable of  and I'd never been coached before. So this was like   Here we go    let's start on this trip.  So he started giving me four days a week of his lunch break  his free time  and I would come up to the track and train with him. So that's how I met Frank. That was fall of '  . But then  by the time that winter was rolling around  he said   You know  you're good enough. You can run on our women's track team here.  And I said   No  come on.  And he said   No  no  really. You can. You can run with our women's track team.  In the spring of       with my goal of making the U.S. Paralympic team that May coming up full speed  I joined the women's track team. And no disabled person had ever done that    run at a collegiate level. So I don't know  it started to become an interesting mix. SS  Well  on your way to the Olympics  a couple of memorable events happened at Georgetown. Why don't you just tell them  AM  Yes  well  you know  I'd won everything as far as the disabled meets    everything I competed in    and  you know  training in Georgetown and knowing that I was going to have to get used to seeing the backs of all these women's shirts    you know  I'm running against the next Flo Jo    and they're all looking at me like   Hmm  what's  you know  what's going on here   And putting on my Georgetown uniform and going out there and knowing that  you know  in order to become better    and I'm already the best in the country    you know  you have to train with people who are inherently better than you. And I went out there and made it to the Big East  which was sort of the championship race at the end of the season. It was really  really hot. And it's the first    I had just gotten these new sprinting legs that you see in that bio  and I didn't realize at that time that the amount of sweating I would be doing in the sock    it actually acted like a lubricant and I'd be  kind of  pistoning in the socket. And at about    meters of my     meters sprint  in all my glory  I came out of my leg. Like  I almost came out of it  in front of  like        people. And I  I mean  was just mortified    because I was signed up for the      you know  which went off in a half hour. I went to my coach   Please  don't make me do this.  I can't do this in front of all those people. My legs will come off. And if it came off at    there's no way I'm going     meters. And he just sat there like this. My pleas fell on deaf ears  thank god. Because you know  the man is from Brooklyn  he's a big man. He says   Aimee  so what if your leg falls off  You pick it up  you put the damn thing back on  and finish the goddamn race   And I did. So  he kept me in line. He kept me on the right track. SS  So  then Aimee makes it to the      Paralympics  and she's all excited. Her family's coming down    it's a big deal. It's now two years that you've been running  AM  No  a year. SS  A year. And why don't you tell them what happened right before you go run your race  AM  Okay  well  Atlanta. The Paralympics  just for a little bit of clarification  are the Olympics for people with physical disabilities    amputees  persons with cerebral palsy  and wheelchair athletes    as opposed to the Special Olympics  which deals with people with mental disabilities. So  here we are  a week after the Olympics and down at Atlanta  and I'm just blown away by the fact that just a year ago  I got out on a gravel track and couldn't run    meters. And so  here I am    never lost. I set new records at the U.S. Nationals    the Olympic trials    that May  and was sure that I was coming home with the gold. I was also the only  what they call  bilateral BK     below the knee. I was the only woman who would be doing the long jump. I had just done the long jump  and a guy who was missing two legs came up to me and says   How do you do that  You know  we're supposed to have a planar foot  so we can't get off on the springboard.  I said   Well  I just did it. No one told me that.  So  it's funny    I'm three inches within the world record    and kept on from that point  you know  so I'm signed up in the long jump    signed up  No  I made it for the long jump and the     meter. And I'm sure of it  you know  I made the front page of my hometown paper that I delivered for six years  you know  It was  like  this is my time for shine. And we're at the trainee warm up track  which is a few blocks away from the Olympic stadium. These legs that I was on  which I'll take out right now    I was the first person in the world on these legs. I was the guinea pig.  I'm telling you  this was  like    talk about a tourist attraction. Everyone was taking pictures     What is this girl running on   And I'm always looking around  like  where is my competition  It's my first international meet. I tried to get it out of anybody I could  you know   Who am I running against here    Oh  Aimee  we'll have to get back to you on that one.  I wanted to find out times.  Don't worry  you're doing great.  This is    minutes before my race in the Olympic stadium  and they post the heat sheets. And I go over and look. And my fastest time  which was the world record  was   .  . Then I'm looking  the next lane  lane two  is   . . Lane three is   . . Lane four is   . . I said   What's going on   And they shove us all into the shuttle bus  and all the women there are missing a hand. So  I'm just  like    they're all looking at me like 'which one of these is not like the other ' you know  I'm sitting there  like   Oh  my god. Oh  my god.  You know  I'd never lost anything  like  whether it would be the scholarship or  you know  I'd won five golds when I skied. In everything  I came in first. And Georgetown    that was great. I was losing  but it was the best training because this was Atlanta. Here we are  like  cr me de la cr me  and there is no doubt about it  that I'm going to lose big. And  you know  I'm just thinking   Oh  my god  my whole family got in a van and drove down here from Pennsylvania.  And  you know  I was the only female U.S. sprinter. So they call us out and  you know     Ladies  you have one minute.  And I remember putting my blocks in and just feeling horrified because there was just this murmur coming over the crowd  like  the ones who are close enough to the starting line to see. And I'm like   I know  Look  This isn't right.  And I'm thinking that's my last card to play here  if I'm not going to beat these girls  I'm going to mess their heads a little  you know  I mean  it was definitely the  Rocky IV  sensation of me versus Germany  and everyone else    Estonia and Poland    was in this heat. And the gun went off  and all I remember was finishing last and fighting back tears of frustration and incredible    incredible    this feeling of just being overwhelmed. And I had to think   Why did I do this   If I had won everything    but it was like  what was the point  All this training    I had transformed my life. I became a collegiate athlete  you know. I became an Olympic athlete. And it made me really think about how the achievement was getting there. I mean  the fact that I set my sights  just a year and three months before  on becoming an Olympic athlete and saying   Here's my life going in this direction    and I want to take it here for a while  and just seeing how far I could push it.  And the fact that I asked for help    how many people jumped on board  How many people gave of their time and their expertise  and their patience  to deal with me  And that was this collective glory    that there was  you know     people behind me that had joined in this incredible experience of going to Atlanta. So  I apply this sort of philosophy now to everything I do  sitting back and realizing the progression  how far you've come at this day to this goal  you know. It's important to focus on a goal  I think  but also recognize the progression on the way there and how you've grown as a person. That's the achievement  I think. That's the real achievement. SS  Why don't you show them your legs  AM  Oh  sure. SS  You know  show us more than one set of legs. AM  Well  these are my pretty legs. No  these are my cosmetic legs  actually  and they're absolutely beautiful. You've got to come up and see them. There are hair follicles on them  and I can paint my toenails. And  seriously  like  I can wear heels. Like  you guys don't understand what that's like to be able to just go into a shoe store and buy whatever you want. SS  You got to pick your height  AM  I got to pick my height  exactly. Patrick Ewing  who played for Georgetown in the '  s  comes back every summer. And I had incessant fun making fun of him in the training room because he'd come in with foot injuries. I'm like   Get it off  Don't worry about it  you know. You can be eight feet tall. Just take them off.  He didn't find it as humorous as I did  anyway. OK  now  these are my sprinting legs  made of carbon graphite  like I said  and I've got to make sure I've got the right socket. No  I've got so many legs in here. These are    do you want to hold that actually  That's another leg I have for  like  tennis and softball. It has a shock absorber in it so it  like   Shhhh   makes this neat sound when you jump around on it. All right. And then this is the silicon sheath I roll over  to keep it on. Which  when I sweat  you know  I'm pistoning out of it. SS  Are you a different height  AM  In these  SS  In these. AM  I don't know. I don't think so. I may be a little taller. I actually can put both of them on. SS  She can't really stand on these legs. She has to be moving  so ... AM  Yeah  I definitely have to be moving  and balance is a little bit of an art in them. But without having the silicon sock  I'm just going to try slip in it. And so  I run on these  and have shocked half the world on these. These are supposed to simulate the actual form of a sprinter when they run. If you ever watch a sprinter  the ball of their foot is the only thing that ever hits the track. So when I stand in these legs  my hamstring and my glutes are contracted  as they would be had I had feet and were standing on the ball of my feet. AM  It's a company in San Diego called Flex Foot. And I was a guinea pig  as I hope to continue to be in every new form of prosthetic limbs that come out. But actually these  like I said  are still the actual prototype. I need to get some new ones because the last meet I was at  they were everywhere. You know  it's like a big    it's come full circle. Moderator  Aimee and the designer of them will be at TEDMED    and we'll talk about the design of them. AM  Yes  we'll do that. SS  Yes  there you go. AM  So  these are the sprint legs  and I can put my other... SS  Can you tell about who designed your other legs  AM  Yes. These I got in a place called Bournemouth  England  about two hours south of London  and I'm the only person in the United States with these  which is a crime because they are so beautiful. And I don't even mean  like  because of the toes and everything. For me  while I'm such a serious athlete on the track  I want to be feminine off the track  and I think it's so important not to be limited in any capacity  whether it's  you know  your mobility or even fashion. I mean  I love the fact that I can go in anywhere and pick out what I want    the shoes I want  the skirts I want    and I'm hoping to try to bring these over here and make them accessible to a lot of people. They're also silicon. This is a really basic  basic prosthetic limb under here. It's like a Barbie foot under this. It is. It's just stuck in this position  so I have to wear a two inch heel. And  I mean  it's really    let me take this off so you can see it. I don't know how good you can see it  but  like  it really is. There're veins on the feet  and then my heel is pink  and my Achilles' tendon    that moves a little bit. And it's really an amazing store. I got them a year and two weeks ago. And this is just a silicon piece of skin. I mean  what happened was  two years ago this man in Belgium was saying   God  if I can go to Madame Tussauds' wax museum and see Jerry Hall replicated down to the color of her eyes  looking so real as if she breathed  why can't they build a limb for someone that looks like a leg  or an arm  or a hand   I mean  they make ears for burn victims. They do amazing stuff with silicon. SS  Two weeks ago  Aimee was up for the Arthur Ashe award at the ESPYs. And she came into town and she rushed around and she said   I have to buy some new shoes   We're an hour before the ESPYs  and she thought she'd gotten a two inch heel but she'd actually bought a three inch heel. AM  And this poses a problem for me  because it means I'm walking like that all night long. SS  For    minutes. Luckily  the hotel was terrific. They got someone to come in and saw off the shoes. AM  I said to the receptionist    I mean  I am just harried  and Sheryl's at my side    I said   Look  do you have anybody here who could help me  Because I have this problem ...   You know  at first they were just going to write me off  like   If you don't like your shoes  sorry. It's too late.   No  no  no  no. I've got these special feet that need a two inch heel. I have a three inch heel. I need a little bit off.  They didn't even want to go there. They didn't even want to touch that one. They just did it. No  these legs are great. I'm actually going back in a couple of weeks to get some improvements. I want to get legs like these made for flat feet so I can wear sneakers  because I can't with these ones. So... Moderator  That's it. SS  That's Aimee Mullins. How can we investigate this flora of viruses that surround us  and aid medicine  How can we turn our cumulative knowledge of virology into a simple  hand held  single diagnostic assay  I want to turn everything we know right now about detecting viruses and the spectrum of viruses that are out there into  let's say  a small chip. When we started thinking about this project    how we would make a single diagnostic assay to screen for all pathogens simultaneously    well  there's some problems with this idea. First of all  viruses are pretty complex  but they're also evolving very fast. This is a picornavirus. Picornaviruses    these are things that include the common cold and polio  things like this. You're looking at the outside shell of the virus  and the yellow color here are those parts of the virus that are evolving very  very fast  and the blue parts are not evolving very fast. When people think about making pan viral detection reagents  usually it's the fast evolving problem that's an issue  because how can we detect things if they're always changing  But evolution is a balance  where you have fast change  you also have ultra conservation    things that almost never change. And so we looked into this a little more carefully  and I'm going to show you data now. This is just some stuff you can do on the computer from the desktop. I took a bunch of these small picornaviruses  like the common cold  like polio and so on  and I just broke them down into small segments. And so took this first example  which is called coxsackievirus  and just break it into small windows. And I'm coloring these small windows blue if another virus shares an identical sequence in its genome to that virus. These sequences right up here    which don't even code for protein  by the way    are almost absolutely identical across all of these  so I could use this sequence as a marker to detect a wide spectrum of viruses  without having to make something individual. Now  over here there's great diversity  that's where things are evolving fast. Down here you can see slower evolution  less diversity. Now  by the time we get out here to  let's say  acute bee paralysis virus    probably a bad one to have if you're a bee     this virus shares almost no similarity to coxsackievirus  but I can guarantee you that the sequences that are most conserved among these viruses on the right hand of the screen are in identical regions right up here. And so we can encapsulate these regions of ultra conservation through evolution    how these viruses evolved    by just choosing DNA elements or RNA elements in these regions to represent on our chip as detection reagents. OK  so that's what we did  but how are we going to do that  Well  for a long time  since I was in graduate school  I've been messing around making DNA chips    that is  printing DNA on glass. And that's what you see here  These little salt spots are just DNA tacked onto glass  and so I can put thousands of these on our glass chip and use them as a detection reagent. We took our chip over to Hewlett Packard and used their atomic force microscope on one of these spots  and this is what you see  you can actually see the strands of DNA lying flat on the glass here. So  what we're doing is just printing DNA on glass    little flat things    and these are going to be markers for pathogens. OK  I make little robots in lab to make these chips  and I'm really big on disseminating technology. If you've got enough money to buy just a Camry  you can build one of these too  and so we put a deep how to guide on the Web  totally free  with basically order off the shelf parts. You can build a DNA array machine in your garage. Here's the section on the all important emergency stop switch. Every important machine's got to have a big red button. But really  it's pretty robust. You can actually be making DNA chips in your garage and decoding some genetic programs pretty rapidly. It's a lot of fun. And so what we did    and this is a really cool project    we just started by making a respiratory virus chip. I talked about that    you know  that situation where you go into the clinic and you don't get diagnosed  Well  we just put basically all the human respiratory viruses on one chip  and we threw in herpes virus for good measure    I mean  why not  The first thing you do as a scientist is  you make sure stuff works. And so what we did is  we take tissue culture cells and infect them with various viruses  and we take the stuff and fluorescently label the nucleic acid  the genetic material that comes out of these tissue culture cells    mostly viral stuff    and stick it on the array to see where it sticks. Now  if the DNA sequences match  they'll stick together  and so we can look at spots. And if spots light up  we know there's a certain virus in there. That's what one of these chips really looks like  and these red spots are  in fact  signals coming from the virus. And each spot represents a different family of virus or species of virus. And so  that's a hard way to look at things  so I'm just going to encode things as a little barcode  grouped by family  so you can see the results in a very intuitive way. What we did is  we took tissue culture cells and infected them with adenovirus  and you can see this little yellow barcode next to adenovirus. And  likewise  we infected them with parainfluenza      that's a paramyxovirus    and you see a little barcode here. And then we did respiratory syncytial virus. That's the scourge of daycare centers everywhere    it's like boogeremia  basically. You can see that this barcode is the same family  but it's distinct from parainfluenza    which gives you a very bad cold. And so we're getting unique signatures  a fingerprint for each virus. Polio and rhino  they're in the same family  very close to each other. Rhino's the common cold  and you all know what polio is  and you can see that these signatures are distinct. And Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpes virus gives a nice signature down here. And so it is not any one stripe or something that tells me I have a virus of a particular type here  it's the barcode that in bulk represents the whole thing. All right  I can see a rhinovirus    and here's the blow up of the rhinovirus's little barcode    but what about different rhinoviruses  How do I know which rhinovirus I have  There're     known variants of the common cold  and there're only     because people got bored collecting them  there are just new ones every year. And so  here are four different rhinoviruses  and you can see  even with your eye  without any fancy computer pattern matching recognition software algorithms  that you can distinguish each one of these barcodes from each other. Now  this is kind of a cheap shot  because I know what the genetic sequence of all these rhinoviruses is  and I in fact designed the chip expressly to be able to tell them apart  but what about rhinoviruses that have never seen a genetic sequencer  We don't know what the sequence is  just pull them out of the field. So  here are four rhinoviruses we never knew anything about    no one's ever sequenced them    and you can also see that you get unique and distinguishable patterns. You can imagine building up some library  whether real or virtual  of fingerprints of essentially every virus. But that's  again  shooting fish in a barrel  you know  right  You have tissue culture cells. There are a ton of viruses. What about real people  You can't control real people  as you probably know. You have no idea what someone's going to cough into a cup  and it's probably really complex  right  It could have lots of bacteria  it could have more than one virus  and it certainly has host genetic material. So how do we deal with this  And how do we do the positive control here  Well  it's pretty simple. That's me  getting a nasal lavage. And the idea is  let's experimentally inoculate people with virus. This is all IRB approved  by the way  they got paid. And basically we experimentally inoculate people with the common cold virus. Or  even better  let's just take people right out of the emergency room    undefined  community acquired respiratory tract infections. You have no idea what walks in through the door. So  let's start off with the positive control first  where we know the person was healthy. They got a shot of virus up the nose  let's see what happens. Day zero  nothing happening. They're healthy  they're clean    it's amazing. Actually  we thought the nasal tract might be full of viruses even when you're walking around healthy. It's pretty clean. If you're healthy  you're pretty healthy. Day two  we get a very robust rhinovirus pattern  and it's very similar to what we get in the lab doing our tissue culture experiment. So that's great  but again  cheap shot  right  We put a ton of virus up this guy's nose. So       I mean  we wanted it to work. He really had a cold. So  how about the people who walk in off the street  Here are two individuals represented by their anonymous ID codes. They both have rhinoviruses  we've never seen this pattern in lab. We sequenced part of their viruses  they're new rhinoviruses no one's actually even seen. Remember  our evolutionary conserved sequences we're using on this array allow us to detect even novel or uncharacterized viruses  because we pick what is conserved throughout evolution. Here's another guy. You can play the diagnosis game yourself here. These different blocks represent the different viruses in this paramyxovirus family  so you can kind of go down the blocks and see where the signal is. Well  doesn't have canine distemper  that's probably good. But by the time you get to block nine  you see that respiratory syncytial virus. Maybe they have kids. And then you can see  also  the family member that's related  RSVB is showing up here. So  that's great. Here's another individual  sampled on two separate days    repeat visits to the clinic. This individual has parainfluenza    and you can see that there's a little stripe over here for Sendai virus  that's mouse parainfluenza. The genetic relationships are very close there. That's a lot of fun. So  we built out the chip. We made a chip that has every known virus ever discovered on it. Why not  Every plant virus  every insect virus  every marine virus. Everything that we could get out of GenBank    that is  the national repository of sequences. Now we're using this chip. And what are we using it for  Well  first of all  when you have a big chip like this  you need a little bit more informatics  so we designed the system to do automatic diagnosis. And the idea is that we simply have virtual patterns  because we're never going to get samples of every virus    it would be virtually impossible. But we can get virtual patterns  and compare them to our observed result    which is a very complex mixture    and come up with some sort of score of how likely it is this is a rhinovirus or something. And this is what this looks like. If  for example  you used a cell culture that's chronically infected with papilloma  you get a little computer readout here  and our algorithm says it's probably papilloma type   . And that is  in fact  what these particular cell cultures are chronically infected with. So let's do something a little bit harder. We put the beeper in the clinic. When somebody shows up  and the hospital doesn't know what to do because they can't diagnose it  they call us. That's the idea  and we're setting this up in the Bay Area. And so  this case report happened three weeks ago. We have a    year old healthy woman  no travel history   unclear   doesn't smoke  doesn't drink.    day history of fevers  night sweats  bloody sputum    she's coughing up blood    muscle pain. She went to the clinic  and they gave her antibiotics and then sent her home. She came back after ten days of fever  right  Still has the fever  and she's hypoxic    she doesn't have much oxygen in her lungs. They did a CT scan. A normal lung is all sort of dark and black here. All this white stuff    it's not good. This sort of tree and bud formation indicates there's inflammation  there's likely to be infection. OK. So  the patient was treated then with a third generation cephalosporin antibiotic and doxycycline  and on day three  it didn't help  she had progressed to acute failure. They had to intubate her  so they put a tube down her throat and they began to mechanically ventilate her. She could no longer breathe for herself. What to do next  Don't know. Switch antibiotics  so they switched to another antibiotic  Tamiflu. It's not clear why they thought she had the flu  but they switched to Tamiflu. And on day six  they basically threw in the towel. You do an open lung biopsy when you've got no other options. There's an eight percent mortality rate with just doing this procedure  and so basically    and what do they learn from it  You're looking at her open lung biopsy. And I'm no pathologist  but you can't tell much from this. All you can tell is  there's a lot of swelling  bronchiolitis. It was  unrevealing   that's the pathologist's report. And so  what did they test her for  They have their own tests  of course  and so they tested her for over    different assays  for every sort of bacteria and fungus and viral assay you can buy off the shelf  SARS  metapneumovirus  HIV  RSV    all these. Everything came back negative  over         dollars worth of tests. I mean  they went to the max for this woman. And basically on hospital day eight  that's when they called us. They gave us endotracheal aspirate    you know  a little fluid from the throat  from this tube that they got down there    and they gave us this. We put it on the chip  what do we see  Well  we saw parainfluenza  . Well  what the hell's parainfluenza    No one tests for parainfluenza  . No one cares about it. In fact  it's not even really sequenced that much. There's just a little bit of it sequenced. There's almost no epidemiology or studies on it. No one would even consider it  because no one had a clue that it could cause respiratory failure. And why is that  Just lore. There's no data    no data to support whether it causes severe or mild disease. Clearly  we have a case of a healthy person that's going down. OK  that's one case report. I'm going to tell you one last thing in the last two minutes that's unpublished    it's going to come out tomorrow    and it's an interesting case of how you might use this chip to find something new and open a new door. Prostate cancer. I don't need to give you many statistics about prostate cancer. Most of you already know it  third leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S. Lots of risk factors  but there is a genetic predisposition to prostate cancer. For maybe about    percent of prostate cancer  there are folks that are predisposed to it. And the first gene that was mapped in association studies for this  early onset prostate cancer  was this gene called RNASEL. What is that  It's an antiviral defense enzyme. So  we're sitting around and thinking   Why would men who have the mutation    a defect in an antiviral defense system    get prostate cancer  It doesn't make sense    unless  maybe  there's a virus   So  we put tumors     and now we have over     tumors    on our array. And we know who's got defects in RNASEL and who doesn't. And I'm showing you the signal from the chip here  and I'm showing you for the block of retroviral oligos. And what I'm telling you here from the signal  is that men who have a mutation in this antiviral defense enzyme  and have a tumor  often have       percent of the time    a signature which reveals a new retrovirus. OK  that's pretty wild. What is it  So  we clone the whole virus. First of all  I'll tell you that a little automated prediction told us it was very similar to a mouse virus. But that doesn't tell us too much  so we actually clone the whole thing. And the viral genome I'm showing you right here  It's a classic gamma retrovirus  but it's totally new  no one's ever seen it before. Its closest relative is  in fact  from mice  and so we would call this a xenotropic retrovirus  because it's infecting a species other than mice. And this is a little phylogenetic tree to see how it's related to other viruses. We've done it for many patients now  and we can say that they're all independent infections. They all have the same virus  but they're different enough that there's reason to believe that they've been independently acquired. Is it really in the tissue  And I'll end up with this  yes. We take slices of these biopsies of tumor tissue and use material to actually locate the virus  and we find cells here with viral particles in them. These guys really do have this virus. Does this virus cause prostate cancer  Nothing I'm saying here implies causality. I don't know. Is it a link to oncogenesis  I don't know. Is it the case that these guys are just more susceptible to viruses  Could be. And it might have nothing to do with cancer. But now it's a door. We have a strong association between the presence of this virus and a genetic mutation that's been linked to cancer. That's where we're at. So  it opens up more questions than it answers  I'm afraid  but that's what  you know  science is really good at. This was all done by folks in the lab    I cannot take credit for most of this. This is a collaboration between myself and Don. This is the guy who started the project in my lab  and this is the guy who's been doing prostate stuff. Thank you very much.  Applause  Natalie MacMaster  I'm going to just quickly start out with a little bit of music here.  Applause  Thank you   Applause  I took my shoes off to dance  but maybe I'll get at that later. Anyways  I... where to start  Well  I'm really excited to talk a bit about my own upbringing in music and family and all of that  but I'm even more excited for you people to hear about Donnell's amazing family and maybe even a little bit about how we met  and all that sort of thing  but for those of you that may not be familiar with my upbringing  I'm from Cape Breton Island  Nova Scotia  eastern Canada  which is a very  very musical island  and its origins come from Scotland with the music and all the traditions  the dancing  the language  which unfortunately is dying out in Cape Breton. The traditional language is Gaelic  but a lot of the music came from the Gaelic language  and the dancing and the singing and everything  and my bloodline is Scottish through and through  but my mother and father are two very  very musical people. My mom taught me to dance when I was five  and my dad taught me to play fiddle when I was nine. My uncle is a very well known Cape Breton fiddler. His name's Buddy MacMaster  and just a wonderful guy  and we have a great tradition at home called square dancing  and we had parties  great parties at our house and the neighbors' houses  and you talk about kitchen c ilidhs. Well  c ilidh first of all is Gaelic for party  but kitchen party in Cape Breton is very common  and basically somebody drops into the house  and no matter what house you go to in Cape Breton  there's a fiddle there  guaranteed  and I'd say  well there's first of all more fiddlers per capita in Cape Breton than anywhere in the world  so ten chances to one  the fellow who walked in the door could play it  so you'd have someone come into the house  you'd invite them to play a tune  and lo and behold a little party would start up and somebody would dance  and somebody would sing  and all that sort of thing  so it was a wonderful  wonderful way to grow up  and that is where my beginnings in music come from  my surroundings  my family  just my bloodline in itself  and  oh  I've done lots of things with my music. I've recorded lots of CDs. I was nominated for a Grammy and I've won some awards and stuff like that  so that's awesome  but the best part was meeting my husband  and I've actually known Donnell for probably    years now  and I'm going to get into a little bit of  I guess  how music brought us together  but I'm going to introduce you right now to my new husband as of October    Donnell Leahy.  Applause  Donnell Leahy  Thank you. I'm kind of new to the TED experience and I'm glad to be here  but I'm just trying to put it all together  trying to figure all you people out  and I've been here for a short while  and I'm starting to understand a little bit better. So I asked Natalie  what do I do  And she said  just talk about yourself. It's kind of boring  but I'll just tell you a little bit about my family. I'm one of    brothers and sisters from Lakefield  Ontario  an hour and a half northeast of Toronto  and we grew up on a farm. Mom and Dad raised beef cattle  and I'm the oldest boy. There are four girls a little bit older than me. We grew up without a television. People find that strange  but I think it was a great blessing for us. We had a television for a few years  but of course we wasted so much time and the work wasn't getting done  so out went the television. We grew up playing  Mom's from Cape Breton  coincidentally. Mom and Natalie's mother knew each other. We grew up playing  and used to dance together  right  yeah. we played by ear and I think that's important for us because we were not really exposed to a lot of different styles of music. We learned to play the instruments  but we kind of had to come from within or go from within  because we didn't watch television  we didn't listen to a lot of radio. We went to church and to school sometimes  and farmed and played music  so we were able  I think  at a very critical age to develop our own style  our own self  and my mother plays  my father plays  and the style that came from the Ottawa Valley in Ontario  we call it French Canadian style but it originated in logging camps. Years ago  hundreds of men would go up for the winter to the camps in Northern Ontario and in Quebec  and they were all different cultures  and the Irish  the French  Scottish  German  they'd all meet  and of course at night  they'd play cards and step dance and play fiddles  and over the course of many years  the Ottawa Valley fiddling kind of evolved and the Ottawa Valley step dancing evolved  so that's  I kind of started out with that style and I quickly started doing my own thing  and then I met Natalie  and I was exposed to the great Cape Breton fiddling. That's how we met.  Laughter  You tell them.  Laughter  NM  You want to or no   Laughter  Well I guess I have to now. Well  it's just so interesting that Donnell's upbringing was very similar to mine  and I actually saw Donnell play when I was about    years old  and he and his family came to Inverness  which is about    minutes from where I lived  and I was just blown away  like  it was just amazing  and you'll find out why pretty soon here  but I couldn't believe the fiddling and Mom was there with me  and she was saying   Donnell's mother came up on stage and danced with her children  and Mom was saying   That's Julie MacDonnell  I used to dance with her when we were kids. Little did I think our children would be playing instruments  you know  playing music  yeah.  Twelve years  er     years later little did she think her kids would be getting married  but anyway  so  then I got a phone call about  I dunno  seven years later. I was     first or second year of college  and it was Donnell  and he said  Hi  you probably don't know me but my name is Donnell Leahy.  And I said   I know you. I have a tape of yours at home.  And he said   Well  I'm in Truro   which is where I was  and he asked me out for supper. That's it.  Laughter  Then   Will I keep going   Laughs  Then we dated for two years  broke up for     got back together and got married.  Laughter   Applause  DL  So anyway  we're running out of time  so I'll just get to it. I'm going to play a piece of music for you. It's actually a Scottish piece I've chosen. I starts out with a slow air. Airs were played in Europe at burials  as a body was carried out from the wake site to the burial site  the procession was led by a piper or a fiddle player. I'll quickly play a short part of the air  and then I'm going to get into kind of a crazy tune that is very difficult to play when you're not warmed up  so  if I mess it up  pretend you like it anyway. It's called The Banks. NM  Well  we're gonna play one together now.  Applause  We're laughing  like  because our styles are totally different  as you can hear. And so  you know  Donnell and I are actually in the process of writing new pieces of music together that we can play  but we don't have any of those ready. We just started yesterday.  Laughter  So we're gonna play something together anyway. DL  With one minute. NM  With one minute. DL  You start. NM  No  you have to start  because you've got to do your thing. NM  I'm not tuned. Hold on. NM  I feel like I'm in the duck or the bird pose right now.  Laughter  Announcer  Great news  they're running late downstairs. We've got another    minutes. NM  Okay. Sure. All right  okay. Let's get her going.  Applause  DL  What do you want to play  NM  Well  um... NM  Uh  sure. DL  How fast  NM  Not too fast. DL  We're going to play a tune and Natalie's going to accompany me on the piano. The Cape Breton piano playing is just awesome. It's very rhythmic and  you'll see it. My mom plays piano  and she learned to play before they had a piano at home in Cape Breton. Before Mom's family had a piano in Cape Breton  she learned to play the rhythms on a piece of board  and the fiddlers would all congregate to play on the cold winter's evenings and Mom would be banging on this board  so when they bought a piano  they bought it in Toronto and had it taken by train and brought in on a horse  a horse and sleigh to the house. It became the only piano in the region  and Mom said she could basically play as soon as the piano arrived  she could play it because she had learned all these rhythms. Anyway  we found the piano last year and were able to bring it back home. We purchased it. It had gone through  like  five or six families  and it was just a big thing for us  and we found actually an old picture of somebody and their family years ago. Anyway  I'm blabbering on here. NM  No  I want you to tell them about Leahy. DL  What about Leahy   Laughter  NM  Just tell them what  DL  She wants me to talk about  We have a band named Leahy. There's    siblings. We  um  What will I tell them   Laughter  We opened  NM  No surgeries. DL  No surgeries  oh yeah. We had a great opportunity. We opened for Shania Twain for two years on her international tour. It was a big thing for us  and now all my sisters are off having babies and the boys are all getting married  so we're staying close to home for  I guess  another couple of weeks. What can I say  I don't know what to say  Natalie. We  uh...  Laughter  NM  Is this what marriage is about  I like it.  Applause  DL  Oh yeah  okay  in my family we had seven girls  four boys  we had two fiddles and one piano  and of course we were all fighting to play on the instruments  so dad and mom set a rule that you couldn't kick anyone off the instrument. You had to wait until they were finished  so of course  what we would do is we'd get on the piano and you wouldn't even get off to eat  because you wouldn't want to give it up to your brother or sister  and they'd wait and wait and wait  and it'd be midnight and you'd be still sitting there on the piano  but it was their way to get us to practice. Will we play a tune  NM  It worked. DL  It worked. Sorry  I hate to carry on... So this is our last number  and we'll feature Nat on piano. Okay  play in  how about A  Right when I was    was when I first got interested in solar energy. My family had moved from Fort Lee  New Jersey to California  and we moved from the snow to lots of heat  and gas lines. There was gas rationing in     . The energy crisis was in full bore. I started reading Popular Science magazine  and I got really excited about the potential of solar energy to try and solve that crisis. I had just taken trigonometry in high school  I learned about the parabola and how it could concentrate rays of light to a single focus. That got me very excited. And I really felt that there would be potential to build some kind of thing that could concentrate light. So  I started this company called Solar Devices. And this was a company where I built parabolas  I took metal shop  and I remember walking into metal shop building parabolas and Stirling engines. And I was building this Stirling engine over on the lathe  and all the biker guys    motorcycle guys    came over and said   You're building a bong  aren't you   And I said   No  it's a Stirling engine. It really is.  But they didn't believe me. I sold the plans for this engine and for this dish in the back of Popular Science magazine  for four dollars each. And I earned enough money to pay for my first year of Caltech. It was a really big excitement for me to get into Caltech. And my first year at Caltech  I continued the business. But then  in the second year of Caltech  they started grading. The whole first year was pass fail  but the second year was graded. I wasn't able to keep up with the business  and I ended up with a    year detour. My dream had been to convert solar energy at a very practical cost  but then I had this big detour. First  the coursework at Caltech. Then  when I graduated from Caltech  the IBM P.C. came out  and I got addicted to the IBM P.C. in     . And then in       Lotus       came out  and I was completely blown away by Lotus      . I began operating my business with        began writing add ins for        wrote a natural language interface to      . I started an educational software company after I joined Lotus  and then I started Idealab so I could have a roof under which I could build multiple companies in succession Then  much much later    in       very recently    the new California energy crisis    or what was purported to be a big energy crisis    was coming. And I was trying to figure if there was some way we could build something that would capitalize on that and try and get people back up energy  in case the crisis really came. And I started looking at how we could build battery back up systems that could give people five hours     hours  maybe even a full day  or three days' worth of back up power. I'm glad you heard earlier today  batteries are unbelievably energy    lack of density compared to fuel. So much more energy can be stored with fuel than with batteries. You'd have to fill your entire parking space of one garage space just to give yourself four hours of battery back up. And I concluded  after researching every other technology that we could deploy for storing energy    flywheels  different formulations of batteries    it just wasn't practical to store energy. So what about making energy  Maybe we could make energy. I tried to figure out    maybe solar's become attractive. It's been    years since I was doing this  let me go back and look at what's been happening with solar cells. And the price had gone down from    dollars a watt to about four or five dollars a watt  but it stabilized. And it really needed to get much lower than that to be cost effective. I studied all the new things that had happened in solar cells  and was trying to look for ways we could innovate and make solar cells more inexpensively. There are a lot of new things that are happening to do that  but fundamentally the process requires a tremendous amount of energy. Some people even say it takes more energy to make a solar cell than it will give out in its entire life. Hopefully  if we can reduce the amount of energy it takes to make the cells  that will become more practical. But right now  you pretty much have to take silicon  put it in an oven at      degrees Fahrenheit for    hours  to make the cells. A lot of people are working on things to try and reduce that  but I didn't have anything to contribute in that area. So I tried to figure out what other way could we try and make cost effective solar electricity. So I thought of an idea    what if we collect the sun with a large reflector    like I had been thinking about way back when  when I was in high school    but maybe with modern technology we could make a cheaper  large collector  concentrate it to a small converter  and then the conversion device wouldn't have to be as expensive  because it's much smaller  rather than solar cells  which have to be covering the entire surface area that you want to gather sun from. This seemed practical now  because a lot of new technologies had come in the    years since I had last looked at it. First of all  there was a lot of new manufacturing techniques  not to mention really cheap miniature motors    brushless motors  servo motors  stepper motors  that are used in printers and scanners and things like that. So  that's a breakthrough. Of course  inexpensive microprocessors and then a very important breakthrough    genetic algorithms. I'll be very short on genetic algorithms. It's a powerful way of solving intractable problems using natural selection. You take a problem that you can't solve with a pure mathematical answer  you build an evolutionary system to try multiple tries at guessing  you add sex    where you take half of one solution and half of another and then make new mutations    and you use natural selection to kill off not as good solutions. Usually  with a genetic algorithm on a computer today  with a three gigahertz processor you can solve many  many formerly intractable problems in just a matter of minutes. We tried to come up with a way to use genetic algorithms to create a new type of concentrator. And I'll show you what we came up with. Traditionally  concentrators look like this. Those shapes are parabolas. They take all the parallel incoming rays and focus it to a single spot. They have to track the sun  because they have to be pointing directly at the sun. They usually have about a one degree acceptance angle  meaning once they're more than about a degree off  none of the sunlight rays will hit the focus. So we tried to come up with a way of making a non tracking collector  a collector that would gather much more than one degree of light  with no moving parts. So we created this genetic algorithm to try this out  we made a model in XL of a multi surface reflector  and an amazing thing evolved  literally evolved  from trying a billion cycles  a billion different attempts  with a fitness function that defined how can you collect the most light  from the most angles  over a day  from the sun. And this is the shape that evolved. It's this non tracking collector with these six tuba like horns  and each of them collect light in the following way    if the sunlight strikes right here  it might bounce right to the center  the hot spot  directly  but if the sun is off axis and comes from the side  it might hit two places and take two bounces. So for direct light  it takes only one bounce  for off axis light it might take two  and for extreme off axis  it might take three. Your efficiency goes down with more bounces  because you lose about    percent with each bounce  but this allowed us to collect light from a plus or minus    degree angle. So  about two and a half hours of the day we could collect with a stationary component. Solar cells collect light for four and a half hours though. On an average adjusted day  a solar cell    because the sun's moving across the sky  the solar cell is going down with a sine wave function of performance at the off axis angles. It collects about four and a half average hours of sunlight a day. So  even this  although it was great with no moving parts    we could achieve high temperatures    wasn't enough. We needed to beat solar cells. So we took a look at another idea. We looked at a way to break up a parabola into individual petals that would track. So what you see here is    separate petals  that each could be controlled with individual microprocessors that would only cost a dollar. You can buy a two megahertz microprocessor for a dollar now. And you can buy stepper motors that pretty much never wear out because they have no brushes  for a dollar. We can control all    of these petals for under    dollars and what this would allow us to do is not have to move the focus any more  but only move the petals. The whole system would have a much lower profile  but also we could gather sunlight for six and a half to seven hours a day. Now that we have concentrated sunlight  what are we going to put at the center to convert sunlight to electricity  So we tried to look at all the different heat engines that have been used in history to try and convert sunlight to electricity  or heat to electricity. And one of the great ones of all time  James Watt's steam engine of      was a major  major breakthrough. James Watt didn't actually invent the steam engine  he just refined it. But  his refinements were incredible. He added new linear motion guides to the pistons  he added a condenser to cool the steam outside the cylinder  he made the engine double acting so it had double the power. Those were major breakthroughs. I mean  all of the improvements he made    and it's justifiable that our measure of energy  the watt  today is named after him. So we looked at this engine  and this had some potential. Steam engines are dangerous  and they had tremendous impact on the world  as you know    industrial revolution and ships and locomotives. But they're usually good to be large  so they're not good for distributed power generation. But they're also very high pressure  so they're dangerous. Another type of engine is the hot air engine. And the hot air engine also was not invented by Robert Stirling  but Robert Stirling came along in      and radically improved it. This engine  because it was so interesting    it only worked on air  no steam    has led to hundreds of creative designs over the years that use the Stirling engine principle. But after the Stirling engine  Otto came along  and also  he didn't invent the internal combustion engine  he just refined it. He showed it in Paris in       and it was a major achievement because it brought the power density of the engine way up. You could now get a lot more power in a lot smaller space  and that allowed the engine to be used for mobile applications. So  once you have mobility  now you're making a lot of engines because you've got lots of units  as opposed to steam ships or big factories where you're not making as many units  so this was the engine that ended up benefiting from mass production where all the other engines didn't benefit. So  because it went into mass production  costs were reduced      years of refinement  emissions were reduced  tremendous production value. There have been hundreds of millions of internal combustion engines built  compared to thousands of Stirling engines built. And not nearly as many small steam engines being built anymore  only large ones for big operations. So after looking at these three  and    others  we concluded that the Stirling engine would be the best one to use. I want to give you a brief explanation of how we looked at it and how it works. So we tried to look at the Stirling engine in a new way  because it was practical    weight no longer mattered for our application The internal combustion engine took off because weight mattered because you were moving around. But if you're trying to generate solar energy in a static place the weight doesn't matter so much. The other thing we discovered is that efficiency doesn't matter so much if your energy source is free. Normally  efficiency is crucial because the fuel cost of your engine over its life dwarfs the cost of the engine. But if your fuel source is free  then the only thing that matters is the up front capital cost of the engine. So you don't want to optimize for efficiency  you want to optimize for power per dollar. So using that new twist  with the new criteria  we thought we could re look at the Stirling engine  and also bring genetic algorithms in. Basically  Robert Stirling didn't have Gordon Moore before him to get us three gigahertz of processor power. So we took the same genetic algorithm that we used earlier to make that concentrator  which didn't work out for us  to optimize the Stirling engine  and make its design sizes and all of its dimensions the exact optimum to get the most power per dollar  irrespective of weight  irrespective of size  to get the most conversion of solar energy  because the sun is free. And that's the process we took    let me show you how the engine works. The simplest heat engine  or hot air engine  of all time would be this    take a box  a steel canister  with a piston. Put a flame under it  the piston moves up. Take it off the flame and pour water on it  or let it cool down  the piston moves down. That's a heat engine. That's basically the most fundamental heat engine you could possibly have. The problem is the efficiency is one hundredth of one percent  because you're heating all the metal of the chamber and then cooling all the metal of the chamber each time. And you're only getting power from the air that's heating at the same time  but you're wasting all the energy heating the metal and cooling the metal. So someone came up with a very clever idea  to    instead of heating the whole cylinder and cooling the whole cylinder  what about if you put a displacer inside    a little thing that shuttles the air back and forth. You move that up and down with a little bit of energy but now you're only shifting the air down to the hot end and up to the cold end  down to the hot end and up to the cold end. So  now you're not alternately heating and cooling the metal  you're just alternately heating and cooling the air. That allows you to get the efficiency up from a hundredth of a percent to about two percent. And then Robert Stirling came along with this genius idea  which was  well I'm still not heating the metal now  with this kind of engine  but I'm still reheating all the air. I'm still heating the air every time and cooling the air every time. What about if I put a thermal sponge in the middle  in the passageway between where the air has to move between hot and cold  So he made fine wires  and cracked glass  and all different kinds of materials to be a heat sponge. So when the air pushes up to go from the hot end to the cold end  it puts some heat into the sponge. And then when the air comes back after it's been cooled it picks up that heat again. So you're reusing your energy five or six times  and that brings the efficiency up between    and    percent It's a little known  but brilliant  genius invention of Robert Stirling that takes the hot air engine from being somewhat impractical    like I found out when I made the real simple version in high school    to very potentially possible  once you get the efficiency up  if you can design this to be low enough cost. So we really set out on a path to try and make the lowest cost possible. We built a huge mathematical model of how a Stirling engine works. We applied the genetic algorithm. We got the results from that for the optimal engine. We built engines    so we built     different engines over the last two years. We measured each one  we readjusted the model to what we measured  and then we led that to the current prototype. It led to a very compact  inexpensive engine  and this is what the engine looks like. Let me show you what it looks like in real life. So this is the engine. It's just a small cylinder down here which holds the generator inside and all the linkage and it's the hot cap    the hot cylinder on the top    this part gets hot  this part is cool  and electricity comes out. The exact converse is also true. If you put electricity in  this will get hot and this will get cold  you get refrigeration. So it's a complete reversible cycle  a very efficient cycle  and quite a simple thing to make. So now you put the two things together. So you have the engine  now what if you combine the petals and the engine in the center  The petals track and the engine gets the concentrated sunlight  take that heat and turn it into electricity. This is what the first prototype of our system looked like together with the petals and the engine in the center. This is being run out in the sun  and now I want to show you what the actual thing looks like. Thank you. So this is a unit with the    petals These petals cost about a dollar each    they're lightweight  injection molded plastic  aluminized. The mechanism to control each petal is below there with a microprocessor on each one. There are thermocouples on the engine    little sensors that detect the heat when the sunlight strikes them. Each petal adjusts itself separately to keep the highest temperature on it. When the sun comes out in the morning  the petals will seek the sun  find it by searching for the highest temperature About a minute and a half or two minutes after the rays are striking the hot cap the engine will be warm enough to start and then the engine will generate electricity for about six and a half hours a day    six and a half to seven hours as the sun moves across the sky A critical part that we can take advantage of is that we have these inexpensive microprocessors and each one of these petals are autonomous  and each one of these petals figures out where the sun is with no user set up. So you don't have to tell what latitude  longitude you're at  you don't have to tell what your roof slope angle is  you don't have to tell what orientation. It doesn't really care. What it does is it searches to find the hottest spot  it searches again a half an hour later  it searches again a day later  it searches again a month later. It basically figures out where on Earth you are by watching the direction the sun moves  so you don't have to actually enter anything about that. The way the unit works is  when the sun comes out the engine will start and you get power out here. We have A.C. and D.C.  get    volts D.C.  so that could be used for certain applications. We have an inverter in there  so you get     volts A.C. and you also get hot water. The hot water's optional. You don't have to use the hot water  it will cool itself. But you can use it to optionally heat hot water and that brings the efficiency up even higher because some of the heat that you would normally be rejecting  you can now use as useful energy  whether it's for a pool or hot water. Let me show you a quick movie of what this looks like running. So this is the first test where we took it outside and each of the petals were individually seeking. And what they do is step  very coarsely at first  and then very finely afterward. Once they get a temperature reading on the thermocouple indicating they found the sun  then they slow down and do a fine search  then all the petals will move into position  and then the engine will start. So  we've been working on this for the last two years. We're very excited about the progress  we do have a very long way to go though still  and let me tell you a little bit more about that. This is how we envision it would be in a residential installation  you'd probably have more than one unit on your roof. It could be on your roof  or in your backyard  or somewhere else. You don't have to have enough units to power your entire house  you just save money with each incremental one you add. So you're still using the grid potentially  in this type of application  to be your back up supply    of course  you can't use these at night  and you can't use these on cloudy days. But by reducing your energy use  pretty much at the peak times    usually when you have you air conditioning on  or other times like that    this generates the peak power at the peak usage time  so it's very complementary in that sense. This is how we would envision a residential application. We also think there's very big potential for energy farms  especially in remote land where there happens to be a lot of sun. It's a really good combination of those two factors. It turns out there's a lot of powerful sun all around the world  obviously  but in special places where it happens to be relatively inexpensive to place these and also in many more places where there is high wind power. So an example of that is  here's the map of the United States. Pretty much everywhere that's not green or blue is a really ideal place  but even the green or blue areas are good  just not as good as the places that are red  orange and yellow. But the hot sport right around Las Vegas and Death Valley and that area is very  very good. And all this does is affect the payback period  it doesn't mean that you couldn't use solar energy  you could use solar energy anywhere on Earth. It just affects the payback period if you're comparing to grid supplied electricity. But if you don't have grid supplied electricity  then the whole question of payback is a different one entirely. It's just how many watts do you get per dollar  and how could you benefit from that using that power to change your life in some way. This is the map of the United States. This is the map of the whole Earth and again  you can see a huge swathe in the middle of pretty much where a large part of the population is  there's tremendous chances for solar energy. And of course  look at Africa. It's just unbelievable what the potential is to take advantage of solar energy there  and I'm really excited to talk more about finding ways we can help with that. So  in conclusion  I would say my journey has shown me that you can revisit old ideas in a new light  and sometimes ideas that have been discarded in the past can be practical now if you apply some new technology or new twists. We believe we're getting very close to something practical and affordable. Our short term goal for this is to be half the price of solar cells and our longer term goal is to be less than a five year payback. And at less than a five year payback  all of a sudden this becomes very economic So you don't have to just want to have a feel good attitude about energy to want to have one of these. It just makes economic sense. Right now  solar paybacks are between    and    years. If you get it down below five years then it becomes almost a no brainer because the interest to own it    someone else will finance it for you and you can just make money  basically from day one. So that's our real powerful goal that we're really shooting for in the company. Two other things that I learned that were very surprising to me    one was how casual we are about energy. I was walking from the elevator over here  and even just looking at the stage right now    so there's probably        watt lights right now. There's        watts of light pouring on the stage  one horsepower is     watts  at full power. So there's basically    horses running at full speed just to keep the stage lit. Not to mention the     horses that are probably running right now to keep the airconditioning going. And it's just amazing  walk in the elevator and there's lights on in the elevator. Of course  now I'm very sensitive at home when we leave the lights on by mistake. But  everywhere around us we have insatiable use for energy because it's so cheap. And it's cheap because we've been subsidized by energy that's been concentrated by the sun. Basically  oil is solar energy concentrate. It's been pounded for a billion years with a lot of energy to make it have all that energy contained in it. And we don't have a birthright to just use that up as fast as we are  I think. And it would be great if we could find a way to make our energy usage renewable  where as we're using the energy we're creating it at the same pace  and I really hope we can get there. Thank you very much  you've been a great audience. I wrote a letter last week talking about the work of the foundation  sharing some of the problems. And Warren Buffet had recommended I do that    being honest about what was going well  what wasn't  and making it kind of an annual thing. A goal I had there was to draw more people in to work on those problems  because I think there are some very important problems that don't get worked on naturally. That is  the market does not drive the scientists  the communicators  the thinkers  the governments to do the right things. And only by paying attention to these things and having brilliant people who care and draw other people in can we make as much progress as we need to. So this morning I'm going to share two of these problems and talk about where they stand. But before I dive into those I want to admit that I am an optimist. Any tough problem  I think it can be solved. And part of the reason I feel that way is looking at the past. Over the past century  average lifespan has more than doubled. Another statistic  perhaps my favorite  is to look at childhood deaths. As recently as           million children were born  and    million of those died before the age of five. Five years ago      million children were born    so  more    and less than    million of them died before the age of five. So that's a factor of two reduction of the childhood death rate. It's a phenomenal thing. Each one of those lives matters a lot. And the key reason we were able to it was not only rising incomes but also a few key breakthroughs  vaccines that were used more widely. For example  measles was four million of the deaths back as recently as      and now is under        . So we really can make changes. The next breakthrough is to cut that    million in half again. And I think that's doable in well under    years. Why  Well there's only a few diseases that account for the vast majority of those deaths  diarrhea  pneumonia and malaria. So that brings us to the first problem that I'll raise this morning  which is how do we stop a deadly disease that's spread by mosquitos  Well  what's the history of this disease  It's been a severe disease for thousands of years. In fact  if we look at the genetic code  it's the only disease we can see that people who lived in Africa actually evolved several things to avoid malarial deaths. Deaths actually peaked at a bit over five million in the     s. So it was absolutely gigantic. And the disease was all over the world. A terrible disease. It was in the United States. It was in Europe. People didn't know what caused it until the early     s  when a British military man figured out that it was mosquitos. So it was everywhere. And two tools helped bring the death rate down. One was killing the mosquitos with DDT. The other was treating the patients with quinine  or quinine derivatives. And so that's why the death rate did come down. Now  ironically  what happened was it was eliminated from all the temperate zones  which is where the rich countries are. So we can see        it's everywhere.       it's still most places.       the U.S. and most of Europe have gotten rid of it.       you've gotten most of the northern areas. And more recently you can see it's just around the equator. And so this leads to the paradox that because the disease is only in the poorer countries  it doesn't get much investment. For example  there's more money put into baldness drugs than are put into malaria. Now  baldness  it's a terrible thing. And rich men are afflicted. And so that's why that priority has been set. But  malaria    even the million deaths a year caused by malaria greatly understate its impact. Over     million people at any one time are suffering from it. It means that you can't get the economies in these areas going because it just holds things back so much. Now  malaria is of course transmitted by mosquitos. I brought some here  just so you could experience this. We'll let those roam around the auditorium a little bit. There's no reason only poor people should have the experience. Those mosquitos are not infected. So we've come up with a few new things. We've got bed nets. And bed nets are a great tool. What it means is the mother and child stay under the bed net at night  so the mosquitos that bite late at night can't get at them. And when you use indoor spraying with DDT and those nets you can cut deaths by over    percent. And that's happened now in a number of countries. It's great to see. But we have to be careful because malaria    the parasite evolves and the mosquito evolves. So every tool that we've ever had in the past has eventually become ineffective. And so you end up with two choices. If you go into a country with the right tools and the right way  you do it vigorously  you can actually get a local eradication. And that's where we saw the malaria map shrinking. Or  if you go in kind of half heartedly  for a period of time you'll reduce the disease burden  but eventually those tools will become ineffective  and the death rate will soar back up again. And the world has gone through this where it paid attention and then didn't pay attention. Now we're on the upswing. Bed net funding is up. There's new drug discovery going on. Our foundation has backed a vaccine that's going into phase three trial that starts in a couple months. And that should save over two thirds of the lives if it's effective. So we're going to have these new tools. But that alone doesn't give us the road map. Because the road map to get rid of this disease involves many things. It involves communicators to keep the funding high  to keep the visibility high  to tell the success stories. It involves social scientists  so we know how to get not just    percent of the people to use the bed nets  but    percent. We need mathematicians to come in and simulate this  to do Monte Carlo things to understand how these tools combine and work together. Of course we need drug companies to give us their expertise. We need rich world governments to be very generous in providing aid for these things. And so as these elements come together  I'm quite optimistic that we will be able to eradicate malaria. Now let me turn to a second question  a fairly different question  but I'd say equally important. And this is  How do you make a teacher great  It seems like the kind of question that people would spend a lot of time on  and we'd understand very well. And the answer is  really  that we don't. Let's start with why this is important. Well  all of us here  I'll bet  had some great teachers. We all had a wonderful education. That's part of the reason we're here today  part of the reason we're successful. I can say that  even though I'm a college drop out. I had great teachers. In fact  in the United States  the teaching system has worked fairly well. There are fairly effective teachers in a narrow set of places. So the top    percent of students have gotten a good education. And those top    percent have been the best in the world  if you measure them against the other top    percent. And they've gone on to create the revolutions in software and biotechnology and keep the U.S. at the forefront. Now  the strength for those top    percent is starting to fade on a relative basis  but even more concerning is the education that the balance of people are getting. Not only has that been weak. it's getting weaker. And if you look at the economy  it really is only providing opportunities now to people with a better education. And we have to change this. We have to change it so that people have equal opportunity. We have to change it so that the country is strong and stays at the forefront of things that are driven by advanced education  like science and mathematics. When I first learned the statistics  I was pretty stunned at how bad things are. Over    percent of kids never finish high school. And that had been covered up for a long time because they always took the dropout rate as the number who started in senior year and compared it to the number who finished senior year. Because they weren't tracking where the kids were before that. But most of the dropouts had taken place before that. They had to raise the stated dropout rate as soon as that tracking was done to over    percent. For minority kids  it's over    percent. And even if you graduate from high school  if you're low income  you have less than a    percent chance of ever completing a college degree. If you're low income in the United States  you have a higher chance of going to jail than you do of getting a four year degree. And that doesn't seem entirely fair. So  how do you make education better  Now  our foundation  for the last nine years  has invested in this. There's many people working on it. We've worked on small schools  we've funded scholarships  we've done things in libraries. A lot of these things had a good effect. But the more we looked at it  the more we realized that having great teachers was the very key thing. And we hooked up with some people studying how much variation is there between teachers  between  say  the top quartile    the very best    and the bottom quartile. How much variation is there within a school or between schools  And the answer is that these variations are absolutely unbelievable. A top quartile teacher will increase the performance of their class    based on test scores    by over    percent in a single year. What does that mean  That means that if the entire U.S.  for two years  had top quartile teachers  the entire difference between us and Asia would go away. Within four years we would be blowing everyone in the world away. So  it's simple. All you need are those top quartile teachers. And so you'd say   Wow  we should reward those people. We should retain those people. We should find out what they're doing and transfer that skill to other people.  But I can tell you that absolutely is not happening today. What are the characteristics of this top quartile  What do they look like  You might think these must be very senior teachers. And the answer is no. Once somebody has taught for three years their teaching quality does not change thereafter. The variation is very  very small. You might think these are people with master's degrees. They've gone back and they've gotten their Master's of Education. This chart takes four different factors and says how much do they explain teaching quality. That bottom thing  which says there's no effect at all  is a master's degree. Now  the way the pay system works is there's two things that are rewarded. One is seniority. Because your pay goes up and you vest into your pension. The second is giving extra money to people who get their master's degree. But it in no way is associated with being a better teacher. Teach for America  slight effect. For math teachers majoring in math there's a measurable effect. But  overwhelmingly  it's your past performance. There are some people who are very good at this. And we've done almost nothing to study what that is and to draw it in and to replicate it  to raise the average capability    or to encourage the people with it to stay in the system. You might say   Do the good teachers stay and the bad teacher's leave   The answer is  on average  the slightly better teachers leave the system. And it's a system with very high turnover. Now  there are a few places    very few    where great teachers are being made. A good example of one is a set of charter schools called KIPP. KIPP means Knowledge Is Power. It's an unbelievable thing. They have    schools    mostly middle schools  some high schools    and what goes on is great teaching. They take the poorest kids  and over    percent of their high school graduates go to four year colleges. And the whole spirit and attitude in those schools is very different than in the normal public schools. They're team teaching. They're constantly improving their teachers. They're taking data  the test scores  and saying to a teacher   Hey  you caused this amount of increase.  They're deeply engaged in making teaching better. When you actually go and sit in one of these classrooms  at first it's very bizarre. I sat down and I thought   What is going on   The teacher was running around  and the energy level was high. I thought   I'm in the sports rally or something. What's going on   And the teacher was constantly scanning to see which kids weren't paying attention  which kids were bored  and calling kids rapidly  putting things up on the board. It was a very dynamic environment  because particularly in those middle school years    fifth through eighth grade    keeping people engaged and setting the tone that everybody in the classroom needs to pay attention  nobody gets to make fun of it or have the position of the kid who doesn't want to be there. Everybody needs to be involved. And so KIPP is doing it. How does that compare to a normal school  Well  in a normal school  teachers aren't told how good they are. The data isn't gathered. In the teacher's contract  it will limit the number of times the principal can come into the classroom    sometimes to once per year. And they need advanced notice to do that. So imagine running a factory where you've got these workers  some of them just making crap and the management is told   Hey  you can only come down here once a year  but you need to let us know  because we might actually fool you  and try and do a good job in that one brief moment.  Even a teacher who wants to improve doesn't have the tools to do it. They don't have the test scores  and there's a whole thing of trying to block the data. For example  New York passed a law that said that the teacher improvement data could not be made available and used in the tenure decision for the teachers. And so that's sort of working in the opposite direction. But I'm optimistic about this  I think there are some clear things we can do. First of all  there's a lot more testing going on  and that's given us the picture of where we are. And that allows us to understand who's doing it well  and call them out  and find out what those techniques are. Of course  digital video is cheap now. Putting a few cameras in the classroom and saying that things are being recorded on an ongoing basis is very practical in all public schools. And so every few weeks teachers could sit down and say   OK  here's a little clip of something I thought I did well. Here's a little clip of something I think I did poorly. Advise me    when this kid acted up  how should I have dealt with that   And they could all sit and work together on those problems. You can take the very best teachers and kind of annotate it  have it so everyone sees who is the very best at teaching this stuff. You can take those great courses and make them available so that a kid could go out and watch the physics course  learn from that. If you have a kid who's behind  you would know you could assign them that video to watch and review the concept. And in fact  these free courses could not only be available just on the Internet  but you could make it so that DVDs were always available  and so anybody who has access to a DVD player can have the very best teachers. And so by thinking of this as a personnel system  we can do it much better. Now there's a book actually  about KIPP    the place that this is going on    that Jay Matthews  a news reporter  wrote    called   Work Hard  Be Nice.  And I thought it was so fantastic. It gave you a sense of what a good teacher does. I'm going to send everyone here a free copy of this book. Now  we put a lot of money into education  and I really think that education is the most important thing to get right for the country to have as strong a future as it should have. In fact we have in the stimulus bill    it's interesting    the House version actually had money in it for these data systems  and it was taken out in the Senate because there are people who are threatened by these things. But I    I'm optimistic. I think people are beginning to recognize how important this is  and it really can make a difference for millions of lives  if we get it right. I only had time to frame those two problems. There's a lot more problems like that    AIDS  pneumonia    I can just see you're getting excited  just at the very name of these things. And the skill sets required to tackle these things are very broad. You know  the system doesn't naturally make it happen. Governments don't naturally pick these things in the right way. The private sector doesn't naturally put its resources into these things. So it's going to take brilliant people like you to study these things  get other people involved    and you're helping to come up with solutions. And with that  I think there's some great things that will come out of it. Thank you. I am a writer. Writing books is my profession but it's more than that  of course. It is also my great lifelong love and fascination. And I don't expect that that's ever going to change. But  that said  something kind of peculiar has happened recently in my life and in my career  which has caused me to have to recalibrate my whole relationship with this work. And the peculiar thing is that I recently wrote this book  this memoir called  Eat  Pray  Love  which  decidedly unlike any of my previous books  went out in the world for some reason  and became this big  mega sensation  international bestseller thing. The result of which is that everywhere I go now  people treat me like I'm doomed. Seriously    doomed  doomed  Like  they come up to me now  all worried  and they say   Aren't you afraid you're never going to be able to top that  Aren't you afraid you're going to keep writing for your whole life and you're never again going to create a book that anybody in the world cares about at all  ever again   So that's reassuring  you know. But it would be worse  except for that I happen to remember that over    years ago  when I was a teenager  when I first started telling people that I wanted to be a writer  I was met with this same sort of fear based reaction. And people would say   Aren't you afraid you're never going to have any success  Aren't you afraid the humiliation of rejection will kill you  Aren't you afraid that you're going to work your whole life at this craft and nothing's ever going to come of it and you're going to die on a scrap heap of broken dreams with your mouth filled with bitter ash of failure   Like that  you know. The answer    the short answer to all those questions is   Yes.  Yes  I'm afraid of all those things. And I always have been. And I'm afraid of many  many more things besides that people can't even guess at  like seaweed and other things that are scary. But  when it comes to writing  the thing that I've been sort of thinking about lately  and wondering about lately  is why  You know  is it rational  Is it logical that anybody should be expected to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this Earth to do. And what is it specifically about creative ventures that seems to make us really nervous about each other's mental health in a way that other careers kind of don't do  you know  Like my dad  for example  was a chemical engineer and I don't recall once in his    years of chemical engineering anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer  you know   That chemical engineering block  John  how's it going   It just didn't come up like that  you know  But to be fair  chemical engineers as a group haven't really earned a reputation over the centuries for being alcoholic manic depressives. We writers  we kind of do have that reputation  and not just writers  but creative people across all genres  it seems  have this reputation for being enormously mentally unstable. And all you have to do is look at the very grim death count in the   th century alone  of really magnificent creative minds who died young and often at their own hands  you know  And even the ones who didn't literally commit suicide seem to be really undone by their gifts  you know. Norman Mailer  just before he died  last interview  he said   Every one of my books has killed me a little more.  An extraordinary statement to make about your life's work. But we don't even blink when we hear somebody say this  because we've heard that kind of stuff for so long and somehow we've completely internalized and accepted collectively this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inherently linked and that artistry  in the end  will always ultimately lead to anguish. And the question that I want to ask everybody here today is are you guys all cool with that idea  Are you comfortable with that  Because you look at it even from an inch away and  you know    I'm not at all comfortable with that assumption. I think it's odious. And I also think it's dangerous  and I don't want to see it perpetuated into the next century. I think it's better if we encourage our great creative minds to live. And I definitely know that  in my case    in my situation    it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of leaking down that dark path of assumption  particularly given the circumstance that I'm in right now in my career. Which is    you know  like check it out  I'm pretty young  I'm only about    years old. I still have maybe another four decades of work left in me. And it's exceedingly likely that anything I write from this point forward is going to be judged by the world as the work that came after the freakish success of my last book  right  I should just put it bluntly  because we're all sort of friends here now    it's exceedingly likely that my greatest success is behind me. So Jesus  what a thought  That's the kind of thought that could lead a person to start drinking gin at nine o'clock in the morning  and I don't want to go there. I would prefer to keep doing this work that I love. And so  the question becomes  how  And so  it seems to me  upon a lot of reflection  that the way that I have to work now  in order to continue writing  is that I have to create some sort of protective psychological construct  right  I have to sort of find some way to have a safe distance between me  as I am writing  and my very natural anxiety about what the reaction to that writing is going to be  from now on. And  as I've been looking  over the last year  for models for how to do that  I've been sort of looking across time  and I've been trying to find other societies to see if they might have had better and saner ideas than we have about how to help creative people sort of manage the inherent emotional risks of creativity. And that search has led me to ancient Greece and ancient Rome. So stay with me  because it does circle around and back. But  ancient Greece and ancient Rome    people did not happen to believe that creativity came from human beings back then  OK  People believed that creativity was this divine attendant spirit that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source  for distant and unknowable reasons. The Greeks famously called these divine attendant spirits of creativity  daemons.  Socrates  famously  believed that he had a daemon who spoke wisdom to him from afar. The Romans had the same idea  but they called that sort of disembodied creative spirit a genius. Which is great  because the Romans did not actually think that a genius was a particularly clever individual. They believed that a genius was this  sort of magical divine entity  who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist's studio  kind of like Dobby the house elf  and who would come out and sort of invisibly assist the artist with their work and would shape the outcome of that work. So brilliant    there it is  right there  that distance that I'm talking about    that psychological construct to protect you from the results of your work. And everyone knew that this is how it functioned  right  So the ancient artist was protected from certain things  like  for example  too much narcissism  right  If your work was brilliant  you couldn't take all the credit for it  everybody knew that you had this disembodied genius who had helped you. If your work bombed  not entirely your fault  you know  Everyone knew your genius was kind of lame. And this is how people thought about creativity in the West for a really long time. And then the Renaissance came and everything changed  and we had this big idea  and the big idea was  let's put the individual human being at the center of the universe above all gods and mysteries  and there's no more room for mystical creatures who take dictation from the divine. And it's the beginning of rational humanism  and people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual. And for the first time in history  you start to hear people referring to this or that artist as being a genius  rather than having a genius. And I got to tell you  I think that was a huge error. You know  I think that allowing somebody  one mere person to believe that he or she is like  the vessel  you know  like the font and the essence and the source of all divine  creative  unknowable  eternal mystery is just a smidge too much responsibility to put on one fragile  human psyche. It's like asking somebody to swallow the sun. It just completely warps and distorts egos  and it creates all these unmanageable expectations about performance. And I think the pressure of that has been killing off our artists for the last     years. And  if this is true  and I think it is true  the question becomes  what now  Can we do this differently  Maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative mystery. Maybe not. Maybe we can't just erase     years of rational humanistic thought in one    minute speech. And there's probably people in this audience who would raise really legitimate scientific suspicions about the notion of  basically  fairies who follow people around rubbing fairy juice on their projects and stuff. I'm not  probably  going to bring you all along with me on this. But the question that I kind of want to pose is    you know  why not  Why not think about it this way  Because it makes as much sense as anything else I have ever heard in terms of explaining the utter maddening capriciousness of the creative process. A process which  as anybody who has ever tried to make something    which is to say basically everyone here     knows does not always behave rationally. And  in fact  can sometimes feel downright paranormal. I had this encounter recently where I met the extraordinary American poet Ruth Stone  who's now in her   s  but she's been a poet her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in rural Virginia  she would be out working in the fields  and she said she would feel and hear a poem coming at her from over the landscape. And she said it was like a thunderous train of air. And it would come barreling down at her over the landscape. And she felt it coming  because it would shake the earth under her feet. She knew that she had only one thing to do at that point  and that was to  in her words   run like hell.  And she would run like hell to the house and she would be getting chased by this poem  and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pencil fast enough so that when it thundered through her  she could collect it and grab it on the page. And other times she wouldn't be fast enough  so she'd be running and running  and she wouldn't get to the house and the poem would barrel through her and she would miss it and she said it would continue on across the landscape  looking  as she put it  for another poet.  And then there were these times    this is the piece I never forgot    she said that there were moments where she would almost miss it  right  So  she's running to the house and she's looking for the paper and the poem passes through her  and she grabs a pencil just as it's going through her  and then she said  it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it. She would catch the poem by its tail  and she would pull it backwards into her body as she was transcribing on the page. And in these instances  the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact but backwards  from the last word to the first. So when I heard that I was like    that's uncanny  that's exactly what my creative process is like. That's not at all what my creative process is    I'm not the pipeline  I'm a mule  and the way that I have to work is I have to get up at the same time every day  and sweat and labor and barrel through it really awkwardly. But even I  in my mulishness  even I have brushed up against that thing  at times. And I would imagine that a lot of you have too. You know  even I have had work or ideas come through me from a source that I honestly cannot identify. And what is that thing  And how are we to relate to it in a way that will not make us lose our minds  but  in fact  might actually keep us sane  And for me  the best contemporary example that I have of how to do that is the musician Tom Waits  who I got to interview several years ago on a magazine assignment. And we were talking about this  and you know  Tom  for most of his life  he was pretty much the embodiment of the tormented contemporary modern artist  trying to control and manage and dominate these sort of uncontrollable creative impulses that were totally internalized. But then he got older  he got calmer  and one day he was driving down the freeway in Los Angeles  and this is when it all changed for him. And he's speeding along  and all of a sudden he hears this little fragment of melody  that comes into his head as inspiration often comes  elusive and tantalizing  and he wants it  it's gorgeous  and he longs for it  but he has no way to get it. He doesn't have a piece of paper  or a pencil  or a tape recorder. So he starts to feel all of that old anxiety start to rise in him like   I'm going to lose this thing  and I'll be be haunted by this song forever. I'm not good enough  and I can't do it.  And instead of panicking  he just stopped. He just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely novel. He just looked up at the sky  and he said   Excuse me  can you not see that I'm driving    Do I look like I can write down a song right now  If you really want to exist  come back at a more opportune moment when I can take care of you. Otherwise  go bother somebody else today. Go bother Leonard Cohen.  And his whole work process changed after that. Not the work  the work was still oftentimes as dark as ever. But the process  and the heavy anxiety around it was released when he took the genie  the genius out of him where it was causing nothing but trouble  and released it back where it came from  and realized that this didn't have to be this internalized  tormented thing. It could be this peculiar  wondrous  bizarre collaboration  kind of conversation between Tom and the strange  external thing that was not quite Tom. When I heard that story  it started to shift a little bit the way that I worked too  and this idea already saved me once. It saved me when I was in the middle of writing  Eat  Pray  Love   and I fell into one of those sort of pits of despair that we all fall into when we're working on something and it's not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disaster  the worst book ever written. Not just bad  but the worst book ever written. And I started to think I should just dump this project. But then I remembered Tom talking to the open air and I tried it. So I just lifted my face up from the manuscript and I directed my comments to an empty corner of the room. And I said aloud   Listen you  thing  you and I both know that if this book isn't brilliant that is not entirely my fault  right  Because you can see that I am putting everything I have into this  I don't have any more than this. If you want it to be better  you've got to show up and do your part of the deal. But if you don't do that  you know what  the hell with it. I'm going to keep writing anyway because that's my job. And I would please like the record to reflect today that I showed up for my part of the job.  Because    Because in the end it's like this  OK    centuries ago in the deserts of North Africa  people used to gather for these moonlight dances of sacred dance and music that would go on for hours and hours  until dawn. They were always magnificent  because the dancers were professionals and they were terrific  right  But every once in a while  very rarely  something would happen  and one of these performers would actually become transcendent. And I know you know what I'm talking about  because I know you've all seen  at some point in your life  a performance like this. It was like time would stop  and the dancer would sort of step through some kind of portal and he wasn't doing anything different than he had ever done        nights before  but everything would align. And all of a sudden  he would no longer appear to be merely human. He would be lit from within  and lit from below and all lit up on fire with divinity. And when this happened  back then  people knew it for what it was  you know  they called it by its name. They would put their hands together and they would start to chant   Allah  Allah  Allah  God  God  God.  That's God  you know. Curious historical footnote  when the Moors invaded southern Spain  they took this custom with them and the pronunciation changed over the centuries from  Allah  Allah  Allah   to  Ol   ol   ol    which you still hear in bullfights and in flamenco dances. In Spain  when a performer has done something impossible and magic   Allah  ol   ol   Allah  magnificent  bravo   incomprehensible  there it is    a glimpse of God. Which is great  because we need that. But  the tricky bit comes the next morning  for the dancer himself  when he wakes up and discovers that it's Tuesday at    a.m.  and he's no longer a glimpse of God. He's just an aging mortal with really bad knees  and maybe he's never going to ascend to that height again. And maybe nobody will ever chant God's name again as he spins  and what is he then to do with the rest of his life  This is hard. This is one of the most painful reconciliations to make in a creative life. But maybe it doesn't have to be quite so full of anguish if you never happened to believe  in the first place  that the most extraordinary aspects of your being came from you. But maybe if you just believed that they were on loan to you from some unimaginable source for some exquisite portion of your life to be passed along when you're finished  with somebody else. And  you know  if we think about it this way  it starts to change everything. This is how I've started to think  and this is certainly how I've been thinking in the last few months as I've been working on the book that will soon be published  as the dangerously  frighteningly over anticipated follow up to my freakish success. And what I have to sort of keep telling myself when I get really psyched out about that is don't be afraid. Don't be daunted. Just do your job. Continue to show up for your piece of it  whatever that might be. If your job is to dance  do your dance. If the divine  cockeyed genius assigned to your case decides to let some sort of wonderment be glimpsed  for just one moment through your efforts  then  Ol    And if not  do your dance anyhow. And  Ol    to you  nonetheless. I believe this and I feel that we must teach it.  Ol    to you  nonetheless  just for having the sheer human love and stubbornness to keep showing up. Thank you. Thank you. June Cohen  Ol   'Theme and variations' is one of those forms that require a certain kind of intellectual activity  because you are always comparing the variation with the theme that you hold in your mind. You might say that the theme is nature and everything that follows is a variation on the subject. I was asked  I guess about six years ago  to do a series of paintings that in some way would celebrate the birth of Piero della Francesca. And it was very difficult for me to imagine how to paint pictures that were based on Piero until I realized that I could look at Piero as nature    that I would have the same attitude towards looking at Piero della Francesca as I would if I were looking out a window at a tree. And that was enormously liberating to me. Perhaps it's not a very insightful observation  but that really started me on a path to be able to do a kind of theme and variations based on a work by Piero  in this case that remarkable painting that's in the Uffizi   The Duke of Montefeltro   who faces his consort  Battista. Once I realized that I could take some liberties with the subject  I did the following series of drawings. That's the real Piero della Francesca    one of the greatest portraits in human history. And these  I'll just show these without comment. It's just a series of variations on the head of the Duke of Montefeltro  who's a great  great figure in the Renaissance  and probably the basis for Machiavelli's  The Prince.  He apparently lost an eye in battle  which is why he is always shown in profile. And this is Battista. And then I decided I could move them around a little bit    so that for the first time in history  they're facing the same direction. Whoops  Passed each other. And then a visitor from another painting by Piero  this is from  The Resurrection of Christ     as though the cast had just gotten of the set to have a chat. And now  four large panels  this is upper left  upper right  lower left  lower right. Incidentally  I've never understood the conflict between abstraction and naturalism. Since all paintings are inherently abstract to begin with there doesn't seem to be an argument there. On another subject    I was driving in the country one day with my wife  and I saw this sign  and I said   That is a fabulous piece of design.  And she said   What are you talking about   I said   Well  it's so persuasive  because the purpose of that sign is to get you into the garage  and since most people are so suspicious of garages  and know that they're going to be ripped off  they use the word 'reliable.' But everybody says they're reliable. But  reliable Dutchman      Fantastic   Because as soon as you hear the word Dutchman    which is an archaic word  nobody calls Dutch people  Dutchmen  anymore    but as soon as you hear Dutchman  you get this picture of the kid with his finger in the dike  preventing the thing from falling and flooding Holland  and so on. And so the entire issue is detoxified by the use of  Dutchman.  Now  if you think I'm exaggerating at all in this  all you have to do is substitute something else  like  Indonesian.  Or even  French.  Now   Swiss  works  but you know it's going to cost a lot of money. I'm going to take you quickly through the actual process of doing a poster. I do a lot of work for the School of Visual Arts  where I teach  and the director of this school    a remarkable man named Silas Rhodes    often gives you a piece of text and he says   Do something with this.  And so he did. And this was the text     In words as fashion the same rule will hold  Alike fantastic if too new or old  Be not the first by whom the new are tried  Nor yet the last to lay the old aside.  I could make nothing of that. And I really struggled with this one. And the first thing I did  which was sort of in the absence of another idea  was say I'll sort of write it out and make some words big  and I'll have some kind of design on the back somehow  and I was hoping    as one often does    to stumble into something. So I took another crack at it    you've got to keep it moving    and I Xeroxed some words on pieces of colored paper and I pasted them down on an ugly board. I thought that something would come out of it  like  Words rule fantastic new old first last Pope  because it's by Alexander Pope  but I sort of made a mess out of it  and then I thought I'd repeat it in some way so it was legible. So  it was going nowhere. Sometimes  in the middle of a resistant problem  I write down things that I know about it. But you can see the beginning of an idea there  because you can see the word  new  emerging from the  old.  That's what happens. There's a relationship between the old and the new  the new emerges from the context of the old. And then I did some variations of it  but it still wasn't coalescing graphically at all. I had this other version which had something interesting about it in terms of being able to put it together in your mind from clues. The W was clearly a W  the N was clearly an N  even though they were very fragmentary and there wasn't a lot of information in it. Then I got the words  new  and  old  and now I had regressed back to a point where there seemed to be no return. I was really desperate at this point. And so  I do something I'm truthfully ashamed of  which is that I took two drawings I had made for another purpose and I put them together. It says  dreams  at the top. And I was going to do a thing  I say   Well  change the copy. Let it say something about dreams  and come to SVA and you'll sort of fulfill your dreams.  But  to my credit  I was so embarrassed about doing that that I never submitted this sketch. And  finally  I arrived at the following solution. Now  it doesn't look terribly interesting  but it does have something that distinguishes it from a lot of other posters. For one thing  it transgresses the idea of what a poster's supposed to be  which is to be understood and seen immediately  and not explained. I remember hearing all of you in the graphic arts     If you have to explain it  it ain't working.  And one day I woke up and I said   Well  suppose that's not true   So here's what it says in my explanation at the bottom left. It says   Thoughts  This poem is impossible. Silas usually has a better touch with his choice of quotations. This one generates no imagery at all.  I am now exposing myself to my audience  right  Which is something you never want to do professionally.  Maybe the words can make the image without anything else happening. What's the heart of this poem  Don't be trendy if you want to be serious. Is doing the poster this way trendy in itself  I guess one could reduce the idea further by suggesting that the new emerges behind and through the old  like this.  And then I show you a little drawing    you see  you remember that old thing I discarded  Well  I found a way to use it. So  there's that little alternative over there  and I say   Not bad      criticizing myself     but more didactic than visual. Maybe what wants to be said is that old and the new are locked in a dialectical embrace  a kind of dance where each defines the other.  And then more self questioning     Am I being simple minded  Is this the kind of simple that looks obvious  or the kind that looks profound  There's a significant difference. This could be embarrassing. Actually  I realize fear of embarrassment drives me as much as any ambition. Do you think this sort of thing could really attract a student to the school   Well  I think there are two fresh things here    two fresh things. One is the sort of willingness to expose myself to a critical audience  and not to suggest that I am confident about what I'm doing. And as you know  you have to have a front. I mean    you've got to be confident  if you don't believe in your work  who else is going to believe in it  So that's one thing  to introduce the idea of doubt into graphics. That can be a big contribution. The other thing is to actually give you two solutions for the price of one  you get the big one and if you don't like that  how about the little one  And that too is a relatively new idea. And here's just a series of experiments where I ask the question of    does a poster have to be square  Now  this is a little illusion. That poster is not folded. It's not folded  that's a photograph and it's cut on the diagonal. Same cheap trick in the upper left hand corner. And here  a very peculiar poster because  simply because of using the isometric perspective in the computer  it won't sit still in the space. At times  it seems to be wider at the back than the front  and then it shifts. And if you sit here long enough  it'll float off the page into the audience. But  we don't have time. And then an experiment    a little bit about the nature of perspective  where the outside shape is determined by the peculiarity of perspective  but the shape of the bottle    which is identical to the outside shape    is seen frontally. And another piece for the art directors' club is  Anna Rees  casting long shadows. This is another poster from the School of Visual Arts. There were    artists invited to participate in it  and it was one of those things where it was extremely competitive and I didn't want to be embarrassed  so I worked very hard on this. The idea was    and it was a brilliant idea    was to have    posters distributed throughout the city's subway system so every time you got on the subway you'd be passing a different poster  all of which had a different idea of what art is. But I was absolutely stuck on the idea of  art is  and trying to determine what art was. But then I gave up and I said   Well  art is whatever.  And as soon as I said that  I discovered that the word  hat  was hidden in the word  whatever   and that led me to the inevitable conclusion. But then again  it's on my list of didactic posters. My intent is to have a literary accompaniment that explains the poster  in case you don't get it. Now this says   Note to the viewer  I thought I might use a visual cliche of our time    Magritte's everyman    to express the idea that art is mystery  continuity and history. I'm also convinced that  in an age of computer manipulation  surrealism has become banal  a shadow of its former self. The phrase 'Art is whatever' expresses the current inclusiveness that surrounds art making    a sort of 'it ain't what you do  it's the way that you do it' notion. The shadow of Magritte falls across the central part of the poster a poetic event that occurs as the shadow man isolates the word 'hat ' hidden in the word 'whatever.' The four hats shown in the poster suggests how art might be defined  as a thing itself  the worth of the thing  the shadow of the thing  and the shape of the thing. Whatever.  OK. And the one that I did not submit  which I still like  I wanted to use the same phrase. There were wonderful experiments by Bruno Munari on letterforms some years ago    sort of  see how far you could go and still be able to read them. And that idea stuck in my head. But then I took the pieces that I had taken off and put them at the bottom. And  of course those are the remains  and they're so labeled. But what really happens is that you read it as   Art is whatever remains.  Thank you. I want to start out by asking you to think back to when you were a kid  playing with blocks. As you figured out how to reach out and grasp  pick them up and move them around  you were actually learning how to think and solve problems by understanding and manipulating spatial relationships. Spatial reasoning is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of the world around us. So  as a computer scientist inspired by this utility of our interactions with physical objects    along with my adviser Pattie  and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi    I started to wonder    what if when we used a computer  instead of having this one mouse cursor that was a like a digital fingertip moving around a flat desktop  what if we could reach in with both hands and grasp information physically  arranging it the way we wanted  This question was so compelling that we decided to explore the answer  by building Siftables. In a nutshell  a Siftable is an interactive computer the size of a cookie. They're able to be moved around by hand  they can sense each other  they can sense their motion  and they have a screen and a wireless radio. Most importantly  they're physical  so like the blocks  you can move them just by reaching out and grasping. And Siftables are an example of a new ecosystem of tools for manipulating digital information. And as these tools become more physical  more aware of their motion  aware of each other  and aware of the nuance of how we move them  we can start to explore some new and fun interaction styles. So  I'm going to start with some simple examples. This Siftable is configured to show video  and if I tilt it in one direction  it'll roll the video this way  if I tilt it the other way it rolls it backwards. And these interactive portraits are aware of each other. So if I put them next to each other  they get interested. If they get surrounded  they notice that too  they might get a little flustered. And they can also sense their motion and tilt. One of the interesting implications on interaction  we started to realize  was that we could use everyday gestures on data  like pouring a color the way we might pour a liquid. So in this case  we've got three Siftables configured to be paint buckets and I can use them to pour color into that central one  where they get mixed. If we overshoot  we can pour a little bit back. There are also some neat possibilities for education  like language  math and logic games where we want to give people the ability to try things quickly  and view the results immediately. So here I'm    This is a Fibonacci sequence that I'm making with a simple equation program. Here we have a word game that's kind of like a mash up between Scrabble and Boggle. Basically  in every round you get a randomly assigned letter on each Siftable  and as you try to make words it checks against a dictionary. Then  after about    seconds  it reshuffles  and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try. Thank you. So these are some kids that came on a field trip to the Media Lab  and I managed to get them to try it out  and shoot a video. They really loved it. And  one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don't have to give people many instructions. All you have to say is   Make words   and they know exactly what to do. So here's another few people trying it out. That's our youngest beta tester  down there on the right. Turns out  all he wanted to do was to stack the Siftables up. So to him  they were just blocks. Now  this is an interactive cartoon application. And we wanted to build a learning tool for language learners. And this is Felix  actually. And he can bring new characters into the scene  just by lifting the Siftables off the table that have that character shown on them. Here  he's bringing the sun out. Video  The sun is rising. David Merrill  Now he's brought a tractor into the scene. Video  The orange tractor. Good job  Yeah  DM  So by shaking the Siftables and putting them next to each other he can make the characters interact    Video  Woof  DM  inventing his own narrative. Video  Hello  DM  It's an open ended story  and he gets to decide how it unfolds. Video  Fly away  cat. DM  So  the last example I have time to show you today is a music sequencing and live performance tool that we've built recently  in which Siftables act as sounds like lead  bass and drums. Each of these has four different variations  you get to choose which one you want to use. And you can inject these sounds into a sequence that you can assemble into the pattern that you want. And you inject it by just bumping up the sound Siftable against a sequence Siftable. There are effects that you can control live  like reverb and filter. You attach it to a particular sound and then tilt to adjust it. And then  overall effects like tempo and volume that apply to the entire sequence. So let's have a look. Video   Music  DM  We'll start by putting a lead into two sequence Siftables  arrange them into a series  extend it  add a little more lead. Now I put a bass line in. Video   Music  DM  Now I'll put some percussion in. Video   Music  DM  And now I'll attach the filter to the drums  so I can control the effect live. Video   Music  DM  I can speed up the whole sequence by tilting the tempo one way or the other. Video   Music  DM  And now I'll attach the filter to the bass for some more expression. Video   Music  DM  I can rearrange the sequence while it plays. So I don't have to plan it out in advance  but I can improvise  making it longer or shorter as I go. And now  finally  I can fade the whole sequence out using the volume Siftable  tilted to the left. Thank you. So  as you can see  my passion is for making new human computer interfaces that are a better match to the ways our brains and bodies work. And today  I had time to show you one point in this new design space  and a few of the possibilities that we're working to bring out of the laboratory. So the thought I want to leave you with is that we're on the cusp of this new generation of tools for interacting with digital media that are going to bring information into our world on our terms. Thank you very much. I look forward to talking with all of you. In his inaugural address  Barack Obama appealed to each of us to give our best as we try to extricate ourselves from this current financial crisis. But what did he appeal to  He did not  happily  follow in the footsteps of his predecessor  and tell us to just go shopping. Nor did he tell us   Trust us. Trust your country. Invest  invest  invest.  Instead  what he told us was to put aside childish things. And he appealed to virtue. Virtue is an old fashioned word. It seems a little out of place in a cutting edge environment like this one. And besides  some of you might be wondering  what the hell does it mean  Let me begin with an example. This is the job description of a hospital janitor that is scrolling up on the screen. And all of the items on it are unremarkable. They're the things you would expect  mop the floors  sweep them  empty the trash  restock the cabinets. It may be a little surprising how many things there are  but it's not surprising what they are. But the one thing I want you to notice about them is this  even though this is a very long list  there isn't a single thing on it that involves other human beings. Not one. The janitor's job could just as well be done in a mortuary as in a hospital. And yet  when some psychologists interviewed hospital janitors to get a sense of what they thought their jobs were like  they encountered Mike  who told them about how he stopped mopping the floor because Mr. Jones was out of his bed getting a little exercise  trying to build up his strength  walking slowly up and down the hall. And Charlene told them about how she ignored her supervisor's admonition and didn't vacuum the visitor's lounge because there were some family members who were there all day  every day who  at this moment  happened to be taking a nap. And then there was Luke  who washed the floor in a comatose young man's room twice because the man's father  who had been keeping a vigil for six months  didn't see Luke do it the first time  and his father was angry. And behavior like this from janitors  from technicians  from nurses and  if we're lucky now and then  from doctors  doesn't just make people feel a little better  it actually improves the quality of patient care and enables hospitals to run well. Now  not all janitors are like this  of course. But the ones who are think that these sorts of human interactions involving kindness  care and empathy are an essential part of the job. And yet their job description contains not one word about other human beings. These janitors have the moral will to do right by other people. And beyond this  they have the moral skill to figure out what  doing right  means.  Practical wisdom   Aristotle told us   is the combination of moral will and moral skill.  A wise person knows when and how to make the exception to every rule  as the janitors knew when to ignore the job duties in the service of other objectives. A wise person knows how to improvise  as Luke did when he re washed the floor. Real world problems are often ambiguous and ill defined and the context is always changing. A wise person is like a jazz musician    using the notes on the page  but dancing around them  inventing combinations that are appropriate for the situation and the people at hand. A wise person knows how to use these moral skills in the service of the right aims. To serve other people  not to manipulate other people. And finally  perhaps most important  a wise person is made  not born. Wisdom depends on experience  and not just any experience. You need the time to get to know the people that you're serving. You need permission to be allowed to improvise  try new things  occasionally to fail and to learn from your failures. And you need to be mentored by wise teachers. When you ask the janitors who behaved like the ones I described how hard it is to learn to do their job  they tell you that it takes lots of experience. And they don't mean it takes lots of experience to learn how to mop floors and empty trash cans. It takes lots of experience to learn how to care for people. At TED  brilliance is rampant. It's scary. The good news is you don't need to be brilliant to be wise. The bad news is that without wisdom  brilliance isn't enough. It's as likely to get you and other people into trouble as anything else. Now  I hope that we all know this. There's a sense in which it's obvious  and yet  let me tell you a little story. It's a story about lemonade. A dad and his seven year old son were watching a Detroit Tigers game at the ballpark. His son asked him for some lemonade and Dad went to the concession stand to buy it. All they had was Mike's Hard Lemonade  which was five percent alcohol. Dad  being an academic  had no idea that Mike's Hard Lemonade contained alcohol. So he brought it back. And the kid was drinking it  and a security guard spotted it  and called the police  who called an ambulance that rushed to the ballpark  whisked the kid to the hospital. The emergency room ascertained that the kid had no alcohol in his blood. And they were ready to let the kid go. But not so fast. The Wayne County Child Welfare Protection Agency said no. And the child was sent to a foster home for three days. At that point  can the child go home  Well  a judge said yes  but only if the dad leaves the house and checks into a motel. After two weeks  I'm happy to report  the family was reunited. But the welfare workers and the ambulance people and the judge all said the same thing   We hate to do it but we have to follow procedure.  How do things like this happen  Scott Simon  who told this story on NPR  said   Rules and procedures may be dumb  but they spare you from thinking.  And  to be fair  rules are often imposed because previous officials have been lax and they let a child go back to an abusive household. Fair enough. When things go wrong  as of course they do  we reach for two tools to try to fix them. One tool we reach for is rules. Better ones  more of them. The second tool we reach for is incentives. Better ones  more of them. What else  after all  is there  We can certainly see this in response to the current financial crisis. Regulate  regulate  regulate. Fix the incentives  fix the incentives  fix the incentives ... The truth is that neither rules nor incentives are enough to do the job. How could you even write a rule that got the janitors to do what they did  And would you pay them a bonus for being empathic  It's preposterous on its face. And what happens is that as we turn increasingly to rules  rules and incentives may make things better in the short run  but they create a downward spiral that makes them worse in the long run. Moral skill is chipped away by an over reliance on rules that deprives us of the opportunity to improvise and learn from our improvisations. And moral will is undermined by an incessant appeal to incentives that destroy our desire to do the right thing. And without intending it  by appealing to rules and incentives  we are engaging in a war on wisdom. Let me just give you a few examples  first of rules and the war on moral skill. The lemonade story is one. Second  no doubt more familiar to you  is the nature of modern American education  scripted  lock step curricula. Here's an example from Chicago kindergarten. Reading and enjoying literature and words that begin with 'B.'  The Bath   Assemble students on a rug and give students a warning about the dangers of hot water. Say    items in this script to teach a    page picture book. All over Chicago in every kindergarten class in the city  every teacher is saying the same words in the same way on the same day. We know why these scripts are there. We don't trust the judgment of teachers enough to let them loose on their own. Scripts like these are insurance policies against disaster. And they prevent disaster. But what they assure in its place is mediocrity. Don't get me wrong. We need rules  Jazz musicians need some notes    most of them need some notes on the page. We need more rules for the bankers  God knows. But too many rules prevent accomplished jazz musicians from improvising. And as a result  they lose their gifts  or worse  they stop playing altogether. Now  how about incentives  They seem cleverer. If you have one reason for doing something and I give you a second reason for doing the same thing  it seems only logical that two reasons are better than one and you're more likely to do it. Right  Well  not always. Sometimes two reasons to do the same thing seem to compete with one another instead of complimenting  and they make people less likely to do it. I'll just give you one example because time is racing. In Switzerland  back about    years ago  they were trying to decide where to site nuclear waste dumps. There was going to be a national referendum. Some psychologists went around and polled citizens who were very well informed. And they said   Would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community   Astonishingly     percent of the citizens said yes. They knew it was dangerous. They thought it would reduce their property values. But it had to go somewhere and they had responsibilities as citizens. The psychologists asked other people a slightly different question. They said   If we paid you six weeks' salary every year would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community   Two reasons. It's my responsibility and I'm getting paid. Instead of    percent saying yes     percent said yes. What happens is that the second this introduction of incentive gets us so that instead of asking   What is my responsibility   all we ask is   What serves my interests   When incentives don't work  when CEOs ignore the long term health of their companies in pursuit of short term gains that will lead to massive bonuses  the response is always the same. Get smarter incentives. The truth is that there are no incentives that you can devise that are ever going to be smart enough. Any incentive system can be subverted by bad will. We need incentives. People have to make a living. But excessive reliance on incentives demoralizes professional activity in two senses of that word. It causes people who engage in that activity to lose morale and it causes the activity itself to lose morality. Barack Obama said  before he was inaugurated   We must ask not just 'Is it profitable ' but 'Is it right '  And when professions are demoralized  everyone in them becomes dependent on    addicted to    incentives and they stop asking  Is it right   We see this in medicine. And we certainly see it in the world of business. It is obvious that this is not the way people want to do their work. So what can we do  A few sources of hope  we ought to try to re moralize work. One way not to do it  teach more ethics courses. There is no better way to show people that you're not serious than to tie up everything you have to say about ethics into a little package with a bow and consign it to the margins as an ethics course. What to do instead  One  Celebrate moral exemplars. Acknowledge  when you go to law school  that a little voice is whispering in your ear about Atticus Finch. No    year old goes to law school to do mergers and acquisitions. People are inspired by moral heroes. But we learn that with sophistication comes the understanding that you can't acknowledge that you have moral heroes. Well  acknowledge them. Be proud that you have them. Celebrate them. And demand that the people who teach you acknowledge them and celebrate them too. That's one thing we can do. I don't know how many of you remember this  another moral hero     years ago  Aaron Feuerstein  who was the head of Malden Mills in Massachusetts    they made Polartec    The factory burned down.       employees. He kept every one of them on the payroll. Why  Because it would have been a disaster for them and for the community if he had let them go.  Maybe on paper our company is worth less to Wall Street  but I can tell you it's worth more. We're doing fine.  Just at this TED we heard talks from several moral heroes. Two were particularly inspiring to me. One was Ray Anderson  who turned       turned  you know  a part of the evil empire into a zero footprint  or almost zero footprint business. Why  Because it was the right thing to do. And a bonus he's discovering is he's actually going to make even more money. His employees are inspired by the effort. Why  Because there happy to be doing something that's the right thing to do. Yesterday we heard Willie Smits talk about re foresting in Indonesia. In many ways this is the perfect example. Because it took the will to do the right thing. God knows it took a huge amount of technical skill. I'm boggled at how much he and his associates needed to know in order to plot this out. But most important to make it work    and he emphasized this    is that it took knowing the people in the communities. Unless the people you're working with are behind you  this will fail. And there isn't a formula to tell you how to get the people behind you  because different people in different communities organize their lives in different ways. So there's a lot here at TED  and at other places  to celebrate. And you don't have to be a mega hero. There are ordinary heroes. Ordinary heroes like the janitors who are worth celebrating too. As practitioners each and every one of us should strive to be ordinary  if not extraordinary heroes. As heads of organizations  we should strive to create environments that encourage and nurture both moral skill and moral will. Even the wisest and most well meaning people will give up if they have to swim against the current in the organizations in which they work. If you run an organization  you should be sure that none of the jobs    none of the jobs    have job descriptions like the job descriptions of the janitors. Because the truth is that any work that you do that involves interaction with other people is moral work. And any moral work depends upon practical wisdom. And  perhaps most important  as teachers  we should strive to be the ordinary heroes  the moral exemplars  to the people we mentor. And there are a few things that we have to remember as teachers. One is that we are always teaching. Someone is always watching. The camera is always on. Bill Gates talked about the importance of education and  in particular  the model that KIPP was providing   Knowledge is power.  And he talked about a lot of the wonderful things that KIPP is doing to take inner city kids and turn them in the direction of college. I want to focus on one particular thing KIPP is doing that Bill didn't mention. That is that they have come to the realization that the single most important thing kids need to learn is character. They need to learn to respect themselves. They need to learn to respect their schoolmates. They need to learn to respect their teachers. And  most important  they need to learn to respect learning. That's the principle objective. If you do that  the rest is just pretty much a coast downhill. And the teachers  the way you teach these things to the kids is by having the teachers and all the other staff embody it every minute of every day. Obama appealed to virtue. And I think he was right. And the virtue I think we need above all others is practical wisdom  because it's what allows other virtues    honesty  kindness  courage and so on    to be displayed at the right time and in the right way. He also appealed to hope. Right again. I think there is reason for hope. I think people want to be allowed to be virtuous. In many ways  it's what TED is all about. Wanting to do the right thing in the right way for the right reasons. This kind of wisdom is within the grasp of each and every one of us if only we start paying attention. Paying attention to what we do  to how we do it  and  perhaps most importantly  to the structure of the organizations within which we work  so as to make sure that it enables us and other people to develop wisdom rather than having it suppressed. Thank you very much. Thank you. Chris Anderson  You have to go and stand out here a sec. Barry Schwartz  Thank you very much. There's a great big elephant in the room called the economy. So let's start talking about that. I wanted to give you a current picture of the economy. That's what I have behind myself. But of course what we have to remember is this. And what you have to think about is  when you're dancing in the flames  what's next  So what I'm going to try to do in the next    and a half minutes is I'm going to talk first about the flames    where we are in the economy    and then I'm going to take three trends that have taken place at TED over the last    years and that will take place in this conference and I will try and bring them together. And I will try and give you a sense of what the ultimate reboot looks like. Those three trends are the ability to engineer cells  the ability to engineer tissues  and robots. And somehow it will all make sense. But anyway  let's start with the economy. There's a couple of really big problems that are still sitting there. One is leverage. And the problem with leverage is it makes the U.S. financial system look like this. So  a normal commercial bank has nine to    times leverage. That means for every dollar you deposit  it loans out about nine or   . A normal investment bank is not a deposit bank  it's an investment bank  it has    to    times. It turns out that B of A in September had    times. And your friendly Citibank had    times. Oops. That means every bad loan goes bad    times over. And that  of course  is the reason why all of you are making such generous and wonderful donations to these nice folks. And as you think about that  you've got to wonder  so what do banks have in store for you now  It ain't pretty. The government  meanwhile  has been acting like Santa Claus. We all love Santa Claus  right  But the problem with Santa Clause is  if you look at the mandatory spending of what these folks have been doing and promising folks  it turned out that in          percent was mandatory spending on what we call  entitlements.  And then by      it was    percent. And we weren't supposed to run into     percent until about     . Except we've been so busy giving away a trillion here  a trillion there  that we've brought that date of reckoning forward to about     . And we thought we were going to be able to lay these debts off on our kids  but  guess what  We're going to start to pay them. And the problem with this stuff is  now that the bill's come due  it turns out Santa isn't quite as cute when it's summertime. Right  Here's some advice from one of the largest investors in the United States. This guy runs the China Investment Corporation. He is the main buyer of U.S. Treasury bonds. And he gave an interview in December. Here's his first bit of advice. And here's his second bit of advice. And  by the way  the Chinese Prime Minister reiterated this at Davos last Sunday. This stuff is getting serious enough that if we don't start paying attention to the deficit  we're going to end up losing the dollar. And then all bets are off. Let me show you what it looks like. I think I can safely say that I'm the only trillionaire in this room. This is an actual bill. And it's    triliion dollars. The only problem with this bill is it's not really worth very much. That was eight bucks last week  four bucks this week  a buck next week. And that's what happens to currencies when you don't stand behind them. So the next time somebody as cute as this shows up on your doorstep  and sometimes this creature's called Chrysler and sometimes Ford and sometimes ... whatever you want    you've just got to say no. And you've got to start banishing a word that's called  entitlement.  And the reason we have to do that in the short term is because we have just run out of cash. If you look at the federal budget  this is what it looks like. The orange slice is what's discretionary. Everything else is mandated. It makes no difference if we cut out the bridges to Alaska in the overall scheme of things. So what we have to start thinking about doing is capping our medical spending because that's a monster that's simply going to eat the entire budget. We've got to start thinking about asking people to retire a little bit later. If you're    to    you retire on time. Your     k  just got nailed. If you're    to    we want you to work two years more. If you're under    we want you to work four more years. The reason why that's reasonable is  when your grandparents were given Social Security  they got it at    and were expected to check out at   . Sixty eight is young today. We've also got to cut the military about three percent a year. We've got to limit other mandatory spending. We've got to quit borrowing as much  because otherwise the interest is going to eat that whole pie. And we've got to end up with a smaller government. And if we don't start changing this trend line  we are going to lose the dollar and start to look like Iceland. I got what you're thinking. This is going to happen when hell freezes over. But let me remind you this December it did snow in Vegas. Here's what happens if you don't address this stuff. So  Japan had a fiscal real estate crisis back in the late '  s. And its     largest companies today are worth one quarter of what they were    years ago. We don't fix this now  how would you like to see a Dow       in       Because that's the consequence of not dealing with this stuff. And unless you want this person to not just become the CFO of Florida  but the United States  we'd better deal with this stuff. That's the short term. That's the flame part. That's the financial crisis. Now  right behind the financial crisis there's a second and bigger wave that we need to talk about. That wave is much larger  much more powerful  and that's of course the wave of technology. And what's really important in this stuff is  as we cut  we also have to grow. Among other things  because startup companies are .   percent of U.S. GDP investmentm and they're about   .  percent of output. It's groups like that in this room that generate the future of the U.S. economy. And that's what we've got to keep growing. We don't have to keep growing these bridges to nowhere. So let's bring a romance novelist into this conversation. And that's where these three trends come together. That's where the ability to engineer microbes  the ability to engineer tissues  and the ability to engineer robots begin to lead to a reboot. And let me recap some of the stuff you've seen. Craig Venter showed up last year and showed you the first fully programmable cell that acts like hardware where you can insert DNA and have it boot up as a different species. In parallel  the folks at MIT have been building a standard registry of biological parts. So think of it as a Radio Shack for biology. You can go out and get your proteins  your RNA  your DNA  whatever. And start building stuff. In      they brought together high school students and college students and started to build these little odd creatures. They just happened to be alive instead of circuit boards. Here was one of the first things they built. So  cells have this cycle. First they don't grow. Then they grow exponentially. Then they stop growing. Graduate students wanted a way of telling which stage they were in. So they engineered these cells so that when they're growing in the exponential phase  they would smell like wintergreen. And when they stopped growing they would smell like bananas. And you could tell very easily when your experiment was working and wasn't  and where it was in the phase. This got a bit more complicated two years later. Twenty one countries came together. Dozens of teams. They started competing. The team from Rice University started to engineer the substance in red wine that makes red wine good for you into beer. So you take resveratrol and you put it into beer. Of course  one of the judges is wandering by  and he goes   Wow  Cancer fighting beer  There is a God.  The team from Taiwan was a little bit more ambitious. They tried to engineer bacterias in such a way that they would act as your kidneys. Four years ago  I showed you this picture. And people oohed and ahhed  because Cliff Tabin had been able to grow an extra wing on a chicken. And that was very cool stuff back then. But now moving from bacterial engineering to tissue engineering  let me show you what's happened in that period of time. Two years ago  you saw this creature. An almost extinct animal from Xochimilco  Mexico called an axolotl that can re generate its limbs. You can freeze half its heart. It regrows. You can freeze half the brain. It regrows. It's almost like leaving Congress. But now  you don't have to have the animal itself to regenerate  because you can build cloned mice molars in Petri dishes. And  of course if you can build mice molars in Petri dishes  you can grow human molars in Petri dishes. This should not surprise you  right  I mean  you're born with no teeth. You give away all your teeth to the tooth fairy. You re grow a set of teeth. But then if you lose one of those second set of teeth  they don't regrow  unless  if you're a lawyer. But  of course  for most of us  we know how to grow teeth  and therefore we can take adult stem teeth  put them on a biodegradable mold  re grow a tooth  and simply implant it. And we can do it with other things. So  a Spanish woman who was dying of T.B. had a donor trachea  they took all the cells off the trachea  they spraypainted her stem cells onto that cartilage. She regrew her own trachea  and    hours later it was implanted. She's now running around with her kids. This is going on in Tony Atala's lab in Wake Forest where he is re growing ears for injured soldiers  and he's also re growing bladders. So there are now nine women walking around Boston with re grown bladders  which is much more pleasant than walking around with a whole bunch of plastic bags for the rest of your life. This is kind of getting boring  right  I mean  you understand where this story's going. But  I mean it gets more interesting. Last year  this group was able to take all the cells off a heart  leaving just the cartilage. Then  they sprayed stem cells onto that heart  from a mouse. Those stem cells self organized  and that heart started to beat. Life happens. This may be one of the ultimate papers. This was done in Japan and in the U.S.  published at the same time  and it rebooted skin cells into stem cells  last year. That meant that you can take the stuff right here  and turn it into almost anything in your body. And this is becoming common  it's moving very quickly  it's moving in a whole series of places. Third trend  robots. Those of us of a certain age grew up expecting that by now we would have Rosie the Robot from  The Jetsons  in our house. And all we've got is a Roomba. We also thought we'd have this robot to warn us of danger. Didn't happen. And these were robots engineered for a flat world  right  So  Rosie runs around on skates and the other one ran on flat threads. If you don't have a flat world  that's not good  which is why the robot's we're designing today are a little different. This is Boston Dynamics'  BigDog.  And this is about as close as you can get to a physical Turing test. O.K.  so let me remind you  a Turing test is where you've got a wall  you're talking to somebody on the other side of the wall  and when you don't know if that thing is human or animal    that's when computers have reached human intelligence. This is not an intelligence Turing rest  but this is as close as you can get to a physical Turing test. And this stuff is moving very quickly  and by the way  that thing can carry about     pounds of weight. These are not the only interesting robots. You've also got flies  the size of flies  that are being made by Robert Wood at Harvard. You've got Stickybots that are being made at Stanford. And as you bring these things together  as you bring cells  biological tissue engineering and mechanics together  you begin to get some really odd questions. In the last Olympics  this gentleman  who had several world records in the Special Olympics  tried to run in the normal Olympics. The only issue with Oscar Pistorius is he was born without bones in the lower part of his legs. He came within about a second of qualifying. He sued to be allowed to run  and he won the suit  but didn't qualify by time. Next Olympics  you can bet that Oscar  or one of Oscar's successors  is going to make the time. And two or three Olympics after that  they are going to be unbeatable. And as you bring these trends together  and as you think of what it means to take people who are profoundly deaf  who can now begin to hear    I mean  remember the evolution of hearing aids  right  I mean  your grandparents had these great big cones  and then your parents had these odd boxes that would squawk at odd times during dinner  and now we have these little buds that nobody sees. And now you have cochlear implants that go into people's heads and allow the deaf to begin to hear. Now  they can't hear as well as you and I can. But  in    or    machine generations they will  and these are machine generations  not human generations. And about two or three years after they can hear as well as you and I can  they'll be able to hear maybe how bats sing  or how whales talk  or how dogs talk  and other types of tonal scales. They'll be able to focus their hearing  they'll be able to increase the sensitivity  decrease the sensitivity  do a series of things that we can't do. And the same thing is happening in eyes. This is a group in Germany that's beginning to engineer eyes so that people who are blind can begin to see light and dark. Very primitive. And then they'll be able to see shape. And then they'll be able to see color  and then they'll be able to see in definition  and one day  they'll see as well as you and I can. And a couple of years after that  they'll be able to see in ultraviolet  they'll be able to see in infrared  they'll be able to focus their eyes  they'll be able to come into a microfocus. They'll do stuff you and I can't do. All of these things are coming together  and it's a particularly important thing to understand  as we worry about the flames of the present  to keep an eye on the future. And  of course  the future is looking back     years  because next week is the    th anniversary of Darwin's birth. And it's the    th anniversary of the publication of  The Origin of Species.  And Darwin  of course  argued that evolution is a natural state. It is a natural state in everything that is alive  including hominids. There have actually been    species of hominids that have been around  have evolved  have wandered in different places  have gone extinct. It is common for hominids to evolve. And that's the reason why  as you look at the hominid fossil record  erectus  and heidelbergensis  and floresiensis  and Neanderthals  and Homo sapiens  all overlap. The common state of affairs is to have overlapping versions of hominids  not one. And as you think of the implications of that  here's a brief history of the universe. The universe was created   .  billion years ago  and then you created all the stars  and all the planets  and all the galaxies  and all the Milky Ways. And then you created Earth about  .  billion years ago  and then you got life about four billion years ago  and then you got hominids about  .    billion years ago  and then you got our version of hominids about  .     billion years ago. Ta dah  Maybe the reason for thr creation of the universe  and all the galaxies  and all the planets  and all the energy  and all the dark energy  and all the rest of stuff is to create what's in this room. Maybe not. That would be a mildly arrogant viewpoint. So  if that's not the purpose of the universe  then what's next  I think what we're going to see is we're going to see a different species of hominid. I think we're going to move from a Homo sapiens into a Homo evolutis. And I think this isn't       years out. I think most of us are going to glance at it  and our grandchildren are going to begin to live it. And a Homo evolutis brings together these three trends into a hominid that takes direct and deliberate control over the evolution of his species  her species and other species. And that  of course  would be the ultimate reboot. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Let's now see the extraordinary speech that we captured a couple weeks ago. Jose Antonio Abreu  My dear friends  ladies and gentlemen  I am overjoyed today at being awarded the TED Prize on behalf of all the distinguished music teachers  artists and educators from Venezuela who have selflessly and loyally accompanied me for    years in founding  growing and developing in Venezuela the National System of Youth and Children's Orchestras and Choirs. Since I was a boy  in my early childhood  I always wanted to be a musician  and  thank God  I made it. From my teachers  my family and my community  I had all the necessary support to become a musician. All my life I've dreamed that all Venezuelan children have the same opportunity that I had. From that desire and from my heart stemmed the idea to make music a deep and global reality for my country. From the very first rehearsal  I saw the bright future ahead. Because the rehearsal meant a great challenge to me. I had received a donation of    music stands to be used by     boys in that rehearsal. When I arrived at the rehearsal  only    kids had shown up  and I said to myself   Do I close the program or multiply these kids   I decided to face the challenge  and on that same night  I promised those    children I'd turn our orchestra into one of the leading orchestras in the world. Two months ago  I remembered that promise I made  when a distinguished English critic published an article in the London Times  asking who could be the winner of the Orchestra World Cup. He mentioned four great world orchestras  and the fifth one was Venezuela's Youth Symphony Orchestra. Today we can say that art in Latin America is no longer a monopoly of elites and that it has become a social right  a right for all the people. Child  There is no difference here between classes  nor white or black  nor if you have money or not. Simply  if you are talented  if you have the vocation and the will to be here  you get in. You share with us and make music. JA  During the recent tour by the Simon Bolivar Youth Orchestra of Venezuela of U.S. and Europe  we saw how our music moved young audiences to the bottom of their souls  how children and adolescents rushed up to the stage to receive the jackets from our musicians  how the standing ovations  sometimes    minutes long  seemed to last forever  and how the public  after the concert was over  went out into the street to greet our young people in triumph. This meant not only an artistic triumph  but also a profound emotional sympathy between the public of the most advanced nations of the world and the musical youth of Latin America  as seen in Venezuela  giving these audiences a message of music  vitality  energy  enthusiasm and strength. In its essence  the orchestra and the choir are much more than artistic structures. They are examples and schools of social life  because to sing and to play together means to intimately coexist toward perfection and excellence  following a strict discipline of organization and coordination in order to seek the harmonic interdependence of voices and instruments. That's how they build a spirit of solidarity and fraternity among them  develop their self esteem and foster the ethical and aesthetical values related to the music in all its senses. This is why music is immensely important in the awakening of sensibility  in the forging of values and in the training of youngsters to teach other kids. Child  After all this time here  music is life. Nothing else. Music is life. JA  Each teenager and child in El Sistema has his own story  and they are all important and of great significance to me. Let me mention the case of Edicson Ruiz. He is a boy from a parish in Caracas who passionately attended to his double bass lessons at the San Agustin's Junior Orchestra. With his effort  and the support of his mother  his family and his community  he became a principal member in the double bass segment of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. We have another well known case    Gustavo Dudamel. He started as a boy member of the children's orchestra in his hometown  Barquisimeto. There  he grew as a violinist and as a conductor. He became the conductor of Venezuela's junior orchestras  and today conducts the world's greatest orchestras. He is the musical director of Los Angeles Philharmonic  and is still the overall leader of Venezuela's junior orchestras. He was the conductor of the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra  and he's an unbeatable example for young musicians in Latin America and the world. The structure of El Sistema is based on a new and flexible managing style adapted to the features of each community and region  and today attends to         children of the lower and middle class all over Venezuela. It's a program of social rescue and deep cultural transformation designed for the whole Venezuelan society with absolutely no distinctions whatsoever  but emphasizing the vulnerable and endangered social groups. The effect of El Sistema is felt in three fundamental circles  in the personal social circle  in the family circle and in the community. In the personal social circle  the children in the orchestras and choirs develop their intellectual and emotional side. The music becomes a source for developing the dimensions of the human being  thus elevating the spirit and leading man to a full development of his personality. So  the emotional and intellectual profits are huge    the acquisition of leadership  teaching and training principles  the sense of commitment  responsibility  generosity and dedication to others  and the individual contribution to achieve great collective goals. All this leads to the development of self esteem and confidence. Mother Teresa of Calcutta insisted on something that always impressed me  the most miserable and tragic thing about poverty is not the lack of bread or roof  but the feeling of being no one    the feeling of not being anyone  the lack of identification  the lack of public esteem. That's why the child's development in the orchestra and the choir provides him with a noble identity and makes him a role model for his family and community. It makes him a better student at school because it inspires in him a sense of responsibility  perseverance and punctuality that will greatly help him at school. Within the family  the parents' support is unconditional. The child becomes a role model for both his parents  and this is very important for a poor child. Once the child discovers he is important to his family  he begins to seek new ways of improving himself and hopes better for himself and his community. Also  he hopes for social and economic improvements for his own family. All this makes up a constructive and ascending social dynamic. The large majority of our children belong  as I already mentioned  to the most vulnerable strata of the Venezuelan population. That encourages them to embrace new dreams  new goals  and progress in the various opportunities that music has to offer. Finally  in the circle of the community  the orchestras prove to be the creative spaces of culture and sources of exchange and new meanings. The spontaneity music has excludes it as a luxury item and makes it a patrimony of society. It's what makes a child play a violin at home  while his father works in his carpentry. It's what makes a little girl play the clarinet at home  while her mother does the housework. The idea is that the families join with pride and joy in the activities of the orchestras and the choirs that their children belong to. The huge spiritual world that music produces in itself  which also lies within itself  ends up overcoming material poverty. From the minute a child's taught how to play an instrument  he's no longer poor. He becomes a child in progress heading for a professional level  who'll later become a full citizen. Needless to say that music is the number one prevention against prostitution  violence  bad habits  and everything degrading in the life of a child. A few years ago  historian Arnold Toynbee said that the world was suffering a huge spiritual crisis. Not an economic or social crisis  but a spiritual one. I believe that to confront such a crisis  only art and religion can give proper answers to humanity  to mankind's deepest aspirations  and to the historic demands of our times. Education    the synthesis of wisdom and knowledge    is the means to strive for a more perfect  more aware  more noble and more just society. With passion and enthusiasm we pay profound respects to TED for its outstanding humanism  the scope of its principles  for its open and generous promotion of young values. We hope that TED can contribute in a full and fundamental way to the building of this new era in the teaching of music  in which the social  communal  spiritual and vindicatory aims of the child and the adolescent become a beacon and a goal for a vast social mission. No longer putting society at the service of art  and much less at the services of monopolies of the elite  but instead art at the service of society  at the service of the weakest  at the service of the children  at the service of the sick  at the service of the vulnerable  and at the service of all those who cry for vindication through the spirit of their human condition and the raising up of their dignity. CA  We are going live now to Caracas. We are going live to Caracas to hear Maestro Abreu's TED Prize wish. JA  Here is my TED Prize wish  I wish that you'll help to create and document a special training program for    gifted young musicians  passionate about their art and social justice  and dedicated to bringing El Sistema to the United States and other countries. Thank you very much. Fifty years ago  when I began exploring the ocean  no one    not Jacques Perrin  not Jacques Cousteau or Rachel Carson    imagined that we could do anything to harm the ocean by what we put into it or by what we took out of it. It seemed  at that time  to be a sea of Eden  but now we know  and now we are facing paradise lost. I want to share with you my personal view of changes in the sea that affect all of us  and to consider why it matters that in    years  we've lost    actually  we've taken  we've eaten    more than    percent of the big fish in the sea  why you should care that nearly half of the coral reefs have disappeared  why a mysterious depletion of oxygen in large areas of the Pacific should concern not only the creatures that are dying  but it really should concern you. It does concern you  as well. I'm haunted by the thought of what Ray Anderson calls  tomorrow's child   asking why we didn't do something on our watch to save sharks and bluefin tuna and squids and coral reefs and the living ocean while there still was time. Well  now is that time. I hope for your help to explore and protect the wild ocean in ways that will restore the health and  in so doing  secure hope for humankind. Health to the ocean means health for us. And I hope Jill Tarter's wish to engage Earthlings includes dolphins and whales and other sea creatures in this quest to find intelligent life elsewhere in the universe. And I hope  Jill  that someday we will find evidence that there is intelligent life among humans on this planet. Did I say that  I guess I did. For me  as a scientist  it all began in      when I first tried scuba. It's when I first got to know fish swimming in something other than lemon slices and butter. I actually love diving at night  you see a lot of fish then that you don't see in the daytime. Diving day and night was really easy for me in       when I led a team of aquanauts living underwater for weeks at a time    at the same time that astronauts were putting their footprints on the moon. In      I had a chance to put my footprints on the ocean floor while using this personal submersible called Jim. It was six miles offshore and       feet down. It's one of my favorite bathing suits. Since then  I've used about    kinds of submarines and I've started three companies and a nonprofit foundation called Deep Search to design and build systems to access the deep sea. I led a five year National Geographic expedition  the Sustainable Seas expeditions  using these little subs. They're so simple to drive that even a scientist can do it. And I'm living proof. Astronauts and aquanauts alike really appreciate the importance of air  food  water  temperature    all the things you need to stay alive in space or under the sea. I heard astronaut Joe Allen explain how he had to learn everything he could about his life support system and then do everything he could to take care of his life support system  and then he pointed to this and he said   Life support system.  We need to learn everything we can about it and do everything we can to take care of it. The poet Auden said   Thousands have lived without love  none without water.  Ninety seven percent of Earth's water is ocean. No blue  no green. If you think the ocean isn't important  imagine Earth without it. Mars comes to mind. No ocean  no life support system. I gave a talk not so long ago at the World Bank and I showed this amazing image of Earth and I said   There it is  The World Bank   That's where all the assets are  And we've been trawling them down much faster than the natural systems can replenish them. Tim Worth says the economy is a wholly owned subsidiary of the environment. With every drop of water you drink  every breath you take  you're connected to the sea. No matter where on Earth you live. Most of the oxygen in the atmosphere is generated by the sea. Over time  most of the planet's organic carbon has been absorbed and stored there  mostly by microbes. The ocean drives climate and weather  stabilizes temperature  shapes Earth's chemistry. Water from the sea forms clouds that return to the land and the seas as rain  sleet and snow  and provides home for about    percent of life in the world  maybe in the universe. No water  no life  no blue  no green. Yet we have this idea  we humans  that the Earth    all of it  the oceans  the skies    are so vast and so resilient it doesn't matter what we do to it. That may have been true        years ago  and maybe even       years ago but in the last      especially in the last     we've drawn down the assets  the air  the water  the wildlife that make our lives possible. New technologies are helping us to understand the nature of nature  the nature of what's happening  showing us our impact on the Earth. I mean  first you have to know that you've got a problem. And fortunately  in our time  we've learned more about the problems than in all preceding history. And with knowing comes caring. And with caring  there's hope that we can find an enduring place for ourselves within the natural systems that support us. But first we have to know. Three years ago  I met John Hanke  who's the head of Google Earth  and I told him how much I loved being able to hold the world in my hands and go exploring vicariously. But I asked him   When are you going to finish it  You did a great job with the land  the dirt. What about the water   Since then  I've had the great pleasure of working with the Googlers  with DOER Marine  with National Geographic  with dozens of the best institutions and scientists around the world  ones that we could enlist  to put the ocean in Google Earth. And as of just this week  last Monday  Google Earth is now whole. Consider this  Starting right here at the convention center  we can find the nearby aquarium  we can look at where we're sitting  and then we can cruise up the coast to the big aquarium  the ocean  and California's four national marine sanctuaries  and the new network of state marine reserves that are beginning to protect and restore some of the assets We can flit over to Hawaii and see the real Hawaiian Islands  not just the little bit that pokes through the surface  but also what's below. To see    wait a minute  we can go kshhplash     right there  ha    under the ocean  see what the whales see. We can go explore the other side of the Hawaiian Islands. We can go actually and swim around on Google Earth and visit with humpback whales. These are the gentle giants that I've had the pleasure of meeting face to face many times underwater. There's nothing quite like being personally inspected by a whale. We can pick up and fly to the deepest place  seven miles down  the Mariana Trench  where only two people have ever been. Imagine that. It's only seven miles  but only two people have been there     years ago. One way trips are easy. We need new deep diving submarines. How about some X Prizes for ocean exploration  We need to see deep trenches  the undersea mountains  and understand life in the deep sea. We can now go to the Arctic. Just ten years ago I stood on the ice at the North Pole. An ice free Arctic Ocean may happen in this century. That's bad news for the polar bears. That's bad news for us too. Excess carbon dioxide is not only driving global warming  it's also changing ocean chemistry  making the sea more acidic. That's bad news for coral reefs and oxygen producing plankton. Also it's bad news for us. We're putting hundreds of millions of tons of plastic and other trash into the sea. Millions of tons of discarded fishing nets  gear that continues to kill. We're clogging the ocean  poisoning the planet's circulatory system  and we're taking out hundreds of millions of tons of wildlife  all carbon based units. Barbarically  we're killing sharks for shark fin soup  undermining food chains that shape planetary chemistry and drive the carbon cycle  the nitrogen cycle  the oxygen cycle  the water cycle    our life support system. We're still killing bluefin tuna  truly endangered and much more valuable alive than dead. All of these parts are part of our life support system. We kill using long lines  with baited hooks every few feet that may stretch for    miles or more. Industrial trawlers and draggers are scraping the sea floor like bulldozers  taking everything in their path. Using Google Earth you can witness trawlers    in China  the North Sea  the Gulf of Mexico    shaking the foundation of our life support system  leaving plumes of death in their path. The next time you dine on sushi    or sashimi  or swordfish steak  or shrimp cocktail  whatever wildlife you happen to enjoy from the ocean    think of the real cost. For every pound that goes to market  more than    pounds  even     pounds  may be thrown away as bycatch. This is the consequence of not knowing that there are limits to what we can take out of the sea. This chart shows the decline in ocean wildlife from      to     . The highest concentrations are in red. In my lifetime  imagine     percent of the big fish have been killed. Most of the turtles  sharks  tunas and whales are way down in numbers. But  there is good news. Ten percent of the big fish still remain. There are still some blue whales. There are still some krill in Antarctica. There are a few oysters in Chesapeake Bay. Half the coral reefs are still in pretty good shape  a jeweled belt around the middle of the planet. There's still time  but not a lot  to turn things around. But business as usual means that in    years  there may be no coral reefs    and no commercial fishing  because the fish will simply be gone. Imagine the ocean without fish. Imagine what that means to our life support system. Natural systems on the land are in big trouble too  but the problems are more obvious  and some actions are being taken to protect trees  watersheds and wildlife. And in       with Yellowstone National Park  the United States began establishing a system of parks that some say was the best idea America ever had. About    percent of the land around the world is now protected  safeguarding biodiversity  providing a carbon sink  generating oxygen  protecting watersheds. And  in       this nation began to establish a counterpart in the sea  National Marine Sanctuaries. That's another great idea. The good news is that there are now more than       places in the sea  around the world  that have some kind of protection. And you can find them on Google Earth. The bad news is that you have to look hard to find them. In the last three years  for example  the U.S. protected         square miles of ocean as national monuments. But it only increased from  .  of one percent to  .  of one percent of the ocean protected  globally. Protected areas do rebound  but it takes a long time to restore    year old rockfish or monkfish  sharks or sea bass  or     year old orange roughy. We don't consume     year old cows or chickens. Protected areas provide hope that the creatures of Ed Wilson's dream of an encyclopedia of life  or the census of marine life  will live not just as a list  a photograph  or a paragraph. With scientists around the world  I've been looking at the    percent of the ocean that is open to fishing    and mining  and drilling  and dumping  and whatever    to search out hope spots  and try to find ways to give them and us a secure future. Such as the Arctic    we have one chance  right now  to get it right. Or the Antarctic  where the continent is protected  but the surrounding ocean is being stripped of its krill  whales and fish. Sargasso Sea's three million square miles of floating forest is being gathered up to feed cows.    percent of the land in the Galapagos Islands is protected  but the adjacent sea is being ravaged by fishing. It's true too in Argentina on the Patagonian shelf  which is now in serious trouble. The high seas  where whales  tuna and dolphins travel    the largest  least protected  ecosystem on Earth  filled with luminous creatures  living in dark waters that average two miles deep. They flash  and sparkle  and glow with their own living light. There are still places in the sea as pristine as I knew as a child. The next    years may be the most important  and the next        years the best chance our species will have to protect what remains of the natural systems that give us life. To cope with climate change  we need new ways to generate power. We need new ways  better ways  to cope with poverty  wars and disease. We need many things to keep and maintain the world as a better place. But  nothing else will matter if we fail to protect the ocean. Our fate and the ocean's are one. We need to do for the ocean what Al Gore did for the skies above. A global plan of action with a world conservation union  the IUCN  is underway to protect biodiversity  to mitigate and recover from the impacts of climate change  on the high seas and in coastal areas  wherever we can identify critical places. New technologies are needed to map  photograph and explore the    percent of the ocean that we have yet to see. The goal is to protect biodiversity  to provide stability and resilience. We need deep diving subs  new technologies to explore the ocean. We need  maybe  an expedition    a TED at sea    that could help figure out the next steps. And so  I suppose you want to know what my wish is. I wish you would use all means at your disposal    films  expeditions  the web  new submarines    and campaign to ignite public support for a global network of marine protected areas    hope spots large enough to save and restore the ocean  the blue heart of the planet. How much  Some say    percent  some say    percent. You decide  how much of your heart do you want to protect  Whatever it is  a fraction of one percent is not enough. My wish is a big wish  but if we can make it happen  it can truly change the world  and help ensure the survival of what actually    as it turns out    is my favorite species  that would be us. For the children of today  for tomorrow's child  as never again  now is the time. Thank you. So  my question  are we alone  The story of humans is the story of ideas    scientific ideas that shine light into dark corners  ideas that we embrace rationally and irrationally  ideas for which we've lived and died and killed and been killed  ideas that have vanished in history  and ideas that have been set in dogma. It's a story of nations  of ideologies  of territories  and of conflicts among them. But  every moment of human history  from the Stone Age to the Information Age  from Sumer and Babylon to the iPod and celebrity gossip  they've all been carried out    every book that you've read  every poem  every laugh  every tear    they've all happened here. Here. Here. Here. Perspective is a very powerful thing. Perspectives can change. Perspectives can be altered. From my perspective  we live on a fragile island of life  in a universe of possibilities. For many millennia  humans have been on a journey to find answers  answers to questions about naturalism and transcendence  about who we are and why we are  and of course  who else might be out there. Is it really just us  Are we alone in this vast universe of energy and matter and chemistry and physics  Well  if we are  it's an awful waste of space. But  what if we're not  What if  out there  others are asking and answering similar questions  What if they look up at the night sky  at the same stars  but from the opposite side  Would the discovery of an older cultural civilization out there inspire us to find ways to survive our increasingly uncertain technological adolescence  Might it be the discovery of a distant civilization and our common cosmic origins that finally drives home the message of the bond among all humans  Whether we're born in San Francisco  or Sudan  or close to the heart of the Milky Way galaxy  we are the products of a billion year lineage of wandering stardust. We  all of us  are what happens when a primordial mixture of hydrogen and helium evolves for so long that it begins to ask where it came from. Fifty years ago  the journey to find answers took a different path and SETI  the Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence  began. So  what exactly is SETI  Well  SETI uses the tools of astronomy to try and find evidence of someone else's technology out there. Our own technologies are visible over interstellar distances  and theirs might be as well. It might be that some massive network of communications  or some shield against asteroidal impact  or some huge astro engineering project that we can't even begin to conceive of  could generate signals at radio or optical frequencies that a determined program of searching might detect. For millennia  we've actually turned to the priests and the philosophers for guidance and instruction on this question of whether there's intelligent life out there. Now  we can use the tools of the   st century to try and observe what is  rather than ask what should be  believed. SETI doesn't presume the existence of extra terrestrial intelligence  it merely notes the possibility  if not the probability in this vast universe  which seems fairly uniform. The numbers suggest a universe of possibilities. Our sun is one of     billion stars in our galaxy  and we know that many other stars have planetary systems. We've discovered over     in the last    years  including the small planet  announced earlier this week  which has a radius just twice the size of the Earth. And  if even all of the planetary systems in our galaxy were devoid of life  there are still     billion other galaxies out there  altogether       stars. Now  I'm going to try a trick  and recreate an experiment from this morning. Remember  one billion  But  this time not one billion dollars  one billion stars. Alright  one billion stars. Now  up there     feet above the stage  that's    trillion. Well  what about        Where's the line that marks that  That line would have to be  .  million miles above this stage.    times farther away than the moon  or four percent of the distance to the sun. So  there are many possibilities. And much of this vast universe  much more may be habitable than we once thought  as we study extremophiles on Earth    organisms that can live in conditions totally inhospitable for us  in the hot  high pressure thermal vents at the bottom of the ocean  frozen in ice  in boiling battery acid  in the cooling waters of nuclear reactors. These extremophiles tell us that life may exist in many other environments. But those environments are going to be widely spaced in this universe. Even our nearest star  the Sun    its emissions suffer the tyranny of light speed. It takes a full eight minutes for its radiation to reach us. And the nearest star is  .  light years away  which means its light takes  .  years to get here. And the edge of our galaxy is        light years away  and the nearest galaxy to us   .  million light years. That means any signal we detect would have started its journey a long time ago. And a signal would give us a glimpse of their past  not their present. Which is why Phil Morrison calls SETI   the archaeology of the future.  It tells us about their past  but detection of a signal tells us it's possible for us to have a long future. I think this is what David Deutsch meant in       when he ended his Oxford TEDTalk by saying he had two principles he'd like to share for living  and he would like to carve them on stone tablets. The first is that problems are inevitable. The second is that problems are soluble. So  ultimately what's going to determine the success or failure of SETI is the longevity of technologies  and the mean distance between technologies in the cosmos    distance over space and distance over time. If technologies don't last and persist  we will not succeed. And we're a very young technology in an old galaxy  and we don't yet know whether it's possible for technologies to persist. So  up until now I've been talking to you about really large numbers. Let me talk about a relatively small number. And that's the length of time that the Earth was lifeless. Zircons that are mined in the Jack Hills of western Australia  zircons taken from the Jack Hills of western Australia tell us that within a few hundred million years of the origin of the planet there was abundant water and perhaps even life. So  our planet has spent the vast majority of its  .   billion year history developing life  not anticipating its emergence. Life happened very quickly  and that bodes well for the potential of life elsewhere in the cosmos. And the other thing that one should take away from this chart is the very narrow range of time over which humans can claim to be the dominant intelligence on the planet. It's only the last few hundred thousand years modern humans have been pursuing technology and civilization. So  one needs a very deep appreciation of the diversity and incredible scale of life on this planet as the first step in preparing to make contact with life elsewhere in the cosmos. We are not the pinnacle of evolution. We are not the determined product of billions of years of evolutionary plotting and planning. We are one outcome of a continuing adaptational process. We are residents of one small planet in a corner of the Milky Way galaxy. And Homo sapiens are one small leaf on a very extensive Tree of Life  which is densely populated by organisms that have been honed for survival over millions of years. We misuse language  and talk about the  ascent  of man. We understand the scientific basis for the interrelatedness of life but our ego hasn't caught up yet. So this  ascent  of man  pinnacle of evolution  has got to go. It's a sense of privilege that the natural universe doesn't share. Loren Eiseley has said   One does not meet oneself until one catches the reflection from an eye other than human.  One day that eye may be that of an intelligent alien  and the sooner we eschew our narrow view of evolution the sooner we can truly explore our ultimate origins and destinations. We are a small part of the story of cosmic evolution  and we are going to be responsible for our continued participation in that story  and perhaps SETI will help as well. Occasionally  throughout history  this concept of this very large cosmic perspective comes to the surface  and as a result we see transformative and profound discoveries. So in       Nicholas Copernicus published  The Revolutions of Heavenly Spheres   and by taking the Earth out of the center  and putting the sun in the center of the solar system  he opened our eyes to a much larger universe  of which we are just a small part. And that Copernican revolution continues today to influence science and philosophy and technology and theology. So  in       Giuseppe Coccone and Philip Morrison published the first SETI article in a refereed journal  and brought SETI into the scientific mainstream. And in       Frank Drake conducted the first SETI observation looking at two stars  Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani  for about     hours. Now Drake did not discover extraterrestrial intelligence  but he learned a very valuable lesson from a passing aircraft  and that's that terrestrial technology can interfere with the search for extraterrestrial technology. We've been searching ever since  but it's impossible to overstate the magnitude of the search that remains. All of the concerted SETI efforts  over the last    some years  are equivalent to scooping a single glass of water from the oceans. And no one would decide that the ocean was without fish on the basis of one glass of water. The   st century now allows us to build bigger glasses    much bigger glasses. In Northern California  we're beginning to take observations with the first    telescopes of the Allen Telescope Array    and I've got to take a moment right now to publicly thank Paul Allen and Nathan Myhrvold and all the TeamSETI members in the TED community who have so generously supported this research. The ATA is the first telescope built from a large number of small dishes  and hooked together with computers. It's making silicon as important as aluminum  and we'll grow it in the future by adding more antennas to reach     for more sensitivity and leveraging Moore's law for more processing capability. Today  our signal detection algorithms can find very simple artifacts and noise. If you look very hard here you can see the signal from the Voyager   spacecraft  the most distant human object in the universe      times as far away from us as the sun is. And over those long distances  its signal is very faint when it reaches us. It may be hard for your eye to see it  but it's easily found with our efficient algorithms. But this is a simple signal  and tomorrow we want to be able to find more complex signals. This is a very good year.      is the    th anniversary of Galileo's first use of the telescope  Darwin's    th birthday  the    th anniversary of the publication of  On the Origin of Species   the   th anniversary of SETI as a science  the   th anniversary of the incorporation of the SETI Institute as a non profit  and of course  the   th anniversary of TED. And next month  the Kepler Spacecraft will launch and will begin to tell us just how frequent Earth like planets are  the targets for SETI's searches. In       the U.N. has declared it to be the International Year of Astronomy  a global festival to help us residents of Earth rediscover our cosmic origins and our place in the universe. And in       change has come to Washington  with a promise to put science in its rightful position. So  what would change everything  Well  this is the question the Edge foundation asked this year  and four of the respondents said   SETI.  Why  Well  to quote   The discovery of intelligent life beyond Earth would eradicate the loneliness and solipsism that has plagued our species since its inception. And it wouldn't simply change everything  it would change everything all at once.  So  if that's right  why did we only capture four out of those     minds  I think it's a problem of completion and delivery  because the fine print said   What game changing ideas and scientific developments would you expect to live to see   So  we have a fulfillment problem. We need bigger glasses and more hands in the water  and then working together  maybe we can all live to see the detection of the first extraterrestrial signal. That brings me to my wish. I wish that you would empower Earthlings everywhere to become active participants in the ultimate search for cosmic company. The first step would be to tap into the global brain trust  to build an environment where raw data could be stored  and where it could be accessed and manipulated  where new algorithms could be developed and old algorithms made more efficient. And this is a technically creative challenge  and it would change the perspective of people who worked on it. And then  we'd like to augment the automated search with human insight. We'd like to use the pattern recognition capability of the human eye to find faint  complex signals that our current algorithms miss. And  of course  we'd like to inspire and engage the next generation. We'd like to take the materials that we have built for education  and get them out to students everywhere  students that can't come and visit us at the ATA. We'd like to tell our story better  and engage young people  and thereby change their perspective. I'm sorry Seth Godin  but over the millennia  we've seen where tribalism leads. We've seen what happens when we divide an already small planet into smaller islands. And  ultimately  we actually all belong to only one tribe  to Earthlings. And SETI is a mirror    a mirror that can show us ourselves from an extraordinary perspective  and can help to trivialize the differences among us. If SETI does nothing but change the perspective of humans on this planet  then it will be one of the most profound endeavors in history. So  in the opening days of       a visionary president stood on the steps of the U.S. Capitol and said   We cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass  that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve  that  as the world grows smaller  our common humanity shall reveal itself.  So  I look forward to working with the TED community to hear about your ideas about how to fulfill this wish  and in collaborating with you  hasten the day that that visionary statement can become a reality. Thank you. I'm here today representing a team of artists and technologists and filmmakers that worked together on a remarkable film project for the last four years. And along the way they created a breakthrough in computer visualization. So I want to show you a clip of the film now. Hopefully it won't stutter. And if we did our jobs well  you won't know that we were even involved. Voice  Video   I don't know how it's possible ... but you seem to have more hair. Brad Pitt  What if I told you that I wasn't getting older ... but I was getting younger than everybody else  I was born with some form of disease. Voice  What kind of disease  BP  I was born old. Man  I'm sorry. BP  No need to be. There's nothing wrong with old age. Girl  Are you sick  BP  I heard momma and Tizzy whisper  and they said I was gonna die soon. But ... maybe not. Girl  You're different than anybody I've ever met. BB  There were many changes ... some you could see  some you couldn't. Hair started growing in all sorts of places  along with other things. I felt pretty good  considering. Ed Ulbrich  That was a clip from  The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.  Many of you  maybe you've seen it or you've heard of the story  but what you might not know is that for nearly the first hour of the film  the main character  Benjamin Button  who's played by Brad Pitt  is completely computer generated from the neck up. Now  there's no use of prosthetic makeup or photography of Brad superimposed over another actor's body. We've created a completely digital human head. So I'd like to start with a little bit of history on the project. This is based on an F. Scott Fitzgerald short story. It's about a man who's born old and lives his life in reverse. Now  this movie has floated around Hollywood for well over half a century  and we first got involved with the project in the early '  s  with Ron Howard as the director. We took a lot of meetings and we seriously considered it. But at the time we had to throw in the towel. It was deemed impossible. It was beyond the technology of the day to depict a man aging backwards. The human form  in particular the human head  has been considered the Holy Grail of our industry. The project came back to us about a decade later  and this time with a director named David Fincher. Now  Fincher is an interesting guy. David is fearless of technology  and he is absolutely tenacious. And David won't take  no.  And David believed  like we do in the visual effects industry  that anything is possible as long as you have enough time  resources and  of course  money. And so David had an interesting take on the film  and he threw a challenge at us. He wanted the main character of the film to be played from the cradle to the grave by one actor. It happened to be this guy. We went through a process of elimination and a process of discovery with David  and we ruled out  of course  swapping actors. That was one idea  that we would have different actors  and we would hand off from actor to actor. We even ruled out the idea of using makeup. We realized that prosthetic makeup just wouldn't hold up  particularly in close up. And makeup is an additive process. You have to build the face up. And David wanted to carve deeply into Brad's face to bring the aging to this character. He needed to be a very sympathetic character. So we decided to cast a series of little people that would play the different bodies of Benjamin at the different increments of his life and that we would in fact create a computer generated version of Brad's head  aged to appear as Benjamin  and attach that to the body of the real actor. Sounded great. Of course  this was the Holy Grail of our industry  and the fact that this guy is a global icon didn't help either  because I'm sure if any of you ever stand in line at the grocery store  you know    we see his face constantly. So there really was no tolerable margin of error. There were two studios involved  Warner Brothers and Paramount. And they both believed this would make an amazing film  of course  but it was a very high risk proposition. There was lots of money and reputations at stake. But we believed that we had a very solid methodology that might work ... But despite our verbal assurances  they wanted some proof. And so  in       they commissioned us to do a screen test of Benjamin. And we did it in about five weeks. But we used lots of cheats and shortcuts. We basically put something together to get through the meeting. I'll roll that for you now. This was the first test for Benjamin Button. And in here  you can see  that's a computer generated head    pretty good    attached to the body of an actor. And it worked. And it gave the studio great relief. After many years of starts and stops on this project  and making that tough decision  they finally decided to greenlight the movie. And I can remember  actually  when I got the phone call to congratulate us  to say the movie was a go  I actually threw up. You know  this is some tough stuff. So we started to have early team meetings  and we got everybody together  and it was really more like therapy in the beginning  convincing each other and reassuring each other that we could actually undertake this. We had to hold up an hour of a movie with a character. And it's not a special effects film  it has to be a man. We really felt like we were in a    kind of a    step program. And of course  the first step is  admit you've got a problem.  Laughter  So we had a big problem  we didn't know how we were going to do this. But we did know one thing. Being from the visual effects industry  we  with David  believed that we now had enough time  enough resources  and  God  we hoped we had enough money. And we had enough passion to will the processes and technology into existence. So  when you're faced with something like that  of course you've got to break it down. You take the big problem and you break it down into smaller pieces and you start to attack that. So we had three main areas that we had to focus on. We needed to make Brad look a lot older    needed to age him    years or so. And we also needed to make sure that we could take Brad's idiosyncrasies  his little tics  the little subtleties that make him who he is and have that translate through our process so that it appears in Benjamin on the screen. And we also needed to create a character that could hold up under  really  all conditions. He needed to be able to walk in broad daylight  at nighttime  under candlelight  he had to hold an extreme close up  he had to deliver dialogue  he had to be able to run  he had to be able to sweat  he had to be able to take a bath  to cry  he even had to throw up. Not all at the same time    but he had to  you know  do all of those things. And the work had to hold up for almost the first hour of the movie. We did about     shots. So we needed a system that would allow Benjamin to do everything a human being can do. And we realized that there was a giant chasm between the state of the art of technology in      and where we needed it to be. So we focused on motion capture. I'm sure many of you have seen motion capture. The state of the art at the time was something called marker based motion capture. I'll give you an example here. It's basically the idea of  you wear a leotard  and they put some reflective markers on your body  and instead of using cameras  there're infrared sensors around a volume  and those infrared sensors track the three dimensional position of those markers in real time. And then animators can take the data of the motion of those markers and apply them to a computer generated character. You can see the computer characters on the right are having the same complex motion as the dancers. But we also looked at numbers of other films at the time that were using facial marker tracking  and that's the idea of putting markers on the human face and doing the same process. And as you can see  it gives you a pretty crappy performance. That's not terribly compelling. And what we realized was that what we needed was the information that was going on between the markers. We needed the subtleties of the skin. We needed to see skin moving over muscle moving over bone. We needed creases and dimples and wrinkles and all of those things. Our first revelation was to completely abort and walk away from the technology of the day  the status quo  the state of the art. So we aborted using motion capture. And we were now well out of our comfort zone  and in uncharted territory. So we were left with this idea that we ended up calling  technology stew.  We started to look out in other fields. The idea was that we were going to find nuggets or gems of technology that come from other industries like medical imaging  the video game space  and re appropriate them. And we had to create kind of a sauce. And the sauce was code in software that we'd written to allow these disparate pieces of technology to come together and work as one. Initially  we came across some remarkable research done by a gentleman named Dr. Paul Ekman in the early '  s. He believed that he could  in fact  catalog the human face. And he came up with this idea of Facial Action Coding System  or FACS. He believed that there were    basic poses or shapes of the human face  and that those basic poses or shapes of the face can be combined to create infinite possibilities of everything the human face is capable of doing. And of course  these transcend age  race  culture  gender. So this became the foundation of our research as we went forward. And then we came across some remarkable technology called Contour. And here you can see a subject having phosphorus makeup stippled on her face. And now what we're looking at is really creating a surface capture as opposed to a marker capture. The subject stands in front of a computer array of cameras  and those cameras can  frame by frame  reconstruct the geometry of exactly what the subject's doing at the moment. So  effectively  you get  D data in real time of the subject. And if you look in a comparison  on the left  we see what volumetric data gives us and on the right you see what markers give us. So  clearly  we were in a substantially better place for this. But these were the early days of this technology  and it wasn't really proven yet. We measure complexity and fidelity of data in terms of polygonal count. And so  on the left  we were seeing         polygons. We could go up into the millions of polygons. It seemed to be infinite. This was when we had our  Aha   This was the breakthrough. This is when we're like   OK  we're going to be OK  This is actually going to work.  And the  Aha   was  what if we could take Brad Pitt  and we could put Brad in this device  and use this Contour process  and we could stipple on this phosphorescent makeup and put him under the black lights  and we could  in fact  scan him in real time performing Ekman's FACS poses. Right  So  effectively  we ended up with a  D database of everything Brad Pitt's face is capable of doing. From there  we actually carved up those faces into smaller pieces and components of his face. So we ended up with literally thousands and thousands and thousands of shapes  a complete database of all possibilities that his face is capable of doing. Now  that's great  except we had him at age   . We need to put another    years on him at this point. We brought in Rick Baker  and Rick is one of the great makeup and special effects gurus of our industry. And we also brought in a gentleman named Kazu Tsuji  and Kazu Tsuji is one of the great photorealist sculptors of our time. And we commissioned them to make a maquette  or a bust  of Benjamin. So  in the spirit of  The Great Unveiling     I had to do this    I had to unveil something. So this is Ben   . We created three of these  there's Ben     there's Ben     there's Ben   . And this really became the template for moving forward. Now  this was made from a life cast of Brad. So  in fact  anatomically  it is correct. The eyes  the jaw  the teeth  everything is in perfect alignment with what the real guy has. We have these maquettes scanned into the computer at very high resolution    enormous polygonal count. And so now we had three age increments of Benjamin in the computer. But we needed to get a database of him doing more than that. We went through this process  then  called retargeting. This is Brad doing one of the Ekman FACS poses. And here's the resulting data that comes from that  the model that comes from that. Retargeting is the process of transposing that data onto another model. And because the life cast  or the bust    the maquette    of Benjamin was made from Brad  we could transpose the data of Brad at    onto Brad at   . So now  we had a  D database of everything Brad Pitt's face can do at age     in his   s and in his   s. Next we had to go into the shooting process. So while all that's going on  we're down in New Orleans and locations around the world. And we shot our body actors  and we shot them wearing blue hoods. So these are the gentleman who played Benjamin. And the blue hoods helped us with two things  one  we could easily erase their heads  and we also put tracking markers on their heads so we could recreate the camera motion and the lens optics from the set. But now we needed to get Brad's performance to drive our virtual Benjamin. And so we edited the footage that was shot on location with the rest of the cast and the body actors and about six months later we brought Brad onto a sound stage in Los Angeles and he watched on the screen. His job  then  was to become Benjamin. And so we looped the scenes. He watched again and again. We encouraged him to improvise. And he took Benjamin into interesting and unusual places that we didn't think he was going to go. We shot him with four HD cameras so we'd get multiple views of him and then David would choose the take of Brad being Benjamin that he thought best matched the footage with the rest of the cast. From there we went into a process called image analysis. And so here  you can see again  the chosen take. And you are seeing  now  that data being transposed on to Ben   . And so  what's interesting about this is we used something called image analysis  which is taking timings from different components of Benjamin's face. And so we could choose  say  his left eyebrow. And the software would tell us that  well  in frame    the left eyebrow begins to move from here to here  and it concludes moving in frame   . And so we could choose numbers of positions on the face to pull that data from. And then  the sauce I talked about with our technology stew    that secret sauce was  effectively  software that allowed us to match the performance footage of Brad in live action with our database of aged Benjamin  the FACS shapes that we had. On a frame by frame basis  we could actually reconstruct a  D head that exactly matched the performance of Brad. So this was how the finished shot appeared in the film. And here you can see the body actor. And then this is what we called the  dead head   no reference to Jerry Garcia. And then here's the reconstructed performance now with the timings of the performance. And then  again  the final shot. It was a long process. The next section here  I'm going to just blast through this  because we could do a whole TEDTalk on the next several slides. We had to create a lighting system. So really  a big part of our processes was creating a lighting environment for every single location that Benjamin had to appear so that we could put Ben's head into any scene and it would exactly match the lighting that's on the other actors in the real world. We also had to create an eye system. We found the old adage  you know   The eyes are the window to the soul   absolutely true. So the key here was to keep everybody looking in Ben's eyes. And if you could feel the warmth  and feel the humanity  and feel his intent coming through the eyes  then we would succeed. So we had one person focused on the eye system for almost two full years. We also had to create a mouth system. We worked from dental molds of Brad. We had to age the teeth over time. We also had to create an articulating tongue that allowed him to enunciate his words. There was a whole system written in software to articulate the tongue. We had one person devoted to the tongue for about nine months. He was very popular. Skin displacement  another big deal. The skin had to be absolutely accurate. He's also in an old age home  he's in a nursing home around other old people  so he had to look exactly the same as the others. So  lots of work on skin deformation  you can see in some of these cases it works  in some cases it looks bad. This is a very  very  very early test in our process. So  effectively we created a digital puppet that Brad Pitt could operate with his own face. There were no animators necessary to come in and interpret behavior or enhance his performance. There was something that we encountered  though  that we ended up calling  the digital Botox effect.  So  as things went through this process  Fincher would always say   It sandblasts the edges off of the performance.  And thing our process and the technology couldn't do  is they couldn't understand intent  the intent of the actor. So it sees a smile as a smile. It doesn't recognize an ironic smile  or a happy smile  or a frustrated smile. So it did take humans to kind of push it one way or another. But we ended up calling the entire process and all the technology  emotion capture   as opposed to just motion capture. Take another look. Brad Pitt  Well  I heard momma and Tizzy whisper  and they said I was gonna die soon  but ... maybe not. EU  That's how to create a digital human in    minutes. A couple of quick factoids  it really took     people over two years  and we didn't even talk about    hairstyles and an all digital haircut. But  that is Benjamin. Thank you. Let's talk trash. You know  we had to be taught to renounce the powerful conservation ethic we developed during the Great Depression and World War II. After the war  we needed to direct our enormous production capacity toward creation of products for peacetime. Life Magazine helped in this effort by announcing the introduction of throwaways that would liberate the housewife from the drudgery of doing dishes. Mental note to the liberators  throwaway plastics take a lot of space and don't biodegrade. Only we humans make waste that nature can't digest. Plastics are also hard to recycle. A teacher told me how to express the under five percent of plastics recovered in our waste stream. It's diddly point squat. That's the percentage we recycle. Now  melting point has a lot to do with this. Plastic is not purified by the re melting process like glass and metal. It begins to melt below the boiling point of water and does not drive off the oily contaminants for which it is a sponge. Half of each year's     billion pounds of thermal plastic pellets will be made into fast track trash. A large  unruly fraction of our trash will flow downriver to the sea. Here is the accumulation at Biona Creek next to the L.A. airport. And here is the flotsam near California State University Long Beach and the diesel plant we visited yesterday. In spite of deposit fees  much of this trash leading out to the sea will be plastic beverage bottles. We use two million of them in the United States every five minutes  here imaged by TED presenter Chris Jordan  who artfully documents mass consumption and zooms in for more detail. Here is a remote island repository for bottles off the coast of Baja California. Isla San Roque is an uninhabited bird rookery off Baja's sparsely populated central coast. Notice that the bottles here have caps on them. Bottles made of polyethylene terephthalate  PET  will sink in seawater and not make it this far from civilization. Also  the caps are produced in separate factories from a different plastic  polypropylene. They will float in seawater  but unfortunately do not get recycled under the bottle bills. Let's trace the journey of the millions of caps that make it to sea solo. After a year the ones from Japan are heading straight across the Pacific  while ours get caught in the California current and first head down to the latitude of Cabo San Lucas. After ten years  a lot of the Japanese caps are in what we call the Eastern Garbage Patch  while ours litter the Philippines. After    years  we see emerging the debris accumulation zone of the North Pacific Gyre. It so happens that millions of albatross nesting on Kure and Midway atolls in the Northwest Hawaiian Islands National Monument forage here and scavenge whatever they can find for regurgitation to their chicks. A four month old Laysan Albatross chick died with this in its stomach. Hundreds of thousands of the goose sized chicks are dying with stomachs full of bottle caps and other rubbish  like cigarette lighters ... but  mostly bottle caps. Sadly  their parents mistake bottle caps for food tossing about in the ocean surface. The retainer rings for the caps also have consequences for aquatic animals. This is Mae West  still alive at a zookeeper's home in New Orleans. I wanted to see what my home town of Long Beach was contributing to the problem  so on Coastal Clean Up Day in      I went to the Long Beach Peninsula  at the east end of our long beach. We cleaned up the swaths of beach shown. I offered five cents each for bottle caps. I got plenty of takers. Here are the       bottle caps they collected. I thought I would spend    bucks. That day I ended up spending nearly   . I separated them by color and put them on display the next Earth Day at Cabrillo Marine Aquarium in San Pedro. Governor Schwarzenegger and his wife Maria stopped by to discuss the display. In spite of my  girly man  hat  crocheted from plastic shopping bags  they shook my hand.  Laughter  I showed him and Maria a zooplankton trawl from the gyre north of Hawaii with more plastic than plankton. Here's what our trawl samples from the plastic soup our ocean has become look like. Trawling a zooplankton net on the surface for a mile produces samples like this. And this. Now  when the debris washes up on the beaches of Hawaii it looks like this. And this particular beach is Kailua Beach  the beach where our president and his family vacationed before moving to Washington. Now  how do we analyze samples like this one that contain more plastic than plankton  We sort the plastic fragments into different size classes  from five millimeters to one third of a millimeter. Small bits of plastic concentrate persistent organic pollutants up to a million times their levels in the surrounding seawater. We wanted to see if the most common fish in the deep ocean  at the base of the food chain  was ingesting these poison pills. We did hundreds of necropsies  and over a third had polluted plastic fragments in their stomachs. The record holder  only two and a half inches long  had    pieces in its tiny stomach. Now  you can buy certified organic produce. But no fishmonger on Earth can sell you a certified organic wild caught fish. This is the legacy we are leaving to future generations. The throwaway society cannot be contained    it has gone global. We simply cannot store and maintain or recycle all our stuff. We have to throw it away. Now  the market can do a lot for us  but it can't fix the natural system in the ocean we've broken. All the king's horses and all the king's men ... will never gather up all the plastic and put the ocean back together again. Narrator  Video   The levels are increasing  the amount of packaging is increasing  the  throwaway  concept of living is proliferating  and it's showing up in the ocean. Anchor  He offers no hope of cleaning it up. Straining the ocean for plastic would be beyond the budget of any country and it might kill untold amounts of sea life in the process. The solution  Moore says  is to stop the plastic at its source  stop it on land before it falls in the ocean. And in a plastic wrapped and packaged world  he doesn't hold out much hope for that  either. This is Brian Rooney for Nightline  in Long Beach  California. Charles Moore  Thank you. This is the first of two rather extraordinary photographs I'm going to show you today. It was taken    years ago. I was    years old at the time. I had just returned from one of the deepest dives I'd ever made at that time     a little over     feet    and  I had caught this little fish here. It turns out that that particular one was the first live one of that ever taken alive. I'm not just an ichthyologist  I'm a bona fide fish nerd. And to a fish nerd  this is some pretty exciting stuff. And more exciting was the fact that the person who took this photo was a guy named Jack Randall  the greatest living ichthyologist on Earth  the Grand Poobah of fish nerds  if you will. And so  it was really exciting to me to have this moment in time  it really set the course for the rest of my life. But really the most significant thing  the most profound thing about this picture is that it was taken two days before I was completely paralyzed from the neck down. I made a really stupid kind of mistake that most    year old males do when they think they're immortal  and I got a bad case of the bends  and was paralyzed  and had to be flown back for treatment. I learned two really important things that day. The first thing I learned    well  I'm mortal  that's a really big one. And the second thing I learned was that I knew  with profound certainty  that this is exactly what I was going to do for the rest of my life. I had to focus all my energies towards going to find new species of things down on deep coral reefs. Now  when you think of a coral reef  this is what most people think of  all these big  hard  elaborate corals and lots of bright  colorful fishes and things. But  this is really just the tip of the iceberg. If you look at this diagram of a coral reef  we know a lot about that part up near the top  and the reason we know so much about it is scuba divers can very easily go down there and access it. There is a problem with scuba though  in that it imposes some limitations on how deep you can go  and it turns out that depth is about     feet. I'll get into why that is in just a minute. But  the point is that scuba divers generally stay less than     feet deep  and very rarely go much below this  at least  not with any kind of sanity. So  to go deeper  most biologists have turned to submersibles. Now  submersibles are great  wonderful things  but if you're going to spend        dollars a day to use one of these things  and it's capable of going       feet  you're sure not going to go farting around up here in a couple of hundred feet  you're going to go way  way  way  down deep. So  the bottom line is that almost all research using submersibles has taken place well below     feet. Now  it's pretty obvious at this point that there's this zone here in the middle and that's the zone that really centers around my own personal pursuit of happiness. I want to find out what's in this zone. We know almost nothing about it. Scuba divers can't get there  submarines go right on past it. It took me a year to learn how to walk again after I had my diving accident in Palau and during that year I spent a lot of time learning about the physics and physiology of diving and figuring out how to overcome these limitations. So  I'm just going to show you a basic idea. We're all breathing air right now. Air is a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen  about    percent oxygen. About    percent nitrogen is in our lungs. And there's a phenomenon called Henry's Law that says that gases will dissolve into a fluid in proportion to the partial pressures which you're exposing them to. So  basically the gas dissolves into our body. The oxygen is bound by metabolism  we use it for energy. The nitrogen just sort of floats around in our blood and tissues  and that's all fine  that's how we're designed. The problem happens when you start to go underwater. Now  the deeper you go underwater  the higher the pressure is. If you were to go down to a depth of about     feet  which is the recommended limit for most scuba divers  you get this pressure effect. And the effect of that pressure is that you have an increased density of gas molecules in every breath you take. Over time  those gas molecules dissolve into your blood and tissues and start to fill you up. Now  if you were to go down to  say      feet  you don't have five times as many gas molecules in your lungs    you've got    times as many gas molecules in your lungs. And  sure enough  they dissolve into your blood  and into your tissues as well. And of course  if you were to down to where there's    times as much    the deeper you go  the more exacerbating the problem becomes. And the problem  the limitation of diving with air is all those dots in your body    all the nitrogen and all the oxygen. There're three basic limitations of scuba diving. The first limitation is the oxygen    oxygen toxicity. Now  we all know the song   Love is like oxygen.  You get too much  you get too high.  Not enough  and you're going to die.  Well  in the context of diving  you get too much  you die also. You die also because oxygen toxicity can cause a seizure    makes you convulse underwater  not a good thing to happen underwater. It happens because there's too much concentration of oxygen in your body. The nitrogen has two problems. One of them is what Jacques Cousteau called  rapture of the deep.  It's nitrogen narcosis. It makes you loopy. The deeper you go  the loopier you get. You don't want to drive drunk  you don't want to dive drunk  so that's a real big problem. And of course  the third problem is the one I found out the hard way in Palau  which is the bends. Now the one thing that I forgot to mention  is that to obviate the problem of the nitrogen narcosis    all of those blue dots in our body    you remove the nitrogen and you replace it with helium. Now helium's a gas  there're a lot of reasons why helium's good  it's a tiny molecule  it's inert  it doesn't give you narcosis. So that's the basic concept that we use. But  the theory's relatively easy. The tricky part is the implementation. So  this is how I began  about    years ago. I'll admit  it wasn't exactly the smartest of starts  but  you know  you got to start somewhere. At the time  I wasn't the only one who didn't know what I was doing    almost nobody did. And this rig was actually used for a dive of     feet. Over time we got a little bit better at it  and we came up with this really sophisticated looking rig with four scuba tanks and five regulators and all the right gas mixtures and all that good stuff. And it was fine and dandy  and it allowed us to go down and find new species. This picture was taken     feet deep  catching new species of fish. But  the problem was that it didn't allow us much time. For all its bulk and size  it only gave us about    minutes at most down at those sorts of depths. We needed more time. There had to be a better way. And  indeed  there is a better way. In       I was fortunate enough to get access to these prototype closed circuit rebreathers. Alright  closed circuit rebreather    what is it about it that makes it different from scuba  and why is it better  Well  there are three main advantages to a rebreather. One  they're quiet  they don't make any noise. Two  they allow you to stay underwater longer. Three  they allow you to go deeper. How is it that they do that  Well  in order to really understand how they do that you have to take off the hood  and look underneath and see what's going on. There are three basic systems to a closed  circuit rebreather. The most fundamental of these is called the breathing loop. It's a breathing loop because you breathe off of it  and it's a closed loop  and you breathe the same gas around and around and around. So there's a mouthpiece that you put in your mouth  and there's also a counterlung  or in this case  two counterlungs. Now  the counterlungs aren't high tech  they're just simply flexible bags. They allow you to mechanically breathe  or mechanically ventilate. When you exhale your breath  it goes in the exhale counterlung  when you inhale a breath  it comes from the inhale counterlung. It's just pure mechanics  allowing you to cycle air through this breathing loop. And  the other component on a breathing loop is the carbon dioxide absorbent canister. Now  as we breathe  we produce carbon dioxide  and that carbon dioxide needs to be scrubbed out of the system. There's a chemical filter in there that pulls the carbon dioxide out of the breathing gas    so that  when it comes back to us to breathe again  it's safe to breathe again. So that's the breathing loop in a nutshell. The second main component of a closed circuit rebreather is the gas system. The primary purpose of the gas system is to provide oxygen  to replenish the oxygen that your body consumes. So the main tank  the main critical thing  is this oxygen gas supply cylinder we have here. But  if we only had an oxygen gas supply cylinder we wouldn't be able to go very deep  because we'd run into oxygen toxicity very  very quickly. So we need another gas  something to dilute the oxygen with. And that  fittingly enough  is called the diluent gas supply. In our applications  we generally put air inside this diluent gas supply  because it's a very cheap and easy source of nitrogen. So that's where we get our nitrogen from. But  if we want to go deeper  of course  we need another gas supply. We need helium  and the helium is what we really need to go deep. And usually we'll have a slightly larger cylinder mounted exterior on the rebreather  like this. And that's what we use to inject  as we start to do our deep dives. We also have a second oxygen cylinder  that's solely as a back up in case there's a problem with our first oxygen supply we can continue to breathe. And the way you manage all these different gases and all these different gas supplies is this really high tech  sophisticated gas block up on the front here  where it's easy to reach. It's got all the valves and knobs and things you need to do to inject the right gases at the right time. Now  normally you don't have to do that because all of it's done automatically for you with the electronics  the third system of a rebreather. The most critical part of a rebreather is the oxygen sensors. You need three of them  so that if one of them goes bad  you know which one it is. You need voting logic. You also have three microprocessors. Any one of those computers can run the entire system  so if you have to lose two of them  there's also back up power supplies. And of course there're multiple displays  to get the information to the diver. This is the high tech gadgetry that allows us to do what we do on these kinds of deep dives. And I can talk about it all day    just ask my wife    but I want to move on to something that's kind of much more interesting. I'm going to take you on a deep dive. I'm going to show you what it's like to do one of these dives that we do. We start up here on the boat  and for all this high tech  expensive equipment  this is still the best way to get in the water    just pfft     flop over the side of the boat. Now  as I showed you in the earlier diagram  these reefs that we dive on start out near the surface and they go almost vertically  completely straight down. So  we drop in the water  and we just sort of go over the edge of this cliff  and then we just start dropping  dropping  dropping. People have asked me   It must take a long time to get there   No  it only takes a couple of minutes to get all the way down to three or four hundred feet  which is where we're aiming for. It's kind of like skydiving in slow motion. It's really a very interesting    you ever see  The Abyss  where Ed Harris  you know  he's sinking down along the side of the wall  That's kind of what it feels like. It's pretty amazing. Also  when you get down there  you find that the water is very  very clear. It's extremely clear water  because there's hardly any plankton. But  when you turn on your light  you look around at the caves  and all of a sudden you're confronted with a tremendous amount of diversity  much more than anyone used to believe. Now not all of it is new species    like that fish you see with the white stripe  that's a known species. But  if you look carefully into the cracks and crevices  you'll see little things scurrying all over the place. There's a just unbelievable diversity. It's not just fish  either. These are crinoids  sponges  black corals. There're some more fishes. And those fishes that you see right now are new species. They're still new species because I had a video camera on this dive instead of my net  so they're still waiting down there for someone to go find them. But this is what it looks like  and this kind of habitat just goes on and on and on for miles. This is Papua  New Guinea. Now little fishes and invertebrates aren't the only things we see down there. We also see sharks  much more regularly than I would have expected to. And we're not quite sure why. But what I want you to do right now is imagine yourself     feet underwater  with all this high tech gear on your back  you're in a remote reef off Papua  New Guinea  thousands of miles from the nearest recompression chamber  and you're completely surrounded by sharks. Video  Look at those ... Uh oh ... uh oh  I think we have their attention.  Laughter  Richard Pyle  When you start talking like Donald Duck  there's no situation in the world that can seem tense. So  we're down there  and this is at     feet    that's looking straight up  by the way  so you can get a sense of how far away the surface is. And if you're a biologist and you know about sharks  and you want to assess  you know  how much jeopardy am I really in here  there's one question that sort of jumps to the forefront of your mind immediately which is    Diver    Video   What kind of sharks  Diver    Uh  silvertip sharks. Diver    Oh. RP  Silvertip sharks    they're actually three species of sharks here. The silvertips are the one with the white edges on the fin  and there're also gray reef sharks and some hammerheads off in the distance. And yes  it's a little nerve wracking. Diver    Video   Hoo  That little guy is frisky   Laughter  Now  you've seen video like this on TV a lot  and it's very intimidating  and I think it gives the wrong impression about sharks. Sharks are actually not very dangerous animals and that's why we weren't worried much  why we were joking around down there. More people are killed by pigs  more people are killed by lightning strikes  more people are killed at soccer games in England. There's a lot of other ways you can die. And I'm not making that stuff up. Coconuts  You can get killed by a coconut more likely than killed by a shark. So sharks aren't quite as dangerous as most people make them out to be. Now  I don't know if any of you get U.S. News and World Report    I got the recent issue. There's a cover story all about the great explorers of our time. The last article is an article entitled  No New Frontiers.  It questions whether or not there really are any new frontiers out there  whether there are any real  true  hardcore discoveries that can still be made. And this is my favorite line from the article. As a fish nerd  I have to laugh  because you know they don't call us fish nerds for nothing    we actually do get excited about finding a new dorsal spine in a guppy. But  it's much more than that. And  I want to show you a few of the guppies we've found over the years. This one's    you know  you can see how ugly it is. Even if you ignore the scientific value of this thing  just look at the monetary value of this thing. A couple of these ended up getting sold through the aquarium trade to Japan  where they sold for        dollars apiece. That's half a million dollars per pound. Here's another new angelfish we discovered. This one we actually first discovered back in the air days    the bad old air days  as we used to say    when we were doing these kind of dives with air. We were at     feet. And I remember coming up from one of these deep dives  and I had this fog  and the narcosis takes a little while to  you know  fade away. It's sort of like sobering up. And I had this vague recollection of seeing these yellow fish with a black spot  and I thought   Aw  damn. I should have caught one. I think that's a new species.  And then  eventually  I got around to looking in my bucket. Sure enough  I had caught one    I just completely forgot that I had caught one.  Laughter  And so this one we decided to give the name Centropyge narcosis to. So that's it's official scientific name  in reference to its deep dwelling habits. And this is another neat one. When we first found it  we weren't even sure what family this thing belonged to  so we just called it the Dr. Seuss fish  because it looked like something out of one of those books. Now  this one's pretty cool. If you go to Papua  New Guinea  and go down     feet  you're going to see these big mounds. And this may be kind of hard to see  but they're about    oh  a couple meters in diameter. If you look closely  you'll see there's a little white fish and gray fish that hangs out near them. Well  it turns out this little white fish builds these giant mounds  one pebble at a time. It's really extraordinary to find something like this. It's not just new species  it's new behavior  it's new ecology it's all kind of new things. So  what I'm going to show you right now  very quickly  is just a sampling of a few of the new species we've discovered. What's extraordinary about this is not just the sheer number of species we're finding    although as you can see that's pretty amazing  this is only half of what we've found    what's extraordinary is how quickly we find them. We're up to seven new species per hour of time we spend at that depth. Now  if you go to an Amazon jungle and fog a tree  you may get a lot of bugs  but for fishes  there's nowhere in the world you can get seven new species per hour of time. Now  we've done some back of the envelope calculations  and we're predicting that there are probably on the order of       to       new species in the Indo Pacific alone. There are only five to six thousand known species. So a very large percentage of what is out there isn't really known. We thought we had a handle on all the reef fish diversity    evidently not. And I'm going to just close on a very somber note. At the beginning I told you that I was going to show you two extraordinary photographs. This is the second extraordinary photograph I'm going to show you. This one was taken at the exact moment I was down there filming those sharks. This was taken exactly     feet above my head. And the reason this photograph is extraordinary is because it captures a moment in the very last minute of a person's life. Less than    seconds after this picture was taken  this guy was dead. When we recovered his body  we figured out what had gone wrong. He had made a very simple mistake. He turned the wrong valve when he filled his cylinder    he had    percent oxygen in his tank when he should have had   . He had an oxygen toxicity seizure and he drowned. The reason I show this    not to put a downer on everything    but I just want to use it to key off my philosophy of life in general  which is that we all have two goals. The first goal we share with every other living thing on this planet  which is to survive. I call it perpetuation  the survival of the species and survival of ourselves  because they're both about perpetuating the genome. And the second goal  for those of us who have mastered that first goal  is to    you know  you call it spiritual fulfillment  you can call it financial success  you can call it any number of different things. I call it seeking joy    this pursuit of happiness. So  I guess my theme on this is this guy lived his life to the fullest  he absolutely did. You have to balance those two goals. If you live your whole life in fear    I mean  life is a sexually transmitted disease with     percent mortality. So  you can't live your life in fear. I thought that was an old one. But  at the same time you don't want to get so focused on rule number two  or goal number two  that you neglect goal number one. Because once you're dead  you really can't enjoy anything after that. I wish you all the best of luck in maintaining that balance in your future endeavors. Thanks. I was raised in Seoul  Korea  and moved to New York City in      to attend college. I was pre med at the time  and I thought I would become a surgeon because I was interested in anatomy and dissecting animals really piqued my curiosity. At the same time  I fell in love with New York City. I started to realize that I could look at the whole city as a living organism. I wanted to dissect it and look into its unseen layers. And the way to it  for me  was through artistic means. So  eventually I decided to pursue an MFA instead of an M.D. and in grad school I became interested in creatures that dwell in the hidden corners of the city. In New York City  rats are part of commuters' daily lives. Most people ignore them or are frightened of them. But I took a liking to them because they dwell on the fringes of society. And even though they're used in labs to promote human lives  they're also considered pests. I also started looking around in the city and trying to photograph them. One day  in the subway  I was snapping pictures of the tracks hoping to catch a rat or two  and a man came up to me and said   You can't take photographs here. The MTA will confiscate your camera.  I was quite shocked by that  and thought to myself   Well  OK then. I'll follow the rats.  Then I started going into the tunnels  which made me realize that there's a whole new dimension to the city that I never saw before and most people don't get to see. Around the same time  I met like minded individuals who call themselves urban explorers  adventurers  spelunkers  guerrilla historians  etc. I was welcomed into this loose  Internet based network of people who regularly explore urban ruins such as abandoned subway stations  tunnels  sewers  aqueducts  factories  hospitals  shipyards and so on. When I took photographs in these locations  I felt there was something missing in the pictures. Simply documenting these soon to be demolished structures wasn't enough for me. So I wanted to create a fictional character or an animal that dwells in these underground spaces  and the simplest way to do it  at the time  was to model myself. I decided against clothing because I wanted the figure to be without any cultural implications or time specific elements. I wanted a simple way to represent a living body inhabiting these decaying  derelict spaces. This was taken in the Riviera Sugar Factory in Red Hook  Brooklyn. It's now an empty  six acre lot waiting for a shopping mall right across from the new Ikea. I was very fond of this space because it's the first massive industrial complex I found on my own that is abandoned. When I first went in  I was scared  because I heard dogs barking and I thought they were guard dogs. But they happened to be wild dogs living there  and it was right by the water  so there were swans and ducks swimming around and trees growing everywhere and bees nesting in the sugar barrels. The nature had really reclaimed the whole complex. And  in a way  I wanted the human figure in the picture to become a part of that nature. When I got comfortable in the space  it also felt like a big playground. I would climb up the tanks and hop across exposed beams as if I went back in time and became a child again. This was taken in the old Croton Aqueduct  which supplied fresh water to New York City for the first time. The construction began in     . It lasted about five years. It got abandoned when the new Croton Aqueducts opened in     . When you go into spaces like this  you're directly accessing the past  because they sit untouched for decades. I love feeling the aura of a space that has so much history. Instead of looking at reproductions of it at home  you're actually feeling the hand laid bricks and shimmying up and down narrow cracks and getting wet and muddy and walking in a dark tunnel with a flashlight. This is a tunnel underneath Riverside Park. It was built in the     s by Robert Moses. The murals were done by a graffiti artist to commemorate the hundreds of homeless people that got relocated from the tunnel in      when the tunnel reopened for trains. Walking in this tunnel is very peaceful. There's nobody around you  and you hear the kids playing in the park above you  completely unaware of what's underneath. When I was going out a lot to these places  I was feeling a lot of anxiety and isolation because I was in a solitary phase in my life  and I decided to title my series  Naked City Spleen   which references Charles Baudelaire.  Naked City  is a nickname for New York  and  Spleen  embodies the melancholia and inertia that come from feeling alienated in an urban environment. This is the same tunnel. You see the sunbeams coming from the ventilation ducts and the train approaching. This is a tunnel that's abandoned in Hell's Kitchen. I was there alone  setting up  and a homeless man approached. I was basically intruding in his living space. I was really frightened at first  but I calmly explained to him that I was working on an art project and he didn't seem to mind and so I went ahead and put my camera on self timer and ran back and forth. And when I was done  he actually offered me his shirt to wipe off my feet and kindly walked me out. It must have been a very unusual day for him. One thing that struck me  after this incident  was that a space like that holds so many deleted memories of the city. That homeless man  to me  really represented an element of the unconscious of the city. He told me that he was abused above ground and was once in Riker's Island  and at last he found peace and quiet in that space. The tunnel was once built for the prosperity of the city  but is now a sanctuary for outcasts  who are completely forgotten in the average urban dweller's everyday life. This is underneath my alma mater  Columbia University. The tunnels are famous for having been used during the development of the Manhattan Project. This particular tunnel is interesting because it shows the original foundations of Bloomingdale Insane Asylum  which was demolished in      when Columbia moved in. This is the New York City Farm Colony  which was a poorhouse in Staten Island from the     s to the     s. Most of my photos are set in places that have been abandoned for decades  but this is an exception. This children's hospital was closed in       it's located in Newark. When I was there three years ago  the windows were broken and the walls were peeling  but everything was left there as it was. You see the autopsy table  morgue trays  x ray machines and even used utensils  which you see on the autopsy table. After exploring recently abandoned buildings  I felt that everything could fall into ruins very fast  your home  your office  a shopping mall  a church    any man made structures around you. I was reminded of how fragile our sense of security is and how vulnerable people truly are. I love to travel  and Berlin has become one of my favorite cities. It's full of history  and also full of underground bunkers and ruins from the war. This was taken under a homeless asylum built in      to house       people. I saw the structure while I was on the train  and I got off at the next station and met people there that gave me access to their catacomb like basement  which was used for ammunition storage during the war and also  at some point  to hide groups of Jewish refugees. This is the actual catacombs in Paris. I explored there extensively in the off limits areas and fell in love right away. There are more than     miles of tunnels  and only about a mile is open to the public as a museum. The first tunnels date back to    B.C. They were consistently dug as limestone quarries and by the   th century  the caving in of some of these quarries posed safety threats  so the government ordered reinforcing of the existing quarries and dug new observation tunnels in order to monitor and map the whole place. As you can see  the system is very complex and vast. It's very dangerous to get lost in there. And at the same time  there was a problem in the city with overflowing cemeteries. So the bones were moved from the cemeteries into the quarries  making them into the catacombs. The remains of over six million people are housed in there  some over       years old. This was taken under the Montparnasse Cemetery where most of the ossuaries are located. There are also phone cables that were used in the '  s and many bunkers from the World War II era. This is a German bunker. Nearby there's a French bunker  and the whole tunnel system is so complex that the two parties never met. The tunnels are famous for having been used by the Resistance  which Victor Hugo wrote about in  Les Miserables.  And I saw a lot of graffiti from the     s  like this one. After exploring the underground of Paris  I decided to climb up  and I climbed a Gothic monument that's right in the middle of Paris. This is the Tower of Saint Jacques. It was built in the early     s. I don't recommend sitting on a gargoyle in the middle of January  naked. It was not very comfortable.  Laughter  And all this time  I never saw a single rat in any of these places  until recently  when I was in the London sewers. This was probably the toughest place to explore. I had to wear a gas mask because of the toxic fumes    I guess  except for in this picture. And when the tides of waste matter come in it sounds as if a whole storm is approaching you. This is a still from a film I worked on recently  called  Blind Door.  I've become more interested in capturing movement and texture. And the   mm black and white film gave a different feel to it. And this is the first theater project I worked on. I adapted and produced  A Dream Play  by August Strindberg. It was performed last September one time only in the Atlantic Avenue tunnel in Brooklyn  which is considered to be the oldest underground train tunnel in the world  built in     . I've been leaning towards more collaborative projects like these  lately. But whenever I get a chance I still work on my series. The last place I visited was the Mayan ruins of Copan  Honduras. This was taken inside an archaeological tunnel in the main temple. I like doing more than just exploring these spaces. I feel an obligation to animate and humanize these spaces continually in order to preserve their memories in a creative way    before they're lost forever. Thank you. Four years ago  on the TED stage  I announced a company I was working with at the time called Odeo. And because of that announcement  we got a big article in The New York Times  which led to more press  which led to more attention  and me deciding to become CEO of that company    whereas I was just an adviser    and raising a round of venture capital and ramping up hiring. One of the guys I hired was an engineer named Jack Dorsey  and a year later  when we were trying to decide which way to go with Odeo  Jack presented an idea he'd been tinkering around with for a number of years that was based around sending simple status updates to friends. We were also playing with SMS at the time at Odeo  so we kind of put two and two together  and in early      we launched Twitter as a side project at Odeo. Now  it's hard to justify doing a side project at a startup  where focus is so critical  but I had actually launched Blogger as a side project to my previous company  thinking it was just a little thing we'd do on the side  and it ended up taking over not only the company  but my life for the next five or six years. So I learned to follow hunches even though you can't necessarily justify them or know where they're going to go. And that's kind of what's happened with Twitter  time after time. So  for those of you unfamiliar  Twitter is based around a very simple  seemingly trivial concept. You say what you're doing in     characters or less  and people who are interested in you get those updates. If they're really interested  they get the update as a text message on their cell phone. So  for instance  I may Twitter right now that I'm giving a talk at TED. And in my case  when I hit send  up to        people will receive that message in a matter of seconds. Now  the fundamental idea is that Twitter lets people share moments of their lives whenever they want  be they momentous occasions or mundane ones. It is by sharing these moments as they're happening that lets people feel more connected and in touch  despite distance  and in real time. This is the primary use we saw of Twitter from the beginning  and what got us excited. What we didn't anticipate was the many  many other uses that would evolve from this very simple system. One of the things we realized was how important Twitter could be during real time events. When the wildfires broke out in San Diego  in October of       people turned to Twitter to report what was happening and to find information from neighbors about what was happening around them. But it wasn't just individuals. The L.A. Times actually turned to Twitter to dispense information as well  and put a Twitter feed on the front page  and the L.A. Fire Department and Red Cross used it to dispense news and updates as well. At this event  dozens of people here are Twittering and thousands of people around the world are following along because they want to know what it feels like to be here and what's happening. Among the other interesting things that have cropped up are many things from businesses  from marketing and communications and predictable things  to an insanely popular Korean barbecue taco truck that drives around L.A. and Twitters where it stops  causing a line to form around the block. Politicians have recently begun Twittering. In fact  there are    members of Congress who currently have Twitter accounts. And they're tweeting  in some cases  from behind closed door sessions with the President. In this case  this guy's not liking what he's hearing. The President himself is our most popular Twitter user  although his tweets have dropped off as of late  while Senator McCain's have picked up. As have this guy's. Twitter was originally designed as a broadcast medium  you send one message and it goes out to everybody  and you receive the messages you're interested in. One of the many ways that users shaped the evolution of Twitter was by inventing a way to reply to a specific person or a specific message. So  this syntax  the   username  that Shaquille O'Neal's using here to reply to one of his fans  was completely invented by users  and we didn't build it into the system until it already became popular and then we made it easier. This is one of the many ways that users have shaped the system. Another is via the API. We built an application programming interface  which basically means that programmers can write software that interacts with Twitter. We currently know about over       pieces of software that can send Twitter updates    interfaces for Mac  Windows  your iPhone  your BlackBerry    as well as things like a device that lets an unborn baby Twitter when it kicks or a plant Twitter when it needs water. Probably the most important third party development came from a little company in Virginia called Summize. Summize built a Twitter search engine. And they tapped into the fact that  if you have millions of people around the world talking about what they're doing and what's around them  you have an incredible resource to find out about any topic or event while it's going on. This really changed how we perceived Twitter. For instance  here's what people are saying about TED. This is another way that our mind was shifted  and Twitter wasn't what we thought it was. We liked this so much we actually bought the company and are folding it into the main product. This not only lets you view Twitters in different ways  but it introduces new use cases as well. One of my favorites is what happened a few months ago when there was a gas shortage in Atlanta. Some users figured out that they would Twitter when they found gas    where it was  and how much it cost    and then appended the keyword   atlgas  which let other people search for that and find gas themselves. And this trend of people using this communication network to help each other out goes far beyond the original idea of just keeping up with family and friends. It's happened more and more lately  whether it's raising money for homeless people or to dig wells in Africa or for a family in crisis. People have raised tens of thousands of dollars over Twitter in a matter of days on several occasions. It seems like when you give people easier ways to share information  more good things happen. I have no idea what will happen next with Twitter. I've learned to follow the hunch  but never assume where it will go. Thanks. Chris Anderson  We're not quite done yet. So  look  if we could have this screen live. This is actually the most terrifying thing that any speaker can do after they've been to an event. It's totally intimidating. So  this would be the Twitter search screen. So we're going to just type a couple of random words into Twitter. For example   Evan Williams.   Evan Williams  give people more good ways to share information and follow your hunch at TED.   Currently listening to Evan Williams.   Currently listening to Evan Williams.   Evan Williams     Oh.  Evan Williams is just dying on stage here at TED. Worst talk ever    Laughter  Evan Williams  Nice. Thanks. CA  Just kidding. But  literally in the eight minutes he was talking  there are about fifty tweets that already came on the talk. So he'll see every aspect of the reaction  the fact that Barack Obama is the biggest Twitterer  the fact that it came out of TED. I don't think there's any other way of getting instant feedback that way. You have build something very fascinating  and it looks like its best times are still ahead of it. So  thank you very much  Evan. EW  Thank you. CA  That was very interesting. Back in       I started working for a company called Interval Research  which was just then being founded by David Lidell and Paul Allen as a for profit research enterprise in Silicon Valley. I met with David to talk about what I might do in his company. I was just coming out of a failed virtual reality business and supporting myself by being on the speaking circuit and writing books    after twenty years or so in the computer game industry having ideas that people didn't think they could sell. And David and I discovered that we had a question in common  that we really wanted the answer to  and that was   Why hasn't anybody built any computer games for little girls   Why is that  It can't just be a giant sexist conspiracy. These people aren't that smart. There's six billion dollars on the table. They would go for it if they could figure out how. So  what is the deal here  And as we thought about our goals    I should say that Interval is really a humanistic institution  in the classical sense that humanism  at its best  finds a way to combine clear eyed empirical research with a set of core values that fundamentally love and respect people. The basic idea of humanism is the improvable quality of life  that we can do good things  that there are things worth doing because they're good things to do  and that clear eyed empiricism can help us figure out how to do them. So  contrary to popular belief  there is not a conflict of interest between empiricism and values. And Interval Research is kind of the living example of how that can be true. So David and I decided to go find out  through the best research we could muster  what it would take to get a little girl to put her hands on a computer  to achieve the level of comfort and ease with the technology that little boys have because they play video games. We spent two and a half years conducting research  we spent another year and a half in advance development. Then we formed a spin off company. In the research phase of the project at Interval  we partnered with a company called Cheskin Research  and these people    Davis Masten and Christopher Ireland    changed my mind entirely about what market research was and what it could be. They taught me how to look and see  and they did not do the incredibly stupid thing of saying to a child   Of all these things we already make you  which do you like best      which gives you zero answers that are usable. So  what we did for the first two and a half years was four things  We did an extensive review of the literature in related fields  like cognitive psychology  spatial cognition  gender studies  play theory  sociology  primatology. Thank you Frans de Waal  wherever you are  I love you and I'd give anything to meet you. After we had done that with a pretty large team of people and discovered what we thought the salient issues were with girls and boys and playing    because  after all  that's really what this is about    we moved to the second phase of our work  where we interviewed adult experts in academia  some of the people who'd produced the literature that we found relevant. Also  we did focus groups with people who were on the ground with kids every day  like playground supervisors. We talked to them  confirmed some hypotheses and identified some serious questions about gender difference and play. Then we did what I consider to be the heart of the work  interviewed       children  boys and girls  ages seven to     all over the United States    except for Silicon Valley  Boston and Austin because we knew that their little families would have millions of computers in them and they wouldn't be a representative sample. And at the end of those remarkable conversations with kids and their best friends across the United States  after two years  we pulled together some survey data from another        children  drew up a set up of what we thought were the key findings of our research  and spent another year transforming them into design heuristics  for designing computer based products    and  in fact  any kind of products    for little girls  ages eight to   . And we spent that time designing interactive prototypes for computer software and testing them with little girls. In       in November  we formed the company Purple Moon which was a spinoff of Interval Research  and our chief investors were Interval Research  Vulcan Northwest  Institutional Venture Partners and Allen and Company. We launched a website on September  nd that has now served    million pages  and has        registered young girl users. They visit an average of one and a half times a day  spend an average of    minutes a visit  and look at    pages a visit. So we feel that we've formed a successful online community with girls. We launched two titles in October     Rockett's New School     the first of a series of products    is about a character called Rockett beginning her first day of school in eighth grade at a brand new place  with a blank slate  which allows girls to play with the question of   What will I be like when I'm older    What's it going to be like to be in high school or junior high school  Who are my friends    to exercise the love of social complexity and the narrative intelligence that drives most of their play behavior  and which embeds in it values about noticing that we have lots of choices in our lives and the ways that we conduct ourselves. The other title that we launched is called  Secret Paths in the Forest   which addresses the more fantasy oriented  inner lives of girls. These two titles both showed up in the top    entertainment titles in PC Data    entertainment titles in PC Data in December  right up there with  John Madden Football   which thrills me to death. So  we're real  and we've touched several hundreds of thousands of little girls. We've made half a billion impressions with marketing and PR for this brand  Purple Moon. Ninety six percent of them  roughly  have been positive  four percent of them have been  other.  I want to talk about the other  because the politics of this enterprise  in a way  have been the most fascinating part of it  for me. There are really two kinds of negative reviews that we've received. One kind of reviewer is a male gamer who thinks he knows what games ought to be  and won't show the product to little girls. The other kind of reviewer is a certain flavor of feminist who thinks they know what little girls ought to be. And so it's funny to me that these interesting  odd bedfellows have one thing in common  they don't listen to little girls. They haven't looked at children and they're certainly not demonstrating any love for them. I'd like to play you some voices of little girls from the two and a half years of research that we did    actually  some of the voices are more recent. And these voices will be accompanied by photographs that they took for us of their lives  of the things that they value and care about. These are pictures the girls themselves never saw  but they gave to us This is the stuff those reviewers don't know about and aren't listening to and this is the kind of research I recommend to those who want to do humanistic work. Girl    Yeah  my character is usually a tomboy. Hers is more into boys. Girl    Uh  yeah. Girl    We have    in the very beginning of the whole game  always we do this  we each have a piece of paper  we write down our name  our age    are we rich  very rich  not rich  poor  medium  wealthy  boyfriends  dogs  pets    what else    sisters  brothers  and all those. Girl    Divorced    parents divorced  maybe. Girl    This is my pretend  unclear  one. Girl    We make a school newspaper on the computer. Girl    For a girl's game also usually they'll have really pretty scenery with clouds and flowers. Girl    Like  if you were a girl and you were really adventurous and a real big tomboy  you would think that girls' games were kinda sissy. Girl    I run track  I played soccer  I play basketball  and I love a lot of things to do. And sometimes I feel like I can't really enjoy myself unless it's like a vacation  like when I get Mondays and all those days off. Girl    Well  sometimes there is a lot of stuff going on because I have music lessons and I'm on swim team    all this different stuff that I have to do  and sometimes it gets overwhelming. Girl    My friend Justine kinda took my friend Kelly  and now they're being mean to me. Girl     Well  sometimes it gets annoying when your brothers and sisters  or brother or sister  when they copy you and you get your idea first and they take your idea and they do it themselves. Girl     Because my older sister  she gets everything and  like  when I ask my mom for something  she'll say   No     all the time. But she gives my sister everything. Brenda Laurel  I want to show you  real quickly  just a minute of  Rockett's Tricky Decision   which went gold two days ago. Let's hope it's really stable. This is the second day in Rockett's life. The reason I'm showing you this is I'm hoping that the scene that I'm going to show you will look familiar and sound familiar  now that you've listened to some girls' voices. And you can see how we've tried to incorporate the issues that matter to them in the game that we've created. Miko  Hey Rockett  C'mere  Rockett  Hi Miko  What's going on  Miko  Did you hear about Nakilia's big Halloween party this weekend  She asked me to make sure you knew about it. Nakilia invited Reuben too  but    Rockett  But what  Isn't he coming  Miko  I don't think so. I mean  I heard his band is playing at another party the same night. Rockett  Really  What other party  Girl  Max's party is going to be so cool  Whitney. He's invited all the best people. BL  I'm going to fast forward to the decision point because I know I don't have a lot of time. After this awful event occurs  Rocket gets to decide how she feels about it. Rockett  Who'd want to show up at that party anyway  I could get invited to that party any day if I wanted to. Gee  I doubt I'll make Max's best people list. BL  OK  so we're going to emotionally navigate. If we were playing the game  that's what we'd do. If at any time during the game we want to learn more about the characters  we can go into this hidden hallway  and I'll quickly just show you the interface. We can  for example  go find Miko's locker and get some more information about her. Oops  I turned the wrong way. But you get the general idea of the product. I wanted to show you the ways  innocuous as they seem  in which we're incorporating what we've learned about girls    their desires to experience greater emotional flexibility  and to play around with the social complexity of their lives. I want to make the point that what we're giving girls  I think  through this effort  is a kind of validation  a sense of being seen. And a sense of the choices that are available in their lives. We love them. We see them. We're not trying to tell them who they ought to be. But we're really  really happy about who they are. It turns out they're really great. I want to close by showing you a videotape that's a version of a future game in the Rockett series that our graphic artists and design people put together  that we feel would please that four percent of reviewers.  Rockett      Rockett  It's like I'm just waking up  you know  BL  Thanks. I was walking in the market one day with my wife  and somebody stuck a cage in my face. And in between those slits were the saddest eyes I've ever seen. There was a very sick orangutan baby  my first encounter. That evening I came back to the market in the dark and I heard  uhh  uhh   and sure enough I found a dying orangutan baby on a garbage heap. Of course  the cage was salvaged. I took up the little baby  massaged her  forced her to drink until she finally started breathing normally. This is Uce. She's now living in the jungle of Sungai Wain  and this is Matahari  her second son  which  by the way  is also the son of the second orangutan I rescued  Dodoy. That changed my life quite dramatically  and as of today  I have almost       babies in my two centers. No. No. No. Wrong. It's horrible. It's a proof of our failing to save them in the wild. It's not good. This is merely proof of everyone failing to do the right thing. Having more than all the orangutans in all the zoos in the world together  just now like victims for every baby  six have disappeared from the forest. The deforestation  especially for oil palm  to provide biofuel for Western countries is what's causing these problems. And those are the peat swamp forests on    meters of peat  the largest accumulation of organic material in the world. When you open this for growing oil palms you're creating CO  volcanoes that are emitting so much CO  that my country is now the third largest emitter of greenhouse gasses in the world  after China and the United States. And we don't have any industry at all    it's only because of this deforestation. And these are horrible images. I'm not going to talk too long about it  but there are so many of the family of Uce  which are not so fortunate to live out there in the forest  that still have to go through that process. And I don't know anymore where to put them. So I decided that I had to come up with a solution for her but also a solution that will benefit the people that are trying to exploit those forests  to get their hands on the last timber and that are causing  in that way  the loss of habitat and all those victims. So I created the place Samboja Lestari  and the idea was  if I can do this on the worst possible place that I can think of where there is really nothing left  no one will have an excuse to say   Yeah  but ...  No. Everyone should be able to follow this. So we're in East Borneo. This is the place where I started. As you can see there's only yellow terrain. There's nothing left    just a bit of grass there. In      we had about    percent of the people jobless there. There was a huge amount of crime. People spent so much of their money on health issues and drinking water. There was no agricultural productivity left. This was the poorest district in the whole province and it was a total extinction of wildlife. This was like a biological desert. When I stood there in the grass  it's hot    not even the sound of insects    just this waving grass. Still  four years later we have created jobs for about       people. The climate has changed. I will show you  no more flooding  no more fires. It's no longer the poorest district  and there is a huge development of biodiversity. We've got over       species. We have     bird species as of today. We have    species of reptiles. So what happened here  We created a huge economic failure in this forest. So basically the whole process of destruction had gone a bit slower than what is happening now with the oil palm. But we saw the same thing. We had slash and burn agriculture  people cannot afford the fertilizer  so they burn the trees and have the minerals available there  the fires become more frequent  and after a while you're stuck with an area of land where there is no fertility left. There are no trees left. Still  in this place  in this grassland where you can see our very first office there on that hill  four years later  there is this one green blop on the Earth's surface ... And there are all these animals  and all these people happy  and there's this economic value. So how's this possible  It was quite simple. If you'll look at the steps  we bought the land  we dealt with the fire  and then only  we started doing the reforestation by combining agriculture with forestry. Only then we set up the infrastructure and management and the monetary. But we made sure that in every step of the way the local people were going to be fully involved so that no outside forces would be able to interfere with that. The people would become the defenders of that forest. So we do the  people  profit  planet  principles  but we do it in addition to a sure legal status    because if the forest belongs to the state  people say   It belongs to me  it belongs to everyone.  And then we apply all these other principles like transparency  professional management  measurable results  scalability   unclear   etc. What we did was we formulated recipes    how to go from a starting situation where you have nothing to a target situation. You formulate a recipe based upon the factors you can control  whether it be the skills or the fertilizer or the plant choice. And then you look at the outputs and you start measuring what comes out. Now in this recipe you also have the cost. You also know how much labor is needed. If you can drop this recipe on the map on a sandy soil  on a clay soil  on a steep slope  on flat soil  you put those different recipes  if you combine them  out of that comes a business plan  comes a work plan  and you can optimize it for the amount of labor you have available or for the amount of fertilizer you have  and you can do it. This is how it looks like in practice. We have this grass we want to get rid of. It exudes  unclear  like compounds from the roots. The acacia trees are of a very low value but we need them to restore the micro climate  to protect the soil and to shake out the grasses. And after eight years they might actually yield some timber    that is  if you can preserve it in the right way  which we can do with bamboo peels. It's an old temple building technique from Japan but bamboo is very fire susceptible. So if we would plant that in the beginning we would have a very high risk of losing everything again. So we plant it later  along the waterways to filter the water  provide the raw products just in time for when the timber becomes available. So the idea is  how to integrate these flows in space  over time and with the limited means you have. So we plant the trees  we plant these pineapples and beans and ginger in between  to reduce the competition for the trees  the crop fertilizer. Organic material is useful for the agricultural crops  for the people  but also helps the trees. The farmers have free land  the system yields early income  the orangutans get healthy food and we can speed up ecosystem regeneration while even saving some money. So beautiful. What a theory. But is it really that easy  Not really  because if you looked at what happened in       the fire started. This is an area of about    million hectares. January. February. March. April. May. We lost  .  million hectares in just a matter of a few months. This is because we have        of those underground fires that you also have in Pennsylvania here in the United States. And once the soil gets dried  you're in a dry season    you get cracks  oxygen goes in  flames come out and the problem starts all over again. So how to break that cycle  Fire is the biggest problem. This is what it looked like for three months. For three months  the automatic lights outside did not go off because it was that dark. We lost all the crops. No children gained weight for over a year  they lost    IQ points. It was a disaster for orangutans and people. So these fires are really the first things to work on. That was why I put it as a single point up there. And you need the local people for that because these grasslands  once they start burning ... It goes through it like a windstorm and you lose again the last bit of ash and nutrients to the first rainfall    going to the sea killing off the coral reefs there. So you have to do it with the local people. That is the short term solution but you also need a long term solution. So what we did is  we created a ring of sugar palms around the area. These sugar palms turn out to be fire resistant    also flood resistant  by the way    and they provide a lot of income for local people. This is what it looks like  the people have to tap them twice a day    just a millimeter slice    and the only thing you harvest is sugar water  carbon dioxide  rain fall and a little bit of sunshine. In principle  you make those trees into biological photovoltaic cells. And you can create so much energy from this    they produce three times more energy per hectare per year  because you can tap them on a daily basis. You don't need to harvest  unclear  or any other of the crops. So this is the combination where we have all this genetic potential in the tropics  which is still unexploited  and doing it in combination with technology. But also your legal side needs to be in very good order. So we bought that land  and here is where we started our project    in the middle of nowhere. And if you zoom in a bit you can see that all of this area is divided into strips that go over different types of soil  and we were actually monitoring  measuring every single tree in these       hectares        acres. And this forest is quite different. What I really did was I just followed nature  and nature doesn't know monocultures  but a natural forest is multilayered. That means that both in the ground and above the ground it can make better use of the available light  it can store more carbon in the system  it can provide more functions. But  it's more complicated. It's not that simple  and you have to work with the people. So  just like nature  we also grow fast planting trees and underneath that  we grow the slower growing  primary grain forest trees of a very high diversity that can optimally use that light. Then  what is just as important  get the right fungi in there that will grow into those leaves  bring back the nutrients to the roots of the trees that have just dropped that leaf within    hours. And they become like nutrient pumps. You need the bacteria to fix nitrogen  and without those microorganisms  you won't have any performance at all. And then we started planting    only       trees a day. We could have planted many  many more  but we didn't want to because we wanted to keep the number of jobs stable. We didn't want to lose the people that are going to work in that plantation. And we do a lot of work here. We use indicator plants to look at what soil types  or what vegetables will grow  or what trees will grow here. And we have monitored every single one of those trees from space. This is what it looks like in reality  you have this irregular ring around it  with strips of     meters wide  with sugar palms that can provide income for     families. It's only a small part of the area. The nursery  in here  is quite different. If you look at the number of tree species we have in Europe  for instance  from the Urals up to England  you know how many     . In this nursery  we're going to grow    times more than the number of species. Can you imagine  You do need to know what you are working with  but it's that diversity which makes it work. That you can go from this zero situation  by planting the vegetables and the trees  or directly  the trees in the lines in that grass there  putting up the buffer zone  producing your compost  and then making sure that at every stage of that up growing forest there are crops that can be used. In the beginning  maybe pineapples and beans and corn  in the second phase  there will be bananas and papayas  later on  there will be chocolate and chilies. And then slowly  the trees start taking over  bringing in produce from the fruits  from the timber  from the fuel wood. And finally  the sugar palm forest takes over and provides the people with permanent income. On the top left  underneath those green stripes  you see some white dots    those are actually individual pineapple plants that you can see from space. And in that area we started growing some acacia trees that you just saw before. So this is after one year. And this is after two years. And that's green. If you look from the tower    this is when we start attacking the grass. We plant in the seedlings mixed with the bananas  the papayas  all the crops for the local people  but the trees are growing up fast in between as well. And three years later      species of birds are living here. So we lowered air temperature three to five degrees Celsius. Air humidity is up    percent. Cloud cover    I'm going to show it to you    is up. Rainfall is up. And all these species and income. This ecolodge that I built here  three years before  was an empty  yellow field. This transponder that we operate with the European Space Agency    it gives us the benefit that every satellite that comes over to calibrate itself is taking a picture. Those pictures we use to analyze how much carbon  how the forest is developing  and we can monitor every tree using satellite images through our cooperation. We can use these data now to provide other regions with recipes and the same technology. We actually have it already with Google Earth. If you would use a little bit of your technology to put tracking devices in trucks  and use Google Earth in combination with that  you could directly tell what palm oil has been sustainably produced  which company is stealing the timber  and you could save so much more carbon than with any measure of saving energy here. So this is the Samboja Lestari area. You measure how the trees grow back  but you can also measure the biodiversity coming back. And biodiversity is an indicator of how much water can be balanced  how many medicines can be kept here. And finally I made it into the rain machine because this forest is now creating its own rain. This nearby city of Balikpapan has a big problem with water  it's    percent surrounded by seawater  and we have now a lot of intrusion there. Now we looked at the clouds above this forest  we looked at the reforestation area  the semi open area and the open area. And look at these images. I'll just run them very quickly through. In the tropics  raindrops are not formed from ice crystals  which is the case in the temperate zones  you need the trees with  unclear   chemicals that come out of the leaves of the trees that initiate the raindrops. So you create a cool place where clouds can accumulate  and you have the trees to initiate the rain. And look  there's now   .  percent more clouds    already  after three years. If you look at rainfall  it was already up    percent at that time. Let's look at the next year  and you can see that that trend is continuing. Where at first we had a small cap of higher rainfall  that cap is now widening and getting higher. And if we look at the rainfall pattern above Samboja Lestari  it used to be the driest place  but now you see consistently see a peak of rain forming there. So you can actually change the climate. When there are trade winds of course the effect disappears  but afterwards  as soon as the wind stabilizes  you see again that the rainfall peaks come back above this area. So to say it is hopeless is not the right thing to do  because we actually can make that difference if you integrate the various technologies. And it's nice to have the science  but it still depends mostly upon the people  on your education. We have our farmer schools. But the real success of course  is our band    because if a baby is born  we will play  so everyone's our family and you don't make trouble with your family. This is how it looks. We have this road going around the area  which brings the people electricity and water from our own area. We have the zone with the sugar palms  and then we have this fence with very thorny palms to keep the orangutans    that we provide with a place to live in the middle    and the people apart. And inside  we have this area for reforestation as a gene bank to keep all that material alive  because for the last    years not a single seedling of the tropical hardwood trees has grown up because the climatic triggers have disappeared. All the seeds get eaten. So now we do the monitoring on the inside    from towers  satellites  ultralights. Each of the families that have sold their land now get a piece of land back. And it has two nice fences of tropical hardwood trees    you have the shade trees planted in year one  then you underplanted with the sugar palms  and you plant this thorny fence. And after a few years  you can remove some of those shade trees. The people get that acacia timber which we have preserved with the bamboo peel  and they can build a house  they have some fuel wood to cook with. And they can start producing from the trees as many as they like. They have enough income for three families. But whatever you do in that program  it has to be fully supported by the people  meaning that you also have to adjust it to the local  cultural values. There is no simple one recipe for one place. You also have to make sure that it is very difficult to corrupt    that it's transparent. Like here  in Samboja Lestari  we divide that ring in groups of    families. If one member trespasses the agreement  and does cut down trees  the other    members have to decide what's going to happen to him. If the group doesn't take action  the other    groups have to decide what is going to happen to the group that doesn't comply with those great deals that we are offering them. In North Sulawesi it is the cooperative    they have a democratic culture there  so there you can use the local justice system to protect your system. In summary  if you look at it  in year one the people can sell their land to get income  but they get jobs back in the construction and the reforestation  the working with the orangutans  and they can use the waste wood to make handicraft. They also get free land in between the trees  where they can grow their crops. They can now sell part of those fruits to the orangutan project. They get building material for houses  a contract for selling the sugar  so we can produce huge amounts of ethanol and energy locally. They get all these other benefits  environmentally  money  they get education    it's a great deal. And everything is based upon that one thing    make sure that forest remains there. So if we want to help the orangutans    what I actually set out to do    we must make sure that the local people are the ones that benefit. Now I think the real key to doing it  to give a simple answer  is integration. I hope    if you want to know more  you can read more. Trees are wonderful arenas for discovery because of their tall stature  their complex structure  the biodiversity they foster and their quiet beauty. I used to climb trees for fun all the time and now  as a grown up  I have made my profession understanding trees and forests  through the medium of science. The most mysterious part of forests is the upper tree canopy. And Dr. Terry Erwin  in       called the canopy   the last biotic frontier.  I'd like to take you all on a journey up to the forest canopy  and share with you what canopy researchers are asking and also how they're communicating with other people outside of science. Let's start our journey on the forest floor of one of my study sites in Costa Rica. Because of the overhanging leaves and branches  you'll notice that the understory is very dark  it's very still. And what I'd like to do is take you up to the canopy  not by putting all of you into ropes and harnesses  but rather showing you a very short clip from a National Geographic film called  Heroes of the High Frontier.  This was filmed in Monteverde  Costa Rica and I think it gives us the best impression of what it's like to climb a giant strangler fig. So what you'll see up there is that it's really like the atmosphere of an open field  and there are tremendous numbers of plants and animals that have adapted to make their way and their life in the canopy. Common groups  like the sloth here  have clear adaptations for forest canopies  hanging on with their very strong claws. But I'd like to describe to you a more subtle kind of diversity and tell you about the ants. There are        species of ants that taxonomists    people who describe and name animals    have named.       of those ants live exclusively in the forest canopy. One of the reasons I tell you about ants is because of my husband  who is in fact an ant taxonomist and when we got married  he promised to name an ant after me  which he did    Procryptocerus nalini  a canopy ant. We've had two children  August Andrew and Erika and actually  he named ants after them. So we may be the only family that has an ant named after each one of us. But my passion    in addition to Jack and my children    are the plants  the so called epiphytes  those plants that grow up on trees. They don't have roots that go into trunks nor to the forest floor. But rather  it is their leaves that are adapted to intercept the dissolved nutrients that come to them in the form of mist and fog. These plants occur in great diversity  over        species around the world. They grow in tropical forests like this one and they also grow in temperate rainforests  that we find in Washington state. These epiphytes are mainly dominated by the mosses. One thing I want to point out is that underneath these live epiphytes  as they die and decompose  they actually construct an arboreal soil  both in the temperate zone and in the tropics. And these mosses  generated by decomposing  are like peat moss in your garden. They have a tremendous capacity for holding on to nutrients and water. One of the surprising things I discovered is that  if you pull back with me on those mats of epiphytes  what you'll find underneath them are connections  networks of what we call canopy roots. These are not epiphyte roots  these are roots that emerge from the trunk and branch of the host trees themselves. And so those epiphytes are actually paying the landlord a bit of rent in exchange for being supported high above the forest floor. I was interested  and my canopy researcher colleagues have been interested in the dynamics of the canopy plants that live in the forest. We've done stripping experiments where we've removed mats of epiphytes and looked at the rates of recolonization. We had predicted that they would grow back very quickly and that they would come in encroaching from the side. What we found  however  was that they took an extremely long time    over    years    to regenerate  starting from the bottom and growing up. And even now  after    years  they're not up there  they have not recolonized completely. And I use this little image to say this is what happens to mosses. If it's gone  it's gone  and if you're really lucky you might get something growing back from the bottom. So  recolonization is really very slow. These canopy communities are fragile. Well  when we look out  you and I  over that canopy of the intact primary forest  what we see is this enormous carpet of carbon. One of the challenges that canopy researchers are attacking today is trying to understand the amount of carbon that is being sequestered. We know it's a lot  but we do not yet know the answers to how much  and by what processes  carbon is being taken out of the atmosphere  held in its biomass  and moving on through the ecosystem. So I hope I've showed you that canopy dwellers are not just insignificant bits of green up high in the canopy that Tarzan and Jane were interested in  but rather that they foster biodiversity contribute to ecosystem nutrient cycles  and they also help to keep our global climate stable. Up in the canopy  if you were sitting next to me and you turned around from those primary forest ecosystems  you would also see scenes like this. Scenes of forest destruction  forest harvesting and forest fragmentation  thereby making that intact tapestry of the canopy unable to function in the marvelous ways that it has when it is not disturbed by humans. I've also looked out on urban places like this and thought about people who are disassociated from trees in their lives. People who grew up in a place like this did not have the opportunity to climb trees and form a relationship with trees and forests  as I did when I was a young girl. This troubles me. Here in       you know  it's not an easy thing to be a forest ecologist  gripping ourselves with these kinds of questions and trying to figure out how we can answer them. And especially  you know  as a small brown woman in a little college  in the upper northwest part of our country  far away from the areas of power and money  I really have to ask myself   What can I do about this  How can I reconnect people with trees   Well  I think that I can do something. I know that as a scientist  I have information and as a human being  I can communicate with anybody  inside or outside of academia. And so  that's what I've begin doing  and so I'd like to unveil the International Canopy Network here. We consult to the media about canopy questions  we have a canopy newsletter  we have an email LISTSERV. And so we're trying to disseminate information about the importance of the canopy  the beauty of the canopy  the necessity of intact canopies  to people outside of academia. We also recognize that a lot of the products that we make    those videos and so forth    you know  they don't reach everybody  and so we've been fostering projects that reach people outside of academia  and outside of the choir that most ecologists preach to. Treetop Barbie is a great example of that. What we do  my students in my lab and I  is we buy Barbies from Goodwill and Value Village  we dress her in clothes that have been made by seamstresses and we send her out with a canopy handbook. And my feeling is    Thank you.    that we've taken this pop icon and we have just tweaked her a little bit to become an ambassador who can carry the message that being a woman scientist studying treetops is actually a really great thing. We've also made partnerships with artists  with people who understand and can communicate the aesthetic beauty of trees and forest canopies. And I'd like to just tell you one of our projects  which is the generation of Canopy Confluences. What I do is I bring together scientists and artists of all kinds  and we spend a week in the forest on these little platforms  and we look at nature  we look at trees  we look at the canopy  and we communicate  and exchange  and express what we see together. The results have been fantastic. I'll just give you a few examples. This is a fantastic installation by Bruce Chao who is chair of the Sculpture and Glass Blowing Department at Rhode Island School of Design. He saw nests in the canopy at one of our Canopy Confluences in the Pacific Northwest  and created this beautiful sculpture. We've had dance people up in the canopy. Jodi Lomask  and her wonderful troupe Capacitor  joined me in the canopy in my rainforest site in Costa Rica. They made a fabulous dance called  Biome.  They danced in the forest  and we are taking this dance  my scientific outreach communications  and also linking up with environmental groups  to go to different cities and to perform the science  the dance and the environmental outreach that we hope will make a difference. We brought musicians to the canopy  and they made their music    and it's fantastic music. We had wooden flutists  we had oboists  we had opera singers  we had guitar players  and we had rap singers. And I brought a little segment to give you of Duke Brady's  Canopy Rap.  This experience of working with Duke also led me to initiate a program called Sound Science. I saw the power of Duke's song with urban youth    an audience  you know  I as a middle aged professor  I don't have a hope of getting to    in terms of convincing them of the importance of wildlands. So I engaged Caution  this rap singer  with a group of young people from inner city Tacoma. We went out to the forest  I would pick up a branch  Caution would rap on it  and suddenly that branch was really cool. And then the students would come into our sound studios  they would make their own rap songs with their own beats. They ended up making a CD which they took home to their family and friends  thereby expressing their own experiences with nature in their own medium. The final project I'll talk about is one that's very close to my heart  and it involves an economic and social value that is associated with epiphytic plants. In the Pacific Northwest  there's a whole industry of moss harvesting from old growth forests. These mosses are taken from the forest  they're used by the floriculture industry  by florists  to make arrangements and make hanging baskets. It's a     million dollar industry and it's increasing rapidly. If you remember that bald guy  you'll know that what has been stripped off of these trunks in the Pacific Northwest old growth forest is going to take decades and decades to come back. So this whole industry is unsustainable. What can I  as an ecologist  do about that  Well  my thought was that I could learn how to grow mosses  and that way we wouldn't have to take them out of the wild. And I thought  if I had some partners that could help me with this  that would be great. And so  I thought perhaps incarcerated men and women    who don't have access to nature  who often have a lot of time  they often have space  and you don't need any sharp tools to work with mosses    would be great partners. And they have become excellent partners. The best I can imagine. They were very enthusiastic. They were incredibly enthusiastic about the work. They learned how to distinguish different species of mosses  which  to tell you the truth  is a lot more than my undergraduate students at the Evergreen College can do. And they embraced the idea that they could help develop a research design in order to grow these mosses. We've been successful as partners in figuring out which species grow the fastest  and I've just been overwhelmed with how successful this has been. Because the prison wardens were very enthusiastic about this as well  I started a Science and Sustainability Seminar in the prisons. I brought my scientific colleagues and sustainability practitioners into the prison. We gave talks once a month  and that actually ended up implementing some amazing sustainability projects at the prisons    organic gardens  worm culture  recycling  water catchment and beekeeping.  Applause  Our latest endeavor  with a grant from the Department of Corrections at Washington state  they've asked us to expand this program to three more prisons. And our new project is having the inmates and ourselves learn how to raise the Oregon spotted frog which is a highly endangered amphibian in Washington state and Oregon. So they will raise them    in captivity  of course    from eggs to tadpoles and onward to frogs. And they will have the pleasure  many of them  of seeing those frogs that they've raised from eggs and helped develop  helped nurture  move out into protected wildlands to augment the number of endangered species out there in the wild. And so  I think for many reasons    ecological  social  economic and perhaps even spiritual    this has been a tremendous project and I'm really looking forward to not only myself and my students doing it  but also to promote and teach other scientists how to do this. As many of you are aware  the world of academia is a rather inward looking one. I'm trying to help researchers move more outward to have their own partnerships with people outside of the academic community. And so I'm hoping that my husband Jack  the ant taxonomist  can perhaps work with Mattel to make Taxonomist Ken. Perhaps Ben Zander and Bill Gates could get together and make an opera about AIDS. Or perhaps Al Gore and Naturally   could make a song about climate change that would really make you clap your hands. So  although it's a little bit of a fantasy  I think it's also a reality. Given the duress that we're feeling environmentally in these times  it is time for scientists to reach outward  and time for those outside of science to reach towards academia as well. I started my career with trying to understand the mysteries of forests with the tools of science. By making these partnerships that I described to you  I have really opened my mind and  I have to say  my heart to have a greater understanding  to make other discoveries about nature and myself. When I look into my heart  I see trees    this is actually an image of a real heart    there are trees in our hearts  there are trees in your hearts. When we come to understand nature  we are touching the most deep  the most important parts of our self. In these partnerships  I have also learned that people tend to compartmentalize themselves into IT people  and movie star people  and scientists  but when we share nature  when we share our perspectives about nature  we find a common denominator. Finally  as a scientist and as a person and now  as part of the TED community  I feel that I have better tools to go out to trees  to go out to forests  to go out to nature  to make new discoveries about nature    and about humans' place in nature wherever we are and whomever you are. Thank you very much. The  Dirty Jobs  crew and I were called to a little town in Colorado  called Craig. It's only a couple dozen square miles. It's in the Rockies. And the job in question was sheep rancher. My role on the show  for those of you who haven't seen it    it's pretty simple. I'm an apprentice  and I work with the people who actually do the jobs in question. And my responsibilities are to simply try and keep up and give an honest account of what it's like to be these people  for one day in their life. The job in question  herding sheep. Great. We go to Craig and we check in to a hotel and I realize the next day that castration is going to be an absolute part of this work. So  normally  I never do any research at all. But  this is a touchy subject  and I work for the Discovery Channel  and we want to portray accurately whatever it is we do  and we certainly want to do it with a lot of respect for the animals. So I called the Humane Society and I say   Look  I'm going to be castrating some lambs  Can you tell me the deal   And they're like   Yeah  it's pretty straightforward.  They use a band    basically a rubber band  like this  only a little smaller. This one was actually around the playing cards I got yesterday  but it had a certain familiarity to it. And I said   Well  what exactly is the process   And they said   The band is applied to the tail  tightly. And then another band is applied to the scrotum  tightly. Blood flow is slowly retarded  a week later the parts in question fall off.  Great    got it.  OK  I call the SPCA to confirm this    they confirm it. I also call PETA  just for fun  and they don't like it    but they confirm it. OK  that's basically how you do it. So the next day I go out. And I'm given a horse and we go get the lambs and we take them to a pen that we built  and we go about the business of animal husbandry. Melanie is the wife of Albert. Albert is the shepherd in question. Melanie picks up the lamb    two hands    one hand on both legs on the right  likewise on the left. Lamb goes on the post  she opens it up. Alright. Great. Albert goes in  I follow Albert  the crew is around. I always watch the process done the first time before I try it. Being an apprentice  you know  you do that. Albert reaches in his pocket to pull out  you know  this black rubber band but what comes out instead is a knife. And I'm like that's not rubber at all  you know. And he kind of flicked it open in a way that caught the sun that was just coming over the Rockies  it was very    it was  it was impressive. In the space of about two seconds  Albert had the knife between the cartilage of the tail  right next to the butt of the lamb  and very quickly the tail was gone and in the bucket that I was holding. A second later  with a big thumb and a well calloused forefinger  he had the scrotum firmly in his grasp. And he pulled it toward him  like so  and he took the knife and he put it on the tip. Now you think you know what's coming  Michael    you don't  OK  He snips it  throws the tip over his shoulder  and then grabs the scrotum and pushes it upward  and then his head dips down  obscuring my view  but what I hear is a slurping sound  and a noise that sounds like Velcro being yanked off a sticky wall and I am not even kidding. Can we roll the video  No I'm kidding    we don't    I thought it best to talk in pictures. So  I do something now I've never ever done on a  Dirty Jobs  shoot  ever. I say   Time out. Stop.  You guys know the show  we use take one  we don't do take two. There's no writing  there's no scripting  there's no nonsense. We don't fool around  we don't rehearse    we shoot what we get  I said   Stop. This is nuts.  I mean  you know.  This is crazy. We can't do this.  And Albert's like   What   And I'm like   I don't know what just happened  but there are testicles in this bucket and that's not how we do it.  And he said  Well  that's how we do it.  And I said   Why would you do it this way   And before I even let him explain  I said   I want to do it the right way  with the rubber bands.  And he says   Like the Humane Society   And I said   Yes  like the Humane Society. Let's do something that doesn't make the lamb squeal and bleed    we're on in five continents  dude. We're on twice a day on the Discovery Channel    we can't do this.  He says   OK.  He goes to his box and he pulls out a bag of these little rubber bands. Melanie picks up another lamb  puts it on the post  band goes on the tail  band goes on the scrotum. Lamb goes on the ground  lamb takes two steps  falls down  gets up  shakes a little  takes another couple steps  falls down. I'm like  this is not a good sign for this lamb  at all. Gets up  walks to the corner  it's quivering  and it lies down and it's in obvious distress. And I'm looking at the lamb and I say   Albert  how long  When does he get up   He's like   A day.  I said   A day  How long does it take them to fall off    A week.  Meanwhile  the lamb that he had just did his little procedure on is  you know  he's just prancing around  bleeding stopped. He's  you know  nibbling on some grass  frolicking. And I was just so blown away at how wrong I was  in that second. And I was reminded how utterly wrong I am  so much of the time. And I was especially reminded of what an ridiculously short straw I had that day because now I had to do what Albert had just done  and there are like     of these lambs in the pen  and suddenly this whole thing's starting to feel like a German porno  and I'm like ...  Laughter  Melanie picks up the lamb  puts it on the post  opens it up. Albert hands me the knife. I go in  tail comes off. I go in  I grab the scrotum  tip comes off. Albert instructs   Push it way up there.  I do.  Push it further.  I do. The testicles emerge    they look like thumbs  coming right at you    and he says   Bite 'em. Just bite 'em off.  And I heard him  I heard all the words. Like  how did    how did I get here  How did    you know    I mean    how did I get here  It's just    it's one of those moments where the brain goes off on it's own  and suddenly  I'm standing there  in the Rockies  and all I can think of is the Aristotelian definition of a tragedy. You know  Aristotle says a tragedy is that moment when the hero comes face to face with his true identity. And I'm like   What is this jacked up metaphor  I don't like what I'm thinking right now.  And I can't get this thought out of my head  and I can't get that vision out of my sight  so I did what I had to do. I went in and I took them. I took them like this  and I yanked my face back. And I'm standing there with two testicles on my chin. And now I can't get    I can't shake the metaphor. OK  I'm still in  Poetics   in Aristotle  and I'm thinking    out of nowhere  two terms come crashing into my head that I haven't heard since my classics professor in college drilled them there. And they are anagnorisis and peripeteia. Anagnorisis and peripeteia. Anagnorisis is the Greek word for discovery. Literally  the transition from ignorance to knowledge is anagnorisis. It's what our network does  it's what  Dirty Jobs  is. And I'm up to my neck in anagnorises every single day. Great. The other word  peripeteia  that's the moment in the great tragedies  you know    Euripides and Sophocles    the moment where Oedipus has his moment  where he suddenly realizes that hot chick he's been sleeping with and having babies with is his mother. OK. That's peripety or peripeteia. And this metaphor in my head    I got anagnorisis and peripetia on my chin. I got to tell you  it's such a great device though. When you start to look for peripetia  you find it everywhere. I mean  Bruce Willis in  The Sixth Sense   right  Spends the whole movie trying to help the little kid who sees dead people  and then  boom     Oh  I'm dead     peripetia. You know  It's crushing when the audience sees it the right way. Neo in  The Matrix   you know   Oh  I'm living in a computer program     that's weird. These discoveries that lead to sudden realizations  and I've been having them  over     dirty jobs  I have them all the time  but that one    that one drilled something home in a way that I just wasn't prepared for. And  as I stood there  looking at the happy lamb that I had just defiled    but it looked OK. Looking at that poor other little thing that I'd done it the right way on  and I just was struck by if I'm wrong about that and if I'm wrong so often  in a literal way  what other peripatetic misconceptions might I be able to comment upon  Because  look  I'm not a social anthropologist but I have a friend who is. And I talk to him. And he says   Hey Mike. Look  I don't know if your brain is interested in this sort of thing or not  but do you realize you've shot in every state  You've worked in mining  you've worked in fishing  you've worked in steel  you've worked in every major industry. You've had your back shoulder to shoulder with these guys that our politicians are desperate to relate to every four years  right   I can still see Hillary doing the shots of rye  dribbling down her chin  with the steel workers. I mean  these are the people that I work with every single day.  And if you have something to say about their thoughts  collectively  it might be time to think about it. Because  dude  you know  four years.  You know  that's in my head  testicles are on my chin  thoughts are bouncing around. And  after that shoot  Dirty Jobs really didn't change  in terms of what the show is  but it changed for me  personally. And now  when I talk about the show  I no longer just tell the story you heard and     like it. I do  but I also start to talk about some of the other things I got wrong  some of the other notions of work that I've just been assuming are sacrosanct  and they're not. People with dirty jobs are happier than you think. As a group  they're the happiest people I know. And I don't want to start whistling  Look for the Union Label   and all that happy worker crap. I'm just telling you that these are balanced people who do unthinkable work. Roadkill picker uppers whistle while they work. I swear to God    I did it with them. They've got this amazing sort of symmetry to their life. And I see it over and over and over again. So I started to wonder what would happen if we challenged some of these sacred cows. Follow your passion    we've been talking about it here for the last    hours. Follow your passion    what could possibly be wrong with that  Probably the worst advice I ever got. You know  follow your dreams and go broke  right  I mean  that's all I heard growing up. I didn't know what to do with my life  but I was told if you follow your passion  it's going to work out. I can give you    examples  right now    Bob Combs  the pig farmer in Las Vegas who collects the uneaten scraps of food from the casinos and feeds them them to his swine. Why  Because there's so much protein in the stuff we don't eat his pigs grow at twice the normal speed  and he is one rich pig farmer  and he is good for the environment  and he spends his days doing this incredible service  and he smells like hell  but God bless him. He's making a great living. You ask him   Did you follow your passion here   and he'd laugh at you. The guy's worth    he just got offered like    million dollars for his farm and turned it down  outside of Vegas. He didn't follow his passion. He stepped back and he watched where everybody was going and he went the other way. And I hear that story over and over. Matt Froind  a dairy farmer in New Canaan  Connecticut  who woke up one day and realized the crap from his cows was worth more than their milk  if he could use it to make these biodegradable flower pots. Now  he's selling them to Walmart. Follow his passion  The guy's    come on. So I started to look at passion  I started to look at efficiency versus effectiveness    as Tim talked about earlier  that's a huge distinction. I started to look at teamwork and determination  and basically all those platitudes they call  successories  that hang with that schmaltzy art in boardrooms around the world right now. That stuff    it's suddenly all been turned on its head. Safety    safety first  Going back to  you know  OSHA and PETA and the Humane Society  what if OSHA got it wrong  I mean    this is heresy  what I'm about to say    but what if it's really safety third  Right  No  I mean really. What I mean to say is I value my safety on these crazy jobs as much as the people that I'm working with  but the ones who really get it done  they're not out there talking about safety first. They know that other things come first    the business of doing the work comes first  the business of getting it done. And I'll never forget  up in the Bering Sea  I was on a crab boat with the  Deadliest Catch  guys    which I also work on    in the first season. We're about     miles off the coast of Russia     foot seas  big waves  green water coming over the wheelhouse  right  Most hazardous environment I'd ever seen  and I was back with a guy  lashing the pots down. So  I'm    feet off the deck  which is like looking down at the top of your shoe  you know  and it's doing this in the ocean. Unspeakably dangerous. I scamper down  I go into the wheelhouse and I say  with some level of incredulity   Captain  OSHA.  And he says   OSHA  Ocean.  And he points out there. But in that moment  what he said next can't be repeated in the lower   . It can't be repeated on any factory floor or any construction site. But he looked at me  and he said   Son     he's my age  by the way  he calls me son  I love that    he says   Son  I'm a captain of a crab boat. My responsibility is not to get you home alive. My responsibility is to get you home rich.  You want to get home alive  that's on you. And for the rest of that day  safety first. I was like    So  the idea that we create this false    this sense of complacency when all we do is talk about somebody else's responsibility as though it's our own  and vice versa. Anyhow  a whole lot of things. I could talk at length about the many little distinctions we made and the endless list of ways that I got it wrong. But  what it all comes down to is this. I formed a theory  and I'm going to share it now in my remaining two minutes and    seconds. It goes like this    we've declared war on work  as a society  all of us. It's a civil war. It's a cold war  really. We didn't set out to do it and we didn't twist our mustache in some Machiavellian way  but we've done it. And we've waged this war on at least four fronts  certainly in Hollywood. The way we portray working people on TV    it's laughable. If there's a plumber  he's     pounds and he's got a giant butt crack. Admit it. You see him all the time. That's what plumbers look like  right  We turn them into heroes  or we turn them into punch lines. That's what TV does. We try hard on  Dirty Jobs  not to do that  which is why I do the work and I don't cheat. But  we've waged this war on Madison Avenue. I mean  so many of the commercials that come out there    in the way of a message  what's really being said  Your life would be better if you could work a little less  if you didn't have to work so hard  if you could get home a little earlier  if you could retire a little faster  if you could punch out a little sooner    it's all in there  over and over  again and again. Washington  I can't even begin to talk about the deals and policies in place that affect the bottom line reality of the available jobs because I don't really know. I just know that that's a front in this war. And right here guys  Silicon Valley  I mean    how many people have an iPhone on them right now  How many people have their Blackberries  We're plugged in  we're connected. I would never suggest for a second that something bad has come out of the tech revolution. Good grief  not to this crowd. But I would suggest that innovation without imitation is a complete waste of time. And nobody celebrates imitation the way  Dirty Jobs  guys know it has to be done. Your iPhone without those people making the same interface  the same circuitry  the same board  over and over  All of that  That's what makes it equally as possible as the genius that goes inside of it. So  we've got this new toolbox  you know. Our tools today don't look like shovels and picks. They look like the stuff we walk around with. And so the collective effect of all of that has been this marginalization of lots and lots of jobs. And I realized  probably too late in this game    I hope not  because I don't know if I can do     more of these things    but we're going to do as many as we can. And to me the most important thing to know and to really come face to face with  is that fact that I got it wrong about a lot of things  not just the testicles on my chin. I got a lot wrong. So  we're thinking    by we  I mean me    that the thing to do is to talk about a PR campaign for work  manual labor  skilled labor. Somebody needs to be out there talking about the forgotten benefits. I'm talking about grandfather stuff  the stuff a lot us probably grew up with but we've kind of    you know  kind of lost a little. Barack wants to create two and a half million jobs. The infrastructure is a huge deal. This war on work  that I suppose exists  has casualties like any other war. The infrastructure's the first one  declining trade school enrollments are the second one. Every single year  fewer electricians  fewer carpenters  fewer plumbers  fewer welders  fewer pipefitters  fewer steamfitters. The infrastructure jobs that everybody is talking about creating are those guys    the ones that have been in decline  over and over. Meanwhile  we've got two trillion dollars    at a minimum  according to the American Society of Civil Engineers    that we need to expend to even make a dent in the infrastructure  which is currently rated at a D minus. So  if I were running for anything  and I'm not  I would simply say that the jobs we hope to make and the jobs we hope to create aren't going to stick unless they're jobs that people want. And I know the point of this conference is to celebrate things that are near and dear to us  but I also know that clean and dirty aren't opposites. They're two sides of the same coin  just like innovation and imitation  like risk and responsibility  like peripetia and anagnorisis  like that poor little lamb  who I hope isn't quivering anymore  and like my time that's gone. It's been great talking to you and get back to work  will you  The new me is beauty. Yeah  people used to say   Norman's OK  but if you followed what he said  everything would be usable but it would be ugly.  Well  I didn't have that in mind  so ... This is neat. Thank you for setting up my display. I mean  it's just wonderful. And I haven't the slightest idea of what it does or what it's good for  but I want it. And that's my new life. My new life is trying to understand what beauty is about  and  pretty   and  emotions.  The new me is all about making things kind of neat and fun. And so this is a Philippe Starck juicer  produced by Alessi. It's just neat  it's fun. It's so much fun I have it in my house    but I have it in the entryway  I don't use it to make juice. In fact  I bought the gold plated special edition and it comes with a little slip of paper that says   Don't use this juicer to make juice.  The acid will ruin the gold plating. So actually  I took a carton of orange juice and I poured it in the glass to take this picture. Beneath it is a wonderful knife. It's a Global cutting knife made in Japan. First of all  look at the shape    it's just wonderful to look at. Second of all  it's really beautifully balanced  it holds well  it feels well. And third of all  it's so sharp  it just cuts. It's a delight to use. And so it's got everything  right  It's beautiful and it's functional. And I can tell you stories about it  which makes it reflective  and so you'll see I have a theory of emotion. And those are the three components. Hiroshi Ishii and his group at the MIT Media Lab took a ping pong table and placed a projector above it  and on the ping pong table they projected an image of water with fish swimming in it. And as you play ping pong  whenever the ball hits part of the table  the ripples spread out and the fish run away. But of course  then the ball hits the other side  the ripples hit the    poor fish  they can't find any peace and quiet. Is that a good way to play ping pong  No. But is it fun  Yeah  Yeah. Or look at Google. If you type in  oh say   emotion and design   you get    pages of results. So Google just took their logo and they spread it out. Instead of saying   You got        results. This is one through   . Next   they just give you as many o's as there are pages. It's really simple and subtle. I bet a lot of you have seen it and never noticed it. That's the subconscious mind that sort of notices it    it probably is kind of pleasant and you didn't know why. And it's just clever. And of course  what's especially good is  if you type  design and emotion   the first response out of those    pages is my website. Now  the weird thing is Google lies  because if I type  design and emotion   it says   You don't need the 'and.' We do it anyway.  So  OK. So I type  design emotion  and my website wasn't first again. It was third. Oh well  different story. There was this wonderful review in The New York Times about the MINI Cooper automobile. It said   You know  this is a car that has lots of faults. Buy it anyway. It's so much fun to drive.  And if you look at the inside of the car    I mean  I loved it  I wanted to see it  I rented it  this is me taking a picture while my son is driving    and the inside of the car  the whole design is fun. It's round  it's neat. The controls work wonderfully. So that's my new life  it's all about fun. I really have the feeling that pleasant things work better  and that never made any sense to me until I finally figured out    look ... I'm going to put a plank on the ground. So  imagine I have a plank about two feet wide and    feet long and I'm going to walk on it  and you see I can walk on it without looking  I can go back and forth and I can jump up and down. No problem. Now I'm going to put the plank     feet in the air    and I'm not going to go near it  thank you. Intense fear paralyzes you. It actually affects the way the brain works. So  Paul Saffo  before his talk said that he didn't really have it down until just a few days or hours before the talk  and that anxiety was really helpful in causing him to focus. That's what fear and anxiety does  it causes you to be    what's called depth first processing    to focus  not be distracted. And I couldn't force myself across that. Now some people can    circus workers  steel workers. But it really changes the way you think. And then  a psychologist  Alice Isen  did this wonderful experiment. She brought students in to solve problems. So  she'd bring people into the room  and there'd be a string hanging down here and a string hanging down here. It was an empty room  except for a table with a bunch of crap on it    some papers and scissors and stuff. And she'd bring them in  and she'd say   This is an IQ test and it determines how well you do in life. Would you tie those two strings together   So they'd take one string and they'd pull it over here and they couldn't reach the other string. Still can't reach it. And  basically  none of them could solve it. You bring in a second group of people  and you say   Oh  before we start  I got this box of candy  and I don't eat candy. Would you like the box of candy   And turns out they liked it  and it made them happy    not very happy  but a little bit of happy. And guess what    they solved the problem. And it turns out that when you're anxious you squirt neural transmitters in the brain  which focuses you makes you depth first. And when you're happy    what we call positive valence    you squirt dopamine into the prefrontal lobes  which makes you a breadth first problem solver  you're more susceptible to interruption  you do out of the box thinking. That's what brainstorming is about  right  With brainstorming we make you happy  we play games  and we say   No criticism   and you get all these weird  neat ideas. But in fact  if that's how you always were you'd never get any work done because you'd be working along and say   Oh  I got a new way of doing it.  So to get work done  you've got to set a deadline  right  You've got be anxious. The brain works differently if you're happy. Things work better because you're more creative. You get a little problem  you say   Ah  I'll figure it out.  No big deal. There's something I call the visceral level of processing  and there will be visceral level design. Biology    we have co adapted through biology to like bright colors. That's especially good that mammals and primates like fruits and bright plants  because you eat the fruit and you thereby spread the seed. There's an amazing amount of stuff that's built into the brain. We dislike bitter tastes  we dislike loud sounds  we dislike hot temperatures  cold temperatures. We dislike scolding voices. We dislike frowning faces  we like symmetrical faces  etc.  etc. So that's the visceral level. In design  you can express visceral in lots of ways  like the choice of type fonts and the red for hot  exciting. Or the      Jaguar  It's actually a crummy car  falls apart all the time  but the owners love it. And it's beautiful    it's in the Museum of Modern Art. A water bottle  You buy it because of the bottle  not because of the water. And when people are finished  they don't throw it away. They keep it for    you know  it's like the old wine bottles  you keep it for decoration or maybe fill it with water again  which proves it's not the water. It's all about the visceral experience. The middle level of processing is the behavioral level and that's actually where most of our stuff gets done. Visceral is subconscious  you're unaware of it. Behavioral is subconscious  you're unaware of it. Almost everything we do is subconscious. I'm walking around the stage    I'm not attending to the control of my legs. I'm doing a lot  most of my talk is subconscious  it has been rehearsed and thought about a lot. Most of what we do is subconscious. Automatic behavior    skilled behavior    is subconscious  controlled by the behavioral side. And behavioral design is all about feeling in control  which includes usability  understanding    but also the feel and heft. That's why the Global knives are so neat. They're so nicely balanced  so sharp  that you really feel you're in control of the cutting. Or  just driving a high performance sports car over a demanding curb    again  feeling that you are in complete control of the environment. Or the sensual feeling. This is a Kohler shower  a waterfall shower  and actually  all those knobs beneath are also showerheads. It will squirt you all around and you can stay in that shower for hours    and not waste water  by the way  because it recirculates the same dirty water. Or this    this is a really neat teapot I found at high tea at The Four Seasons Hotel in Chicago. It's a Ronnefeldt tilting teapot. That's kind of what the teapot looks like but the way you use it is you lay it on its back  and you put tea in  and then you fill it with water. The water then seeps over the tea. And the tea is sitting in this stuff to the right    the tea is to the right of this line. There's a little ledge inside  so the tea is sitting there and the water is filling it up like that. And when the tea is ready  or almost ready  you tilt it. And that means the tea is partially covered while it completes the brewing. And when it's finished  you put it vertically  and now the tea is    you remember    above this line and the water only comes to here    and so it keeps the tea out. On top of that  it communicates  which is what emotion does. Emotion is all about acting  emotion is really about acting. It's being safe in the world. Cognition is about understanding the world  emotion is about interpreting it    saying good  bad  safe  dangerous  and getting us ready to act  which is why the muscles tense or relax. And that's why we can tell the emotion of somebody else    because their muscles are acting  subconsciously  except that we've evolved to make the facial muscles really rich with emotion. Well  this has emotions if you like  because it signals the waiter that   Hey  I'm finished. See    upright.  And the waiter can come by and say   Would you like more water   It's kind of neat. What a wonderful design. And the third level is reflective  which is  if you like the superego  it's a little part of the brain that has no control over what you do  no control over the    doesn't see the senses  doesn't control the muscles. It looks over what's going on. It's that little voice in your head that's watching and saying   That's good. That's bad.  Or   Why are you doing that  I don't understand.  It's that little voice in your head that's the seat of consciousness. Here's a great reflective product. Owners of the Hummer have said   You know I've owned many cars in my life    all sorts of exotic cars  but never have I had a car that attracted so much attention.  It's about attention. It's about their image  not about the car. If you want a more positive model    this is the GM car. And the reason you might buy it now is because you care about the environment. And you'll buy it to protect the environment  even though the first few cars are going to be really expensive and not perfected. But that's reflective design as well. Or an expensive watch  so you can impress people     Oh gee  I didn't know you had that watch.  As opposed to this one  which is a pure behavioral watch  which probably keeps better time than the         watch I just showed you. But it's ugly. This is a clear Don Norman watch. And what's neat is sometimes you pit one emotion against the other  the visceral fear of falling against the reflective state saying   It's OK. It's OK. It's safe. It's safe.  If that amusement park were rusty and falling apart  you'd never go on the ride. So  it's pitting one against the other. The other neat thing ... So Jake Cress is this furniture maker  and he makes this unbelievable set of furniture. And this is his chair with claw  and the poor little chair has lost its ball and it's trying to get it back before anybody notices. And what's so neat about it is how you accept that story. And that's what's nice about emotion. So that's the new me. I'm only saying positive things from now on. I've been intrigued by this question of whether we could evolve or develop a sixth sense    a sense that would give us seamless access and easy access to meta information or information that may exist somewhere that may be relevant to help us make the right decision about whatever it is that we're coming across. And some of you may argue   Well  don't today's cell phones do that already   But I would say no. When you meet someone here at TED    and this is the top networking place  of course  of the year    you don't shake somebody's hand and then say   Can you hold on for a moment while I take out my phone and Google you   Or when you go to the supermarket and you're standing there in that huge aisle of different types of toilet papers  you don't take out your cell phone  and open a browser  and go to a website to try to decide which of these different toilet papers is the most ecologically responsible purchase to make. So we don't really have easy access to all this relevant information that can just help us make optimal decisions about what to do next and what actions to take. And so my research group at the Media Lab has been developing a series of inventions to give us access to this information in a sort of easy way  without requiring that the user changes any of their behavior. And I'm here to unveil our latest effort  and most successful effort so far  which is still very much a work in process. I'm actually wearing the device right now and we've sort of cobbled it together with components that are off the shelf    and that  by the way  only cost     dollars at this point in time. I'm wearing a camera  just a simple web cam  a portable  battery powered projection system with a little mirror. These components communicate to my cell phone in my pocket which acts as the communication and computation device. And in the video here we see my student Pranav Mistry  who's really the genius who's been implementing and designing this whole system. And we see how this system lets him walk up to any surface and start using his hands to interact with the information that is projected in front of him. The system tracks the four significant fingers. In this case  he's wearing simple marker caps that you may recognize. But if you want a more stylish version  you could also paint your nails in different colors. And the camera basically tracks these four fingers and recognizes any gestures that he's making so he can just go to  for example  a map of Long Beach  zoom in and out  etc. The system also recognizes iconic gestures such as the  take a picture  gesture  and then takes a picture of whatever is in front of you. And when he then walks back to the Media Lab  he can just go up to any wall and project all the pictures that he's taken  sort through them and organize them  and re size them  etc.  again using all natural gestures. So  some of you most likely were here two years ago and saw the demo by Jeff Han  or some of you may think   Well  doesn't this look like the Microsoft Surface Table   And yes  you also interact using natural gestures  both hands  etc. But the difference here is that you can use any surface  you can walk up to any surface  including your hand  if nothing else is available  and interact with this projected data. The device is completely portable  and can be    So  one important difference is that it's totally mobile. Another even more important difference is that in mass production  this would not cost more tomorrow than today's cell phones and would actually not sort of be a bigger packaging    could look a lot more stylish than this version that I'm wearing around my neck. But other than letting some of you live out your fantasy of looking as cool as Tom Cruise in  Minority Report   the reason why we're really excited about this device is that it really can act as one of these sixth sense devices that gives you relevant information about whatever is in front of you. So we see Pranav here going into the supermarket and he's shopping for some paper towels. And  as he picks up a product  the system can recognize the product that he's picking up  using either image recognition or marker technology  and give him the green light or an orange light. He can ask for additional information. So this particular choice here is a particularly good choice  given his personal criteria. Some of you may want the toilet paper with the most bleach in it rather than the most ecologically responsible choice. If he picks up a book in the bookstore  he can get an Amazon rating    it gets projected right on the cover of the book. This is Juan's book  our previous speaker  which gets a great rating  by the way  at Amazon. And so  Pranav turns the page of the book and can then see additional information about the book    reader comments  maybe sort of information by his favorite critic  etc. If he turns to a particular page  he finds an annotation by maybe an expert or a friend of ours that gives him a little bit of additional information about whatever is on that particular page. Reading the newspaper    it never has to be outdated. You can get video annotations of the events that you're reading about. You can get the latest sports scores  etc. This is a more controversial one. As you interact with someone at TED  maybe you can see a word cloud of the tags  the words that are associated with that person in their blog and personal web pages. In this case  the student is interested in cameras  etc. On your way to the airport  if you pick up your boarding pass  it can tell you that your flight is delayed  that the gate has changed  etc. And  if you need to know what the current time is  it's as simple as drawing a watch    on your arm. So that's where we're at so far in developing this sixth sense that would give us seamless access to all this relevant information about the things that we may come across. My student Pranav  who's really  like I said  the genius behind this. He does deserve a lot of applause  because I don't think he's slept much in the last three months  actually. And his girlfriend is probably not very happy about him either. But it's not perfect yet  it's very much a work in progress. And who knows  maybe in another    years we'll be here with the ultimate sixth sense brain implant. Thank you. I was speaking to a group of about     kids  ages six to eight  at a children's museum  and I brought with me a bag full of legs  similar to the kinds of things you see up here  and had them laid out on a table for the kids. And  from my experience  you know  kids are naturally curious about what they don't know  or don't understand  or is foreign to them. They only learn to be frightened of those differences when an adult influences them to behave that way  and maybe censors that natural curiosity  or you know  reins in the question asking in the hopes of them being polite little kids. So I just pictured a first grade teacher out in the lobby with these unruly kids  saying   Now  whatever you do  don't stare at her legs.  But  of course  that's the point. That's why I was there  I wanted to invite them to look and explore. So I made a deal with the adults that the kids could come in without any adults for two minutes on their own. The doors open  the kids descend on this table of legs  and they are poking and prodding  and they're wiggling toes  and they're trying to put their full weight on the sprinting leg to see what happens with that. And I said   Kids  really quickly    I woke up this morning  I decided I wanted to be able to jump over a house    nothing too big  two or three stories    but  if you could think of any animal  any superhero  any cartoon character  anything you can dream up right now  what kind of legs would you build me   And immediately a voice shouted   Kangaroo    No  no  no  Should be a frog    No. It should be Go Go Gadget    No  no  no  It should be the Incredibles.  And other things that I don't    aren't familiar with. And then  one eight year old said   Hey  why wouldn't you want to fly too   And the whole room  including me  was like   Yeah.  And just like that  I went from being a woman that these kids would have been trained to see as  disabled  to somebody that had potential that their bodies didn't have yet. Somebody that might even be super abled. Interesting. So some of you actually saw me at TED     years ago. And there's been a lot of talk about how life changing this conference is for both speakers and attendees  and I am no exception. TED literally was the launch pad to the next decade of my life's exploration. At the time  the legs I presented were groundbreaking in prosthetics. I had woven carbon fiber sprinting legs modeled after the hind leg of a cheetah  which you may have seen on stage yesterday. And also these very life like  intrinsically painted silicone legs. So at the time  it was my opportunity to put a call out to innovators outside the traditional medical prosthetic community to come bring their talent to the science and to the art of building legs. So that we can stop compartmentalizing form  function and aesthetic  and assigning them different values. Well  lucky for me  a lot of people answered that call. And the journey started  funny enough  with a TED conference attendee    Chee Pearlman  who hopefully is in the audience somewhere today. She was the editor then of a magazine called ID  and she gave me a cover story. This started an incredible journey. Curious encounters were happening to me at the time  I'd been accepting numerous invitations to speak on the design of the cheetah legs around the world. And people would come up to me after the conference  after my talk  men and women. And the conversation would go something like this   You know Aimee  you're very attractive. You don't look disabled.  I thought   Well  that's amazing  because I don't feel disabled.  And it really opened my eyes to this conversation that could be explored  about beauty. What does a beautiful woman have to look like  What is a sexy body  And interestingly  from an identity standpoint  what does it mean to have a disability  I mean  people    Pamela Anderson has more prosthetic in her body than I do. Nobody calls her disabled. So this magazine  through the hands of graphic designer Peter Saville  went to fashion designer Alexander McQueen  and photographer Nick Knight  who were also interested in exploring that conversation. So  three months after TED I found myself on a plane to London  doing my first fashion shoot  which resulted in this cover     Fashion able   Three months after that  I did my first runway show for Alexander McQueen on a pair of hand carved wooden legs made from solid ash. Nobody knew    everyone thought they were wooden boots. Actually  I have them on stage with me  grapevines  magnolias    truly stunning. Poetry matters. Poetry is what elevates the banal and neglected object to a realm of art. It can transform the thing that might have made people fearful into something that invites them to look  and look a little longer  and maybe even understand. I learned this firsthand with my next adventure. The artist Matthew Barney  in his film opus called the  The Cremaster Cycle.  This is where it really hit home for me    that my legs could be wearable sculpture. And even at this point  I started to move away from the need to replicate human ness as the only aesthetic ideal. So we made what people lovingly referred to as glass legs even though they're actually optically clear polyurethane  a.k.a. bowling ball material. Heavy  Then we made these legs that are cast in soil with a potato root system growing in them  and beetroots out the top  and a very lovely brass toe. That's a good close up of that one. Then another character was a half woman  half cheetah    a little homage to my life as an athlete.    hours of prosthetic make up to get into a creature that had articulated paws  claws and a tail that whipped around  like a gecko. And then another pair of legs we collaborated on were these    look like jellyfish legs  also polyurethane. And the only purpose that these legs can serve  outside the context of the film  is to provoke the senses and ignite the imagination. So whimsy matters. Today  I have over a dozen pair of prosthetic legs that various people have made for me  and with them I have different negotiations of the terrain under my feet  and I can change my height    I have a variable of five different heights. Today  I'm  '  . And I had these legs made a little over a year ago at Dorset Orthopedic in England and when I brought them home to Manhattan  my first night out on the town  I went to a very fancy party. And a girl was there who has known me for years at my normal  '  . Her mouth dropped open when she saw me  and she went   But you're so tall   And I said   I know. Isn't it fun   I mean  it's a little bit like wearing stilts on stilts  but I have an entirely new relationship to door jams that I never expected I would ever have. And I was having fun with it. And she looked at me  and she said   But  Aimee  that's not fair.  And the incredible thing was she really meant it. It's not fair that you can change your height  as you want it. And that's when I knew    that's when I knew that the conversation with society has changed profoundly in this last decade. It is no longer a conversation about overcoming deficiency. It's a conversation about augmentation. It's a conversation about potential. A prosthetic limb doesn't represent the need to replace loss anymore. It can stand as a symbol that the wearer has the power to create whatever it is that they want to create in that space. So people that society once considered to be disabled can now become the architects of their own identities and indeed continue to change those identities by designing their bodies from a place of empowerment. And what is exciting to me so much right now is that by combining cutting edge technology    robotics  bionics    with the age old poetry  we are moving closer to understanding our collective humanity. I think that if we want to discover the full potential in our humanity  we need to celebrate those heartbreaking strengths and those glorious disabilities that we all have. I think of Shakespeare's Shylock   If you prick us  do we not bleed  and if you tickle us  do we not laugh   It is our humanity  and all the potential within it  that makes us beautiful. Thank you. So  here we go  a flyby of play. It's got to be serious if the New York Times puts a cover story of their February   th Sunday magazine about play. At the bottom of this  it says   It's deeper than gender. Seriously  but dangerously fun. And a sandbox for new ideas about evolution.  Not bad  except if you look at that cover  what's missing  You see any adults  Well  lets go back to the   th century. This is a courtyard in Europe  and a mixture of     different kinds of play. All ages  solo play  body play  games  taunting. And there it is. And I think this is a typical picture of what it was like in a courtyard then. I think we may have lost something in our culture. So I'm gonna take you through what I think is a remarkable sequence. North of Churchill  Manitoba  in October and November  there's no ice on Hudson Bay. And this polar bear that you see  this      pound male  he's wild and fairly hungry. And Norbert Rosing  a German photographer  is there on scene  making a series of photos of these huskies  who are tethered. And from out of stage left comes this wild  male polar bear  with a predatory gaze. Any of you who've been to Africa or had a junkyard dog come after you  there is a fixed kind of predatory gaze that you know you're in trouble. But on the other side of that predatory gaze is a female husky in a play bow  wagging her tail. And something very unusual happens. That fixed behavior    which is rigid and stereotyped and ends up with a meal    changes. And this polar bear stands over the husky  no claws extended  no fangs taking a look. And they begin an incredible ballet. A play ballet. This is in nature  it overrides a carnivorous nature and what otherwise would have been a short fight to the death. And if you'll begin to look closely at the husky that's bearing her throat to the polar bear  and look a little more closely  they're in an altered state. They're in a state of play. And it's that state that allows these two creatures to explore the possible. They are beginning to do something that neither would have done without the play signals. And it is a marvelous example of how a differential in power can be overridden by a process of nature that's within all of us. Now how did I get involved in this  John mentioned that I've done some work with murderers  and I have. The Texas Tower murderer opened my eyes  in retrospect  when we studied his tragic mass murder  to the importance of play  in that that individual  by deep study  was found to have severe play deprivation. Charles Whitman was his name. And our committee  which consisted of a lot of hard scientists  did feel at the end of that study that the absence of play and a progressive suppression of developmentally normal play led him to be more vulnerable to the tragedy that he perpetrated. And that finding has stood the test of time    unfortunately even into more recent times  at Virginia Tech. And other studies of populations at risk sensitized me to the importance of play  but I didn't really understand what it was. And it was many years in taking play histories of individuals before I really began to recognize that I didn't really have a full understanding of it. And I don't think any of us has a full understanding of it  by any means. But there are ways of looking at it that I think can give you    give us all a taxonomy  a way of thinking about it. And this image is  for humans  the beginning point of play. When that mother and infant lock eyes  and the infant's old enough to have a social smile  what happens    spontaneously    is the eruption of joy on the part of the mother. And she begins to babble and coo and smile  and so does the baby. If we've got them wired up with an electroencephalogram  the right brain of each of them becomes attuned  so that the joyful emergence of this earliest of play scenes and the physiology of that is something we're beginning to get a handle on. And I'd like you to think that every bit of more complex play builds on this base for us humans. And so now I'm going to take you through sort of a way of looking at play  but it's never just singularly one thing. We're going to look at body play  which is a spontaneous desire to get ourselves out of gravity. This is a mountain goat. If you're having a bad day  try this  jump up and down  wiggle around    you're going to feel better. And you may feel like this character  who is also just doing it for its own sake. It doesn't have a particular purpose  and that's what's great about play. If its purpose is more important than the act of doing it  it's probably not play. And there's a whole other type of play  which is object play. And this Japanese macaque has made a snowball  and he or she's going to roll down a hill. And    they don't throw it at each other  but this is a fundamental part of being playful. The human hand  in manipulation of objects  is the hand in search of a brain  the brain is in search of a hand  and play is the medium by which those two are linked in the best way. JPL we heard this morning    JPL is an incredible place. They have located two consultants  Frank Wilson and Nate Johnson  who are    Frank Wilson is a neurologist  Nate Johnson is a mechanic. He taught mechanics in a high school in Long Beach  and found that his students were no longer able to solve problems. And he tried to figure out why. And he came to the conclusion  quite on his own  that the students who could no longer solve problems  such as fixing cars  hadn't worked with their hands. Frank Wilson had written a book called  The Hand.  They got together    JPL hired them. Now JPL  NASA and Boeing  before they will hire a research and development problem solver    even if they're summa cum laude from Harvard or Cal Tech    if they haven't fixed cars  haven't done stuff with their hands early in life  played with their hands  they can't problem solve as well. So play is practical  and it's very important. Now one of the things about play is that it is born by curiosity and exploration.  Laughter  But it has to be safe exploration. This happens to be OK    he's an anatomically interested little boy and that's his mom. Other situations wouldn't be quite so good. But curiosity  exploration  are part of the play scene. If you want to belong  you need social play. And social play is part of what we're about here today  and is a byproduct of the play scene. Rough and tumble play. These lionesses  seen from a distance  looked like they were fighting. But if you look closely  they're kind of like the polar bear and husky  no claws  flat fur  soft eyes  open mouth with no fangs  balletic movements  curvilinear movements    all specific to play. And rough and tumble play is a great learning medium for all of us. Preschool kids  for example  should be allowed to dive  hit  whistle  scream  be chaotic  and develop through that a lot of emotional regulation and a lot of the other social byproducts    cognitive  emotional and physical    that come as a part of rough and tumble play. Spectator play  ritual play    we're involved in some of that. Those of you who are from Boston know that this was the moment    rare    where the Red Sox won the World Series. But take a look at the face and the body language of everybody in this fuzzy picture  and you can get a sense that they're all at play. Imaginative play. I love this picture because my daughter  who's now almost     is in this picture  but it reminds me of her storytelling and her imagination  her ability to spin yarns at this age    preschool. A really important part of being a player is imaginative solo play. And I love this one  because it's also what we're about. We all have an internal narrative that's our own inner story. The unit of intelligibility of most of our brains is the story. I'm telling you a story today about play. Well  this bushman  I think  is talking about the fish that got away that was that long  but it's a fundamental part of the play scene. So what does play do for the brain  Well  a lot. We don't know a whole lot about what it does for the human brain  because funding has not been exactly heavy for research on play. I walked into the Carnegie asking for a grant. They'd given me a large grant when I was an academician for the study of felony drunken drivers  and I thought I had a pretty good track record  and by the time I had spent half an hour talking about play  it was obvious that they were not    did not feel that play was serious. I think that    that's a few years back    I think that wave is past  and the play wave is cresting  because there is some good science. Nothing lights up the brain like play. Three dimensional play fires up the cerebellum  puts a lot of impulses into the frontal lobe    the executive portion    helps contextual memory be developed  and    and  and  and. So it's    for me  its been an extremely nourishing scholarly adventure to look at the neuroscience that's associated with play  and to bring together people who in their individual disciplines hadn't really thought of it that way. And that's part of what the National Institute for Play is all about. And this is one of the ways you can study play    is to get a     lead electroencephalogram. I'm sorry I don't have a playful looking subject  but it allows mobility  which has limited the actual study of play. And we've got a mother infant play scenario that we're hoping to complete underway at the moment. The reason I put this here is also to queue up my thoughts about objectifying what play does. The animal world has objectified it. In the animal world  if you take rats  who are hardwired to play at a certain period of their juvenile years and you suppress play    they squeak  they wrestle  they pin each other  that's part of their play. If you stop that behavior on one group that you're experimenting with  and you allow it in another group that you're experimenting with  and then you present those rats with a cat odor saturated collar  they're hardwired to flee and hide. Pretty smart    they don't want to get killed by a cat. So what happens  They both hide out. The non players never come out    they die. The players slowly explore the environment  and begin again to test things out. That says to me  at least in rats    and I think they have the same neurotransmitters that we do and a similar cortical architecture    that play may be pretty important for our survival. And  and  and    there are a lot more animal studies that I could talk about. Now  this is a consequence of play deprivation.  Laughter  This took a long time    I had to get Homer down and put him through the fMRI and the SPECT and multiple EEGs  but as a couch potato  his brain has shrunk. And we do know that in domestic animals and others  when they're play deprived  they don't    and rats also    they don't develop a brain that is normal. Now  the program says that the opposite of play is not work  it's depression. And I think if you think about life without play    no humor  no flirtation  no movies  no games  no fantasy and  and  and. Try and imagine a culture or a life  adult or otherwise without play. And the thing that's so unique about our species is that we're really designed to play through our whole lifetime. And we all have capacity to play signal. Nobody misses that dog I took a picture of on a Carmel beach a couple of weeks ago. What's going to follow from that behavior is play. And you can trust it. The basis of human trust is established through play signals. And we begin to lose those signals  culturally and otherwise  as adults. That's a shame. I think we've got a lot of learning to do. Now  Jane Goodall has here a play face along with one of her favorite chimps. So part of the signaling system of play has to do with vocal  facial  body  gestural. You know  you can tell    and I think when we're getting into collective play  its really important for groups to gain a sense of safety through their own sharing of play signals. You may not know this word  but it should be your biological first name and last name. Because neoteny means the retention of immature qualities into adulthood. And we are  by physical anthropologists  by many  many studies  the most neotenous  the most youthful  the most flexible  the most plastic of all creatures. And therefore  the most playful. And this gives us a leg up on adaptability. Now  there is a way of looking at play that I also want to emphasize here  which is the play history. Your own personal play history is unique  and often is not something we think about particularly. This is a book written by a consummate player by the name of Kevin Carroll. Kevin Carroll came from extremely deprived circumstances  alcoholic mother  absent father  inner city Philadelphia  black  had to take care of a younger brother. Found that when he looked at a playground out of a window into which he had been confined  he felt something different. And so he followed up on it. And his life    the transformation of his life from deprivation and what one would expect    potentially prison or death    he become a linguist  a trainer for the   ers and now is a motivational speaker. And he gives play as a transformative force over his entire life. Now there's another play history that I think is a work in progress. Those of you who remember Al Gore  during the first term and then during his successful but unelected run for the presidency  may remember him as being kind of wooden and not entirely his own person  at least in public. And looking at his history  which is common in the press  it seems to me  at least    looking at it from a shrink's point of view    that a lot of his life was programmed. Summers were hard  hard work  in the heat of Tennessee summers. He had the expectations of his senatorial father and Washington  D.C. And although I think he certainly had the capacity for play    because I do know something about that    he wasn't as empowered  I think  as he now is by paying attention to what is his own passion and his own inner drive  which I think has its basis in all of us in our play history. So what I would encourage on an individual level to do  is to explore backwards as far as you can go to the most clear  joyful  playful image that you have  whether it's with a toy  on a birthday or on a vacation. And begin to build to build from the emotion of that into how that connects with your life now. And you'll find  you may change jobs    which has happened to a number people when I've had them do this    in order to be more empowered through their play. Or you'll be able to enrich your life by prioritizing it and paying attention to it. Most of us work with groups  and I put this up because the d.school  the design school at Stanford  thanks to David Kelley and a lot of others who have been visionary about its establishment  has allowed a group of us to get together and create a course called  From Play to Innovation.  And you'll see this course is to investigate the human state of play  which is kind of like the polar bear husky state and its importance to creative thinking   to explore play behavior  its development and its biological basis  to apply those principles  through design thinking  to promote innovation in the corporate world  and the students will work with real world partners on design projects with widespread application.  This is our maiden voyage in this. We're about two and a half  three months into it  and it's really been fun. There is our star pupil  this labrador  who taught a lot of us what a state of play is  and an extremely aged and decrepit professor in charge there. And Brendan Boyle  Rich Crandall    and on the far right is  I think  a person who will be in cahoots with George Smoot for a Nobel Prize    Stuart Thompson  in neuroscience. So we've had Brendan  who's from IDEO  and the rest of us sitting aside and watching these students as they put play principles into practice in the classroom. And one of their projects was to see what makes meetings boring  and to try and do something about it. So what will follow is a student made film about just that. Narrator  Flow is the mental state of apparition in which the person is fully immersed in what he or she is doing. Characterized by a feeling of energized focus  full involvement and success in the process of the activity. An important key insight that we learned about meetings is that people pack them in one after another  disruptive to the day. Attendees at meetings don't know when they'll get back to the task that they left at their desk. But it doesn't have to be that way. Some sage and repeatedly furry monks at this place called the d.school designed a meeting that you can literally step out of when it's over. Take the meeting off  and have peace of mind that you can come back to me. Because when you need it again  the meeting is literally hanging in your closet. The Wearable Meeting. Because when you put it on  you immediately get everything you need to have a fun and productive and useful meeting. But when you take it off    that's when the real action happens. Stuart Brown  So I would encourage you all to engage not in the work play differential    where you set aside time to play    but where your life becomes infused minute by minute  hour by hour  with body  object  social  fantasy  transformational kinds of play. And I think you'll have a better and more empowered life. Thank You. John Hockenberry  So it sounds to me like what you're saying is that there may be some temptation on the part of people to look at your work and go    I think I've heard this  in my kind of pop psychological understanding of play  that somehow  the way animals and humans deal with play  is that it's some sort of rehearsal for adult activity. Your work seems to suggest that that is powerfully wrong. SB  Yeah  I don't think that's accurate  and I think probably because animals have taught us that. If you stop a cat from playing    which you can do  and we've all seen how cats bat around stuff    they're just as good predators as they would be if they hadn't played. And if you imagine a kid pretending to be King Kong  or a race car driver  or a fireman  they don't all become race car drivers or firemen  you know. So there's a disconnect between preparation for the future    which is what most people are comfortable in thinking about play as    and thinking of it as a separate biological entity. And this is where my chasing animals for four  five years really changed my perspective from a clinician to what I am now  which is that play has a biological place  just like sleep and dreams do. And if you look at sleep and dreams biologically  animals sleep and dream  and they rehearse and they do some other things that help memory and that are a very important part of sleep and dreams. The next step of evolution in mammals and creatures with divinely superfluous neurons will be to play. And the fact that the polar bear and husky or magpie and a bear or you and I and our dogs can crossover and have that experience sets play aside as something separate. And its hugely important in learning and crafting the brain. So it's not just something you do in your spare time. JH  How do you keep    and I know you're part of the scientific research community  and you have to justify your existence with grants and proposals like everyone else    how do you prevent    and some of the data that you've produced  the good science that you're talking about you've produced  is hot to handle. How do you prevent either the media's interpretation of your work or the scientific community's interpretation of the implications of your work  kind of like the Mozart metaphor  where   Oh  MRIs show that play enhances your intelligence. Well  let's round these kids up  put them in pens and make them play for months at a time  they'll all be geniuses and go to Harvard.  How do you prevent people from taking that sort of action on the data that you're developing  SB  Well  I think the only way I know to do it is to have accumulated the advisers that I have who go from practitioners    who can establish through improvisational play or clowning or whatever    a state of play. So people know that it's there. And then you get an fMRI specialist  and you get Frank Wilson  and you get other kinds of hard scientists  including neuroendocrinologists. And you get them into a group together focused on play  and it's pretty hard not to take it seriously. Unfortunately  that hasn't been done sufficiently for the National Science Foundation  National Institute of Mental Health or anybody else to really look at it in this way seriously. I mean you don't hear about anything that's like cancer or heart disease associated with play. And yet I see it as something that's just as basic for survival    long term    as learning some of the basic things about public health. JH  Stuart Brown  thank you very much. Time flies. It's actually almost    years ago when I wanted to reframe the way we use information  the way we work together  I invented the World Wide Web. Now     years on  at TED  I want to ask your help in a new reframing. So going back to       I wrote a memo suggesting the global hypertext system. Nobody really did anything with it  pretty much. But    months later    this is how innovation happens       months later  my boss said I could do it on the side  as a sort of a play project  kick the tires of a new computer we'd got. And so he gave me the time to code it up. So I basically roughed out what HTML should look like  hypertext protocol  HTTP  the idea of URLs  these names for things which started with HTTP. I wrote the code and put it out there. Why did I do it  Well  it was basically frustration. I was frustrated    I was working as a software engineer in this huge  very exciting lab  lots of people coming from all over the world. They brought all sorts of different computers with them. They had all sorts of different data formats  all sorts  all kinds of documentation systems. So that  in all that diversity  if I wanted to figure out how to build something out of a bit of this and a bit of this  everything I looked into  I had to connect to some new machine  I had to learn to run some new program  I would find the information I wanted in some new data format. And these were all incompatible. It was just very frustrating. The frustration was all this unlocked potential. In fact  on all these discs there were documents. So if you just imagined them all being part of some big  virtual documentation system in the sky  say on the Internet  then life would be so much easier. Well  once you've had an idea like that it kind of gets under your skin and even if people don't read your memo    actually he did  it was found after he died  his copy. He had written   Vague  but exciting   in pencil  in the corner. But in general it was difficult    it was really difficult to explain what the web was like. It's difficult to explain to people now that it was difficult then. But then    OK  when TED started  there was no web so things like  click  didn't have the same meaning. I can show somebody a piece of hypertext  a page which has got links  and we click on the link and bing    there'll be another hypertext page. Not impressive. You know  we've seen that    we've got things on hypertext on CD ROMs. What was difficult was to get them to imagine  so  imagine that that link could have gone to virtually any document you could imagine. Alright  that is the leap that was very difficult for people to make. Well  some people did. So yeah  it was difficult to explain  but there was a grassroots movement. And that is what has made it most fun. That has been the most exciting thing  not the technology  not the things people have done with it  but actually the community  the spirit of all these people getting together  sending the emails. That's what it was like then. Do you know what  It's funny  but right now it's kind of like that again. I asked everybody  more or less  to put their documents    I said   Could you put your documents on this web thing   And you did. Thanks. It's been a blast  hasn't it  I mean  it has been quite interesting because we've found out that the things that happen with the web really sort of blow us away. They're much more than we'd originally imagined when we put together the little  initial website that we started off with. Now  I want you to put your data on the web. Turns out that there is still huge unlocked potential. There is still a huge frustration that people have because we haven't got data on the web as data. What do you mean   data   What's the difference    documents  data  Well  documents you read  OK  More or less  you read them  you can follow links from them  and that's it. Data    you can do all kinds of stuff with a computer. Who was here or has otherwise seen Hans Rosling's talk  One of the great    yes a lot of people have seen it    one of the great TED Talks. Hans put up this presentation in which he showed  for various different countries  in various different colors    he showed income levels on one axis and he showed infant mortality  and he shot this thing animated through time. So  he'd taken this data and made a presentation which just shattered a lot of myths that people had about the economics in the developing world. He put up a slide a little bit like this. It had underground all the data OK  data is brown and boxy and boring  and that's how we think of it  isn't it  Because data you can't naturally use by itself But in fact  data drives a huge amount of what happens in our lives and it happens because somebody takes that data and does something with it. In this case  Hans had put the data together he had found from all kinds of United Nations websites and things. He had put it together  combined it into something more interesting than the original pieces and then he'd put it into this software  which I think his son developed  originally  and produces this wonderful presentation. And Hans made a point of saying   Look  it's really important to have a lot of data.  And I was happy to see that at the party last night that he was still saying  very forcibly   It's really important to have a lot of data.  So I want us now to think about not just two pieces of data being connected  or six like he did  but I want to think about a world where everybody has put data on the web and so virtually everything you can imagine is on the web and then calling that linked data. The technology is linked data  and it's extremely simple. If you want to put something on the web there are three rules  first thing is that those HTTP names    those things that start with  http      we're using them not just for documents now  we're using them for things that the documents are about. We're using them for people  we're using them for places  we're using them for your products  we're using them for events. All kinds of conceptual things  they have names now that start with HTTP. Second rule  if I take one of these HTTP names and I look it up and I do the web thing with it and I fetch the data using the HTTP protocol from the web  I will get back some data in a standard format which is kind of useful data that somebody might like to know about that thing  about that event. Who's at the event  Whatever it is about that person  where they were born  things like that. So the second rule is I get important information back. Third rule is that when I get back that information it's not just got somebody's height and weight and when they were born  it's got relationships. Data is relationships. Interestingly  data is relationships. This person was born in Berlin  Berlin is in Germany. And when it has relationships  whenever it expresses a relationship then the other thing that it's related to is given one of those names that starts HTTP. So  I can go ahead and look that thing up. So I look up a person    I can look up then the city where they were born  then I can look up the region it's in  and the town it's in  and the population of it  and so on. So I can browse this stuff. So that's it  really. That is linked data. I wrote an article entitled  Linked Data  a couple of years ago and soon after that  things started to happen. The idea of linked data is that we get lots and lots and lots of these boxes that Hans had  and we get lots and lots and lots of things sprouting. It's not just a whole lot of other plants. It's not just a root supplying a plant  but for each of those plants  whatever it is    a presentation  an analysis  somebody's looking for patterns in the data    they get to look at all the data and they get it connected together  and the really important thing about data is the more things you have to connect together  the more powerful it is. So  linked data. The meme went out there. And  pretty soon Chris Bizer at the Freie Universitat in Berlin who was one of the first people to put interesting things up  he noticed that Wikipedia    you know Wikipedia  the online encyclopedia with lots and lots of interesting documents in it. Well  in those documents  there are little squares  little boxes. And in most information boxes  there's data. So he wrote a program to take the data  extract it from Wikipedia  and put it into a blob of linked data on the web  which he called dbpedia. Dbpedia is represented by the blue blob in the middle of this slide and if you actually go and look up Berlin  you'll find that there are other blobs of data which also have stuff about Berlin  and they're linked together. So if you pull the data from dbpedia about Berlin  you'll end up pulling up these other things as well. And the exciting thing is it's starting to grow. This is just the grassroots stuff again  OK  Let's think about data for a bit. Data comes in fact in lots and lots of different forms. Think of the diversity of the web. It's a really important thing that the web allows you to put all kinds of data up there. So it is with data. I could talk about all kinds of data. We could talk about government data  enterprise data is really important  there's scientific data  there's personal data  there's weather data  there's data about events  there's data about talks  and there's news and there's all kinds of stuff. I'm just going to mention a few of them so that you get the idea of the diversity of it  so that you also see how much unlocked potential. Let's start with government data. Barack Obama said in a speech  that he    American government data would be available on the Internet in accessible formats. And I hope that they will put it up as linked data. That's important. Why is it important  Not just for transparency  yeah transparency in government is important  but that data    this is the data from all the government departments Think about how much of that data is about how life is lived in America. It's actual useful. It's got value. I can use it in my company. I could use it as a kid to do my homework. So we're talking about making the place  making the world run better by making this data available. In fact if you're responsible    if you know about some data in a government department  often you find that these people  they're very tempted to keep it    Hans calls it database hugging. You hug your database  you don't want to let it go until you've made a beautiful website for it. Well  I'd like to suggest that rather    yes  make a beautiful website  who am I to say don't make a beautiful website  Make a beautiful website  but first give us the unadulterated data  we want the data. We want unadulterated data. OK  we have to ask for raw data now. And I'm going to ask you to practice that  OK  Can you say  raw   Audience  Raw. Tim Berners Lee  Can you say  data   Audience  Data. TBL  Can you say  now   Audience  Now  TBL  Alright   raw data now   Audience  Raw data now  Practice that. It's important because you have no idea the number of excuses people come up with to hang onto their data and not give it to you  even though you've paid for it as a taxpayer. And it's not just America. It's all over the world. And it's not just governments  of course    it's enterprises as well. So I'm just going to mention a few other thoughts on data. Here we are at TED  and all the time we are very conscious of the huge challenges that human society has right now    curing cancer  understanding the brain for Alzheimer's  understanding the economy to make it a little bit more stable  understanding how the world works. The people who are going to solve those    the scientists    they have half formed ideas in their head  they try to communicate those over the web. But a lot of the state of knowledge of the human race at the moment is on databases  often sitting in their computers  and actually  currently not shared. In fact  I'll just go into one area    if you're looking at Alzheimer's  for example  drug discovery    there is a whole lot of linked data which is just coming out because scientists in that field realize this is a great way of getting out of those silos  because they had their genomics data in one database in one building  and they had their protein data in another. Now  they are sticking it onto    linked data    and now they can ask the sort of question  that you probably wouldn't ask  I wouldn't ask    they would. What proteins are involved in signal transduction and also related to pyramidal neurons  Well  you take that mouthful and you put it into Google. Of course  there's no page on the web which has answered that question because nobody has asked that question before. You get         hits    no results you can use. You ask the linked data    which they've now put together       hits  each of which is a protein which has those properties and you can look at. The power of being able to ask those questions  as a scientist    questions which actually bridge across different disciplines    is really a complete sea change. It's very very important. Scientists are totally stymied at the moment    the power of the data that other scientists have collected is locked up and we need to get it unlocked so we can tackle those huge problems. Now if I go on like this  you'll think that all the data comes from huge institutions and has nothing to do with you. But  that's not true. In fact  data is about our lives. You just    you log on to your social networking site  your favorite one  you say   This is my friend.  Bing  Relationship. Data. You say   This photograph  it's about    it depicts this person.   Bing  That's data. Data  data  data. Every time you do things on the social networking site  the social networking site is taking data and using it    re purposing it    and using it to make other people's lives more interesting on the site. But  when you go to another linked data site    and let's say this is one about travel  and you say   I want to send this photo to all the people in that group   you can't get over the walls. The Economist wrote an article about it  and lots of people have blogged about it    tremendous frustration. The way to break down the silos is to get inter operability between social networking sites. We need to do that with linked data. One last type of data I'll talk about  maybe it's the most exciting. Before I came down here  I looked it up on OpenStreetMap The OpenStreetMap's a map  but it's also a Wiki. Zoom in and that square thing is a theater    which we're in right now    The Terrace Theater. It didn't have a name on it. So I could go into edit mode  I could select the theater  I could add down at the bottom the name  and I could save it back. And now if you go back to the OpenStreetMap. org  and you find this place  you will find that The Terrace Theater has got a name. I did that. Me  I did that to the map. I just did that  I put that up on there. Hey  you know what  If I    that street map is all about everybody doing their bit and it creates an incredible resource because everybody else does theirs. And that is what linked data is all about. It's about people doing their bit to produce a little bit  and it all connecting. That's how linked data works. You do your bit. Everybody else does theirs. You may not have lots of data which you have yourself to put on there but you know to demand it. And we've practiced that. So  linked data    it's huge. I've only told you a very small number of things There are data in every aspect of our lives  every aspect of work and pleasure  and it's not just about the number of places where data comes  it's about connecting it together. And when you connect data together  you get power in a way that doesn't happen just with the web  with documents. You get this really huge power out of it. So  we're at the stage now where we have to do this    the people who think it's a great idea. And all the people    and I think there's a lot of people at TED who do things because    even though there's not an immediate return on the investment because it will only really pay off when everybody else has done it    they'll do it because they're the sort of person who just does things which would be good if everybody else did them. OK  so it's called linked data. I want you to make it. I want you to demand it. And I think it's an idea worth spreading. Thanks. I m going around the world giving talks about Darwin  and usually what I m talking about is Darwin s strange inversion of reasoning. Now that title  that phrase  comes from a critic  an early critic  and this is a passage that I just love  and would like to read for you.  In the theory with which we have to deal  Absolute Ignorance is the artificer  so that we may enunciate as the fundamental principle of the whole system  that  in order to make a perfect and beautiful machine  it is not requisite to know how to make it. This proposition will be found on careful examination to express  in condensed form  the essential purport of the Theory  and to express in a few words all Mr. Darwin s meaning  who  by a strange inversion of reasoning  seems to think Absolute Ignorance fully qualified to take the place of Absolute Wisdom in the achievements of creative skill.  Exactly. Exactly. And it is a strange inversion. A creationist pamphlet has this wonderful page in it   Test Two  Do you know of any building that didn t have a builder  Yes No. Do you know of any painting that didn t have a painter  Yes No. Do you know of any car that didn t have a maker  Yes No. If you answered 'Yes' for any of the above  give details.  A ha  I mean  it really is a strange inversion of reasoning. You would have thought it stands to reason that design requires an intelligent designer. But Darwin shows that it s just false. Today  though  I m going to talk about Darwin s other strange inversion  which is equally puzzling at first  but in some ways just as important. It stands to reason that we love chocolate cake because it is sweet. Guys go for girls like this because they are sexy. We adore babies because they re so cute. And  of course  we are amused by jokes because they are funny. This is all backwards. It is. And Darwin shows us why. Let s start with sweet. Our sweet tooth is basically an evolved sugar detector  because sugar is high energy  and it s just been wired up to the preferer  to put it very crudely  and that s why we like sugar. Honey is sweet because we like it  not  we like it because honey is sweet.  There s nothing intrinsically sweet about honey. If you looked at glucose molecules till you were blind  you wouldn t see why they tasted sweet. You have to look in our brains to understand why they re sweet. So if you think first there was sweetness  and then we evolved to like sweetness  you ve got it backwards  that s just wrong. It s the other way round. Sweetness was born with the wiring which evolved. And there s nothing intrinsically sexy about these young ladies. And it s a good thing that there isn t  because if there were  then Mother Nature would have a problem  How on earth do you get chimps to mate  Now you might think  ah  there s a solution  hallucinations. That would be one way of doing it  but there s a quicker way. Just wire the chimps up to love that look  and apparently they do. That s all there is to it. Over six million years  we and the chimps evolved our different ways. We became bald bodied  oddly enough  for one reason or another  they didn t. If we hadn t  then probably this would be the height of sexiness. Our sweet tooth is an evolved and instinctual preference for high energy food. It wasn t designed for chocolate cake. Chocolate cake is a supernormal stimulus. The term is owed to Niko Tinbergen  who did his famous experiments with gulls  where he found that that orange spot on the gull s beak    if he made a bigger  oranger spot the gull chicks would peck at it even harder. It was a hyperstimulus for them  and they loved it. What we see with  say  chocolate cake is it s a supernormal stimulus to tweak our design wiring. And there are lots of supernormal stimuli  chocolate cake is one. There's lots of supernormal stimuli for sexiness. And there's even supernormal stimuli for cuteness. Here s a pretty good example. It s important that we love babies  and that we not be put off by  say  messy diapers. So babies have to attract our affection and our nurturing  and they do. And  by the way  a recent study shows that mothers prefer the smell of the dirty diapers of their own baby. So nature works on many levels here. But now  if babies didn t look the way they do    if babies looked like this  that s what we would find adorable  that s what we would find    we would think  oh my goodness  do I ever want to hug that. This is the strange inversion. Well now  finally what about funny. My answer is  it s the same story  the same story. This is the hard one  the one that isn t obvious. That s why I leave it to the end. And I won t be able to say too much about it. But you have to think evolutionarily  you have to think  what hard job that has to be done    it s dirty work  somebody s got to do it    is so important to give us such a powerful  inbuilt reward for it when we succeed. Now  I think we've found the answer    I and a few of my colleagues. It s a neural system that s wired up to reward the brain for doing a grubby clerical job. Our bumper sticker for this view is that this is the joy of debugging. Now I m not going to have time to spell it all out  but I ll just say that only some kinds of debugging get the reward. And what we re doing is we re using humor as a sort of neuroscientific probe by switching humor on and off  by turning the knob on a joke    now it s not funny ... oh  now it s funnier ... now we ll turn a little bit more ... now it s not funny    in this way  we can actually learn something about the architecture of the brain  the functional architecture of the brain. Matthew Hurley is the first author of this. We call it the Hurley Model. He s a computer scientist  Reginald Adams a psychologist  and there I am  and we re putting this together into a book. Thank you very much. I want to talk to you today a little bit about predictable irrationality. And my interest in irrational behavior started many years ago in the hospital. I was burned very badly. And if you spend a lot of time in hospital  you'll see a lot of types of irrationalities. And the one that particularly bothered me in the burn department was the process by which the nurses took the bandage off me. Now  you must have all taken a Band Aid off at some point  and you must have wondered what's the right approach. Do you rip it off quickly    short duration but high intensity    or do you take your Band Aid off slowly    you take a long time  but each second is not as painful    which one of those is the right approach  The nurses in my department thought that the right approach was the ripping one  so they would grab hold and they would rip  and they would grab hold and they would rip. And because I had    percent of my body burned  it would take about an hour. And as you can imagine  I hated that moment of ripping with incredible intensity. And I would try to reason with them and say   Why don't we try something else  Why don't we take it a little longer    maybe two hours instead of an hour    and have less of this intensity   And the nurses told me two things. They told me that they had the right model of the patient    that they knew what was the right thing to do to minimize my pain    and they also told me that the word patient doesn't mean to make suggestions or to interfere or ... This is not just in Hebrew  by the way. It's in every language I've had experience with so far. And  you know  there's not much    there wasn't much I could do  and they kept on doing what they were doing. And about three years later  when I left the hospital  I started studying at the university. And one of the most interesting lessons I learned was that there is an experimental method that if you have a question you can create a replica of this question in some abstract way  and you can try to examine this question  maybe learn something about the world. So that's what I did. I was still interested in this question of how do you take bandages off burn patients. So originally I didn't have much money  so I went to a hardware store and I bought a carpenter's vice. And I would bring people to the lab and I would put their finger in it  and I would crunch it a little bit. And I would crunch it for long periods and short periods  and pain that went up and pain that went down  and with breaks and without breaks    all kinds of versions of pain. And when I finished hurting people a little bit  I would ask them  so  how painful was this  Or  how painful was this  Or  if you had to choose between the last two  which one would you choose  I kept on doing this for a while. And then  like all good academic projects  I got more funding. I moved to sounds  electrical shocks    I even had a pain suit that I could get people to feel much more pain. But at the end of this process  what I learned was that the nurses were wrong. Here were wonderful people with good intentions and plenty of experience  and nevertheless they were getting things wrong predictably all the time. It turns out that because we don't encode duration in the way that we encode intensity  I would have had less pain if the duration would have been longer and the intensity was lower. It turns out it would have been better to start with my face  which was much more painful  and move toward my legs  giving me a trend of improvement over time    that would have been also less painful. And it also turns out that it would have been good to give me breaks in the middle to kind of recuperate from the pain. All of these would have been great things to do  and my nurses had no idea. And from that point on I started thinking  are the nurses the only people in the world who get things wrong in this particular decision  or is it a more general case  And it turns out it's a more general case    there's a lot of mistakes we do. And I want to give you one example of one of these irrationalities  and I want to talk to you about cheating. And the reason I picked cheating is because it's interesting  but also it tells us something  I think  about the stock market situation we're in. So  my interest in cheating started when Enron came on the scene  exploded all of a sudden  and I started thinking about what is happening here. Is it the case that there was kind of a few apples who are capable of doing these things  or are we talking a more endemic situation  that many people are actually capable of behaving this way  So  like we usually do  I decided to do a simple experiment. And here's how it went. If you were in the experiment  I would pass you a sheet of paper with    simple math problems that everybody could solve  but I wouldn't give you enough time. When the five minutes were over  I would say   Pass me the sheets of paper  and I'll pay you a dollar per question.  People did this. I would pay people four dollars for their task    on average people would solve four problems. Other people I would tempt to cheat. I would pass their sheet of paper. When the five minutes were over  I would say   Please shred the piece of paper. Put the little pieces in your pocket or in your backpack  and tell me how many questions you got correctly.  People now solved seven questions on average. Now  it wasn't as if there was a few bad apples    a few people cheated a lot. Instead  what we saw is a lot of people who cheat a little bit. Now  in economic theory  cheating is a very simple cost benefit analysis. You say  what's the probability of being caught  How much do I stand to gain from cheating  And how much punishment would I get if I get caught  And you weigh these options out    you do the simple cost benefit analysis  and you decide whether it's worthwhile to commit the crime or not. So  we try to test this. For some people  we varied how much money they could get away with    how much money they could steal. We paid them    cents per correct question     cents  a dollar  five dollars     dollars per correct question. You would expect that as the amount of money on the table increases  people would cheat more  but in fact it wasn't the case. We got a lot of people cheating by stealing by a little bit. What about the probability of being caught  Some people shredded half the sheet of paper  so there was some evidence left. Some people shredded the whole sheet of paper. Some people shredded everything  went out of the room  and paid themselves from the bowl of money that had over     dollars. You would expect that as the probability of being caught goes down  people would cheat more  but again  this was not the case. Again  a lot of people cheated by just by a little bit  and they were insensitive to these economic incentives. So we said   If people are not sensitive to the economic rational theory explanations  to these forces  what could be going on   And we thought maybe what is happening is that there are two forces. At one hand  we all want to look at ourselves in the mirror and feel good about ourselves  so we don't want to cheat. On the other hand  we can cheat a little bit  and still feel good about ourselves. So  maybe what is happening is that there's a level of cheating we can't go over  but we can still benefit from cheating at a low degree  as long as it doesn't change our impressions about ourselves. We call this like a personal fudge factor. Now  how would you test a personal fudge factor  Initially we said  what can we do to shrink the fudge factor  So  we got people to the lab  and we said   We have two tasks for you today.  First  we asked half the people to recall either    books they read in high school  or to recall The Ten Commandments  and then we tempted them with cheating. Turns out the people who tried to recall The Ten Commandments    and in our sample nobody could recall all of The Ten Commandments    but those people who tried to recall The Ten Commandments  given the opportunity to cheat  did not cheat at all. It wasn't that the more religious people    the people who remembered more of the Commandments    cheated less  and the less religious people    the people who couldn't remember almost any Commandments    cheated more. The moment people thought about trying to recall The Ten Commandments  they stopped cheating. In fact  even when we gave self declared atheists the task of swearing on the Bible and we give them a chance to cheat  they don't cheat at all. Now  Ten Commandments is something that is hard to bring into the education system  so we said   Why don't we get people to sign the honor code   So  we got people to sign   I understand that this short survey falls under the MIT Honor Code.  Then they shredded it. No cheating whatsoever. And this is particularly interesting  because MIT doesn't have an honor code. So  all this was about decreasing the fudge factor. What about increasing the fudge factor  The first experiment    I walked around MIT and I distributed six packs of Cokes in the refrigerators    these were common refrigerators for the undergrads. And I came back to measure what we technically call the half lifetime of Coke    how long does it last in the refrigerators  As you can expect it doesn't last very long  people take it. In contrast  I took a plate with six one dollar bills  and I left those plates in the same refrigerators. No bill ever disappeared. Now  this is not a good social science experiment  so to do it better I did the same experiment as I described to you before. A third of the people we passed the sheet  they gave it back to us. A third of the people we passed it to  they shredded it  they came to us and said   Mr. Experimenter  I solved X problems. Give me X dollars.  A third of the people  when they finished shredding the piece of paper  they came to us and said   Mr Experimenter  I solved X problems. Give me X tokens.  We did not pay them with dollars  we paid them with something else. And then they took the something else  they walked    feet to the side  and exchanged it for dollars. Think about the following intuition. How bad would you feel about taking a pencil from work home  compared to how bad would you feel about taking    cents from a petty cash box  These things feel very differently. Would being a step removed from cash for a few seconds by being paid by token make a difference  Our subjects doubled their cheating. I'll tell you what I think about this and the stock market in a minute. But this did not solve the big problem I had with Enron yet  because in Enron  there's also a social element. People see each other behaving. In fact  every day when we open the news we see examples of people cheating. What does this cause us  So  we did another experiment. We got a big group of students to be in the experiment  and we prepaid them. So everybody got an envelope with all the money for the experiment  and we told them that at the end  we asked them to pay us back the money they didn't make. OK  The same thing happens. When we give people the opportunity to cheat  they cheat. They cheat just by a little bit  all the same. But in this experiment we also hired an acting student. This acting student stood up after    seconds  and said   I solved everything. What do I do now   And the experimenter said   If you've finished everything  go home. That's it. The task is finished.  So  now we had a student    an acting student    that was a part of the group. Nobody knew it was an actor. And they clearly cheated in a very  very serious way. What would happen to the other people in the group  Will they cheat more  or will they cheat less  Here is what happens. It turns out it depends on what kind of sweatshirt they're wearing. Here is the thing. We ran this at Carnegie Mellon and Pittsburgh. And at Pittsburgh there are two big universities  Carnegie Mellon and University of Pittsburgh. All of the subjects sitting in the experiment were Carnegie Mellon students. When the actor who was getting up was a Carnegie Mellon student    he was actually a Carnegie Mellon student    but he was a part of their group  cheating went up. But when he actually had a University of Pittsburgh sweatshirt  cheating went down. Now  this is important  because remember  when the moment the student stood up  it made it clear to everybody that they could get away with cheating  because the experimenter said   You've finished everything. Go home   and they went with the money. So it wasn't so much about the probability of being caught again. It was about the norms for cheating. If somebody from our in group cheats and we see them cheating  we feel it's more appropriate  as a group  to behave this way. But if it's somebody from another group  these terrible people    I mean  not terrible in this    but somebody we don't want to associate ourselves with  from another university  another group  all of a sudden people's awareness of honesty goes up    a little bit like The Ten Commandments experiment    and people cheat even less. So  what have we learned from this about cheating  We've learned that a lot of people can cheat. They cheat just by a little bit. When we remind people about their morality  they cheat less. When we get bigger distance from cheating  from the object of money  for example  people cheat more. And when we see cheating around us  particularly if it's a part of our in group  cheating goes up. Now  if we think about this in terms of the stock market  think about what happens. What happens in a situation when you create something where you pay people a lot of money to see reality in a slightly distorted way  Would they not be able to see it this way  Of course they would. What happens when you do other things  like you remove things from money  You call them stock  or stock options  derivatives  mortgage backed securities. Could it be that with those more distant things  it's not a token for one second  it's something that is many steps removed from money for a much longer time    could it be that people will cheat even more  And what happens to the social environment when people see other people behave around them  I think all of those forces worked in a very bad way in the stock market. More generally  I want to tell you something about behavioral economics. We have many intuitions in our life  and the point is that many of these intuitions are wrong. The question is  are we going to test those intuitions  We can think about how we're going to test this intuition in our private life  in our business life  and most particularly when it goes to policy  when we think about things like No Child Left Behind  when you create new stock markets  when you create other policies    taxation  health care and so on. And the difficulty of testing our intuition was the big lesson I learned when I went back to the nurses to talk to them. So I went back to talk to them and tell them what I found out about removing bandages. And I learned two interesting things. One was that my favorite nurse  Ettie  told me that I did not take her pain into consideration. She said   Of course  you know  it was very painful for you. But think about me as a nurse  taking  removing the bandages of somebody I liked  and had to do it repeatedly over a long period of time. Creating so much torture was not something that was good for me  too.  And she said maybe part of the reason was it was difficult for her. But it was actually more interesting than that  because she said   I did not think that your intuition was right. I felt my intuition was correct.  So  if you think about all of your intuitions  it's very hard to believe that your intuition is wrong. And she said   Given the fact that I thought my intuition was right ...     she thought her intuition was right    it was very difficult for her to accept doing a difficult experiment to try and check whether she was wrong. But in fact  this is the situation we're all in all the time. We have very strong intuitions about all kinds of things    our own ability  how the economy works  how we should pay school teachers. But unless we start testing those intuitions  we're not going to do better. And just think about how better my life would have been if these nurses would have been willing to check their intuition  and how everything would have been better if we just start doing more systematic experimentation of our intuitions. Thank you very much. About four years ago  the New Yorker published an article about a cache of dodo bones that was found in a pit on the island of Mauritius. Now  the island of Mauritius is a small island off the east coast of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean  and it is the place where the dodo bird was discovered and extinguished  all within about     years. Everyone was very excited about this archaeological find  because it meant that they might finally be able to assemble a single dodo skeleton. See  while museums all over the world have dodo skeletons in their collection  nobody    not even the actual Natural History Museum on the island of Mauritius    has a skeleton that's made from the bones of a single dodo. Well  this isn't exactly true. The fact is  is that the British Museum had a complete specimen of a dodo in their collection up until the   th century    it was actually mummified  skin and all    but in a fit of space saving zeal  they actually cut off the head and they cut off the feet and they burned the rest in a bonfire. If you go look at their website today  they'll actually list these specimens  saying  the rest was lost in a fire. Not quite the whole truth. Anyway. The frontispiece of this article was this photo  and I'm one of the people that thinks that Tina Brown was great for bringing photos to the New Yorker  because this photo completely rocked my world. I became obsessed with the object    not just the beautiful photograph itself  and the color  the shallow depth of field  the detail that's visible  the wire you can see on the beak there that the conservator used to put this skeleton together    there's an entire story here. And I thought to myself  wouldn't it be great if I had my own dodo skeleton  I want to point out here at this point that I've spent my life obsessed by objects and the stories that they tell  and this was the very latest one. So I began looking around for    to see if anyone sold a kit  some kind of model that I could get  and I found lots of reference material  lots of lovely pictures. No dice  no dodo skeleton for me. But the damage had been done. I had saved a few hundred photos of dodo skeletons into my  Creative Projects  folder    it's a repository for my brain  everything that I could possibly be interested in. Any time I have an internet connection  there's a sluice of stuff moving into there  everything from beautiful rings to cockpit photos. The key that the Marquis du Lafayette sent to George Washington to celebrate the storming of the Bastille. Russian nuclear launch key  The one on the top is the picture of the one I found on eBay  the one on the bottom is the one I made for myself  because I couldn't afford the one on eBay. Storm trooper costumes. Maps of Middle Earth    that's one I hand drew myself. There's the dodo skeleton folder. This folder has        photos    over    gigabytes of information    and it's growing constantly. And one day  a couple of weeks later  it might have been maybe a year later  I was in the art store with my kids  and I was buying some clay tools    we were going to have a craft day. I bought some Super Sculpeys  some armature wire  some various materials. And I looked down at this Sculpey  and I thought  maybe  yeah  maybe I could make my own dodo skull. I should point out at this time    I'm not a sculptor  I'm a hard edged model maker. You give me a drawing  you give me a prop to replicate  you give me a crane  scaffolding  parts from  Star Wars     especially parts from  Star Wars     I can do this stuff all day long. It's exactly how I made my living for    years. But you give me something like this    my friend Mike Murnane sculpted this  it's a maquette for  Star Wars  Episode Two     this is not my thing    this is something other people do    dragons  soft things. However  I felt like I had looked at enough photos of dodo skulls to actually be able to understand the topology and perhaps replicate it    I mean  it couldn't be that difficult. So  I started looking at the best photos I could find. I grabbed all the reference  and I found this lovely piece of reference. This is someone selling this on eBay  it was clearly a woman s hand  hopefully a woman's hand. Assuming it was roughly the size of my wife's hand  I made some measurements of her thumb  and I scaled them out to the size of the skull. I blew it up to the actual size  and I began using that  along with all the other reference that I had  comparing it to it as size reference for figuring out exactly how big the beak should be  exactly how long  etc. And over a few hours  I eventually achieved what was actually a pretty reasonable dodo skull. And I didn't mean to continue  I    it's kind of like  you know  you can only clean a super messy room by picking up one thing at a time  you can't think about the totality. I wasn't thinking about a dodo skeleton  I just noticed that as I finished this skull  the armature wire that I had been used to holding it up was sticking out of the back just where a spine would be. And one of the other things I'd been interested in and obsessed with over the years is spines and skeletons  having collected a couple of hundred. I actually understood the mechanics of vertebrae enough to kind of start to imitate them. And so button by button  vertebrae by vertebrae  I built my way down. And actually  by the end of the day  I had a reasonable skull  a moderately good vertebrae and half of a pelvis. And again  I kept on going  looking for more reference  every bit of reference I could find    drawings  beautiful photos. This guy    I love this guy  He put a dodo leg bones on a scanner with a ruler. This is the kind of accuracy that I wanted  and I replicated every last bone and put it in. And after about six weeks  I finished  painted  mounted my own dodo skeleton. You can see that I even made a museum label for it that includes a brief history of the dodo. And TAP Plastics made me    although I didn't photograph it    a museum vitrine. I don't have the room for this in my house  but I had to finish what I had started. And this actually represented kind of a sea change to me. Again  like I said  my life has been about being fascinated by objects and the stories that they tell  and also making them for myself  obtaining them  appreciating them and diving into them. And in this folder   Creative Projects   there are tons of projects that I'm currently working on  projects that I've already worked on  things that I might want to work on some day  and things that I may just want to find and buy and have and look at and touch. But now there was potentially this new category of things that I could sculpt that was different  that I    you know  I have my own R D   but that's    honestly  relative to sculpting  to me  that's easy. And so I went back and looked through my  Creative Projects  folder  and I happened across the Maltese Falcon. Now  this is funny for me  to fall in love with an object from a Hammett novel  because if it's true that the world is divided into two types of people  Chandler people and Hammett people  I am absolutely a Chandler person. But in this case  it's not about the author  it's not about the book or the movie or the story  it's about the object in and of itself. And in this case  this object is    plays on a host of levels. First of all  there's the object in the world. This is the  Kniphausen Hawk.  It is a ceremonial pouring vessel made around      for a Swedish Count  and it is very likely the object from which Hammett drew his inspiration for the Maltese Falcon. Then there is the fictional bird  the one that Hammett created for the book. Built out of words  it is the engine that drives the plot of his book and also the movie  in which another object is created  a prop that has to represent the thing that Hammett created out of words  inspired by the Kniphausen Hawk  and this represents the falcon in the movie. And then there is this fourth level  which is a whole new object in the world  the prop made for the movie  the representative of the thing  becomes  in its own right  a whole other thing  a whole new object of desire. And so now it was time to do some research. I actually had done some research a few years before    it's why the folder was there. I'd bought a replica  a really crappy replica  of the Maltese Falcon on eBay  and had downloaded enough pictures to actually have some reasonable reference. But I discovered  in researching further  really wanting precise reference  that one of the original lead birds had been sold at Christie's in       and so I contacted an antiquarian bookseller who had the original Christie's catalogue  and in it I found this magnificent picture  which included a size reference. I was able to scan the picture  blow it up to exactly full size. I found other reference. Avi  Ara  Chekmayan  a New Jersey editor  actually found this resin Maltese Falcon at a flea market in       although it took him five years to authenticate this bird to the auctioneers' specifications  because there was a lot of controversy about it. It was made out of resin  which wasn't a common material for movie props about the time the movie was made. It's funny to me that it took a while to authenticate it  because I can see it compared to this thing  and I can tell you    it's real  it's the real thing  it's made from the exact same mold that this one is. In this one  because the auction was actually so controversial  Profiles in History  the auction house that sold this    I think in      for about         dollars    they actually included    you can see here on the bottom    not just a front elevation  but also a side  rear and other side elevation. So now  I had all the topology I needed to replicate the Maltese Falcon. What do they do  how do you start something like that  I really don't know. So what I did was  again  like I did with the dodo skull  I blew all my reference up to full size  and then I began cutting out the negatives and using those templates as shape references. So I took Sculpey  and I built a big block of it  and I passed it through until  you know  I got the right profiles. And then slowly  feather by feather  detail by detail  I worked out and achieved    working in front of the television and Super Sculpey    here's me sitting next to my wife    it's the only picture I took of the entire process. As I moved through  I achieved a very reasonable facsimile of the Maltese Falcon. But again  I am not a sculptor  and so I don't know a lot of the tricks  like  I don't know how my friend Mike gets beautiful  shiny surfaces with his Sculpey  I certainly wasn't able to get it. So  I went down to my shop  and I molded it and I cast it in resin  because in the resin  then  I could absolutely get the glass smooth finished. Now there's a lot of ways to fill and get yourself a nice smooth finish. My preference is about    coats of this    matte black auto primer. I spray it on for about three or four days  it drips to hell  but it allows me a really  really nice gentle sanding surface and I can get it glass smooth. Oh  finishing up with triple zero steel wool. Now  the great thing about getting it to this point was that because in the movie  when they finally bring out the bird at the end  and they place it on the table  they actually spin it. So I was able to actually screen shot and freeze frame to make sure. And I'm following all the light kicks on this thing and making sure that as I'm holding the light in the same position  I'm getting the same type of reflection on it    that's the level of detail I'm going into this thing. I ended up with this  my Maltese Falcon. And it's beautiful. And I can state with authority at this point in time  when I'd finished it  of all of the replicas out there    and there is a few    this is by far the most accurate representation of the original Maltese Falcon than anyone has sculpted. Now the original one  I should tell you  is sculpted by a guy named Fred Sexton. This is where it gets weird. Fred Sexton was a friend of this guy  George Hodel. Terrifying guy    agreed by many to be the killer of the Black Dahlia. Now  James Ellroy believes that Fred Sexton  the sculptor of the Maltese Falcon  killed James Elroy's mother. I'll go you one stranger than that  In       during the production of a weird comedy sequel to  The Maltese Falcon   called  The Black Bird   starring George Segal  the Los Angeles County Museum of Art had a plaster original of the Maltese Falcon    one of the original six plasters  I think  made for the movie    stolen out of the museum. A lot of people thought it was a publicity stunt for the movie. John's Grill  which actually is seen briefly in  The Maltese Falcon   is still a viable San Francisco eatery  counted amongst its regular customers Elisha Cook  who played Wilmer Cook in the movie  and he gave them one of his original plasters of the Maltese Falcon. And they had it in their cabinet for about    years  until it got stolen in January of     . It would seem that the object of desire only comes into its own by disappearing repeatedly. So here I had this Falcon  and it was lovely. It looked really great  the light worked on it really well  it was better than anything that I could achieve or obtain out in the world. But there was a problem. And the problem was that  I wanted the entirety of the object  I wanted the weight behind the object. This thing was made of resin and it was too light. There's this group online that I frequent. It's a group of prop crazies just like me called the Replica Props Forum  and it's people who trade  make and travel in information about movie props. And it turned out that one of the guys there  a friend of mine that I never actually met  but befriended through some prop deals  was the manager of a local foundry. He took my master Falcon pattern  he actually did lost wax casting in bronze for me  and this is the bronze I got back. And this is  after some acid etching  the one that I ended up with. And this thing  it's deeply  deeply satisfying to me. Here  I'm going to put it out there  later on tonight  and I want you to pick it up and handle it. You want to know how obsessed I am. This project's only for me  and yet I went so far as to buy on eBay a      Chinese San Francisco based newspaper  in order so that the bird could properly be wrapped ... like it is in the movie. Yeah  I know  There you can see  it's weighing in at    and a half pounds. That's half the weight of my dog  Huxley. But there's a problem. Now  here's the most recent progression of Falcons. On the far left is a piece of crap    a replica I bought on eBay. There's my somewhat ruined Sculpey Falcon  because I had to get it back out of the mold. There's my first casting  there's my master and there's my bronze. There's a thing that happens when you mold and cast things  which is that every time you throw it into silicone and cast it in resin  you lose a little bit of volume  you lose a little bit of size. And when I held my bronze one up against my Sculpey one  it was shorter by three quarters of an inch. Yeah  no  really  this was like aah    why didn't I remember this  Why didn't I start and make it bigger  So what do I do  I figure I have two options. One  I can fire a freaking laser at it  which I have already done  to do a  D scan    there's a  D scan of this Falcon. I had figured out the exact amount of shrinkage I achieved going from a wax master to a bronze master and blown this up big enough to make a  D lithography master of this  which I will polish  then I will send to the mold maker and then I will have it done in bronze. Or  There are several people who own originals  and I have been attempting to contact them and reach them  hoping that they will let me spend a few minutes in the presence of one of the real birds  maybe to take a picture  or even to pull out the hand held laser scanner that I happen to own that fits inside a cereal box  and could maybe  without even touching their bird  I swear  get a perfect  D scan. And I'm even willing to sign pages saying that I'll never let anyone else have it  except for me in my office  I promise. I'll give them one if they want it. And then  maybe  then I'll achieve the end of this exercise. But really  if we're all going to be honest with ourselves  I have to admit that achieving the end of the exercise was never the point of the exercise to begin with  was it. Thank you. I don't know what the hell I'm doing here. I was born in a Scots Presbyterian ghetto in Canada  and dropped out of high school. I don't own a cell phone  and I paint on paper using gouache  which hasn't changed in     years. But about three years ago I had an art show in New York  and I titled it  Serious Nonsense.  So I think I'm actually the first one here    I lead. I called it  Serious Nonsense  because on the serious side  I use a technique of painstaking realism of editorial illustration from when I was a kid. I copied it and I never unlearned it    it's the only style I know. And it's very kind of staid and formal. And meanwhile  I use nonsense  as you can see. This is a Scottish castle where people are playing golf indoors  and the trick was to bang the golf ball off of suits of armor    which you can't see there. This was one of a series called  Zany Afternoons   which became a book. This is a home built rocket propelled car. That's a      Henry J    I'm a bug for authenticity    in a quiet neighborhood in Toledo. This is my submission for the L.A. Museum of Film. You can probably tell Frank Gehry and I come from the same town. My work is so personal and so strange that I have to invent my own lexicon for it. And I work a lot in what I call  retrofuturism   which is looking back to see how yesterday viewed tomorrow. And they're always wrong  always hilariously  optimistically wrong. And the peak time for that was the   s  because the Depression was so dismal that anything to get away from the present into the future ... and technology was going to carry us along. This is Popular Workbench. Popular science magazines in those days    I had a huge collection of them from the '  s    all they are is just poor people being asked to make sunglasses out of wire coat hangers and everything improvised and dreaming about these wonderful giant radio robots playing ice hockey at     miles an hour    it's all going to happen  it's all going to be wonderful. Automotive retrofuturism is one of my specialties. I was both an automobile illustrator and an advertising automobile copywriter  so I have a lot of revenge to take on the subject. Detroit has always been halfway into the future    the advertising half. This is the '   Bulgemobile  so new  they make tomorrow look like yesterday. This is a chain gang of guys admiring the car. That's from a whole catalog    it's    pages or so    ran back in the days of the Lampoon  where I cut my teeth. Techno archaeology is digging back and finding past miracles that never happened    for good reason  usually. The zeppelin    this was from a brochure about the zeppelin based  obviously  on the Hindenburg. But the zeppelin was the biggest thing that ever moved made by man. And it carried    people at the speed of a Buick at an altitude you could hear dogs bark  and it cost twice as much as a first class cabin on the Normandie to fly it. So the Hindenburg wasn't  you know  it was inevitable it was going to go. This is auto gyro jousting in Malibu in the   s. The auto gyro couldn't wait for the invention of the helicopter  but it should have    it wasn't a big success. It's the only Spanish innovation  technologically  of the   th century  by the way. You needed to know that. The flying car which never got off the ground    it was a post war dream. My old man used to tell me we were going to get a flying car. This is pitched into the future from       looking at the day all American families have them.  There's Moscow  Shirley. Hope they speak Esperanto   Faux nostalgia  which I'm sort of    not  say  famous for  but I work an awful lot in it. It's the achingly sentimental yearning for times that never happened. Somebody once said that nostalgia is the one utterly most useless human emotion    so I think that s a case for serious play. This is emblematic of it    this is wing dining  recalling those balmy summer days somewhere over France in the   s  dining on the wing of a plane. You can't see it very well here  but that's Hemingway reading some pages from his new novel to Fitzgerald and Ford Madox Ford until the slipstream blows him away. This is tank polo in the South Hamptons. The brainless rich are more fun to make fun of than anybody. I do a lot of that. And authenticity is a major part of my serious nonsense. I think it adds a huge amount. Those  for example  are Mark IV British tanks from     . They had two machine guns and a cannon  and they had    horsepower Ricardo engines. They went five miles an hour and inside it was     degrees in the pitch dark. And they had a canary hung inside the thing to make sure the Germans weren't going to use gas. Happy little story  isn't it  This is Motor Ritz Towers in Manhattan in the   s  where you drove up to your front door  if you had the guts. Anybody who was anybody had an apartment there. I managed to stick in both the zeppelin and an ocean liner out of sheer enthusiasm. And I love cigars    there's a cigar billboard down there. And faux nostalgia works even in serious subjects like war. This is those wonderful days of the Battle of Britain in       when a Messerschmitt ME    bursts into the House of Commons and buzzes around  just to piss off Churchill  who's down there somewhere. It's a fond memory of times past. Hyperbolic overkill is a way of taking exaggeration to the absolute ultimate limit  just for the fun of it. This was a piece I did    a brochure again     RMS Tyrannic  The Biggest Thing in All the World.  The copy  which you can't see because it goes on and on for several pages  says that steerage passengers can't get their to bunks before the voyage is over  and it's so safe it carries no insurance. It's obviously modeled on the Titanic. But it's not a cri de coeur about man's hubris in the face of the elements. It's just a sick  silly joke. Shamelessly cheap is something  I think    this will wake you up. It has no meaning  just    Desoto discovers the Mississippi  and it's a Desoto discovering the Mississippi. I did that as a quick back page    I had like four hours to do a back page for an issue of the Lampoon  and I did that  and I thought   Well  I'm ashamed. I hope nobody knows it.  People wrote in for reprints of that thing. Urban absurdism    that's what the New Yorker really calls for. I try to make life in New York look even weirder than it is with those covers. I've done about    of them  and I'd say    of them are based on that concept. I was driving down  th Avenue one night at   a.m.  and this steam pouring out of the street  and I thought   What causes that   And that    who s to say  The Temple of Dendur at the Metropolitan in New York    it's a very somber place. I thought I could jazz it up a bit  have a little fun with it. This is a very un PC cover. Not in New York. I couldn't resist  and I got a nasty email from some environmental group saying   This is too serious and solemn to make fun of. You should be ashamed  please apologize on our website.  Haven't got around to it yet but    I may. This is the word side of my brain. I love the word  Eurotrash.  That's all the Eurotrash coming through JFK customs. This was the New York bike messenger meeting the Tour de France. If you live in New York  you know how the bike messengers move. Except that he's carrying a tube for blueprints and stuff    they all do    and a lot of people thought that meant it was a terrorist about to shoot rockets at the Tour de France    sign of our times  I guess. This is the only fashion cover I've ever done. It's the little old lady that lives in a shoe  and then this thing    the title of that was   There Goes the Neighborhood.  I don't know a hell of a lot about fashion    I was told to do what they call a Mary Jane  and then I got into this terrible fight between the art director and the editor saying   Put a strap on it      No  don't put a strap on it      Put a strap on it     Don't put a strap on it     because it obscures the logo and looks terrible and it's bad and    I finally chickened out and did it for the sake of the authenticity of the shoe. This is a tiny joke    E ZR pass. One letter makes an idea. This is a big joke. This is the audition for  King Kong.  People always ask me  where do you get your ideas  how do your ideas come  Truth about that one is I had a horrible red wine hangover  in the middle of the night  this came to me like a Xerox    all I had to do was write it down. It was perfectly clear. I didn't do any thinking about it. And then when it ran  a lovely lady  an old lady named Mrs. Edgar Rosenberg    if you know that name    called me and said she loved the cover  it was so sweet. Her former name was Fay Wray  and so that was    I didn't have the wit to say   Take the painting.  Finally  this was a three page cover  never done before  and I don't think it will ever be done again    successive pages in the front of the magazine. It's the ascent of man using an escalator  and it's in three parts. You can't see it all together  unfortunately  but if you look at it enough  you can sort of start to see how it actually starts to move. Pretty elegant. Nothing like a crash to end a joke. That completes my oeuvre. I would just like to add a crass commercial    I have a kids' book coming out in the fall called  Marvel Sandwiches   a compendium of all the serious play that ever was  and it s going to be available in fine bookstores  crummy bookstores  tables on the street in October. So thank you very much. Some    years ago  I became allergic to Delhi's air. My doctors told me that my lung capacity had gone down to    percent  and it was killing me. With the help of IIT  TERI  and learnings from NASA  we discovered that there are three basic green plants  common green plants  with which we can grow all the fresh air we need indoors to keep us healthy. We've also found that you can reduce the fresh air requirements into the building  while maintaining industry indoor air quality standards. The three plants are Areca palm  Mother in Law's Tongue and money plant. The botanical names are in front of you. Areca palm is a plant which removes CO  and converts it into oxygen. We need four shoulder high plants per person  and in terms of plant care  we need to wipe the leaves every day in Delhi  and perhaps once a week in cleaner air cities. We had to grow them in vermi manure  which is sterile  or hydroponics  and take them outdoors every three to four months. The second plant is Mother in law's Tongue  which is again a very common plant  and we call it a bedroom plant  because it converts CO  into oxygen at night. And we need six to eight waist high plants per person. The third plant is money plant  and this is again a very common plant  preferably grows in hydroponics. And this particular plant removes formaldehydes and other volatile chemicals. With these three plants  you can grow all the fresh air you need. In fact  you could be in a bottle with a cap on top  and you would not die at all  and you would not need any fresh air. We have tried these plants at our own building in Delhi  which is a        square feet     year old building. And it has close to       such plants for     occupants. Our studies have found that there is a    percent probability of one's blood oxygen going up by one percent if one stays indoors in this building for    hours. The government of India has discovered or published a study to show that this is the healthiest building in New Delhi. And the study showed that  compared to other buildings  there is a reduced incidence of eye irritation by    percent  respiratory systems by    percent  headaches by    percent  lung impairment by    percent and asthma by nine percent. And this study has been published on September          and it's available on the government of India website. Our experience points to an amazing increase in human productivity by over    percent by using these plants. And also a reduction in energy requirements in buildings by an outstanding    percent  because you need less fresh air. We are now replicating this in a  .   million square feet building  which will have        indoor plants. Why is this important  It is also important for the environment  because the world's energy requirements are expected to grow by    percent in the next decade.    percent of the world's energy is taken up by buildings currently  and    percent of the world's population will be living in buildings in cities with a population of over one million in the next    years. And there is a growing preference for living and working in air conditioned places.  Be the change you want to see in the world   said Mahatma Gandhi. And thank you for listening. If you're at all like me  this is what you do with the sunny summer weekends in San Francisco  you build experimental kite powered hydrofoils capable of more than    knots. And you realize that there is incredible power in the wind  and it can do amazing things. And one day  a vessel not unlike this will probably break the world speed record. But kites aren't just toys like this. Kites  I'm going to give you a brief history  and tell you about the magnificent future of every child's favorite plaything. So  kites are more than a thousand years old  and the Chinese used them for military applications  and even for lifting men. So they knew at that stage they could carry large weights. I'm not sure why there is a hole in this particular man. In       a fellow called George Pocock actually pioneered the use of kites for towing buggies in races against horse carriages across the English countryside. Then of course  at the dawn of aviation  all of the great inventors of the time    like Hargreaves  like Langley  even Alexander Graham Bell  inventor of the telephone  who was flying this kite    were doing so in the pursuit of aviation. Then these two fellows came along  and they were flying kites to develop the control systems that would ultimately enable powered human flight. So this is of course Orville and Wilbur Wright  and the Wright Flyer. And their experiments with kites led to this momentous occasion  where we powered up and took off for the first ever    second human flight. And that was fantastic for the future of commercial aviation. But unfortunately  it relegated kites once again to be considered children's toys. That was until the     s  where we had the last energy crisis. And a fabulous man called Miles Loyd who lives on the outskirts of San Francisco  wrote this seminal paper that was completely ignored in the Journal of Energy about how to use basically an airplane on a piece of string to generate enormous amounts of electricity. The real key observation he made is that a free flying wing can sweep through more sky and generate more power in a unit of time than a fixed wing turbine. So turbines grew. And they can now span up to three hundred feet at the hub height  but they can't really go a lot higher  and more height is where the more wind is  and more power    as much as twice as much. So cut to now. We still have an energy crisis  and now we have a climate crisis as well. You know  so humans generate about    trillion watts  or    terawatts  from fossil fuels. And Al Gore has spoken to why we need to hit one of these targets  and in reality what that means is in the next    to    years  we have to make    trillion watts or more of new clean energy somehow. Wind is the second largest renewable resource after solar       terawatts  more than enough to supply humanity     times over. The majority of it is in the higher altitudes  above     feet  where we don't have a technology as yet to get there. So this is the dawn of the new age of kites. This is our test site on Maui  flying across the sky. I'm now going to show you the first autonomous generation of power by every child's favorite plaything. As you can tell  you need to be a robot to fly this thing for thousands of hours. It makes you a little nauseous. And here we're actually generating about    kilowatts    so  enough to power probably five United States households    with a kite not much larger than this piano. And the real significant thing here is we're developing the control systems  as did the Wright brothers  that would enable sustained  long duration flight. And it doesn't hurt to do it in a location like this either. So this is the equivalent for a kite flier of peeing in the snow    that's tracing your name in the sky. And this is where we're actually going. So we're beyond the    second steps. And we're working towards megawatt scale machines that fly at      feet and generate tons of clean electricity. So you ask  how big are those machines  Well  this paper plane would be maybe a    oop  That would be enough to power your cell phone. Your Cessna would be     killowatts. If you'd loan me your Gulfstream  I'll rip its wings off and generate you a megawatt. If you give me a      I'll make six megawatts  which is more than the largest wind turbines today. And the Spruce Goose would be a    megawatt wing. So that is audacious  you say. I agree. But audacious is what has happened many times before in history. This is a refrigerator factory  churning out airplanes for World War II. Prior to World War II  they were making      planes a year. By       they were making        . With this factory and         planes a year  we could make all of America's electricity in about    years. So really this is a story about the audacious plans of young people with these dreams. There are many of us. I am lucky enough to work with    of them. And I think we need to support all of the dreams of the kids out there doing these crazy things. Thank you. I've been working on issues of poverty for more than    years  and so it's ironic that the problem that and question that I most grapple with is how you actually define poverty. What does it mean  So often  we look at dollar terms    people making less than a dollar or two or three a day. And yet the complexity of poverty really has to look at income as only one variable. Because really  it's a condition about choice  and the lack of freedom. And I had an experience that really deepened and elucidated for me the understanding that I have. It was in Kenya  and I want to share it with you. I was with my friend Susan Meiselas  the photographer  in the Mathare Valley slums. Now  Mathare Valley is one of the oldest slums in Africa. It's about three miles out of Nairobi  and it's a mile long and about two tenths of a mile wide  where over half a million people live crammed in these little tin shacks  generation after generation  renting them  often eight or    people to a room. And it's known for prostitution  violence  drugs  a hard place to grow up. And when we were walking through the narrow alleys  it was literally impossible not to step in the raw sewage and the garbage alongside the little homes. But at the same time it was also impossible not to see the human vitality  the aspiration and the ambition of the people who live there  women washing their babies  washing their clothes  hanging them out to dry. I met this woman  Mama Rose  who has rented that little tin shack for    years  where she lives with her seven children. Four sleep in one twin bed  and three sleep on the mud and linoleum floor. And she keeps them all in school by selling water from that kiosk  and from selling soap and bread from the little store inside. It was also the day after the inauguration  and I was reminded how Mathare is still connected to the globe. And I would see kids on the street corners  and they'd say  Obama  he's our brother   And I'd say  Well  Obama's my brother  so that makes you my brother too.  And they would look quizzically  and then be like   High five   And it was here that I met Jane. I was struck immediately by the kindness and the gentleness in her face  and I asked her to tell me her story. She started off by telling me her dream. She said   I had two. My first dream was to be a doctor  and the second was to marry a good man who would stay with me and my family  because my mother was a single mom  and couldn't afford to pay for school fees. So I had to give up the first dream  and I focused on the second.  She got married when she was     had a baby right away. And when she turned     found herself pregnant with a second child  her mom died and her husband left her    married another woman. So she was again in Mathare  with no income  no skill set  no money. And so she ultimately turned to prostitution. It wasn't organized in the way we often think of it. She would go into the city at night with about    girls  look for work  and sometimes come back with a few shillings  or sometimes with nothing. And she said   You know  the poverty wasn't so bad. It was the humiliation and the embarrassment of it all.  In       her life changed. She had a girlfriend who had heard about this organization  Jamii Bora  that would lend money to people no matter how poor you were  as long as you provided a commensurate amount in savings. And so she spent a year to save    dollars  and started borrowing  and over time she was able to buy a sewing machine. She started tailoring. And that turned into what she does now  which is to go into the secondhand clothing markets  and for about three dollars and    cents she buys an old ball gown. Some of them might be ones you gave. And she repurposes them with frills and ribbons  and makes these frothy confections that she sells to women for their daughter's Sweet    or first Holy Communion    those milestones in a life that people want to celebrate all along the economic spectrum. And she does really good business. In fact  I watched her walk through the streets hawking. And before you knew it  there was a crowd of women around her  buying these dresses. And I reflected  as I was watching her sell the dresses  and also the jewelry that she makes  that now Jane makes more than four dollars a day. And by many definitions she is no longer poor. But she still lives in Mathare Valley. And so she can't move out. She lives with all of that insecurity  and in fact  in January  during the ethnic riots  she was chased from her home and had to find a new shack in which she would live. Jamii Bora understands that and understands that when we're talking about poverty  we've got to look at people all along the economic spectrum. And so with patient capital from Acumen and other organizations  loans and investments that will go the long term with them  they built a low cost housing development  about an hour outside Nairobi central. And they designed it from the perspective of customers like Jane herself  insisting on responsibility and accountability. So she has to give    percent of the mortgage    of the total value  or about     dollars in savings. And then they match her mortgage to what she paid in rent for her little shanty. And in the next couple of weeks  she's going to be among the first     families to move into this development. When I asked her if she feared anything  or whether she would miss anything from Mathare  she said   What would I fear that I haven't confronted already  I'm HIV positive. I've dealt with it all.  And she said   What would I miss  You think I will miss the violence or the drugs  The lack of privacy  Do you think I'll miss not knowing if my children are going to come home at the end of the day   She said  If you gave me    minutes my bags would be packed.  I said   Well what about your dreams   And she said   Well  you know  my dreams don't look exactly like I thought they would when I was a little girl. But if I think about it  I thought I wanted a husband  but what I really wanted was a family that was loving. And I fiercely love my children  and they love me back.  She said   I thought that I wanted to be a doctor  but what I really wanted to be was somebody who served and healed and cured. And so I feel so blessed with everything that I have  that two days a week I go and I counsel HIV patients. And I say  'Look at me. You are not dead. You are still alive. And if you are still alive you have to serve.'  And she said   I'm not a doctor who gives out pills. But maybe me  I give out something better because I give them hope.  And in the middle of this economic crisis  where so many of us are inclined to pull in with fear  I think we're well suited to take a cue from Jane and reach out  recognizing that being poor doesn't mean being ordinary. Because when systems are broken  like the ones that we're seeing around the world  it's an opportunity for invention and for innovation. It's an opportunity to truly build a world where we can extend services and products to all human beings  so that they can make decisions and choices for themselves. I truly believe it's where dignity starts. We owe it to the Janes of the world. And just as important  we owe it to ourselves. Thank you. I'm the weekly tech critic for the New York Times. I review gadgets and stuff. And mostly what good dads should be doing this time of year is nestling with their kids and decorating the Christmas tree. What I'm mostly doing this year is going on cable TV and answering the same question   What are the tech trends for next year   And I'm like   Didn't we just go through this last year   But I'm going to pick the one that interests me most  and that is the completed marriage of the cell phone and the Internet. You know  I found that volcano on Google Images  not realizing how much it makes me look like the cover of Dianetics. Anyway  this all started a few years ago  when they started carrying your voice over the Internet rather than over a phone line  and we've come a long way since that. But that was interesting in itself. This is companies like Vonage. Basically you take an ordinary telephone  you plug it into this little box that they give you and the box plugs into your cable modem. Now  it works just like a regular phone. So you can pick up the phone  you hear a dial tone  but its just a fake out. It's a WAV file of a dial tone  just to reassure you that the world hasn't ended. It could be anything. It could be salsa music or a comedy routine    it doesn't matter. The little box has your phone number. So that's really cool    you can take it to London or Siberia  and your next door neighbor can dial your home number and your phone will ring  because it's got everything in the box. They've got every feature known to man in there  because adding a new feature is just software. And as a result of Voice Over IP    I hate that term    Voice Over Internet    land line home phone service has gone down    percent in the last three years. I mean  no self respecting college kid has home phone service anymore. This is what college kids are more likely to have. It's the most popular VOIP service in the world  It's Skype. It's a free program you download for your Mac or PC  and you make free phone calls anywhere in the world The downside is that you have to wear a headset like a nerd. It's not your phone    it's your computer. But nonetheless  if you're a college kid and you have no money  believe me  this is better than trying to use your cell phone. It's really cute seeing middle aged people like me  try out Skype for the first time  which is usually when their kid goes away for a semester abroad. They don't want to pay the international fees  so they're like   Timmy  Is that you   It's really cute. But I    at least it was when I did it    I think where VOIP is really going to get interesting is when they start putting it on cell phones. Imagine if you had an ordinary cell phone  and any time you were in a wireless hotspot    free calls anywhere in the world  never pay the cellular company a nickel. It'd be really  really cool    and yet  even though the technology for this has been available for five years  incredibly  the number of standard cell phones offered by US carriers with free VOIP is zero  I can't figure out why  Actually  I need to update that. There's one now. And it's so interesting that I thought I would tell you about it. It comes from T Mobile. And I am not paid by T Mobile. I'm not plugging T Mobile. The New York Times has very rigid policies about that. Ever since that Jayson Blair jerk ruined it for all of us. Basically  the reason you haven't heard about this program is because it was introduced last year on June   . Does anyone remember what else happened on June    last year  It was the iPhone. The iPhone came out that day. I'm like  can you imagine being the T Mobile PR lady  You know   Hi  we have an announcement to    WAH     But it's actually really  really cool. You have a choice of phones  and we're not talking smartphones    ordinary phones  including a Blackberry  that have Wi Fi. The deal is  any time you're in a Wi Fi hotspot  all your calls are free. And when you're out of the hotspot  you're on the regular cellular network. You're thinking   Well  how often am I in a hotspot   The answer is   All the time   Because they give you a regular wireless router that works with the phone  for your house. Which is really ingenious  because we all know that T Mobile is the most pathetic carrier. They have coverage like the size of my thumbnail. But it's a hundred million dollars to put up one of those towers. Right  They don't have that kind of money. Instead they give each of us a seven dollar and    cent box. They're like a stealth tower installation program. We're putting it in our homes for them  Anyway  they have Wi Fi phones in Europe. But the thing that T Mobile did that nobody's done before is  when you're on a call an you move from Wi Fi into cellular range  the call is handed off in mid syllable  seamlessly. I'll show you the advanced technologies we use at the New York Times to test this gear. This is me with a camcorder on a phone going like this. As I walk out of the house from my Wi Fi hotspot into the cellular network on a call with my wife    look at the upper left. That's the Wi Fi signal. David Pogue  Hi babes  it's me. JP  Oh  hi darling  how are you  DP  You're on Wi Fi. How does it sound  JP  Oh  it sounds pretty good. Now  I'm leaving the house. DP  I'm going for a walk    do you mind  JP  No not at all. I'm having a great day with the kids. DP  What are you guys doing  Right there  It just changed to the cellular tower in mid call. I don't know why my wife says I never listen to her. I don't get that. The bottom line is that the boundaries  because of the Internet plus cell phone  are melting. The cool thing about the T Mobile phones is that although switching technologies is very advanced  the billing technology has not caught up. So what I mean is that you can start a call in your house in the Wi Fi hotspot  you can get in your car and talk until the battery's dead    which would be like    minutes    And the call will continue to be free. Because they don't  they haven't    well  no  wait  Not so fast. It also works the other way. So if you start a call on your cellular network and you come home  you keep being billed. Which is why most people with this service get into the habit of saying   Hey  I just got home. Can I call you right back   Now you get it. It's also true that if you use one of these phones overseas  it doesn't know what Internet hotspot you're in. On the Internet nobody knows you're a dog  right  Nobody knows you're in Pakistan. You can make free unlimited calls home to the US with these phones. So  very  very interesting. This is another favorite of mine. Does anyone here have a working cell phone that's on  with coverage  who can make a call right now without a lot of fussing  OK. Would you call me please right now   Phone number given.  And don't you all call me at three a.m. asking me to fix your printer. I have two cell phones  so this going to be very odd  if it works. I should know not to do technology demos in front of an audience. It's just  like  absurd. This one is going off. And    oh  I have the ringer off. Tsh  Great. Anyway  this one is also going off. So they're both ringing at the same time. Excuse me one second. Hello  Oh. Where are you calling from  No  no just kidding. There he is. Thank you very much for doing that. I didn't even know it was you    I was looking at this guy. Oh great  Yeah. Yeah you can all stop calling now  All right  We've made the point. All right. Ringer off. Everyone wants in on the action. So this is Grand Central at work    it's a    oh  for gods sake  I have your numbers now  You will pay. Grand Central is this really brilliant idea where they give you a new phone number  and then at that point one phone number rings all your phones at once. Your home phone  your work phone  your cell phone  your yacht phone The beauty of that is you never miss a call. I know a lot of you are like   Ooh  I don't want to be reached at any hour.  But the beauty is it's all going through the internet  so you get all of these really cool features    like you can say  I want these people to be able to call me only during these hours. And I want these people to hear this greeting   Hi boss  I'm out making us both some money. Leave a message.  And then your wife calls  and   Hi honey  leave me a message.  Very  very customizable. Google bought it  and they've been working on it for a year. They're supposed to come out with it very shortly in a public method. By the way  this is something that really bothers me. I don't know if you realize this. When you call     on your cell phone  they charge you two bucks. Did you know that  It's an outrage. I actually got a photograph of the Verizon employee right there. I'm going to tell you how to avoid that now. What you're going to use is Google Cellular. It's totally free    there's not even ads. If you know how to send a text message  you can get the same information for free. I'm about to change your life. So here's me doing it. You send a text message to the word  Google   which turns out to be      . Leave off the last  e  for savings. Anyway  so lets say you need a drugstore near Chicago. You type  pharmacy Chicago   or the zip code. You hit send  and in five seconds  they will send you back the two closest drugstores  complete with name address and phone number. Here it comes. And it's already written down    so  like  if you're driving  you don't have to do one of these things   Uh huh  uh huh  uh huh.  It works with weather  too. You can say  Weather   and the name of the city you're going to travel to. And then in five seconds  they send you back the complete weather forecast for that town. Shortly I'll tell you why I was in Milan. Here we go. And those are just the beginning. These are all the different things that you can text to Google and they will    yeah  You're all trying to write this down. That's cute. I do have an email address. You can just ask me. It's absolutely phenomenal. The only downside is that it requires you to know how to text    send a text message. Nobody over    knows how to do that. So I'm going to teach you something even better. This is called Google Info. They've just launched this voice activated version of the same thing. It's speech recognition like you've never heard before. So lets say I'm in Monterey  and I want what  I want to find what  Bagels. OK. Google  Say the business and the city and state. DP  Bagels  Monterey  California. I got the Chinese line. Google  Bagels  Monterey  California. Top eight results  Number one  Bagel Bakery on El Dorado Street. To select number one  you can press one or say  number one.  Number two  Bagel Bakery  commissary department. Number Two. Number Two. Two. Why do I listen to people in the audience  Well anyway    oh  Here we go  Google  ... commissary department on McClellan Avenue  Monterey. I'll connect you  or say  details   or  go back.  DP  He's connecting me  He doesn't even tell me the phone number. He's just connecting me directly. It's like having a personal valet. Google  Hold on. DP  Hi  could I have     with a schmear  No  no  no    just kidding  no no. So anyway  you never even find out the number. It's just so amazing. And it has incredible  incredible accuracy. This is even more amazing. Put this in your speed dial. This you can ask by voice any question. Who won the      World Series  What's the recipe for a certain cocktail  It's absolutely amazing    and they text you back the answer. I tried this this morning just to make sure it's still alive.  Which actors have played James Bond   They text me back this   Sean Connery  George Lazenby  Roger Moore  Timothy Dalton  Pierce Brosnan  Daniel Craig.  Right  And then I was trying to pretend I was like a Valley girl. I'm like   What's the word that means you know  like  when the sun  the moon and the earth are  like  all in a line   Just to see how the recognition was. They texted me back   It's called a syzygy.  Which I knew  because it's the word that won me the Ohio spelling bee in     . You know  there's a lot of people wondering   How on earth are they going to make money doing this   And the answer is  look at the last line. They put this teeny weeny little ad  about    characters long. And a lot of people also want to know   How does it work  How can it be so good  It's as though there is a human being on the other end of the line.  Because there is one  They have        people who are being paid    cents per answer. As you can imagine  it's college kids and old people. That's who can afford to do that. But it's a human being on the line. And it's gotten me out of so many tough positions like   When's the last flight out of Chicago   You know. It's just absolutely amazing. Another thing that really bothers me about cell phones today    this is probably my biggest pet peeve in all of technology. When I call to leave you a message  I get    seconds of instructions from a third grade teacher on Ambien   To page this person ...   Page  What is this        Nobody has pagers anymore.  You may begin speaking at the tone. When you have finished recording  you may hang up.  No  And then it gets worse  when I call to retrieve my messages  first of all   You have    messages. To listen to your messages ...   Why else am I calling  Of course I want to listen to the messages  Oh  You all have cell phones too. So last year I went to Milan  Italy  and I got to speak to an audience of cellular executives from     countries around the world. And I said as a joke    as a joke  I said   I did the math. Verizon has    million customers. If you check your voicemail twice a day  that's     million dollars a year. I bet you guys are doing this just to run up our airtime  aren't you   No chuckle. They're like this    Where is the outrage  people  Rise up  Sorry. I'm not bitter. So now I'm going to tell you how to get out of that. There are these services that transcribe your voicemail into text. And they send it either to your email or as text messages to your phone. It is a life changer. And by the way  they don't always get the words right  because it's over the phone and all that. So they attach the audio file at the bottom of the email so you can listen to double check. The services are called things like Spinvox  Phonetag    this is the one I use    Callwave. A lot of people say   How are they doing this  I don't really want people listening in to my calls.  The executives at these companies told me   Well we use a proprietary B to B  best of breed  peer to peer soluti      you know. I think basically it's like these guys in India with headsets  you know  listening in. The reason I think that is that on the first day I tried one of these services  I got two voicemail messages. One was from a guy named Michael Stevenson  which shouldn't be that hard to transcribe  and it was misspelled. The other was from my video producer at the Times  whose name is Vijaiy Singh  with the silent 'h'. Nailed that one. So you be the judge. Anyway  this service  Callwave  promises that it's all software    nobody is listening to your messages. And they also promise that they're going to transcribe only the gist of your messages. So I thought I'd see how that goes. This is me testing it out. Hope you're doing well. I'm fine here. Everything's good. Hey  I was walking along the street and the sky was blue. And your daughter broke her leg at soccer practice. I'm going to have a sandwich for lunch. She's in room    emergency room   W. OK  talk to you later    bye. I love my job. So a couple minutes later  this I got by email. It's a very good transcription. But a couple minutes after that  I got the text message version. Now remember  a text message can only be     characters long. So it had better be the gist of the gist  right  I'm not kidding you. The message said   Was walking along the street  and  sky was blue  and  emergency   What the f      Well I guess that was the gist. And lastly  I just have to talk about this one. This is my favorite of all time. It's called Popularitydialer.com. Basically  you're going to go on some iffy date  or a potentially bad meeting. So you go and you type in your phone number  and at the exact minute where you want to be called    And at that moment your phone will ring. And you're like   I'm sorry. I've got to take this.  The really beautiful thing is  you know how when somebody's sitting next to you  sometimes they can sort of hear a little bit of the caller. So they give you a choice of what you want to hear on the other end. Here's the girlfriend. Phone  Hey you  what's going on  DP  I'm kinda  like  giving a talk right now. Phone  Well  that's good. DP  What are you doing  Phone  I was just wondering what you were up to. DP  Right  I can't really talk right now. This is the    I love this    the boss call. Phone  Hey  this is Mr. Johnson calling from the office. DP  Oh  hi  sir. Phone  Did you complete that thing about a month ago  That photocopier training  DP  Oh    sorry I forgot. Phone  Yeah  well so when was the last time you used the photocopier  DP  It was like three weeks ago. Phone  Well  I don't know if you heard  you might have heard from Lenny  but    I think the biggest change when Internet met phone was with the iPhone. Not my finest moment in New York Times journalism. It was when in the fall of       I explained why Apple would never do a cell phone. I looked like a moron. However  my logic was good  because    I don't know if you realize this  but    until the iPhone came along  the carriers    Verizon  AT T  Cingular    held veto power over every aspect of every design of every phone. I know the people who worked on the Treo. They went around to these carriers and said   Look at these cool features.  And Verizon is like   Hmm  no. I don't think so.  It was not very conducive to innovation. What I didn't anticipate was that Steve Jobs went around and said   Tell you what    I'll give you a five year exclusive if you'll let me design this phone in peace    and you won't even see it till it's done.  Actually  even so  he was turned down by Verizon and others. Finally Cingular said OK. I'm going to talk about the effect of the iPhone. Please don't corner me at the party tonight and go   What are you  An Apple fan boy     you know. I'm not. You can see what I said about it. It's a flawed masterpiece. It's got bad things and good things. Lets all acknowledge that right now. But it did change a few things. The first thing it changed was that all those carriers saw that they sold    million of these things in a year. And they said   Oh my gosh  maybe we've been doing it wrong. Maybe we should let phone designers design the phones.  Another thing was that it let    million people  for the first time  experience being online all the time. Not using these    dollar a month cellular cards for their laptops. I don't understand why we're not there yet. When I'm an old man  I'm going to tell my grandchildren   When I was your age  if I wanted to check my email  I used to drive around town looking for a coffee shop. I did    We had wireless base stations that could broadcast    yay  about     feet across.  It's absurd. We have power outlets in every room of every building. We have running water. What's the problem  Anyway    but this teaches people what it's like. You have to go to YouTube and type in  iPhone Shuffle.  This guy did a mock video of one that's one inch square  like the real iPod Shuffle. It's like   It only has one button. Touch it and it dials a number at random.   Who the hell is this   But the other thing it did is it opened up this idea of an app store. It downloads right to the phone. And you can use the tilt sensor to steer this car using this game. These programs can use all the components of the iPhone    the touch screen. This is the Etch A Sketch program    the theme of EG     . You know how you erase it  Of course. You shake it. Right  of course. We shake it to erase  like this. They have        of these programs. This is the translator program. They have every language in the world. You type in what you want  and it gives you the translation. This is amazing. This is Midomi. A song is running through your head    you sing it into the thing  do do do do do  da da da da da da  da dum ... OK  you tap   Done  and it will find out the song and play it for you. I know. It's insane  right  This is Pandora. Free Internet radio. Not just free Internet radio    you type in a band or a song name. It will immediately play you that song or that band. It has a thumbs up and a thumbs down. You say if you like this song or not. If you like it  it tries another song on you from a different band  with the same instrumentation  vocals  theme and tempo. If you like that one  or don't like it  you do thumbs up and thumbs down. Over time it tailors the songs so that it completely stops playing bad songs. It eventually only plays songs you like. This is Urbanspoon. You're in a city. It knows from GPS where you're standing. You want to find a place to eat. You shake it. It proposes a restaurant. It gives you the price  and the location and ratings. Video  I'm not going all the way to Flushing. Anyway  just amazing  amazing things. Of course  its not just about the iPhone. The iPhone broke the dyke  the wall. But now it's everybody else. So Google has done their own Android operating system that will soon be on handsets    phones from    companies. Touch screen    very  very nice. Also with its own app store  where you can download programs. This is amazing. In the wake of all this  Verizon  the most calcified  corporate  conservative carrier of all  said   You can use any phone you want on our network.  I love the Wired headline  Pigs Fly  Hell Freezes Over and Verizon Opens Up Its Network    No. Really. So everything is changing. We've entered a new world of innovation  where the cell phone becomes your laptop  customized the way you want it. Every cell phone is unique. There is software that you can add on. Can I do one more one minute song  Thank you. Just to round it up    this is the new Apple Power Music Stand. It's only three pounds  or    if you install Microsoft Office. Sorry  that was mean. This is a song I did for the New York Times website as a music video. Ladies and gentlemen  for seven blissful hours it was the number one video on YouTube. And now the end is near. I'm sick to death of this old cell phone. Bad sound  the signal's weak  the software stinks. A made in Hell phone. I've heard there's something new    a million times more rad than my phone. I too will join the cult. I want an iPhone. Concerns    I have a few. It's got some flaws  we may just face it. No keys  no memory card  the battery's sealed    you can't replace it. But God  this thing is sweet. A multitouch  iPod  Wi Fi phone. You had me from   Hello.  I want an iPhone. I want to touch its precious screen. I want to wipe the smudges clean. I want my friends to look and drool. I want to say   Look    now I'm cool  I stood in line and I'll get mine. I want an iPhone. For what is a man  What has he got  If not iPhone  then he's got squat. It's all the things a phone should be. Who cares if it's AT T  I took a stand  paid half a grand  And I got an iPhone  Thank you. Thank you very much. I coined my own definition of success in       when I was teaching at a high school in South Bend  Indiana  being a little bit disappointed  and  disillusioned  perhaps  by the way parents of the youngsters in my English classes expected their youngsters to get an A or a B. They thought a C was all right for the neighbors' children  because they were all average. But they weren't satisfied when their own    it would make the teacher feel that they had failed  or the youngster had failed. And that's not right. The good Lord in his infinite wisdom didn't create us all equal as far as intelligence is concerned  any more than we're equal for size  appearance. Not everybody could earn an A or a B  and I didn't like that way of judging  and I did know how the alumni of various schools back in the '  s judged coaches and athletic teams. If you won them all  you were considered to be reasonably successful    not completely. Because I found out    we had a number of years at UCLA where we didn't lose a game. But it seemed that we didn't win each individual game by the margin that some of our alumni had predicted    And quite frequently I really felt that they had backed up their predictions in a more materialistic manner. But that was true back in the   s  so I understood that. But I didn't like it  I didn't agree with it. I wanted to come up with something I hoped could make me a better teacher  and give the youngsters under my supervision  be it in athletics or the English classroom  something to which to aspire  other than just a higher mark in the classroom  or more points in some athletic contest. I thought about that for quite a spell  and I wanted to come up with my own definition. I thought that might help. And I knew how Mr. Webster defined it  as the accumulation of material possessions or the attainment of a position of power or prestige  or something of that sort  worthy accomplishments perhaps  but in my opinion  not necessarily indicative of success. So I wanted to come up with something of my own. And I recalled    I was raised on a small farm in Southern Indiana  and Dad tried to teach me and my brothers that you should never try to be better than someone else. I'm sure at the time he did that  I didn't    it didn't    well  somewhere  I guess in the hidden recesses of the mind  it popped out years later. Never try to be better than someone else  always learn from others. Never cease trying to be the best you can be    that's under your control. If you get too engrossed and involved and concerned in regard to the things over which you have no control  it will adversely affect the things over which you have control. Then I ran across this simple verse that said   At God's footstool to confess  a poor soul knelt  and bowed his head. 'I failed ' he cried. The Master said  'Thou didst thy best  that is success.'  From those things  and one other perhaps  I coined my own definition of success  which is  Peace of mind attained only through self satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to do the best of which you're capable. I believe that's true. If you make the effort to do the best of which you're capable  trying to improve the situation that exists for you  I think that's success  and I don't think others can judge that  it's like character and reputation    your reputation is what you're perceived to be  your character is what you really are. And I think that character is much more important than what you are perceived to be. You'd hope they'd both be good  but they won't necessarily be the same. Well  that was my idea that I was going to try to get across to the youngsters. I ran across other things. I love to teach  and it was mentioned by the previous speaker that I enjoy poetry  and I dabble in it a bit  and love it. There are some things that helped me  I think  be better than I would have been. I know I'm not what I ought to be  what I should be  but I think I'm better than I would have been if I hadn't run across certain things. One was just a little verse that said   No written word  no spoken plea can teach our youth what they should be  nor all the books on all the shelves    it's what the teachers are themselves.  That made an impression on me in the     s. And I tried to use that more or less in my teaching  whether it be in sports  or whether it be in the English classroom. I love poetry and always had an interest in that somehow. Maybe it's because Dad used to read to us at night  by coal oil lamp    we didn't have electricity in our farm home. And Dad would read poetry to us. So I always liked it. And about the same time I ran across this one verse  I ran across another one. Someone asked a lady teacher why she taught  and after some time  she said she wanted to think about that. Then she came up and said   They ask me why I teach  and I reply  'Where could I find such splendid company ' There sits a statesman  strong  unbiased  wise  another Daniel Webster  silver tongued. A doctor sits beside him  whose quick  steady hand may mend a bone  or stem the life blood's flow. And there a builder  upward rise the arch of a church he builds  wherein that minister may speak the word of God  and lead a stumbling soul to touch the Christ. And all about  a gathering of teachers  farmers  merchants  laborers    those who work and vote and build and plan and pray into a great tomorrow. And I may say  I may not see the church  or hear the word  or eat the food their hands may grow  but yet again I may  And later I may say  I knew him once  and he was weak  or strong  or bold or proud or gay. I knew him once  but then he was a boy. They ask me why I teach and I reply  'Where could I find such splendid company '  And I believe the teaching profession    it's true  you have so many youngsters  and I've got to think of my youngsters at UCLA       some attorneys     dentists and doctors  many  many teachers and other professions. And that gives you a great deal of pleasure  to see them go on. I always tried to make the youngsters feel that they're there to get an education  number one  basketball was second  because it was paying their way  and they do need a little time for social activities  but you let social activities take a little precedence over the other two  and you're not going to have any very long. So that was the idea that I tried to get across to the youngsters under my supervision. I had three rules  pretty much  that I stuck with practically all the time. I'd learned these prior to coming to UCLA  and I decided they were very important. One was  Never be late.  Later on I said certain things    the players  if we were leaving for somewhere  had to be neat and clean. There was a time when I made them wear jackets and shirts and ties. Then I saw our chancellor coming to school in denims and turtlenecks  and thought  it's not right for me to keep this other  rule  so I let them just    they had to be neat and clean. I had one of my greatest players that you probably heard of  Bill Walton. He came to catch the bus  we were leaving for somewhere to play. And he wasn't clean and neat  so I wouldn't let him go. He couldn't get on the bus  he had to go home and get cleaned up to get to the airport. So I was a stickler for that. I believed in that. I believe in time  very important. I believe you should be on time  but I felt at practice  for example    we start on time  we close on time. The youngsters didn't have to feel that we were going to keep them over. When I speak at coaching clinics  I often tell young coaches    and at coaching clinics  more or less  they'll be the younger coaches getting in the profession. Most of them are young  you know  and probably newly married. And I tell them   Don't run practices late  because you'll go home in a bad mood  and that's not good  for a young married man to go home in a bad mood. When you get older  it doesn't make any difference  but     So I did believe  on time. I believe starting on time  and I believe closing on time. And another one I had was  not one word of profanity. One word of profanity  and you are out of here for the day. If I see it in a game  you're going to come out and sit on the bench. And the third one was  never criticize a teammate. I didn't want that. I used to tell them I was paid to do that. That's my job. I'm paid to do it. Pitifully poor  but I am paid to do it. Not like the coaches today  for gracious sakes  no. It's a little different than it was in my day. Those were three things that I stuck with pretty closely all the time. And those actually came from my dad. That's what he tried to teach me and my brothers at one time. I came up with a pyramid eventually  that I don't have the time to go on that. But that helped me  I think  become a better teacher. It's something like this  And I had blocks in the pyramid  and the cornerstones being industriousness and enthusiasm  working hard and enjoying what you're doing  coming up to the apex  according to my definition of success. And right at the top  faith and patience. And I say to you  in whatever you're doing  you must be patient. You have to have patience to    we want things to happen. We talk about our youth being impatient a lot  and they are. They want to change everything. They think all change is progress. And we get a little older    we sort of let things go. And we forget there is no progress without change. So you must have patience  and I believe that we must have faith. I believe that we must believe  truly believe. Not just give it word service  believe that things will work out as they should  providing we do what we should. I think our tendency is to hope things will turn out the way we want them to much of the time  but we don't do the things that are necessary to make those things become reality. I worked on this for some    years  and I think it helped me become a better teacher. But it all revolved around that original definition of success. You know  a number of years ago  there was a Major League Baseball umpire by the name of George Moriarty. He spelled Moriarty with only one 'i'. I'd never seen that before  but he did. Big league baseball players    they're very perceptive about those things  and they noticed he had only one 'i' in his name. You'd be surprised how many also told him that that was one more than he had in his head at various times. But he wrote something where I think he did what I tried to do in this pyramid. He called it  The Road Ahead  or the Road Behind.  He said   Sometimes I think the Fates must grin as we denounce them and insist the only reason we can't win  is the Fates themselves have missed. Yet there lives on the ancient claim  we win or lose within ourselves. The shining trophies on our shelves can never win tomorrow's game. You and I know deeper down  there's always a chance to win the crown. But when we fail to give our best  we simply haven't met the test  of giving all and saving none until the game is really won  of showing what is meant by grit  of playing through when others quit  of playing through  not letting up. It's bearing down that wins the cup. Of dreaming there's a goal ahead  of hoping when our dreams are dead  of praying when our hopes have fled  yet losing  not afraid to fall  if  bravely  we have given all. For who can ask more of a man than giving all within his span. Giving all  it seems to me  is not so far from victory. And so the Fates are seldom wrong  no matter how they twist and wind. It's you and I who make our fates    we open up or close the gates on the road ahead or the road behind.  Reminds me of another set of threes that my dad tried to get across to us  Don't whine. Don't complain. Don't make excuses. Just get out there  and whatever you're doing  do it to the best of your ability. And no one can do more than that. I tried to get across  too  that    my opponents will tell you    you never heard me mention winning. Never mention winning. My idea is that you can lose when you outscore somebody in a game  and you can win when you're outscored. I've felt that way on certain occasions  at various times. And I just wanted them to be able to hold their head up after a game. I used to say that when a game is over  and you see somebody that didn't know the outcome  I hope they couldn't tell by your actions whether you outscored an opponent or the opponent outscored you. That's what really matters  if you make an effort to do the best you can regularly  the results will be about what they should be. Not necessarily what you'd want them to be but they'll be about what they should  only you will know whether you can do that. And that's what I wanted from them more than anything else. And as time went by  and I learned more about other things  I think it worked a little better  as far as the results. But I wanted the score of a game to be the byproduct of these other things  and not the end itself. I believe it was one great philosopher who said    no  no    Cervantes. Cervantes said   The journey is better than the end.  And I like that. I think that it is    it's getting there. Sometimes when you get there  there's almost a let down. But it's the getting there that's the fun. As a basketball coach at UCLA  I liked our practices to be the journey  and the game would be the end  the end result. I liked to go up and sit in the stands and watch the players play  and see whether I'd done a decent job during the week. There again  it's getting the players to get that self satisfaction  in knowing that they'd made the effort to do the best of which they are capable. Sometimes I'm asked who was the best player I had  or the best teams. I can never answer that. As far as the individuals are concerned    I was asked one time about that  and they said   Suppose that you  in some way  could make the perfect player. What would you want   And I said   Well  I'd want one that knew why he was at UCLA  to get an education  he was a good student  really knew why he was there in the first place. But I'd want one that could play  too. I'd want one to realize that defense usually wins championships  and who would work hard on defense. But I'd want one who would play offense  too. I'd want him to be unselfish  and look for the pass first and not shoot all the time. And I'd want one that could pass and would pass. I've had some that could and wouldn't  and I've had some that would and could. So  yeah  I'd want that. And I wanted them to be able to shoot from the outside. I wanted them to be good inside too. I'd want them to be able to rebound well at both ends  too. Why not just take someone like Keith Wilkes and let it go at that. He had the qualifications. Not the only one  but he was one that I used in that particular category  because I think he made the effort to become the best. There was a couple. I mention in my book   They Call Me Coach   two players that gave me great satisfaction  that came as close as I think anyone I ever had to reach their full potential  one was Conrad Burke  and one was Doug McIntosh. When I saw them as freshmen  on our freshmen team    freshmen couldn't play varsity when I taught. I thought   Oh gracious  if these two players  either one of them     they were different years  but I thought about each one at the time he was there     Oh  if he ever makes the varsity  our varsity must be pretty miserable  if he's good enough to make it.  And you know  one of them was a starting player for a season and a half. The other one  his next year  played    minutes in a national championship game  Did a tremendous job for us. The next year  he was a starting player on the national championship team  and here I thought he'd never play a minute  when he was    so those are the things that give you great joy  and great satisfaction to see. Neither one of those youngsters could shoot very well. But they had outstanding shooting percentages  because they didn't force it. And neither one could jump very well  but they kept good position  and so they did well rebounding. They remembered that every shot that's taken  they assumed would be missed. I've had too many stand around and wait to see if it's missed  then they go and it's too late  somebody else is in there ahead of them. They weren't very quick  but they played good position  kept in good balance. And so they played pretty good defense for us. So they had qualities that    they came close to    as close to reaching possibly their full potential as any players I ever had. So I consider them to be as successful as Lewis Alcindor or Bill Walton  or many of the others that we had  there were some outstanding players. Have I rambled enough  I was told that when he makes his appearance  I was supposed to shut up. When most people think about the beginnings of AIDS  they're gonna think back to the     s. And certainly  this was the decade in which we discovered AIDS and the virus that causes it  HIV. But in fact this virus crossed over into humans many decades before  from chimpanzees  where the virus originated  into humans who hunt these apes. This photo was taken before the Great Depression in Brazzaville  Congo. At this time  there were thousands of individuals  we think  that were infected with HIV. So I have a couple of really important questions for you. If this virus was in thousands of individuals at this point  why was it the case that it took us until      to be able to discover this virus  OK now  more importantly  had we been there in the '  s and '  s  '  s  had we seen this disease  had we understood exactly what was going on with it  how might that have changed and completely transformed the nature of the way this pandemic moved  In fact  this is not unique to HIV. The vast majority of viruses come from animals. And you can kind of think of this as a pyramid of this bubbling up of viruses from animals into human populations. But only at the very top of this pyramid do these things become completely human. Nevertheless  we spend the vast majority of our energy focused on this level of the pyramid  trying to tackle things that are already completely adapted to human beings  that are going to be very very difficult to address    as we've seen in the case of HIV. So during the last    years  I've been working to actually study the earlier interface here    what I've labeled  viral chatter   which was a term coined by my mentor Don Burke. This is the idea that we can study the sort of pinging of these viruses into human populations  the movement of these agents over into humans  and by capturing this moment  we might be able to move to a situation where we can catch them early. OK  so this is a picture  and I'm going to show you some pictures now from the field. This is a picture of a central African hunter. It's actually a fairly common picture. One of the things I want you to note from it is blood    that you see a tremendous amount of blood contact. This was absolutely key for us. This is a very intimate form of connection. So if we're going to study viral chatter  we need to get to these populations who have intensive contact with wild animals. And so we've been studying people like this individual. We collect blood from them  other specimens. We look at the diseases  which are in the animals as well as the humans. And ideally  this is going to allow us to catch these things early on  as they're moving over into human populations. And the basic objective of this work is not to just go out once and look at these individuals  but to establish thousands of individuals in these populations that we would monitor continuously on a regular basis. When they were sick  we would collect specimens from them. We would actually enlist them    which we've done now    to collect specimens from animals. We give them these little pieces of filter paper. When they sample from animals  they collect the blood on the filter paper and this allows us to identify yet unknown viruses from exactly the right animals    the ones that are actually being hunted. two hunters stalk their prey. Their names are Patrice and Patee. They're searching for bush meat  forest animals they can kill to feed their families. Patrice and Patee set out most days to go out hunting in the forest around their homes. They have a series of traps  of snares that they've set up to catch wild pigs  snakes  monkeys  rodents    anything they can  really. Patrice and Patee have been out for hours but found nothing. The animals are simply gone. We stop for a drink of water. Then there is a rustle in the brush. A group of hunters approach  their packs loaded with wild game. There's at least three viruses that you know about  which are in this particular monkey. Nathan Wolfe  This species  yeah. And there's many many more pathogens that are present in these animals. These individuals are at specific risk  particularly if there's blood contact  they're at risk for transmission and possibly infection with novel viruses. Narrator  As the hunters display their kills  something surprising happens. They show us filter paper they've used to collect the animals' blood. The blood will be tested for zoonotic viruses  part of a program Dr. Wolfe has spent years setting up. NW  So this is from this animal right here  Greater Spot Nosed Guenon. Every person who has one of those filter papers has at least  at a minimum  been through our basic health education about the risks associated with these activities  which presumably  from our perspective  gives them the ability to decrease their own risk  and then obviously the risk to their families  the village  the country  and the world. NW  OK  before I continue  I think it's important to take just a moment to talk about bush meat. Bush meat is the hunting of wild game. OK  And you can consider all sorts of different bush meat. I'm going to be talking about this. When your children and grandchildren sort of pose questions to you about this period of time  one of the things they're gonna ask you  is how it was they we allowed some of our closest living relatives  some of the most valuable and endangered species on our planet  to go extinct because we weren't able to address some of the issues of poverty in these parts of the world. But in fact that's not the only question they're going to ask you about this. They're also going to ask you the question that when we knew that this was the way that HIV entered into the human population  and that other diseases had the potential to enter like this  why did we let these behaviors continue  Why did we not find some other solution to this  They're going to say  in regions of profound instability throughout the world  where you have intense poverty  where populations are growing and you don't have sustainable resources like this  this is going to lead to food insecurity. But they're also going to ask you probably a different question. It's one that I think we all need to ask ourselves  which is  why we thought the responsibility rested with this individual here. Now this is the individual    you can see just right up over his right shoulder    this is the individual that hunted the monkey from the last picture that I showed you. OK  take a look at his shirt. You know  take a look at his face. Bush meat is one of the central crises  which is occurring in our population right now  in humanity  on this planet. But it can't be the fault of somebody like this. OK  And solving it cannot be his responsibility alone. There's no easy solutions  but what I'm saying to you is that we neglect this problem at our own peril. So  in       along with my mentors Don Burke and Colonel Mpoudi Ngole  we went to actually start this work in Central Africa  to work with hunters in this part of the world. And my job    at that time I was a post doctoral fellow  and I was really tasked with setting this up. So I said to myself   OK  great    we're gonna collect all kinds of specimens. We're gonna go to all these different locations. It's going to be wonderful.  You know  I looked at the map  I picked out    sites  I figured  no problem. Needless to say  I was drastically wrong. This is challenging work to do. Fortunately  I had and continue to have an absolutely wonderful team of colleagues and collaborators in my own team  and that's the only way that this work can really occur. We have a whole range of challenges about this work. One of them is just obtaining trust from individuals that we work with in the field. The person you see on the right hand side is Paul DeLong Minutu. He's one of the best communicators that I've really ever dealt with. When I arrived I didn't speak a word of French  and I still seemed to understand what it was he was saying. Paul worked for years on the Cameroonian national radio and television  and he spoke about health issues. He was a health correspondent. So we figured we'd hire this person    when we got there he could be a great communicator. When we would get to these rural villages  though  what we found out is that no one had television  so they wouldn't recognize his face. But    when he began to speak they would actually recognize his voice from the radio. And this was somebody who had incredible potential to spread aspects of our message  whether it be with regards to wildlife conservation or health prevention. Often we run into obstacles. This is us coming back from one of these very rural sites  with specimens from     individuals that we needed to get back to the lab within    hours. I like to show this shot    this is Ubald Tamoufe  who's the lead investigator in our Cameroon site. Ubald laughs at me when I show this photo because of course you can't see his face. But the reason I like to show the shot is because you can see that he's about to solve this problem. Which    which he did  which he did. Just a few quick before and after shots. This was our laboratory before. This is what it looks like now. Early on  in order to ship our specimens  we had to have dry ice. To get dry ice we had to go to the breweries    beg  borrow  steal to get these folks to give it to us. Now we have our own liquid nitrogen. I like to call our laboratory the coldest place in Central Africa    it might be. And here's a shot of me  this is the before shot of me. No comment. So what happened  So during the    years that we've been doing this work  we actually surprised ourselves. We made a number of discoveries. And what we've found is that if you look in the right place  you can actually monitor the flow of these viruses into human populations. That gave us a tremendous amount of hope. What we've found is a whole range of new viruses in these individuals  including new viruses in the same group as HIV    so  brand new retroviruses. And let's face it  any new retrovirus in the human population    it's something we should be aware of. It's something we should be following. It's not something that we should be surprised by. Needless to say in the past these viruses entering into these rural communities might very well have gone extinct. That's no longer the case. Logging roads provide access to urban areas. And critically  what happens in central Africa doesn't stay in Central Africa. So  once we discovered that it was really possible that we could actually do this monitoring  we decided to move this from research  to really attempt to phase up to a global monitoring effort. Through generous support and partnership scientifically with Google.org and the Skoll Foundation  we were able to start the Global Viral Forecasting Initiative and begin work in four different sites in Africa and Asia. Needless to say  different populations from different parts of the world have different sorts of contact. So it's not just hunters in Central Africa. It's also working in live animal markets    these wet markets    which is exactly the place where SARS emerged in Asia. But really  this is just the beginning from our perspective. Our objective right now  in addition to deploying to these sites and getting everything moving  is to identify new partners because we feel like this effort needs to be extended to probably    or more sites throughout the world    to viral hotspots    because really the idea here is to cast an incredibly wide net so that we can catch these things  ideally  before they make it to blood banks  sexual networks  airplanes. And that's really our objective. There was a time not very long ago when the discovery of unknown organisms was something that held incredible awe for us. It had potential to really change the way that we saw ourselves  and thought about ourselves. Many people  I think  on our planet right now despair  and they think we've reached a point where we've discovered most of the things. I'm going tell you right now  please don't despair. If an intelligent extra terrestrial was taxed with writing the encyclopedia of life on our planet     out of    of these volumes would be devoted to bacteria and virus  with just a few of the volumes left for plants  fungus and animals  humans being a footnote  interesting footnote but a footnote nonetheless. This is honestly the most exciting period ever for the study of unknown life forms on our planet. The dominant things that exist here we know almost nothing about. And yet finally  we have the tools  which will allow us to actually explore that world and understand them. Thank you very much. I thought I would read poems I have that relate to the subject of youth and age. I was sort of astonished to find out how many I have actually. The first one is dedicated to Spencer  and his grandmother  who was shocked by his work. My poem is called  Dirt.  My grandmother is washing my mouth out with soap  half a long century gone and still she comes at me with that thick cruel yellow bar. All because of a word I said  not even said really  only repeated. But  Open   she says   open up   her hand clawing at my head. I know now her life was hard  she lost three children as babies  then her husband died too  leaving young sons  and no money. She'd stand me in the sink to pee because there was never room in the toilet. But oh  her soap  Might its bitter burning have been what made me a poet  The street she lived on was unpaved  her flat  two cramped rooms and a fetid kitchen where she stalked and caught me. Dare I admit that after she did it I never really loved her again  She lived to a hundred  even then. All along it was the sadness  the squalor  but I never  until now loved her again. When that was published in a magazine I got an irate letter from my uncle.  You have maligned a great woman.  It took some diplomacy. This is called  The Dress.  It's a longer poem. In those days  those days which exist for me only as the most elusive memory now  when often the first sound you'd hear in the morning would be a storm of birdsong  then the soft clop of the hooves of the horse hauling a milk wagon down your block  and the last sound at night as likely as not would be your father pulling up in his car  having worked late again  always late  and going heavily down to the cellar  to the furnace  to shake out the ashes and damp the draft before he came upstairs to fall into bed    in those long ago days  women  my mother  my friends' mothers  our neighbors  all the women I knew    wore  often much of the day  what were called housedresses  cheap  printed  pulpy  seemingly purposefully shapeless light cotton shifts that you wore over your nightgown and  when you had to go look for a child  hang wash on the line  or run down to the grocery store on the corner  under a coat  the twisted hem of the nightgown always lank and yellowed  dangling beneath. More than the curlers some of the women seemed constantly to have in their hair in preparation for some great event    a ball  one would think    that never came to pass  more than the way most women's faces not only were never made up during the day  but seemed scraped  bleached  and  with their plucked eyebrows  scarily masklike  more than all that it was those dresses that made women so unknowable and forbidding  adepts of enigmas to which men could have no access  and boys no conception. Only later would I see the dresses also as a proclamation  that in your dim kitchen  your laundry  your bleak concrete yard  what you revealed of yourself was a fabulation  your real sensual nature  veiled in those sexless vestments  was utterly your dominion. In those days  one hid much else as well  grown men didn't embrace one another  unless someone had died  and not always then  you shook hands or  at a ball game  thumped your friend's back and exchanged blows meant to be codes for affection  once out of childhood you'd never again know the shock of your father's whiskers on your cheek  not until mores at last had evolved  and you could hug another man  then hold on for a moment  then even kiss  your fathers bristles white and stiff now . What release finally  the embrace  though we were wary    it seemed so audacious    how much unspoken joy there was in that affirmation of equality and communion  no matter how much misunderstanding and pain had passed between you by then. We knew so little in those days  as little as now  I suppose about healing those hurts  even the women  in their best dresses  with beads and sequins sewn on the bodices  even in lipstick and mascara  their hair aflow  could only stand wringing their hands  begging for peace  while father and son  like thugs  like thieves  like Romans  simmered and hissed and hated  inflicting sorrows that endured  the worst anyway  through the kiss and embrace  bleeding from brother to brother  into the generations. In those days there was still countryside close to the city  farms  cornfields  cows  even not far from our building with its blurred brick and long shadowy hallway you could find tracts with hills and trees you could pretend were mountains and forests. Or you could go out by yourself even to a half block long empty lot  into the bushes  like a creature of leaves you'd lurk  crouched  crawling  simplified  savage  alone  already there was wanting to be simpler  wanting  when they called you  never to go back. This is another longish one  about the old and the young. It actually happened right at the time we met. Part of the poem takes place in space we shared and time we shared. It's called  The Neighbor.  Her five horrid  deformed little dogs who incessantly yap on the roof under my window. Her cats  God knows how many  who must piss on her rugs    her landing's a sickening reek. Her shadow once  fumbling the chain on her door  then the door slamming fearfully shut  only the barking and the music    jazz    filtering as it does  day and night into the hall. The time it was Chris Connor singing  Lush Life     how it brought back my college sweetheart  my first real love  who    till I left her    played the same record. And head on my shoulder  hand on my thigh  sang sweetly along  of regrets and depletions she was too young for  as I was too young  later  to believe in her pain. It startled  then bored  then repelled me. My starting to fancy she'd ended up in this fire trap in the Village  that my neighbor was her. My thinking we'd meet  recognize one another  become friends  that I'd accomplish a penance. My seeing her  it wasn't her  at the mailbox. Gray yellow hair  army pants under a nightgown  her turning away  hiding her ravaged face in her hands  muttering an inappropriate  Hi.  Sometimes there are frightening goings on in the stairwell. A man shouting   Shut up   The dogs frantically snarling  claws scrabbling  then her    her voice hoarse  harsh  hollow  almost only a tone  incoherent  a note  a squawk  bone on metal  metal gone molten  calling them back   Come back darlings  come back dear ones. My sweet angels  come back.  Medea she was  next time I saw her. Sorceress  tranced  ecstatic  stock still on the sidewalk ragged coat hanging agape  passersby flowing around her  her mouth torn suddenly open as though in a scream  silently though  as though only in her brain or breast had it erupted. A cry so pure  practiced  detached  it had no need of a voice  or could no longer bear one. These invisible links that allure  these transfigurations  even of anguish  that hold us. The girl  my old love  the last lost time I saw her when she came to find me at a party  her drunkenly stumbling  falling  sprawling  skirt hiked  eyes veined red  swollen with tears  her shame  her dishonor. My ignorant  arrogant coarseness  my secret pride  my turning away. Still life on a rooftop  dead trees in barrels  a bench broken  dogs  excrement  sky. What pathways through pain  what junctures of vulnerability  what crossings and counterings  Too many lives in our lives already  too many chances for sorrow  too many unaccounted for pasts.  Behold me   the god of frenzied  inexhaustible love says  rising in bloody splendor   Behold me.  Her making her way down the littered vestibule stairs  one agonized step at a time. My holding the door. Her crossing the fragmented tiles  faltering at the step to the street  droning  not looking at me   Can you help me   Taking my arm  leaning lightly against me. Her wavering step into the world. Her whispering   Thanks love.  Lightly  lightly against me. I think I'll lighten up a little. Another  different kind of poem of youth and age. It's called  Gas.  Wouldn't it be nice  I think  when the blue haired lady in the doctor's waiting room bends over the magazine table and farts  just a little  and violently blushes. Wouldn't it be nice if intestinal gas came embodied in visible clouds  so she could see that her really quite inoffensive pop had only barely grazed my face before it drifted away. Besides  for this to have happened now is a nice coincidence. Because not an hour ago  while we were on our walk  my dog was startled by a backfire and jumped straight up like a horse bucking. And that brought back to me the stable I worked on weekends when I was     and a splendid piebald stallion  who whenever he was mounted would buck just like that  though more hugely of course  enormous  gleaming  resplendent. And the woman  her face abashedly buried in her  Elle  now  reminded me    I'd forgotten that not the least part of my awe consisted of the fact that with every jump he took the horse would powerfully fart. Phwap  Phwap  Phwap  Something never mentioned in the dozens of books about horses and their riders I devoured in those days. All that savage grandeur  the steely glinting hooves  the eruptions driven from the creature's mighty innards  breath stopped  heart stopped  nostrils madly flared  I didn't know if I wanted to break him  or be him. This is called  Thirst.  Many    most of my poems actually are urban poems. I happen to be reading a bunch that aren't.  Thirst.  Here was my relation with the woman who lived all last autumn and winter  day and night  on a bench in the    rd Street subway station  until finally one day she vanished. We regarded each other  scrutinized one another. Me shyly  obliquely  trying not to be furtive. She boldly  unblinkingly  even pugnaciously  wrathfully even  when her bottle was empty. I was frightened of her. I felt like a child. I was afraid some repressed part of myself would go out of control  and I'd be forever entrapped in the shocking seethe of her stench. Not excrement merely  not merely surface and orifice going unwashed  rediffusion of rum  there was will in it  and intention  power and purpose    a social  ethical rage and rebellion    despair too  though  grief  loss. Sometimes I'd think I should take her home with me  bathe her  comfort her  dress her. She wouldn't have wanted me to  I would think. Instead  I'd step into my train. How rich I would think  is the lexicon of our self absolving. How enduring  our bland fatal assurance that reflection is righteousness being accomplished. The dance of our glances  the clash  pulling each other through our perceptual punctures  then holocaust  holocaust  host on host of ill  injured presences  squandered  consumed. Her vigil somewhere I know continues. Her occupancy  her absolute  faithful attendance. The dance of our glances  challenge  abdication  effacement  the perfume of our consternation. This is a newer poem  a brand new poem. The title is  This Happened.  A student  a young woman in a fourth floor hallway of her lycee  perched on the ledge of an open window chatting with friends between classes  a teacher passes and chides her   Be careful  you might fall   almost banteringly chides her   You might fall   and the young woman      a girl really  though she wouldn't think that  as brilliant as she is  first in her class  and  Beautiful  too   she's often told  smiles back  and leans into the open window  which wouldn't even be open if it were winter    if it were winter someone would have closed it   Close it       leans into the window  farther  still smiling  farther and farther  though it takes less time than this  really an instant  and lets herself fall. Herself fall. A casual impulse  a fancy  never thought of until now  hardly thought of even now ... No  more than impulse or fancy  the girl knows what she's doing  the girl means something  the girl means to mean  because it occurs to her in that instant  that beautiful or not  bright yes or no  she's not who she is  she's not the person she is  and the reason  she suddenly knows  is that there's been so much premeditation where she is  so much plotting and planning  there's hardly a person where she is  or if there is  it's not her  or not wholly her  it's a self inhabited  lived in by her  and seemingly even as she thinks it she knows what's been missing  grace  not premeditation but grace  a kind of being in the world spontaneously  with grace. Weightfully upon me was the world. Weightfully this self which graced the world yet never wholly itself. Weightfully this self which weighed upon me  the release from which is what I desire and what I achieve. And the girl remembers  in this infinite instant already now so many times divided  the sadness she felt once  hardly knowing she felt it  to merely inhabit herself. Yes  the girl falls  absurd to fall  even the earth with its compulsion to take unto itself all that falls must know that falling is absurd  yet the girl falling isn't myself  or she is myself  but a self I took of my own volition unto myself. Forever. With grace. This happened. I'll read just one more. I don't usually say that. I like to just end. But I'm afraid that Ricky will come out here and shake his fist at me. This is called  Old Man   appropriately enough.  Special  big tits   Says the advertisement for a soft core magazine on our neighborhood newsstand. But forget her breasts. A lush  fresh lipped blond  skin glowing gold  sprawls there  resplendent.    nearly  yet these hardly tangible  hardly better than harlots  can still stir me. Maybe a coming of age in the American sensual darkness  never seeing an unsmudged nipple  an uncensored vagina  has left me forever infected with an unquenchable lust of the eye. Always that erotic murmur  I'm hardly myself if I'm not in a state of incipient desire. God knows though  there are worse twists your obsessions can take. Last year in Israel  a young ultra orthodox Rabbi guiding some teenage girls through the Shrine of the Shoah forbade them to look in one room. Because there were images in it he said were licentious. The display was a photo. Men and women stripped naked  some trying to cover their genitals  others too frightened to bother  lined up in snow waiting to be shot and thrown into a ditch. The girls  to my horror  averted their gaze. What carnal mistrust had their teacher taught them. Even that though. Another confession  Once in a book on pre war Poland  a studio portrait  an absolute angel  an absolute angel with tormented  tormenting eyes. I kept finding myself at her page. That she died in the camps made her    I didn't dare wonder why    more present  more precious. Died in the camps  that too people    or Jews anyway    kept from their children back then. But it was like sex  you didn't have to be told. Sex and death  how close they can seem. So constantly conscious now of death moving towards me  sometimes I think I confound them. My wife's loveliness almost consumes me. My passion for her goes beyond reasonable bounds. When we make love  her holding me everywhere all around me  I'm there and not there. My mind teems  jumbles of faces  voices  impressions  I live my life over  as though I were drowning. Then I am drowning  in despair at having to leave her  this  everything  all  unbearable  awful. Still  to be able to die with no special contrition  not having been slaughtered  or enslaved. And not having to know history's next mad rage or regression  it might be a relief. No. Again  no. I don't mean that for a moment. What I mean is the world holds me so tightly    the good and the bad    my own follies and weakness that even this counterfeit Venus with her sham heat  and her bosom probably plumped with gel  so moves me my breath catches. Vamp. Siren. Seductress. How much more she reveals in her glare of ink than she knows. How she incarnates our desperate human need for regard  our passion to live in beauty  to be beauty  to be cherished by glances  if by no more  of something like love  or love. Thank you. Newspapers are dying for a few reasons. Readers don't want to pay for yesterday's news  and advertisers follow them. Your iPhone  your laptop  is much more handy than New York Times on Sunday. And we should save trees in the end. So it's enough to bury any industry. So  should we rather ask   Can anything save newspapers   There are several scenarios for the future newspaper. Some people say it should be free  it should be tabloid  or even smaller  A   it should be local  run by communities  or niche  for some smaller groups like business    but then it's not free  it's very expensive. It should be opinion driven  less news  more views. And we'd rather read it during breakfast  because later we listen to radio in a car  check your mail at work and in the evening you watch TV. Sounds nice  but this can only buy time. Because in the long run  I think there is no reason  no practical reason for newspapers to survive. So what can we do  Let me tell you my story.    years ago  Bonnier  Swedish publisher  started to set newspapers in the former Soviet Bloc. After a few years  they had several newspapers in central and eastern Europe. They were run by an inexperienced staff  with no visual culture  no budgets for visuals    in many places there were not even art directors. I decided to be    to work for them as an art director. Before  I was an architect  and my grandmother asked me once   What are you doing for a living   I said   I'm designing newspapers.   What  There's nothing to design there. It's just boring letters  And she was right. I was very frustrated  until one day. I came to London  and I've seen performance by Cirque du Soleil. And I had a revelation. I thought   These guys took some creepy  run down entertainment  and put it to the highest possible level of performance art.  I thought  Oh my God  maybe I can do the same with these boring newspapers.  And I did. We started to redesign them  one by one. The front page became our signature. It was my personal intimate channel to talk to the readers. I'm not going to tell you stories about teamwork or cooperation. My approach was very egotistic. I wanted my artistic statement  my interpretation of reality. I wanted to make posters  not newspapers. Not even magazines  posters. We were experimenting with type  with illustration  with photos. And we had fun. Soon it started to bring results. In Poland  our pages were named  Covers of the Year  three times in a row. Other examples you can see here are from Latvia  Lithuania  Estonia    the central European countries. But it's not only about the front page. The secret is that we were treating the whole newspaper as one piece  as one composition    like music. And music has a rhythm  has ups and downs. And design is responsible for this experience. Flipping through pages is readers experience  and I'm responsible for this experience. We treated two pages  both spreads  as a one page  because that's how readers perceive it. You can see some Russian pages here which got many awards on biggest infographic competition in Spain. But the real award came from Society for Newspaper Design. Just a year after redesigning this newspaper in Poland  they name it the World's Best Designed Newspaper. And two years later  the same award came to Estonia. Isn't amazing  What really makes it amazing  that the circulation of these newspapers were growing too. Just some examples  in Russia  plus    after one year  plus    after three years of the redesign. Same in Poland  plus     up to    percent raise of circulation after three years. You can see on a graph  after years of stagnation  the paper started to grow  just after redesign. But the real hit was in Bulgaria. And that is really amazing. Did design do this  Design was just a part of the process. And the process we made was not about changing the look  it was about improving the product completely. I took an architectural rule about function and form and translated it into newspaper content and design. And I put strategy at the top of it. So first you ask a big question  why we do it  What is the goal  Then we adjust the content accordingly. And then  usually after two months  we start designing. My bosses  in the beginning  were very surprised. Why am I asking all of these business questions  instead of just showing them pages  But soon they realized that this is the new role of designer  to be in this process from the very beginning to the very end. So what is the lesson behind it  The first lesson is about that design can change not just your product. It can change your workflow    actually  it can change everything in your company  it can turn your company upside down. It can even change you. And who's responsible  Designers. Give power to designers. But the second is even more important. You can live in a small poor country  like me. You can work for a small company  in a boring branch. You can have no budgets  no people    but still can put your work to the highest possible level. And everybody can do it. You just need inspiration  vision and determination. And you need to remember that to be good is not enough. Thank you.
