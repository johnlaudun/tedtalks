I have all my life wondered what  mind boggling  meant. After two days here  I declare myself boggled  and enormously impressed  and feel that you are one of the great hopes    not just for American achievement in science and technology  but for the whole world. I've come  however  on a special mission on behalf of my constituency  which are the    to the   th power    that's a million trillion    insects and other small creatures  and to make a plea for them. If we were to wipe out insects alone  just that group alone  on this planet    which we are trying hard to do    the rest of life and humanity with it would mostly disappear from the land. And within a few months. Now  how did I come to this particular position of advocacy  As a little boy  and through my teenage years  I became increasingly fascinated by the diversity of life. I had a butterfly period  a snake period  a bird period  a fish period  a cave period and finally and definitively  an ant period. By my college years  I was a devoted myrmecologist  a specialist on the biology of ants  but my attention and research continued to make journeys across the great variety of life on Earth in general    including all that it means to us as a species  how little we understand it and how pressing a danger that our activities have created for it. Out of that broader study has emerged a concern and an ambition  crystallized in the wish that I'm about to make to you. My choice is the culmination of a lifetime commitment that began with growing up on the Gulf Coast of Alabama  on the Florida peninsula. As far back as I can remember  I was enchanted by the natural beauty of that region and the almost tropical exuberance of the plants and animals that grow there. One day when I was only seven years old and fishing  I pulled a  pinfish   they're called  with sharp dorsal spines  up too hard and fast  and I blinded myself in one eye. I later discovered I was also hard of hearing  possibly congenitally  in the upper registers. So in planning to be a professional naturalist    I never considered anything else in my entire life    I found that I was lousy at bird watching and couldn't track frog calls either. So I turned to the teeming small creatures that can be held between the thumb and forefinger  the little things that compose the foundation of our ecosystems  the little things  as I like to say  who run the world. In so doing  I reached a frontier of biology so strange  so rich  that it seemed as though it exists on another planet. In fact  we live on a mostly unexplored planet. The great majority of organisms on Earth remain unknown to science. In the last    years  thanks to explorations in remote parts of the world and advances in technology  biologists have  for example  added a full one third of the known frog and other amphibian species  to bring the current total to        and more continue to pour in. Two new kinds of whales have been discovered  along with two new antelopes  dozens of monkey species and a new kind of elephant    and even a distinct kind of gorilla. At the extreme opposite end of the size scale  the class of marine bacteria  the Prochlorococci    that will be on the final exam    although discovered only in       are now recognized as likely the most abundant organisms on Earth  and moreover  responsible for a large part of the photosynthesis that occurs in the ocean. These bacteria were not uncovered sooner because they are also among the smallest of all Earth's organisms    so minute that they cannot be seen with conventional optical microscopy. Yet life in the sea may depend on these tiny creatures. These examples are just the first glimpse of our ignorance of life on this planet. Consider the fungi    including mushrooms  rusts  molds and many disease causing organisms.        species are known to science  but more than  .  million have been estimated to exist. Consider the nematode roundworm  the most abundant of all animals. Four out of five animals on Earth are nematode worms    if all solid materials except nematode worms were to be eliminated  you could still see the ghostly outline of most of it in nematode worms. About        species of nematode worms have been discovered and diagnosed by scientists  there could be hundreds of thousands of them  even millions  still unknown. This vast domain of hidden biodiversity is increased still further by the dark matter of the biological world of bacteria  which within just the last several years still were known from only about       species of bacteria worldwide. But that number of bacteria species can be found in one gram of soil  just a little handful of soil  in the    billion bacteria that would be there. It's been estimated that a single ton of soil    fertile soil    contains approximately four million species of bacteria  all unknown. So the question is  what are they all doing  The fact is  we don't know. We are living on a planet with a lot of activities  with reference to our living environment  done by faith and guess alone. Our lives depend upon these creatures. To take an example close to home  there are over     species of bacteria now known    friendly bacteria    living symbiotically in your mouth and throat probably necessary to your health for holding off pathogenic bacteria. At this point I think we have a little impressionistic film that was made especially for this occasion. And I'd like to show it. Assisted in this by Billie Holiday. And that may be just the beginning  The viruses  those quasi organisms among which are the prophages  the gene weavers that promote the continued evolution in the lives of the bacteria  are a virtually unknown frontier of modern biology  a world unto themselves. What constitutes a viral species is still unresolved  although they're obviously of enormous importance to us. But this much we can say  the variety of genes on the planet in viruses exceeds  or is likely to exceed  that in all of the rest of life combined. Nowadays  in addressing microbial biodiversity  scientists are like explorers in a rowboat launched onto the Pacific Ocean. But that is changing rapidly with the aid of new genomic technology. Already it is possible to sequence the entire genetic code of a bacterium in under four hours. Soon we will be in a position to go forth in the field with sequencers on our backs    to hunt bacteria in tiny crevices of the habitat's surface in the way you go watching for birds with binoculars. What will we find as we map the living world  as  finally  we get this underway seriously  As we move past the relatively gigantic mammals  birds  frogs and plants to the more elusive insects and other small invertebrates and then beyond to the countless millions of organisms in the invisible living world enveloped and living within humanity  Already what were thought to be bacteria for generations have been found to compose  instead  two great domains of microorganisms  true bacteria and one celled organisms the archaea  which are closer than other bacteria to the eukaryota  the group that we belong to. Some serious biologists  and I count myself among them  have begun to wonder that among the enormous and still unknown diversity of microorganisms  one might    just might    find aliens among them. True aliens  stocks that arrived from outer space. They've had billions of years to do it  but especially during the earliest period of biological evolution on this planet. We do know that some bacterial species that have earthly origin are capable of almost unimaginable extremes of temperature and other harsh changes in environment  including hard radiation strong enough and maintained long enough to crack the Pyrex vessels around the growing population of bacteria. There may be a temptation to treat the biosphere holistically and the species that compose it as a great flux of entities hardly worth distinguishing one from the other. But each of these species  even the tiniest Prochlorococci  are masterpieces of evolution. Each has persisted for thousands to millions of years. Each is exquisitely adapted to the environment in which it lives  interlocked with other species to form ecosystems upon which our own lives depend in ways we have not begun even to imagine. We will destroy these ecosystems and the species composing them at the peril of our own existence    and unfortunately we are destroying them with ingenuity and ceaseless energy. My own epiphany as a conservationist came in       while a Harvard graduate student  searching for rare ants found in the mountain forests of Cuba  ants that shine in the sunlight    metallic green or metallic blue  according to species  and one species  I discovered  metallic gold. I found my magical ants  but only after a tough climb into the mountains where the last of the native Cuban forests hung on  and were then    and still are    being cut back. I realized then that these species and a large part of the other unique  marvelous animals and plants on that island    and this is true of practically every part of the world    which took millions of years to evolve  are in the process of disappearing forever. And so it is everywhere one looks. The human juggernaut is permanently eroding Earth's ancient biosphere by a combination of forces that can be summarized by the acronym  HIPPO   the animal hippo. H is for habitat destruction  including climate change forced by greenhouse gases. I is for the invasive species like the fire ants  the zebra mussels  broom grasses and pathogenic bacteria and viruses that are flooding every country  and at an exponential rate    that's the I. The P  the first one in  HIPPO   is for pollution. The second is for continued population  human population expansion. And the final letter is O  for over harvesting    driving species into extinction by excessive hunting and fishing. The HIPPO juggernaut we have created  if unabated  is destined    according to the best estimates of ongoing biodiversity research    to reduce half of Earth's still surviving animal and plant species to extinction or critical endangerment by the end of the century. Human forced climate change alone    again  if unabated    could eliminate a quarter of surviving species during the next five decades. What will we and all future generations lose if much of the living environment is thus degraded  Huge potential sources of scientific information yet to be gathered  much of our environmental stability and new kinds of pharmaceuticals and new products of unimaginable strength and value    all thrown away. The loss will inflict a heavy price in wealth  security and yes  spirituality for all time to come  because previous cataclysms of this kind    the last one  that ended the age of dinosaurs    took  normally  five to    million years to repair. Sadly  our knowledge of biodiversity is so incomplete that we are at risk of losing a great deal of it before it is even discovered. For example  even in the United States  the         species known currently actually has been found to be only partial in coverage  it is mostly unknown to us in basic biology. Only about    percent of the known species have been studied well enough to evaluate their status. Of the    percent evaluated     percent are classified as  in peril   that is  in danger of extinction. That's in the United States. We are  in short  flying blind into our environmental future. We urgently need to change this. We need to have the biosphere properly explored so that we can understand and competently manage it. We need to settle down before we wreck the planet. And we need that knowledge. This should be a big science project equivalent to the Human Genome Project. It should be thought of as a biological moonshot with a timetable. So this brings me to my wish for TEDsters  and to anyone else around the world who hears this talk. I wish we will work together to help create the key tools that we need to inspire preservation of Earth's biodiversity. And let us call it the  Encyclopedia of Life.  What is the  Encyclopedia of Life   A concept that has already taken hold and is beginning to spread and be looked at seriously  It is an encyclopedia that lives on the Internet and is contributed to by thousands of scientists around the world. Amateurs can do it also. It has an indefinitely expandable page for each species. It makes all key information about life on Earth accessible to anyone  on demand  anywhere in the world. I've written about this idea before  and I know there are people in this room who have expended significant effort on it in the past. But what excites me is that since I first put forward this particular idea in that form  science has advanced. Technology has moved forward. Today  the practicalities of making such an encyclopedia  regardless of the magnitude of the information put into it  are within reach. Indeed  in the past year  a group of influential scientific institutions have begun mobilizing to realize this dream. I wish you would help them. Working together  we can make this real. The encyclopedia will quickly pay for itself in practical applications. It will address transcendent qualities in the human consciousness  and sense of human need. It will transform the science of biology in ways of obvious benefit to humanity. And most of all  it can inspire a new generation of biologists to continue the quest that started  for me personally     years ago  to search for life  to understand it and finally  above all  to preserve it. That is my wish. Thank you. As someone who has spent his entire career trying to be invisible  standing in front of an audience is a cross between an out of body experience and a deer caught in the headlights  so please forgive me for violating one of the TED commandments by relying on words on paper  and I only hope I'm not struck by lightning bolts before I'm done. I'd like to begin by talking about some of the ideas that motivated me to become a documentary photographer. I was a student in the '  s  a time of social upheaval and questioning  and on a personal level  an awakening sense of idealism. The war in Vietnam was raging  the Civil Rights Movement was under way  and pictures had a powerful influence on me. Our political and military leaders were telling us one thing  and photographers were telling us another. I believed the photographers  and so did millions of other Americans. Their images fueled resistance to the war and to racism. They not only recorded history  they helped change the course of history. Their pictures became part of our collective consciousness and  as consciousness evolved into a shared sense of conscience  change became not only possible  but inevitable. I saw that the free flow of information represented by journalism  specifically visual journalism  can bring into focus both the benefits and the cost of political policies. It can give credit to sound decision making  adding momentum to success. In the face of poor political judgment or political inaction  it becomes a kind of intervention  assessing the damage and asking us to reassess our behavior. It puts a human face on issues which from afar can appear abstract or ideological or monumental in their global impact. What happens at ground level  far from the halls of power  happens to ordinary citizens one by one. And I understood that documentary photography has the ability to interpret events from their point of view. It gives a voice to those who otherwise would not have a voice. And as a reaction  it stimulates public opinion and gives impetus to public debate  thereby preventing the interested parties from totally controlling the agenda  much as they would like to. Coming of age in those days made real the concept that the free flow of information is absolutely vital for a free and dynamic society to function properly. The press is certainly a business  and in order to survive it must be a successful business  but the right balance must be found between marketing considerations and journalistic responsibility. Society's problems can't be solved until they're identified. On a higher plane  the press is a service industry  and the service it provides is awareness. Every story does not have to sell something. There's also a time to give. That was a tradition I wanted to follow. Seeing the war created such incredibly high stakes for everyone involved and that visual journalism could actually become a factor in conflict resolution    I wanted to be a photographer in order to be a war photographer. But I was driven by an inherent sense that a picture that revealed the true face of war would almost by definition be an anti war photograph. I'd like to take you on a visual journey through some of the events and issues I've been involved in over the past    years. In       I went to Northern Ireland.    IRA prisoners were in the process of starving themselves to death in protest against conditions in jail. The reaction on the streets was violent confrontation. I saw that the front lines of contemporary wars are not on isolated battlefields  but right where people live. During the early '  s  I spent a lot of time in Central America  which was engulfed by civil wars that straddled the ideological divide of the Cold War. In Guatemala  the central government    controlled by a oligarchy of European decent    was waging a scorched Earth campaign against an indigenous rebellion  and I saw an image that reflected the history of Latin America  conquest through a combination of the Bible and the sword. An anti Sandinista guerrilla was mortally wounded as Commander Zero attacked a town in Southern Nicaragua. A destroyed tank belonging to Somoza's national guard was left as a monument in a park in Managua  and was transformed by the energy and spirit of a child. At the same time  a civil war was taking place in El Salvador  and again  the civilian population was caught up in the conflict. I've been covering the Palestinian Israeli conflict since     . This is a moment from the beginning of the second intifada  in       when it was still stones and Molotovs against an army. In       the uprising escalated into an armed conflict  and one of the major incidents was the destruction of the Palestinian refugee camp in the West Bank town of Jenin. Without the political will to find common ground  the continual friction of tactic and counter tactic only creates suspicion and hatred and vengeance  and perpetuates the cycle of violence. In the '  s  after the breakup of the Soviet Union  Yugoslavia fractured along ethnic fault lines  and civil war broke out between Bosnia  Croatia and Serbia. This is a scene of house to house fighting in Mostar  neighbor against neighbor. A bedroom  the place where people share intimacy  where life itself is conceived  became a battlefield. A mosque in northern Bosnia was destroyed by Serbian artillery and was used as a makeshift morgue. Dead Serbian soldiers were collected after a battle and used as barter for the return of prisoners or Bosnian soldiers killed in action. This was once a park. The Bosnian soldier who guided me told me that all of his friends were there now. At the same time in South Africa  after Nelson Mandela had been released from prison  the black population commenced the final phase of liberation from apartheid. One of the things I had to learn as a journalist was what to do with my anger. I had to use it  channel its energy  turn it into something that would clarify my vision  instead of clouding it. In Transkei  I witnessed a rite of passage into manhood  of the Xhosa tribe. Teenage boys lived in isolation  their bodies covered with white clay. After several weeks  they washed off the white and took on the full responsibilities of men. It was a very old ritual that seemed symbolic of the political struggle that was changing the face of South Africa. Children in Soweto playing on a trampoline. Elsewhere in Africa there was famine. In Somalia  the central government collapsed and clan warfare broke out. Farmers were driven off their land  and crops and livestock were destroyed or stolen. Starvation was being used as a weapon of mass destruction    primitive but extremely effective. Hundreds of thousands of people were exterminated  slowly and painfully. The international community responded with massive humanitarian relief  and hundreds of thousands of more lives were saved. American troops were sent to protect the relief shipments  but they were eventually drawn into the conflict  and after the tragic battle in Mogadishu  they were withdrawn. In southern Sudan  another civil war saw similar use of starvation as a means of genocide. Again  international NGOs  united under the umbrella of the U.N.  staged a massive relief operation and thousands of lives were saved. I'm a witness  and I want my testimony to be honest and uncensored. I also want it to be powerful and eloquent  and to do as much justice as possible to the experience of the people I'm photographing. This man was in an NGO feeding center  being helped as much as he could be helped. He literally had nothing. He was a virtual skeleton  yet he could still summon the courage and the will to move. He had not given up  and if he didn't give up  how could anyone in the outside world ever dream of losing hope  In       after three months of covering the South African election  I saw the inauguration of Nelson Mandela  and it was the most uplifting thing I've ever seen. It exemplified the best that humanity has to offer. The next day I left for Rwanda  and it was like taking the express elevator to hell. This man had just been liberated from a Hutu death camp. He allowed me to photograph him for quite a long time  and he even turned his face toward the light  as if he wanted me to see him better. I think he knew what the scars on his face would say to the rest of the world. This time  maybe confused or discouraged by the military disaster in Somalia  the international community remained silent  and somewhere around         people were slaughtered by their own countrymen    sometimes their own neighbors    using farm implements as weapons. Perhaps because a lesson had been learned by the weak response to the war in Bosnia and the failure in Rwanda  when Serbia attacked Kosovo  international action was taken much more decisively. NATO forces went in  and the Serbian army withdrew. Ethnic Albanians had been murdered  their farms destroyed and a huge number of people forcibly deported. They were received in refugee camps set up by NGOs in Albania and Macedonia. The imprint of a man who had been burned inside his own home. The image reminded me of a cave painting  and echoed how primitive we still are in so many ways. Between      and '    I covered the first two wars in Chechnya from inside Grozny. This is a Chechen rebel on the front line against the Russian army. The Russians bombarded Grozny constantly for weeks  killing mainly the civilians who were still trapped inside. I found a boy from the local orphanage wandering around the front line. My work has evolved from being concerned mainly with war to a focus on critical social issues as well. After the fall of Ceausescu  I went to Romania and discovered a kind of gulag of children  where thousands of orphans were being kept in medieval conditions. Ceausescu had imposed a quota on the number of children to be produced by each family  thereby making women's bodies an instrument of state economic policy. Children who couldn't be supported by their families were raised in government orphanages. Children with birth defects were labeled incurables  and confined for life to inhuman conditions. As reports began to surface  again international aid went in. Going deeper into the legacy of the Eastern European regimes  I worked for several months on a story about the effects of industrial pollution  where there had been no regard for the environment or the health of either workers or the general population. An aluminum factory in Czechoslovakia was filled with carcinogenic smoke and dust  and four out of five workers came down with cancer. After the fall of Suharto in Indonesia  I began to explore conditions of poverty in a country that was on its way towards modernization. I spent a good deal of time with a man who lived with his family on a railway embankment and had lost an arm and a leg in a train accident. When the story was published  unsolicited donations poured in. A trust fund was established  and the family now lives in a house in the countryside and all their basic necessities are taken care of. It was a story that wasn't trying to sell anything. Journalism had provided a channel for people's natural sense of generosity  and the readers responded. I met a band of homeless children who'd come to Jakarta from the countryside  and ended up living in a train station. By the age of    or     they'd become beggars and drug addicts. The rural poor had become the urban poor  and in the process  they'd become invisible. These heroin addicts in detox in Pakistan reminded me of figures in a play by Beckett  isolated  waiting in the dark  but drawn to the light. Agent Orange was a defoliant used during the Vietnam War to deny cover to the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese army. The active ingredient was dioxin  an extremely toxic chemical that was sprayed in vast quantities  and whose effects passed through the genes to the next generation. In       I began documenting global health issues  concentrating first on AIDS in Africa. I tried to tell the story through the work of caregivers. I thought it was important to emphasize that people were being helped  whether by international NGOs or by local grassroots organizations. So many children have been orphaned by the epidemic that grandmothers have taken the place of parents  and a lot of children had been born with HIV. A hospital in Zambia. I began documenting the close connection between HIV AIDS and tuberculosis. This is an MSF hospital in Cambodia. My pictures can play a supporting role to the work of NGOs by shedding light on the critical social problems they're trying to deal with. I went to Congo with MSF  and contributed to a book and an exhibition that focused attention on a forgotten war in which millions of people have died  and exposure to disease without treatment is used as a weapon. A malnourished child being measured as part of the supplemental feeding program. In the fall of      I went to Darfur. This time I was on assignment for a magazine  but again worked closely with MSF. The international community still hasn't found a way to create the pressure necessary to stop this genocide. An MSF hospital in a camp for displaced people. I've been working on a long project on crime and punishment in America. This is a scene from New Orleans. A prisoner on a chain gang in Alabama was punished by being handcuffed to a post in the midday sun. This experience raised a lot of questions  among them questions about race and equality and for whom in our country opportunities and options are available. In the yard of a chain gang in Alabama. I didn't see either of the planes hit  and when I glanced out my window  I saw the first tower burning  and I thought it might have been an accident. A few minutes later when I looked again and saw the second tower burning  I knew we were at war. In the midst of the wreckage at Ground Zero  I had a realization. I'd been photographing in the Islamic world since         not only in the Middle East  but also in Africa  Asia and Europe. At the time I was photographing in these different places  I thought I was covering separate stories  but on      history crystallized  and I understood I'd actually been covering a single story for more than    years  and the attack on New York was its latest manifestation. The central commercial district of Kabul  Afghanistan at the end of the civil war  shortly before the city fell to the Taliban. Land mine victims being helped at the Red Cross rehab center being run by Alberto Cairo. A boy who lost a leg to a leftover mine. I'd witnessed immense suffering in the Islamic world from political oppression  civil war  foreign invasions  poverty  famine. I understood that in its suffering  the Islamic world had been crying out. Why weren't we listening  A Taliban fighter shot during a battle as the Northern Alliance entered the city of Kunduz. When war with Iraq was imminent  I realized the American troops would be very well covered  so I decided to cover the invasion from inside Baghdad. A marketplace was hit by a mortar shell that killed several members of a single family. A day after American forces entered Baghdad  a company of Marines began rounding up bank robbers and were cheered on by the crowds    a hopeful moment that was short lived. For the first time in years  Shi'ites were allowed to make the pilgrimage to Karbala to observe Ashura  and I was amazed by the sheer number of people and how fervently they practiced their religion. A group of men march through the streets cutting themselves with knives. It was obvious that the Shi'ites were a force to be reckoned with  and we would do well to understand them and learn how to deal with them. Last year I spent several months documenting our wounded troops  from the battlefield in Iraq all the way home. This is a helicopter medic giving CPR to a soldier who had been shot in the head. Military medicine has become so efficient that the percentage of troops who survive after being wounded is much higher in this war than in any other war in our history. The signature weapon of the war is the IED  and the signature wound is severe leg damage. After enduring extreme pain and trauma  the wounded face a grueling physical and psychological struggle in rehab. The spirit they displayed was absolutely remarkable. I tried to imagine myself in their place  and I was totally humbled by their courage and determination in the face of such catastrophic loss. Good people had been put in a very bad situation for questionable results. One day in rehab someone  started talking about surfing and all these guys who'd never surfed before said   Hey  let's go.  And they went surfing. Photographers go to the extreme edges of human experience to show people what's going on. Sometimes they put their lives on the line  because they believe your opinions and your influence matter. They aim their pictures at your best instincts  generosity  a sense of right and wrong  the ability and the willingness to identify with others  the refusal to accept the unacceptable. My TED wish  there's a vital story that needs to be told  and I wish for TED to help me gain access to it and then to help me come up with innovative and exciting ways to use news photography in the digital era. Thank you very much. I thought in getting up to my TED wish I would try to begin by putting in  perspective what I try to do and how it fits with what they try to do. We live in a world that everyone knows is interdependent  but insufficient in three major ways. It is  first of all  profoundly unequal  half the world's people still living on less than two dollars a day  a billion people with no access to clean water  two and a half billion no access to sanitation  a billion going to bed hungry every night  one in four deaths every year from AIDS  TB  malaria and the variety of infections associated with dirty water       percent of them under five years of age. Even in wealthy countries it is common now to see inequality growing. In the United States  since      we've had five years of economic growth  five years of productivity growth in the workplace  but median wages are stagnant and the percentage of working families dropping below the poverty line is up by four percent. The percentage of working families without health care up by four percent. So this interdependent world which has been pretty good to most of us    which is why we're all here in Northern California doing what we do for a living  enjoying this evening    is profoundly unequal. It is also unstable. Unstable because of the threats of terror  weapons of mass destruction  the spread of global disease and a sense that we are vulnerable to it in a way that we weren't not so many years ago. And perhaps most important of all  it is unsustainable because of climate change  resource depletion and species destruction. When I think about the world I would like to leave to my daughter and the grandchildren I hope to have  it is a world that moves away from unequal  unstable  unsustainable interdependence to integrated communities    locally  nationally and globally    that share the characteristics of all successful communities  a broadly shared  accessible set of opportunities  a shared sense of responsibility for the success of the common enterprise and a genuine sense of belonging. All easier said than done. When the terrorist incidents occurred in the United Kingdom a couple of years ago  I think even though they didn't claim as many lives as we lost in the United States on       I think the thing that troubled the British most was that the perpetrators were not invaders  but homegrown citizens whose religious and political identities were more important to them than the people they grew up with  went to school with  worked with  shared weekends with  shared meals with. In other words  they thought their differences were more important than their common humanity. It is the central psychological plague of humankind in the   st century. Into this mix  people like us  who are not in public office  have more power to do good than at any time in history  because more than half the world's people live under governments they voted in and can vote out. And even non democratic governments are more sensitive to public opinion. Because primarily of the power of the Internet  people of modest means can band together and amass vast sums of money that can change the world for some public good if they all agree. When the tsunami hit South Asia  the United States contributed  .  billion dollars.    percent of our households gave. Half of them gave over the Internet. The median contribution was somewhere around    dollars. And thirdly  because of the rise of non governmental organizations. They  businesses  other citizens' groups  have enormous power to affect the lives of our fellow human beings. When I became president in       there were none of these organizations in Russia. There are now a couple of hundred thousand. None in India. There are now at least a half a million active. None in China. There are now         registered with the government  probably twice again that many who are not registered for political reasons. When I organized my foundation  and I thought about the world as it is and the world that I hope to leave to the next generation  and I tried to be realistic about what I had cared about all my life that I could still have an impact on. I wanted to focus on activities that would help to alleviate poverty  fight disease  combat climate change  bridge the religious  racial and other divides that torment the world  but to do it in a way that would either use whatever particular skills we could put together in our group to change the way some public good function was performed so that it would sweep across the world more. You saw one reference to that in what we were able to do with AIDS drugs. And I want to say that the head of our AIDS effort  and the person who also is primarily active in the wish I'll make tonight  Ira Magaziner  is here with me and I want to thank him for everything he's done. He's over there. When I got out of office and was asked to work  first in the Caribbean  to try to help deal with the AIDS crisis  generic drugs were available for about     dollars a person a year. If you bought them in vast bulks  you could get them at a little under     dollars. The first country we went to work in  the Bahamas  was paying       dollars for these drugs. The market was so terribly disorganized that they were buying this medicine through two agents who were gigging them sevenfold. So the very first week we were working  we got the price down to     dollars. And all of a sudden  they could save seven times as many lives for the same amount of money. Then we went to work with the manufacturers of AIDS medicines  one of whom was cited in the film  and negotiated a whole different change in business strategy  because even at     dollars  these drugs were being sold on a high margin  low volume  uncertain payment basis. So we worked on improving the productivity of the operations and the supply chain  and went to a low margin  high volume  absolutely certain payment business. I joked that the main contribution we made to the battle against AIDS was to get the manufacturers to change from a jewelry store to a grocery store strategy. But the price went to     dollars from    . And pretty soon  the average price was     dollars. Now we can get it for about     dollars. Children's medicine was     dollars  because nobody could afford to buy any of it. We negotiated it down to    . Then  the French imposed their brilliantly conceived airline tax to create a something called UNITAID  got a bunch of other countries to help. That children's medicine is now    dollars a person a year. The only thing that is keeping us from basically saving the lives of everybody who needs the medicine to stay alive are the absence of systems necessary to diagnose  treat and care for people and deliver this medicine. We started a childhood obesity initiative with the Heart Association in America. We tried to do the same thing by negotiating industry right deals with the soft drink and the snack food industry to cut the caloric and other dangerous content of food going to our children in the schools. We just reorganized the markets. And it occurred to me that in this whole non governmental world  somebody needs to be thinking about organizing public goods markets. And that is now what we're trying to do  and working with this large cities group to fight climate change  to negotiate huge  big  volume deals that will enable cities which generate    percent of the world's greenhouse gases  to drastically and quickly reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a way that is good economics. And this whole discussion as if it's some sort of economic burden  is a mystery to me. I think it's a bird's nest on the ground. When Al Gore won his well deserved Oscar for the  Inconvenient Truth  movie  I was thrilled  but I had urged him to make a second movie quickly. For those of you who saw  An Inconvenient Truth   the most important slide in the Gore lecture is the last one  which shows here's where greenhouse gases are going if we don't do anything  here's where they could go. And then there are six different categories of things we can do to change the trajectory. We need a movie on those six categories. And all of you need to have it embedded in your brains and to organize yourselves around it. So we're trying to do that. So organizing these markets is one thing we try to do. Now we have taken on a second thing  and this gets to my wish. It has been my experience in working in developing countries that while the headlines may all be    the pessimistic headlines may say  well  we can't do this  that or the other thing because of corruption    I think incapacity is a far bigger problem in poor countries than corruption  and feeds corruption. We now have the money  given these low prices  to distribute AIDS drugs all over the world to people we cannot presently reach. Today these low prices are available in the    countries where we work  and in a total of    countries  and about         people are getting the benefits of them. But the money is there to reach others. The systems are not there to reach the people. So what we have been trying to do  working first in Rwanda and then in Malawi and other places    but I want to talk about Rwanda tonight    is to develop a model for rural health care in a very poor area that can be used to deal with AIDS  TB  malaria  other infectious diseases  maternal and child health  and a whole range of health issues poor people are grappling with in the developing world  that can first be scaled for the whole nation of Rwanda  and then will be a model that could literally be implemented in any other poor country in the world. And the test is  one  will it do the job  Will it provide high quality care  And two  will it do it at a price that will enable the country to sustain a health care system without foreign donors after five to    years  Because the longer I deal with these problems  the more convinced I am that we have to    whether it's economics  health  education  whatever    we have to build systems. And the absence of systems that function break the connection which got you all in this seat tonight. You think about whatever your life has been  however many obstacles you have faced in your life  at critical junctures you always knew there was a predictable connection between the effort you exerted and the result you achieved. In a world with no systems  with chaos  everything becomes a guerilla struggle  and this predictability is not there. And it becomes almost impossible to save lives  educate kids  develop economies  whatever. The person  in my view  who has done the best job of this in the health care area  of building a system in a very poor area  is Dr. Paul Farmer  who  many of you know  has worked for now    years with his group  Partners in Health  primarily in Haiti where he started  but they've also worked in Russia  in Peru and other places around the world. As poor as Haiti is  in the area where Farmer's clinic is active    and they serve a catchment area far greater than the medical professionals they have would indicate they could serve    since       they have not lost one person to tuberculosis  not one. And they've achieved a lot of other amazing health results. So when we decided to work in Rwanda on trying to dramatically increase the income of the country and fight the AIDS problem  we wanted to build a healthcare network  because it had been totally destroyed during the genocide in       and the per capita income was still under a dollar a day. So I rang up  asked Paul Farmer if he would help. Because it seemed to me if we could prove there was a model in Haiti and a model in Rwanda that we could then take all over the country  number one  it would be a wonderful thing for a country that has suffered as much as any on Earth in the last    years  and number two  we would have something that could then be adapted to any other poor country anywhere in the world. And so we have set about doing that. Now  we started working together    months ago. And we're working in an area called Southern Kayonza  which is one of the poorest areas in Rwanda  with a group that originally includes about         people. We're essentially implementing what Paul Farmer did in Haiti  he develops and trains paid community health workers who are able to identify health problems  ensure that people who have AIDS or TB are properly diagnosed and take their medicine regularly  who work on bringing about health education  clean water and sanitation  providing nutritional supplements and moving people up the chain of health care if they have problems of the severity that require it. The procedures that make this work have been perfected  as I said  by Paul Farmer and his team in their work in rural Haiti over the last    years. Recently we did an evaluation of the first    months of our efforts in Rwanda. And the results were so good that the Rwandan government has now agreed to adopt the model for the entire country  and has strongly supported and put the full resources of the government behind it. I'll tell you a little bit about our team because it's indicative of what we do. We have about     people around the world working in our AIDS program  some of them for nothing    just for transportation  room and board. And then we have others working in these other related programs. Our business plan in Rwanda was put together under the leadership of Diana Noble  who is an unusually gifted woman  but not unusual in the type of people who have been willing to do this kind of work. She was the youngest partner at Schroder Ventures in London in her   s. She was CEO of a successful e venture    she started and built Reed Elsevier Ventures    and at    she decided she wanted to do something different with her life. So she now works full time on this for very little pay. She and her team of former business people have created a business plan that will enable us to scale this health system up for the whole country. And it would be worthy of the kind of private equity work she used to do when she was making a lot more money for it. When we came to this rural area     percent of the children under the age of five had stunted growth due to malnutrition.    percent of them died before they reached the age of five. Mortality at birth was over two and a half percent. Over    percent of the deaths among adults and children occurred because of intestinal parasites and diarrhea from dirty water and inadequate sanitation    all entirely preventable and treatable. Over    percent of the deaths were from respiratory illnesses    again  all preventable and treatable. And not a single soul in this area was being treated for AIDS or tuberculosis. Within the first    months  the following things happened  we went from zero to about       people being treated for AIDS. That's    percent of the people who need treatment in this area. Listen to this  less than four tenths of one percent of those being treated stopped taking their medicine or otherwise defaulted on treatment. That's lower than the figure in the United States. Less than three tenths of one percent had to transfer to the more expensive second line drugs.         pregnant women were brought into counseling and will give birth for the first time within an organized healthcare system. That's about    percent of all the pregnancies. About    percent of all the people    I said        . I meant       . About    percent of all the people who need TB treatment are now getting it    in just    months  up from zero when we started.    percent of the children in need of an infant feeding program to prevent malnutrition and early death are now getting the food supplements they need to stay alive and to grow. We've started the first malaria treatment programs they've ever had there. Patients admitted to a hospital that was destroyed during the genocide that we have renovated along with four other clinics  complete with solar power generators  good lab technology. We now are treating     people a month  despite the fact that almost     percent of the AIDS patients are now treated at home. And the most important thing is because we've implemented Paul Farmer's model  using community health workers  we estimate that this system could be put into place for all of Rwanda for between five and six percent of GDP  and that the government could sustain that without depending on foreign aid after five or six years. And for those of you who understand healthcare economics you know that all wealthy countries spend between nine and    percent of GDP on health care  except for the United States  we spend       but that's a story for another day. We're now working with Partners in Health and the Ministry of Health in Rwanda and our Foundation folks to scale this system up. We're also beginning to do this in Malawi and Lesotho. And we have similar projects in Tanzania  Mozambique  Kenya and Ethiopia with other partners trying to achieve the same thing  to save as many lives as quickly as we can  but to do it in a systematic way that can be implemented nationwide and then with a model that can be implemented in any country in the world. We need initial upfront investment to train doctors  nurses  health administration and community health workers throughout the country  to set up the information technology  the solar energy  the water and sanitation  the transportation infrastructure. But over a five  to    year period  we will take down the need for outside assistance and eventually it will be phased out. My wish is that TED assist us in our work and help us to build a high quality rural health system in a poor country  Rwanda  that can be a model for Africa  and indeed  for any poor country anywhere in the world. My belief is that this will help us to build a more integrated world with more partners and fewer terrorists  with more productive citizens and fewer haters  a place we'd all want our kids and our grandchildren to grow up in. It has been an honor for me  particularly  to work in Rwanda where we also have a major economic development project in partnership with Sir Tom Hunter  the Scottish philanthropist  where last year we  using the same thing with AIDS drugs  cut the cost of fertilizer and the interest rates on microcredit loans by    percent and achieved three  to four hundred percent increases in crop yields with the farmers. These people have been through a lot and none of us  most of all me  helped them when they were on the verge of destroying each other. We're undoing that now  and they are so over it and so into their future. We're doing this in an environmentally responsible way. I'm doing my best to convince them not to run the electric grid to the    percent of the people that have no access  but to do it with clean energy. To have responsible reforestation projects  the Rwandans  interestingly enough  have been quite good  Mr. Wilson  in preserving their topsoil. There's a couple of guys from southern farming families    the first thing I did when I went out to this place was to get down on my hands and knees and dig in the dirt and see what they'd done with it. We have a chance here to prove that a country that almost slaughtered itself out of existence can practice reconciliation  reorganize itself  focus on tomorrow and provide comprehensive  quality health care with minimal outside help. I am grateful for this prize  and I will use it to that end. We could use some more help to do this  but think of what it would mean if we could have a world class health system in Rwanda    in a country with a less than one dollar a day per capita income  one that could save hundreds of millions of lives over the next decade if applied to every similarly situated country on Earth. It's worth a try and I believe it would succeed. Thank you and God bless you. What I want to talk about is  as background  is the idea that cars are art. This is actually quite meaningful to me  because car designers tend to be a little bit low on the totem pole    we don't do coffee table books with just one lamp inside of it    and cars are thought so much as a product that it's a little bit difficult to get into the aesthetic side under the same sort of terminology that one would discuss art. And so cars  as art  brings it into an emotional plane    if you accept that    that you have to deal with on the same level you would with art with a capital A. Now at this point you're going to see a picture of Michelangelo. This is completely different than automobiles. Automobiles are self moving things  right  Elevators are automobiles. And they're not very emotional  they solve a purpose  and certainly automobiles have been around for     years and have made our lives functionally a lot better in many ways  they've also been a real pain in the ass  because automobiles are really the thing we have to solve. We have to solve the pollution  we have to solve the congestion    but that's not what interests me in this speech. What interests me in this speech is cars. Automobiles may be what you use  but cars are what we are  in many ways. And as long as we can solve the problems of automobiles  and I believe we can  with fuel cells or hydrogen  like BMW is really hip on  and lots of other things  then I think we can look past that and try and understand why this hook is in many of us    of this car y ness    and what that means  what we can learn from it. That's what I want to get to. Cars are not a suit of clothes  cars are an avatar. Cars are an expansion of yourself  they take your thoughts  your ideas  your emotions  and they multiply it    your anger  whatever. It's an avatar. It's a super waldo that you happen to be inside of  and if you feel sexy  the car is sexy. And if you're full of road rage  you've got a  Chevy  Like a Rock   right  Cars are a sculpture    did you know this  That every car you see out there is sculpted by hand. Many people think   Well  it's computers  and it's done by machines and stuff like that.  Well  they reproduce it  but the originals are all done by hand. It's done by men and women who believe a lot in their craft. And they put that same kind of tension into the sculpting of a car that you do in a great sculpture that you would go and look at in a museum. That tension between the need to express  the need to discover  then you put something new into it  and at the same time you have bounds of craftsmanship. Rules that say  this is how you handle surfaces  this is what control is all about  this is how you show you're a master of your craft. And that tension  that discovery  that push for something new    and at the same time  that sense of obligation to the regards of craftsmanship    that's as strong in cars as it is in anything. We work in clay  which hasn't changed much since Michelangelo started screwing around with it  and there's a very interesting analogy to that too. Real quickly    Michelangelo once said he's there to  discover the figure within   OK  There we go  the automobile. That was     years right there    did you catch that  Between that one there  and that one there  it changed a lot didn't it  OK  it's not marketing  there's a very interesting car concept here  but the marketing part is not what I want to talk about here. I want to talk about this. Why it means you have to wash a car  what is it  that sensuality you have to touch about it  That's the sculpture that goes into it. That sensuality. And it's done by men and women working just like this  making cars. Now this little quote about sculpture from Henry Moore  I believe that that  pressure within  that Moore's talking about    at least when it comes to cars    comes right back to this idea of the mean. It's that will to live  that need to survive  to express itself  that comes in a car  and takes over people like me. And we tell other people   Do this  do this  do this   until this thing comes alive. We are completely infected. And beauty can be the result of this infectiousness  it's quite wonderful. This sculpture is  of course  at the heart of all of it  and it's really what puts the craftsmanship into our cars. And it's not a whole lot different  really  when they're working like this  or when somebody works like this. It's that same kind of commitment  that same kind of beauty. Now  now I get to the point. I want to talk about cars as art. Art  in the Platonic sense  is truth  it's beauty  and love. Now this is really where designers in car business diverge from the engineers. We don't really have a problem talking about love. We don't have a problem talking about truth or beauty in that sense. That's what we're searching for    when we're working our craft  we are really trying to find that truth out there. We're not trying to find vanity and beauty. We're trying to find the beauty in the truth. However  engineers tend to look at things a little bit more Newtonian  instead of this quantum approach. We're dealing with irrationalisms  and we're dealing with paradoxes that we admit exist  and the engineers tend to look things a little bit more like two and two is four  and if you get  .  it's better  and  .    is even better. And that sometimes leads to bit of a divergence in why we're doing what we're doing. We've pretty much accepted the fact  though  that we are the women in the organization at BMW    BMW is a very manly type business     men  men  men  it's engineers. And we're kind of the female side to that. That's OK  that's cool. You go off and be manly. We're going to be a little bit more female. Because what we're interested in is finding form that's more than just a function. We're interested in finding beauty that's more than just an aesthetic  it's really a truth. And I think this idea of soul  as being at the heart of great cars  is very applicable. You all know it. You know a car when you've seen it  with soul. You know how strong this is. Well  this experience of love  and the experience of design  to me  are interchangeable. And now I'm coming to my story. I discovered something about love and design through a project called Deep Blue. And first of all  you have to go with me for a second  and say  you know  you could take the word  love  out of a lot of things in our society  put the word  design  in  and it still works  like this quote here  you know. It kind of works  you know  You can understand that. It works in truisms.  All is fair in design and war.  Certainly we live in a competitive society. I think this one here  there's a pop song that really describes Philippe Starck for me  you know  this is like you know  this is like puppy love  you know  this is cool right  Toothbrush  cool. It really only gets serious when you look at something like this. OK  This is one substitution that I believe all of us  in design management  are guilty of. And this idea that there is more to love  more to design  when it gets down to your neighbor  your other  it can be physical like this  and maybe in the future it will be. But right now it's in dealing with our own people  our own teams who are doing the creating. So  to my story. The idea of people work is what we work with here  and I have to make a bond with my designers when we're creating BMWs. We have to have a shared intimacy  a shared vision    that means we have to work as one family  we have to understand ourselves that way. There's good times  there's interesting times  and there's some stress times too. You want to do cars  you've got to go outside. You've got to do cars in the rain  you've got to do cars in the snow. That's  by the way  is a presentation we made to our board of directors. We haul their butts out in the snow  too. You want to know cars outside  Well  you've got to stand outside to do this. And because these are artists  they have very artistic temperaments. All right  Now one thing about art is  art is discovery  and art is discovering yourself through your art. Right  And one thing about cars is we're all a little bit like Pygmalion  we are completely in love with our own creations. This is one of my favorite paintings  it really describes our relationship with cars. This is sick beyond belief. But because of this  the intimacy with which we work together as a team takes on a new dimension  a new meaning. We have a shared center  we have a shared focus    that car stays at the middle of all our relationships. And it's my job  in the competitive process  to narrow this down. I heard today about Joseph's death genes that have to go in and kill cell reproduction. You know  that's what I have to do sometimes. We start out with    cars  we narrow it down to five cars  down to three cars  down to two cars  down to one car  and I'm in the middle of that killing  basically. Someone's love  someone's baby. This is very difficult  and you have to have a bond with your team that permits you to do this  because their life is wrapped up in that too. They've got that gene infected in them as well  and they want that to live  more than anything else. Well  this project  Deep Blue  put me in contact with my team in a way that I never expected  and I want to pass it on to you  because I want you to reflect on this  perhaps in your own relationships. We wanted to a do a car which was a complete leap of faith for BMW. We wanted to do a team which was so removed from the way we'd done it  that I only had a phone number that connected me to them. So  what we did was  instead of having a staff of artists that are just your wrist  we decided to free up a team of creative designers and engineers to find out what's the successor to the SUV phenomenon in America. This is      we did this project. And so we sent them off with this team name  Deep Blue. Now many people know Deep Blue from IBM    we actually stole it from them because we figured if anybody read our faxes they'd think we're talking about computers. It turned out it was quite clever because Deep Blue  in a company like BMW  has a hook     Deep Blue   wow  cool name. So people get wrapped up in it. And we took a team of designers  and we sent them off to America. And we gave them a budget  what we thought was a set of deliverables  a timetable  and nothing else. Like I said  I just had a phone number that connected me to them. And a group of engineers worked in Germany  and the idea was they would work separately on this problem of what's the successor to the SUV. They would come together  compare notes. Then they would work apart  come together  and they would produce together a monumental set of diverse opinions that didn't pollute each other's ideas    but at the same time came together and resolved the problems. Hopefully  really understand the customer at its heart  where the customer is  live with them in America. So    sent the team off  and actually something different happened. They went other places. They disappeared  quite honestly  and all I got was postcards. Now  I got some postcards of these guys in Las Vegas  and I got some postcards of these guys in the Grand Canyon  and I got these postcards of Niagara Falls  and pretty soon they're in New York  and I don't know where else. And I'm telling myself   This is going to be a great car  they're doing research that I've never even thought about before.  Right  And they decided that instead of  like  having a studio  and six or seven apartments  it was cheaper to rent Elizabeth Taylor's ex house in Malibu. And    at least they told me it was her house  I guess it was at one time  she had a party there or something. But anyway  this was the house  and they all lived there. Now this is      living  half a dozen people who'd left their    some had left their wives behind and families behind  and they literally lived in this house for the entire six months the project was in America  but the first three months were the most intensive. And one of the young women in the project  she was a fantastic lady  she actually built her room in the bathroom. The bathroom was so big  she built the bed over the bathtub    it's quite fascinating. On the other hand  I didn't know anything about this. OK  Nothing. This is all going on  and all I'm getting is postcards of these guys in Las Vegas  or whatever  saying   Don't worry Chris  this is really going to be good.  OK  So my concept of what a design studio was probably    I wasn't up to speed on where these guys were. However  the engineers back in Munich had taken on this kind of Newtonian solution  and they were trying to find how many cup holders can dance on the head of a pin  and  you know  these really serious questions that are confronting the modern consumer. And one was hoping that these two teams would get together  and this collusion of incredible creativity  under these incredible surroundings  and these incredibly stressed out engineers  would create some incredible solutions. Well  what I didn't know was  and what we found out was    these guys  they can't even like talk to each other under those conditions. You get a divergence of Newtonian and quantum thinking at that point  you have a split in your dialog that is so deep  and so far  that they cannot bring this together at all. And so we had our first meeting  after three months  in Tiburon  which is just up the road from here    you know Tiburon  And the idea was after the first three months of this independent research they would present it all to Dr. Goschel    who is now my boss  and at that time he was co mentor on the project    and they would present their results. We would see where we were going  we would see the first indication of what could be the successive phenomenon to the SUV in America. And so I had these ideas in my head  that this is going to be great. I mean  I'm going to see so much work  it's so intense    I know probably Las Vegas meant a lot about it  and I'm not really sure where the Grand Canyon came in either    but somehow all this is going to come together  and I'm going to see some really great product. So we went to Tiburon  after three months  and the team had gotten together the week before  many days ahead of time. The engineers flew over  and designers got together with them  and they put their presentation together. Well  it turns out that the engineers hadn't done anything. And they hadn't done anything because    kind of  like in car business  engineers are there to solve problems  and we were asking them to create a problem. And the engineers were waiting for the designers to say   This is the problem that we've created  now help us solve it.  And they couldn't talk about it. So what happened was  the engineers showed up with nothing. And the engineers told the designers   If you go in with all your stuff  we'll walk out  we'll walk right out of the project.  So I didn't know any of this  and we got a presentation that had an agenda  looked like this. There was a whole lot of dialog. We spent four hours being told all about vocabulary that needs to be built between engineers and designers. And here I'm expecting at any moment   OK  they're going to turn the page  and I'm going to see the cars  I'm going to see the sketches  I'm going to see maybe some idea of where it's going.  Dialog kept on going  with mental maps of words  and pretty soon it was becoming obvious that instead of being dazzled with brilliance  I was seriously being baffled with bullshit. And if you can imagine what this is like  to have these months of postcard indication of how great this team is working  and they're out there spending all this money  and they're learning  and they're doing all this stuff. I went fucking ballistic  right  I went nuts. You can probably remember Tiburon  it used to look like this. After four hours of this  I stood up  and I took this team apart. I screamed at them  I yelled at them   What the hell are you doing  You're letting me down  you're my designers  you're supposed to be the creative ones  what the hell is going on around here   It was probably one of my better tirades  I have some good ones  but this was probably one of my better ones. And I went into these people  how could they take BMW's money  how could they have a holiday for three months and produce nothing  nothing  Because of course they didn't tell us that they had three station wagons full of drawings  model concepts  pictures    everything I wanted  they'd locked up in the cars  because they had shown solidarity with the engineers    and they'd decided not to show me anything  in order to give the chance for problem solving a chance to start  because they hadn't realized  of course  that they couldn't do problem creating. So we went to lunch    And I've got to tell you  this was one seriously quiet lunch. The engineers all sat at one end of the table  the designers and I sat at the other end of the table  really quiet. And I was just fucking furious  furious. OK  Probably because they had all the fun and I didn't  you know. That's what you get furious about right  And somebody asked me about Catherine  my wife  you know  did she fly out with me or something  I said   No   and it triggered a set of thoughts about my wife. And I recalled that when Catherine and I were married  the priest gave a very nice sermon  and he said something very important. He said   Love is not selfish   he said   Love does not mean counting how many times I say  'I love you.' It doesn't mean you had sex this many times this month  and it's two times less than last month  so that means you don't love me as much. Love is not selfish.  And I thought about this  and I thought   You know  I'm not showing love here. I'm seriously not showing love. I'm in the air  I'm in the air without trust. This cannot be. This cannot be that I'm expecting a certain number of sketches  and to me that's my quantification method for qualifying a team. This cannot be.  So I told them this story. I said   Guys  I'm thinking about something here  this isn't right. I can't have a relationship with you guys based on a premise that is a quantifiable one. Based on a dictate premise that says  'I'm a boss  you do what I say  without trust.'  I said  This can't be.  Actually  we all broke down into tears  to be quite honest about it  because they still could not tell me how much frustration they had built up inside of them  not being able to show me what I wanted  and merely having to ask me to trust them that it would come. And I think we felt much closer that day  we cut a lot of strings that didn't need to be there  and we forged the concept for what real team and creativity is all about. We put the car back at the center of our thoughts  and we put love  I think  truly back into the center of the process. By the way  that team went on to create six different concepts for the next model of what would be the proposal for the next generation after SUVs in America. One of those was the idea of a crossover coupes    you see it downstairs  the X Coupe    they had a lot of fun with that. It was the rendition of our motorcycle  the GS  as Carl Magnusson says   brute iful   as the idea of what could be a motorcycle  if you add two more wheels. And so  in conclusion  my lesson that I wanted to pass on to you  was this one here. I'm also going to steal a little quote out of  Little Prince.  There's a lot to be said about trust and love  if you know that those two words are synonymous for design. I had a very  very meaningful relationship with my team that day  and it's stayed that way ever since. And I hope that you too find that there's more to design  and more towards the art of the design  than doing it yourself. It's true that the trust and the love  that makes it worthwhile. Thanks so much. At the break  I was asked by several people about my comments about the aging debate. And this will be my only comment on it. And that is  I understand that optimists greatly outlive pessimists. What I'm going to tell you about in my    minutes is how we're about to switch from reading the genetic code to the first stages of beginning to write the code ourselves. It's only    years ago this month when we published the first sequence of a free living organism  that of haemophilus influenzae. That took a genome project from    years down to four months. We can now do that same genome project in the order of two to eight hours. So in the last decade  a large number of genomes have been added  most human pathogens  a couple of plants  several insects and several mammals  including the human genome. Genomics at this stage of the thinking from a little over    years ago was  by the end of this year  we might have between three and five genomes sequenced  it's on the order of several hundred. We just got a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation to sequence     genomes this year  as a side project from environmental organisms. So the rate of reading the genetic code has changed. But as we look  what's out there  we've barely scratched the surface on what is available on this planet. Most people don't realize it  because they're invisible  but microbes make up about a half of the Earth's biomass  whereas all animals only make up about one one thousandth of all the biomass. And maybe it's something that people in Oxford don't do very often  but if you ever make it to the sea  and you swallow a mouthful of seawater  keep in mind that each milliliter has about a million bacteria and on the order of    million viruses. Less than       microbial species have been characterized as of two years ago  and so we decided to do something about it. And we started the Sorcerer II Expedition  where we were  as with great oceanographic expeditions  trying to sample the ocean every     miles. We started in Bermuda for our test project  then moved up to Halifax  working down the U.S. East Coast  the Caribbean Sea  the Panama Canal  through to the Galapagos  then across the Pacific  and we're in the process now of working our way across the Indian Ocean. It's very tough duty  we're doing this on a sailing vessel  in part to help excite young people about going into science. The experiments are incredibly simple. We just take seawater and we filter it  and we collect different size organisms on different filters  and then take their DNA back to our lab in Rockville  where we can sequence a hundred million letters of the genetic code every    hours. And with doing this  we've made some amazing discoveries. For example  it was thought that the visual pigments that are in our eyes    there was only one or two organisms in the environment that had these same pigments. It turns out  almost every species in the upper parts of the ocean in warm parts of the world have these same photoreceptors  and use sunlight as the source of their energy and communication. From one site  from one barrel of seawater  we discovered  .  million new genes and as many as        new species. We've extended this to the air now with a grant from the Sloan Foundation. We're measuring how many viruses and bacteria all of us are breathing in and out every day  particularly on airplanes or closed auditoriums. We filter through some simple apparatuses  we collect on the order of a billion microbes from just a day filtering on top of a building in New York City. And we're in the process of sequencing all that at the present time. Just on the data collection side  just where we are through the Galapagos  we're finding that almost every     miles  we see tremendous diversity in the samples in the ocean. Some of these make logical sense  in terms of different temperature gradients. So this is a satellite photograph based on temperatures    red being warm  blue being cold    and we found there's a tremendous difference between the warm water samples and the cold water samples  in terms of abundant species. The other thing that surprised us quite a bit is these photoreceptors detect different wavelengths of light  and we can predict that based on their amino acid sequence. And these vary tremendously from region to region. Maybe not surprisingly  in the deep ocean  where it's mostly blue  the photoreceptors tend to see blue light. When there's a lot of chlorophyll around  they see a lot of green light. But they vary even more  possibly moving towards infrared and ultraviolet in the extremes. Just to try and get an assessment of what our gene repertoire was  we assembled all the data    including all of ours thus far from the expedition  which represents more than half of all the gene data on the planet    and it totaled around    million genes. And we tried to put these into gene families to see what these discoveries are  Are we just discovering new members of known families  or are we discovering new families  And it turns out we have about        major gene families  but every new sample we take in the environment adds in a linear fashion to these new families. So we're at the earliest stages of discovery about basic genes  components and life on this planet. When we look at the so called evolutionary tree  we're up on the upper right hand corner with the animals. Of those roughly    million genes  we only have around        in our genome. And if you take all animals together  we probably share less than        and probably maybe a dozen or more thousand different gene families. I view that these genes are now not only the design components of evolution. And we think in a gene centric view    maybe going back to Richard Dawkins' ideas    than in a genome centric view  which are different constructs of these gene components. Synthetic DNA  the ability to synthesize DNA  has changed at sort of the same pace that DNA sequencing has over the last decade or two  and is getting very rapid and very cheap. Our first thought about synthetic genomics came when we sequenced the second genome back in       and that from mycoplasma genitalium. And we have really nice T shirts that say  you know   I heart my genitalium.  This is actually just a microorganism. But it has roughly     genes. Haemophilus had       genes. And we simply asked the question  if one species needs      another      is there a smaller set of genes that might comprise a minimal operating system  So we started doing transposon mutagenesis. Transposons are just small pieces of DNA that randomly insert in the genetic code. And if they insert in the middle of the gene  they disrupt its function. So we made a map of all the genes that could take transposon insertions and we called those  non essential genes.  But it turns out the environment is very critical for this  and you can only define an essential or non essential gene based on exactly what's in the environment. We also tried to take a more directly intellectual approach with the genomes of    related organisms  and we tried to compare all of those  to see what they had in common. And we got these overlapping circles. And we found only     genes common to all    organisms. The pool expanded a little bit if we ignored one intracellular parasite  it expanded even more when we looked at core sets of genes of around     or so. So we think that we can expand or contract genomes  depending on your point of view here  to maybe     to     genes from the minimal of    . The only way to prove these ideas was to construct an artificial chromosome with those genes in them  and we had to do this in a cassette based fashion. We found that synthesizing accurate DNA in large pieces was extremely difficult. Ham Smith and Clyde Hutchison  my colleagues on this  developed an exciting new method that allowed us to synthesize a       base pair virus in only a two week period that was     percent accurate  in terms of its sequence and its biology. It was a quite exciting experiment    when we just took the synthetic piece of DNA  injected it in the bacteria and all of a sudden  that DNA started driving the production of the virus particles that turned around and then killed the bacteria. This was not the first synthetic virus    a polio virus had been made a year before    but it was only one ten thousandth as active and it took three years to do. This is a cartoon of the structure of phi X    . This is a case where the software now builds its own hardware  and that's the notions that we have with biology. People immediately jump to concerns about biological warfare  and I had recent testimony before a Senate committee  and a special committee the U.S. government has set up to review this area. And I think it's important to keep reality in mind  versus what happens with people's imaginations. Basically  any virus that's been sequenced today    that genome can be made. And people immediately freak out about things about Ebola or smallpox  but the DNA from this organism is not infective. So even if somebody made the smallpox genome  that DNA itself would not cause infections. The real concern that security departments have is designer viruses. And there's only two countries  the U.S. and the former Soviet Union  that had major efforts on trying to create biological warfare agents. If that research is truly discontinued  there should be very little activity on the know how to make designer viruses in the future. I think single cell organisms are possible within two years. And possibly eukaryotic cells  those that we have  are possible within a decade. So we're now making several dozen different constructs  because we can vary the cassettes and the genes that go into this artificial chromosome. The key is  how do you put all of the others  We start with these fragments  and then we have a homologous recombination system that reassembles those into a chromosome. This is derived from an organism  deinococcus radiodurans  that can take three million rads of radiation and not be killed. It reassembles its genome after this radiation burst in about    to    hours  after its chromosomes are literally blown apart. This organism is ubiquitous on the planet  and exists perhaps now in outer space due to all our travel there. This is a glass beaker after about half a million rads of radiation. The glass started to burn and crack  while the microbes sitting in the bottom just got happier and happier. Here's an actual picture of what happens  the top of this shows the genome after  .  million rads of radiation. The chromosome is literally blown apart. And here's that same DNA automatically reassembled    hours later. It's truly stunning that these organisms can do that  and we probably have thousands  if not tens of thousands  of different species on this planet that are capable of doing that. After these genomes are synthesized  the first step is just transplanting them into a cell without a genome. So we think synthetic cells are going to have tremendous potential  not only for understanding the basis of biology but for hopefully environmental and society issues. For example  from the third organism we sequenced  Methanococcus jannaschii    it lives in boiling water temperatures  its energy source is hydrogen and all its carbon comes from CO  it captures back from the environment. So we know lots of different pathways  thousands of different organisms now that live off of CO   and can capture that back. So instead of using carbon from oil for synthetic processes  we have the chance of using carbon and capturing it back from the atmosphere  converting that into biopolymers or other products. We have one organism that lives off of carbon monoxide  and we use as a reducing power to split water to produce hydrogen and oxygen. Also  there's numerous pathways that can be engineered metabolizing methane. And DuPont has a major program with Statoil in Norway to capture and convert the methane from the gas fields there into useful products. Within a short while  I think there's going to be a new field called  Combinatorial Genomics   because with these new synthesis capabilities  these vast gene array repertoires and the homologous recombination  we think we can design a robot to make maybe a million different chromosomes a day. And therefore  as with all biology  you get selection through screening  whether you're screening for hydrogen production  or chemical production  or just viability. To understand the role of these genes is going to be well within reach. We're trying to modify photosynthesis to produce hydrogen directly from sunlight. Photosynthesis is modulated by oxygen  and we have an oxygen insensitive hydrogenase that we think will totally change this process. We're also combining cellulases  the enzymes that break down complex sugars into simple sugars and fermentation in the same cell for producing ethanol. Pharmaceutical production is already under way in major laboratories using microbes. The chemistry from compounds in the environment is orders of magnitude more complex than our best chemists can produce. I think future engineered species could be the source of food  hopefully a source of energy  environmental remediation and perhaps replacing the petrochemical industry. Let me just close with ethical and policy studies. We delayed the start of our experiments in      until we completed a year and a half bioethical review as to whether we should try and make an artificial species. Every major religion participated in this. It was actually a very strange study  because the various religious leaders were using their scriptures as law books  and they couldn't find anything in them prohibiting making life  so it must be OK. The only ultimate concerns were biological warfare aspects of this  but gave us the go ahead to start these experiments for the reasons we were doing them. Right now the Sloan Foundation has just funded a multi institutional study on this  to work out what the risk and benefits to society are  and the rules that scientific teams such as my own should be using in this area  and we're trying to set good examples as we go forward. These are complex issues. Except for the threat of bio terrorism  they're very simple issues in terms of  can we design things to produce clean energy  perhaps revolutionizing what developing countries can do and provide through various simple processes. Thank you very much. As you pointed out  every time you come here  you learn something. This morning  the world's experts from I guess three or four different companies on building seats  I think concluded that ultimately  the solution is  people shouldn't sit down. I could have told them that. Yesterday  the automotive guys gave us some new insights. They pointed out that  I believe it was between    and    years from today  they will be steering cars by wire  without all that mechanical stuff. That's reassuring. They then pointed out that there'd be  sort of  the other controls by wire  to get rid of all that mechanical stuff. That's pretty good  but why not get rid of the wires  Then you don't need anything to control the car  except thinking about it. I would love to talk about the technology  and sometime  in what's past the    minutes  I'll be happy to talk to all the techno geeks around here about what's in here. But if I had one thing to say about this  before we get to first  it would be that from the time we started building this  the big idea wasn't the technology. It really was a big idea in technology when we started applying it in the iBOT for the disabled community. The big idea here is  I think  a new piece of a solution to a fairly big problem in transportation. And maybe to put that in perspective  there's so much data on this  I'll be happy to give it to you in different forms. You never know what strikes the fancy of whom  but everybody is perfectly willing to believe the car changed the world. And Henry Ford  just about     years ago  started cranking out Model Ts. What I don't think most people think about is the context of how technology is applied. For instance  in that time     percent of America lived either on farms or in small towns. So  the car    the horseless carriage that replaced the horse and carriage    was a big deal  it went twice as fast as a horse and carriage. It was half as long. And it was an environmental improvement  because  for instance  in      they outlawed horses and buggies in downtown Manhattan  because you can imagine what the roads look like when you have a million horses  and a million of them urinating and doing other things  and the typhoid and other problems created were almost unimaginable. So the car was the clean environmental alternative to a horse and buggy. It also was a way for people to get from their farm to a farm  or their farm to a town  or from a town to a city. It all made sense  with    percent of the people living there. By the     s  we started connecting all the towns together with what a lot of people claim is the eighth wonder of the world  the highway system. And it is certainly a wonder. And by the way  as I take shots at old technologies  I want to assure everybody  and particularly the automotive industry    who's been very supportive of us    that I don't think this in any way competes with airplanes  or cars. But think about where the world is today.    percent of the global population now lives in cities. That's  .  billion people. We've solved all the transportation problems that have changed the world to get it to where we are today.     years ago  sailing ships started getting reliable enough  we found a new continent.     years ago  locomotives got efficient enough  steam power  that we turned the continent into a country. Over the last hundred years  we started building cars  and then over the    years we've connected every city to every other city in an extraordinarily efficient way  and we have a very high standard of living as a consequence of that. But during that entire process  more and more people have been born  and more and more people are moving to cities. China alone is going to move four to six hundred million people into cities in the next decade and a half. And so  nobody  I think  would argue that airplanes  in the last    years  have turned the continent and the country now into a neighborhood. And if you just look at how technology has been applied  we've solved all the long range  high speed  high volume  large weight problems of moving things around. Nobody would want to give them up. And I certainly wouldn't want to give up my airplane  or my helicopter  or my Humvee  or my Porsche. I love them all. I don't keep any of them in my living room. The fact is  the last mile is the problem  and half the world now lives in dense cities. And people spend  depending on who they are  between    and    percent of their energy getting around on foot. I think there's    I don't know what data would impress you  but how about     percent of the refined fuel produced in the world is consumed by cars in metropolitan areas in the United States. Three million people die every year in cities due to bad air  and almost all particulate pollution on this planet is produced by transportation devices  particularly sitting in cities. And again  I say that not to attack any industry  I think    I really do    I love my airplane  and cars on highways moving    miles an hour are extraordinarily efficient  both from an engineering point of view  an energy consumption point of view  and a utility point of view. And we all love our cars  and I do. The problem is  you get into the city and you want to go four blocks  it's neither fun nor efficient nor productive. It's not sustainable. If    in China  in the year           million people used bicycles   .  million people used cars. If five percent of that population became  quote  middle class  and wanted to go the way we've gone in the last hundred years at the same time that    percent of their population are moving into cities of the size and density of Manhattan  every six weeks    it isn't sustainable environmentally  it isn't sustainable economically    there just ain't enough oil    and it's not sustainable politically. I mean  what are we fighting over right now  We can make it complicated  but what's the world fighting over right now  So it seemed to me that somebody had to work on that last mile  and it was dumb luck. We were working on iBOTs  but once we made this  we instantly decided it could be a great alternative to jet skis. You don't need the water. Or snowmobiles. You don't need the snow. Or skiing. It's just fun  and people love to move around doing fun things. And every one of those industries  by the way    just golf carts alone is a multi billion dollar industry. But rather than go license this off  which is what we normally do  it seemed to me that if we put all our effort not into the technology  but into an understanding of a world that's solved all its other problems  but has somehow come to accept that cities    which  right back from ancient Greece on  were meant to walk around  cities that were architected and built for people    now have a footprint that  while we've solved every other transportation problem    and it's like Moore's law. I mean  look at the time it took to cross a continent in a Conestoga wagon  then on a railroad  then an airplane. Every other form of transportation's been improved. In       years  we've gone backwards in getting around cities. They've gotten bigger  they're spread out. The most expensive real estate on this planet in every city    Wilshire Boulevard  or Fifth Avenue  or Tokyo  or Paris    the most expensive real estate is their downtowns.    percent of the landmass of our cities are parked cars. The    largest cities in the world. So you wonder  what if cities could give to their pedestrians what we take for granted as we now go between cities  What if you could make them fun  attractive  clean  environmentally friendly  What if it would make it a little bit more palatable to have access via this  as that last link to mass transit  to get out to your cars so we can all live in the suburbs and use our cars the way we want  and then have our cities energized again  We thought it would be really neat to do that  and one of the problems we really were worried about is  how do we get legal on the sidewalk  Because technically I've got motors  I've got wheels    I'm a motor vehicle. I don't look like a motor vehicle. I have the same footprint as a pedestrian  I have the same unique capability to deal with other pedestrians in a crowded space. I took this down to Ground Zero  and knocked my way through crowds for an hour. I'm a pedestrian. But the law typically lags technology by a generation or two  and if we get told we don't belong on the sidewalk  we have two choices. We're a recreational vehicle that doesn't really matter  and I don't spend my time doing that kind of stuff. Or maybe we should be out in the street in front of a Greyhound bus or a vehicle. We've been so concerned about that  we went to the Postmaster General of the United States  as the first person we ever showed on the outside  and said   Put your people on it. Everybody trusts their postman. And they belong on the sidewalks  and they'll use it seriously.  He agreed. We went to a number of police departments that want their police officers back in the neighborhood on the beat  carrying    pounds of stuff. They love it. And I can't believe a policeman is going to give themselves a ticket. So we've been working really  really hard  but we knew that the technology would not be as hard to develop as an attitude about what's important  and how to apply the technology. We went out and we found some visionary people with enough money to let us design and build these things  and in hopefully enough time to get them accepted. So  I'm happy  really  I am happy to talk about this technology as much as you want. And yes  it's really fun  and yes  you should all go out and try it. But if I could ask you to do one thing  it's not to think about it as a piece of technology  but just imagine that  although we all understand somehow that it's reasonable that we use our       pound machine  which can go    miles an hour  that can bring you everywhere you want to go  and somehow it's also what we used for the last mile  and it's broken  and it doesn't work. One of the more exciting things that occurred to us about why it might get accepted  happened out here in California. A few weeks ago  after we launched it  we were here with a news crew on Venice Beach  zipping up and back  and he's marveling at the technology  and meanwhile bicycles are zipping by  and skateboarders are zipping by  and a little old lady    I mean  if you looked in the dictionary  a little old lady    came by me    and now that I'm on this  I'm the height of a normal adult now    and she just stops  and the camera is there  and she looks up at me and says   Can I try that   And what was I    you know  how are you going to say anything  And so I said   Sure.  So I get off  and she gets on  and with a little bit of the usual  ah  then she turns around  and she goes about    feet  and she turns back around  and she's all smiles. And she comes back to me and she stops  and she says   Finally  they made something for us.  And the camera is looking down at her. I'm thinking   Wow  that was great       please lady  don't say another word.  And the camera is down at her  and this guy has to put the microphone in her face  said   What do you mean by that   And I figured   It's all over now   and she looks up and she says   Well   she's still watching these guys go  she says   I can't ride a bike   no  she says   I can't use a skateboard  and I've never used roller blades   she knew them by name  she says   And it's been    years since I rode a bicycle.  Then she looks up  she's looking up  and she says   And I'm    years old  and I don't drive a car anymore. I still have to get to the store  and I can't carry a lot of things.  And it suddenly occurred to me  that among my many fears  were not just that the bureaucracy and the regulators and the legislators might not get it    it was that  fundamentally  you believe there's pressure among the people not to invade the most precious little bit of space left  the sidewalks in these cities. When you look at the    inches of legal requirement for sidewalk  then the eight foot for the parked car  then the three lanes  and then the other eight feet    it's    that little piece is all that's there. But she looks up and says this  and it occurs to me  well  kids aren't going to mind these things  and they don't vote  and business people and then young adults aren't going to mind these things    they're pretty cool    so I guess subliminally I was worried that it's the older population that's going to worry. So  having seen this  and having worried about it for eight years  the first thing I do is pick up my phone and ask our marketing and regulatory guys  call AARP  get an appointment right away. We've got to show them this thing. And they took it to Washington  they showed them  and they're going to be involved now  watching how these things get absorbed in a number of cities  like Atlanta  where we're doing trials to see if it really can  in fact  help re energize their downtown. The bottom line is  whether you believe the United Nations  or any of the other think tanks    in the next    years  all human population growth on this planet will be in cities. In Asia alone  it will be over a billion people. They learned to start with cell phones. They didn't have to take the     year trip we took. They start at the top of the technology food chain. We've got to start building cities and human environments where a     pound person can go a couple of miles in a dense  rich  green space environment  without being in a       pound machine to do it. Cars were not meant for parallel parking  they're wonderful machines to go between cities  but just think about it  we've solved all the long range  high speed problems. The Greeks went from the theater of Dionysus to the Parthenon in their sandals. You do it in your sneakers. Not much has changed. If this thing goes only three times as fast as walking    three times    a    minute walk becomes    minutes. Your choice  when living in a city  if it's now    minutes    because at    minutes you want an alternative  whether it's a bus  a train    we've got to build an infrastructure    a light rail    or you're going to keep parking those cars. But if you could put a pin in most cities  and imagine how far you could  if you had the time  walk in one half hour  it's the city. If you could make it fun  and make it eight or    minutes  you can't find your car  un park your car  move your car  re park your car and go somewhere  you can't get to a cab or a subway. We could change the way people allocate their resources  the way this planet uses its energy  make it more fun. And we're hoping to some extent history will say we were right. That's Segway. This is a Stirling cycle engine  this had been confused by a lot of things we're doing. This little beast  right now  is producing a few hundred watts of electricity. Yes  it could be attached to this  and yes  on a kilogram of propane  you could drive from New York to Boston if you so choose. Perhaps more interesting about this little engine is it'll burn any fuel  because some of you might be skeptical about the capability of this to have an impact  where most of the world you can't simply plug into your     volt outlet. We've been working on this  actually  as an alternative energy source  starting way back with Johnson   Johnson  to run an iBOT  because the best batteries you could get       watt hours per kilogram in lead     watt hours per kilogram nickel cadmium     watt hours per kilogram in nickel metal hydride     watt hours per kilogram in lithium        watt hours of energy in every kilogram of propane or gasoline    which is why nobody drives electric cars. But  in any event  if you can burn it with the same efficiency    because it's external combustion    as your kitchen stove  if you can burn any fuel  it turns out to be pretty neat. It makes just enough electricity to  for instance  do this  which at night is enough electricity  in the rest of the world  as Mr. Holly    Dr. Holly    pointed out  can run computers and a light bulb. But more interestingly  the thermodynamics of this say  you're never going to get more than    percent efficiency. It doesn't matter much    it says if you get     watts of electricity  you'll get     or     watts of heat. If you wanted to boil water and re condense it at a rate of    gallons an hour  it takes about     a little over   .  kilowatt           watts of continuous power    to do it. That's so much energy  you couldn't afford to desalinate or clean water in this country that way. Certainly  in the rest of the world  your choice is to devastate the place  turning everything that will burn into heat  or drink the water that's available. The number one cause of death on this planet among humans is bad water. Depending on whose numbers you believe  it's between    and        people per day. We don't need sophisticated heart transplants around the world. We need water. And women shouldn't have to spend four hours a day looking for it  or watching their kids die. We figured out how to put a vapor compression distiller on this thing  with a counter flow heat exchanger to take the waste heat  then using a little bit of the electricity control that process  and for     watts  which is a little more than half of its waste heat  it will make    gallons an hour of distilled water from anything that comes into it to cool it. So if we put this box on here in a few years  could we have a solution to transportation  electricity  and communication  and maybe drinkable water in a sustainable package that weighs    pounds  I don't know  but we'll try it. I better shut up. Good morning everyone. First of all  it's been fantastic being here over these past few days. And secondly  I feel it's a great honor to kind of wind up this extraordinary gathering of people  these amazing talks that we've had. I feel that I've fitted in  in many ways  to some of the things that I've heard. I came directly here from the deep  deep tropical rainforest in Ecuador  where I was out    you could only get there by a plane    with indigenous people with paint on their faces and parrot feathers on their headdresses  where these people are fighting to try and keep the oil companies  and keep the roads  out of their forests. They're fighting to develop their own way of living within the forest in a world that's clean  a world that isn't contaminated  a world that isn't polluted. And what was so amazing to me  and what fits right in with what we're all talking about here at TED  is that there  right in the middle of this rainforest  was some solar panels    the first in that part of Ecuador    and that was mainly to bring water up by pump so that the women wouldn't have to go down. The water was cleaned  but because they got a lot of batteries  they were able to store a lot of electricity. So every house    and there were  I think  eight houses in this little community    could have light for  I think it was about half an hour each evening. And there is the Chief  in all his regal finery  with a laptop computer. And this man  he has been outside  but he's gone back  and he was saying   You know  we have suddenly jumped into a whole new era  and we didn't even know about the white man    years ago  and now here we are with laptop computers  and there are some things we want to learn from the modern world. We want to know about health care. We want to know about what other people do    we're interested in it. And we want to learn other languages. We want to know English and French and perhaps Chinese  and we're good at languages.  So there he is with his little laptop computer  but fighting against the might of the pressures    because of the debt  the foreign debt of Ecuador    fighting the pressure of World Bank  IMF  and of course the people who want to exploit the forests and take out the oil. And so  coming directly from there to here. But  of course  my real field of expertise lies in an even different kind of civilization    I can't really call it a civilization. A different way of life  a different being. We've talked earlier    this wonderful talk by Wade Davis about the different cultures of the humans around the world    but the world is not composed only of human beings  there are also other animal beings. And I propose to bring into this TED conference  as I always do around the world  the voice of the animal kingdom. Too often we just see a few slides  or a bit of film  but these beings have voices that mean something. And so  I want to give you a greeting  as from a chimpanzee in the forests of Tanzania    Ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  I've been studying chimpanzees in Tanzania since     . During that time  there have been modern technologies that have really transformed the way that field biologists do their work. For example  for the first time  a few years ago  by simply collecting little fecal samples we were able to have them analyzed    to have DNA profiling done    so for the first time  we actually know which male chimps are the fathers of each individual infant. Because the chimps have a very promiscuous mating society. So this opens up a whole new avenue of research. And we use GSI    geographic whatever it is  GSI    to determine the range of the chimps. And we're using    you can see that I'm not really into this kind of stuff    but we're using satellite imagery to look at the deforestation in the area. And of course  there's developments in infrared  so you can watch animals at night  and equipment for recording by video  and tape recording is getting lighter and better. So in many  many ways  we can do things today that we couldn't do when I began in     . Especially when chimpanzees  and other animals with large brains  are studied in captivity  modern technology is helping us to search for the upper levels of cognition in some of these non human animals. So that we know today  they're capable of performances that would have been thought absolutely impossible by science when I began. I think the chimpanzee in captivity who is the most skilled in intellectual performance is one called Ai in Japan    her name means love    and she has a wonderfully sensitive partner working with her. She loves her computer    she'll leave her big group  and her running water  and her trees and everything. And she'll come in to sit at this computer    it's like a video game for a kid  she's hooked. She's     by the way  and she does things with her computer screen and a touch pad that she can do faster than most humans. She does very complex tasks  and I haven't got time to go into them  but the amazing thing about this female is she doesn't like making mistakes. If she has a bad run  and her score isn't good  she'll come and reach up and tap on the glass    because she can't see the experimenter    which is asking to have another go. And her concentration    she's already concentrated hard for    minutes or so  and now she wants to do it all over again  just for the satisfaction of having done it better. And the food is not important    she does get a tiny reward  like one raisin for a correct response    but she will do it for nothing  if you tell her beforehand. So here we are  a chimpanzee using a computer. Chimpanzees  gorillas  orangutans also learn human sign language. But the point is that when I was first in Gombe in         I remember so well  so vividly  as though it was yesterday    the first time  when I was going through the vegetation  the chimpanzees were still running away from me  for the most part  although some were a little bit acclimatized    and I saw this dark shape  hunched over a termite mound  and I peered with my binoculars. It was  fortunately  one adult male whom I'd named David Greybeard    and by the way  science at that time was telling me that I shouldn't name the chimps  they should all have numbers  that was more scientific. Anyway  David Greybeard    and I saw that he was picking little pieces of grass and using them to fish termites from their underground nest. And not only that    he would sometimes pick a leafy twig and strip the leaves    modifying an object to make it suitable for a specific purpose    the beginning of tool making. The reason this was so exciting and such a breakthrough is at that time  it was thought that humans  and only humans  used and made tools. When I was at school  we were defined as man  the toolmaker. So that when Louis Leakey  my mentor  heard this news  he said   Ah  we must now redefine 'man ' redefine 'tool ' or accept chimpanzees as humans.  We now know that at Gombe alone  there are nine different ways in which chimpanzees use different objects for different purposes. Moreover  we know that in different parts of Africa  wherever chimps have been studied  there are completely different tool using behaviors. And because it seems that these patterns are passed from one generation to the next  through observation  imitation and practice    that is a definition of human culture. What we find is that over these    odd years that I and others have been studying chimpanzees and the other great apes  and  as I say  other mammals with complex brains and social systems  we have found that after all  there isn't a sharp line dividing humans from the rest of the animal kingdom. It's a very wuzzy line. It's getting wuzzier all the time as we find animals doing things that we  in our arrogance  used to think was just human. The chimps    there's no time to discuss their fascinating lives    but they have this long childhood  five years of suckling and sleeping with the mother  and then another three  four or five years of emotional dependence on her  even when the next child is born. The importance of learning in that time  when behavior is flexible    and there's an awful lot to learn in chimpanzee society. The long term affectionate supportive bonds that develop throughout this long childhood with the mother  with the brothers and sisters  and which can last through a lifetime  which may be up to    years. They can actually live longer than    in captivity  so we've only done    years in the wild so far. And we find chimps are capable of true compassion and altruism. We find in their non verbal communication    this is very rich    they have a lot of sounds  which they use in different circumstances  but they also use touch  posture  gesture  and what do they do  They kiss  they embrace  they hold hands. They pat one another on the back  they swagger  they shake their fist    the kind of things that we do  and they do them in the same kind of context. They have very sophisticated cooperation. Sometimes they hunt    not that often  but when they hunt  they show sophisticated cooperation  and they share the prey. We find that they show emotions  similar to    maybe sometimes the same    as those that we describe in ourselves as happiness  sadness  fear  despair. They know mental as well as physical suffering. And I don't have time to go into the information that will prove some of these things to you  save to say that there are very bright students  in the best universities  studying emotions in animals  studying personalities in animals. We know that chimpanzees and some other creatures can recognize themselves in mirrors     self  as opposed to  other.  They have a sense of humor  and these are the kind of things which traditionally have been thought of as human prerogatives. But this teaches us a new respect    and it's a new respect not only for the chimpanzees  I suggest  but some of the other amazing animals with whom we share this planet. Once we're prepared to admit that after all  we're not the only beings with personalities  minds and above all feelings  and then we start to think about ways we use and abuse so many other sentient  sapient creatures on this planet  it really gives cause for deep shame  at least for me. So  the sad thing is that these chimpanzees    who've perhaps taught us  more than any other creature  a little humility    are in the wild  disappearing very fast. They're disappearing for the reasons that all of you in this room know only too well. The deforestation  the growth of human populations  needing more land. They're disappearing because some timber companies go in with clear cutting. They're disappearing in the heart of their range in Africa because the big multinational logging companies have come in and made roads    as they want to do in Ecuador and other parts where the forests remain untouched    to take out oil or timber. And this has led in Congo basin  and other parts of the world  to what is known as the bush meat trade. This means that although for hundreds  perhaps thousands of years  people have lived in those forests  or whatever habitat it is  in harmony with their world  just killing the animals they need for themselves and their families    now  suddenly  because of the roads  the hunters can go in from the towns. They shoot everything  every single thing that moves that's bigger than a small rat  they sun dry it or smoke it. And now they've got transport  they take it on the logging trucks or the mining trucks into the towns where they sell it. And people will pay more for bush meat  as it's called  than for domestic meat    it's culturally preferred. And it's not sustainable  and the huge logging camps in the forest are now demanding meat  so the Pygmy hunters in the Congo basin who've lived there with their wonderful way of living for so many hundreds of years are now corrupted. They're given weapons  they shoot for the logging camps  they get money. Their culture is being destroyed  along with the animals upon whom they depend. So  when the logging camp moves  there's nothing left. We talked already about the loss of human cultural diversity  and I've seen it happening with my own eyes. And the grim picture in Africa    I love Africa  and what do we see in Africa  We see deforestation  we see the desert spreading  we see massive hunger  we see disease and we see population growth in areas where there are more people living on a certain piece of land than the land can possibly support  and they're too poor to buy food from elsewhere. Were the people that we heard about yesterday  on the Easter Island  who cut down their last tree    were they stupid  Didn't they know what was happening  Of course  but if you've seen the crippling poverty in some of these parts of the world it isn't a question of  Let's leave the tree for tomorrow.   How am I going to feed my family today  Maybe I can get just a few dollars from this last tree which will keep us going a little bit longer  and then we'll pray that something will happen to save us from the inevitable end.  So  this is a pretty grim picture. The one thing we have  which makes us so different from chimpanzees or other living creatures  is this sophisticated spoken language    a language with which we can tell children about things that aren't here. We can talk about the distant past  plan for the distant future  discuss ideas with each other  so that the ideas can grow from the accumulated wisdom of a group. We can do it by talking to each other  we can do it through video  we can do it through the written word. And we are abusing this great power we have to be wise stewards  and we're destroying the world. In the developed world  in a way  it's worse  because we have so much access to knowledge of the stupidity of what we're doing. Do you know  we're bringing little babies into a world where  in many places  the water is poisoning them  And the air is harming them  and the food that's grown from the contaminated land is poisoning them. And that's not just in the far away developing world  that's everywhere. Do you know we all have about    chemicals in our bodies we didn't have about    years ago  And so many of these diseases  like asthma and certain kinds of cancers  are on the increase around places where our filthy toxic waste is dumped. We're harming ourselves around the world  as well as harming the animals  as well as harming nature herself    Mother Nature  that brought us into being  Mother Nature  where I believe we need to spend time  where there's trees and flowers and birds for our good psychological development. And yet  there are hundreds and hundreds of children in the developed world who never see nature  because they're growing up in concrete and all they know is virtual reality  with no opportunity to go and lie in the sun  or in the forest  with the dappled sun specks coming down from the canopy above. As I was traveling around the world  you know  I had to leave the forest    that's where I love to be. I had to leave these fascinating chimpanzees for my students and field staff to continue studying because  finding they dwindled from about two million     years ago to about         now  I knew I had to leave the forest to do what I could to raise awareness around the world. And the more I talked about the chimpanzees' plight  the more I realized the fact that everything's interconnected  and the problems of the developing world so often stem from the greed of the developed world  and everything was joining together  and making    not sense  hope lies in sense  you said    it's making a nonsense. How can we do it  Somebody said that yesterday. And as I was traveling around  I kept meeting young people who'd lost hope. They were feeling despair  they were feeling   Well  it doesn't matter what we do  eat  drink and be merry  for tomorrow we die. Everything is hopeless    we're always being told so by the media.  And then I met some who were angry  and anger that can turn to violence  and we're all familiar with that. And I have three little grandchildren  and when some of these students would say to me at high school or university  they'd say   We're angry   or  We're filled with despair  because we feel you've compromised our future  and there's nothing we can do about it.  And I looked in the eyes of my little grandchildren  and think how much we've harmed this planet since I was their age. I feel this deep shame  and that's why in      in Tanzania  I started a program that's called Roots and Shoots. There's little brochures all around outside  and if any of you have anything to do with children and care about their future  I beg that you pick up that brochure. And Roots and Shoots is a program for hope. Roots make a firm foundation. Shoots seem tiny  but to reach the sun they can break through brick walls. See the brick walls as all the problems that we've inflicted on this planet. Then  you see  it is a message of hope. Hundreds and thousands of young people around the world can break through  and can make this a better world. And the most important message of Roots and Shoots is that every single individual makes a difference. Every individual has a role to play. Every one of us impacts the world around us everyday  and you scientists know that you can't actually    even if you stay in bed all day  you're breathing oxygen and giving out CO   and probably going to the loo  and things like that    you're making a difference in the world. So  the Roots and Shoots program involves youth in three kinds of projects. And these are projects to make the world around them a better place. One project to show care and concern for your own human community. One for animals  including domestic animals    and I have to say  I learned everything I know about animal behavior even before I got to Gombe and the chimps from my dog  Rusty  who was my childhood companion. And the third kind of project  something for the local environment. So what the kids do depends first of all  how old are they    and we go now from pre school right through university. It's going to depend whether they're inner city or rural. It's going to depend if they're wealthy or impoverished. It's going to depend which part  say  of America they're in. We're in every state now  and the problems in Florida are different from the problems in New York. It's going to depend on which country they're in    and we're already in    plus countries  with about       active groups    and there are groups all over the place that I keep hearing about that I've never even heard of  because the kids are taking the program and spreading it themselves. Why  Because they're buying into it  and they're the ones who get to decide what they're going to do. It isn't something that their parents tell them  or their teachers tell them. That's effective  but if they decide themselves   We want to clean this river and put the fish back that used to be there. We want to clear away the toxic soil from this area and have an organic garden. We want to go and spend time with the old people and hear their stories and record their oral histories. We want to go and work in a dog shelter. We want to learn about animals. We want ...   You know  it goes on and on  and this is very hopeful for me. As I travel around the world     days a year  everywhere there's a group of Roots and Shoots of different ages. Everywhere there are children with shining eyes saying   Look at the difference we've made.  And now comes the technology into it  because with this new way of communicating electronically these kids can communicate with each other around the world. And if anyone is interested to help us  we've got so many ideas but we need help    we need help to create the right kind of system that will help these young people to communicate their excitement. But also    and this is so important    to communicate their despair  to say   We've tried this and it doesn't work  and what shall we do   And then  lo and behold  there's another group answering these kids who may be in America  or maybe this is a group in Israel  saying   Yeah  you did it a little bit wrong. This is how you should do it.  The philosophy is very simple. We do not believe in violence. No violence  no bombs  no guns. That's not the way to solve problems. Violence leads to violence  at least in my view. So how do we solve  The tools for solving the problems are knowledge and understanding. Know the facts  but see how they fit in the big picture. Hard work and persistence   don't give up    and love and compassion leading to respect for all life. How many more minutes  Two  one  Chris Anderson  One    one to two. Jane Goodall  Two  two  I'm going to take two. Are you going to come and drag me off  Anyway    so basically  Roots and Shoots is beginning to change young people's lives. It's what I'm devoting most of my energy to. And I believe that a group like this can have a very major impact  not just because you can share technology with us  but because so many of you have children. And if you take this program out  and give it to your children  they have such a good opportunity to go out and do good  because they've got parents like you. And it's been so clear how much you all care about trying to make this world a better place. It's very encouraging. But the kids do ask me    and this won't take more than two minutes  I promise    the kids say   Dr. Jane  do you really have hope for the future  You travel  you see all these horrible things happening.  Firstly  the human brain    I don't need to say anything about that. Now that we know what the problems are around the world  human brains like yours are rising to solve those problems. And we've talked a lot about that. Secondly  the resilience of nature. We can destroy a river  and we can bring it back to life. We can see a whole area desolated  and it can be brought back to bloom again  with time or a little help. And thirdly  the last speaker talked about    or the speaker before last  talked about the indomitable human spirit. We are surrounded by the most amazing people who do things that seem to be absolutely impossible. Nelson Mandela    I take a little piece of limestone from Robben Island Prison  where he labored for    years  and came out with so little bitterness  he could lead his people from the horror of apartheid without a bloodbath. Even after the   th of September    and I was in New York and I felt the fear    nevertheless  there was so much human courage  so much love and so much compassion. And then as I went around the country after that and felt the fear    the fear that was leading to people feeling they couldn't worry about the environment any more  in case they seemed not to be patriotic    and I was trying to encourage them  somebody came up with a little quotation from Mahatma Gandhi   If you look back through human history  you see that every evil regime has been overcome by good.  And just after that a woman brought me this little bell  and I want to end on this note. She said   If you're talking about hope and peace  ring this. This bell is made from metal from a defused landmine  from the killing fields of Pol Pot    one of the most evil regimes in human history    where people are now beginning to put their lives back together after the regime has crumbled. So  yes  there is hope  and where is the hope  Is it out there with the politicians  It's in our hands. It's in your hands and my hands and those of our children. It's really up to us. We're the ones who can make a difference. If we lead lives where we consciously leave the lightest possible ecological footprints  if we buy the things that are ethical for us to buy and don't buy the things that are not  we can change the world overnight. Thank you. Imagine spending seven years at MIT and research laboratories  only to find out that you're a performance artist. I'm also a software engineer  and I make lots of different kinds of art with the computer. And I think the main thing that I'm interested in is trying to find a way of making the computer into a personal mode of expression. And many of you out there are the heads of Macromedia and Microsoft  and in a way those are my bane  I think there's a great homogenizing force that software imposes on people and limits the way they think about what's possible on the computer. Of course  it's also a great liberating force that makes possible  you know  publishing and so forth  and standards  and so on. But  in a way  the computer makes possible much more than what most people think  and my art has just been about trying to find a personal way of using the computer  and so I end up writing software to do that. Chris has asked me to do a short performance  and so I'm going to take just this time    maybe    minutes    to do that  and hopefully at the end have just a moment to show you a couple of my other projects in video form. Thank you. We've got about a minute left. I'd just like to show a clip from a most recent project. I did a performance with two singers who specialize in making strange noises with their mouths. And this just came off last September at ARS Electronica  we repeated it in England. And the idea is to visualize their speech and song behind them with a large screen. We used a computer vision tracking system in order to know where they were. And since we know where their heads are  and we have a wireless mic on them that we're processing the sound from  we're able to create visualizations which are linked very tightly to what they're doing with their speech. This will take about    seconds or so. He's making a  kind of  cheek flapping sound. Well  suffice it to say it's not all like that  but that's part of it. Thanks very much. There's always lots more. I'm overtime  so I just wanted to say you can  if you're in New York  you can check out my work at the Whitney Biennial next week  and also at Bitforms Gallery in Chelsea. And with that  I think I should give up the stage  so  thank you so much. It is a thrill to be here at a conference that's devoted to  Inspired by Nature     you can imagine. And I'm also thrilled to be in the foreplay section. Did you notice this section is foreplay  Because I get to talk about one of my favorite critters  which is the Western Grebe. You haven't lived until you've seen these guys do their courtship dance. I was on Bowman Lake in Glacier National Park  which is a long  skinny lake with sort of mountains upside down in it  and my partner and I have a rowing shell. And so we were rowing  and one of these Western Grebes came along. And what they do for their courtship dance is  they go together  the two of them  the two mates  and they begin to run underwater. They paddle faster  and faster  and faster  until they're going so fast that they literally lift up out of the water  and they're standing upright  sort of paddling the top of the water. And one of these Grebes came along while we were rowing. And so we're in a skull  and we're moving really  really quickly. And this Grebe  I think  sort of  mistaked us for a prospect  and started to run along the water next to us  in a courtship dance    for miles. It would stop  and then start  and then stop  and then start. Now that is foreplay. I came this close to changing species at that moment. Obviously  life can teach us something in the entertainment section. Life has a lot to teach us. But what I'd like to talk about today is what life might teach us in technology and in design. What's happened since the book came out    the book was mainly about research in biomimicry    and what's happened since then is architects  designers  engineers    people who make our world    have started to call and say  we want a biologist to sit at the design table to help us  in real time  become inspired. Or    and this is the fun part for me    we want you to take us out into the natural world. We'll come with a design challenge and we find the champion adapters in the natural world  who might inspire us. So this is a picture from a Galapagos trip that we took with some wastewater treatment engineers  they purify wastewater. And some of them were very resistant  actually  to being there. What they said to us at first was  you know  we already do biomimicry. We use bacteria to clean our water. And we said  well  that's not exactly being inspired by nature. That's bioprocessing  you know  that's bio assisted technology  using an organism to do your wastewater treatment is an old  old technology called  domestication.  This is learning something  learning an idea  from an organism and then applying it. And so they still weren't getting it. So we went for a walk on the beach and I said  well  give me one of your big problems. Give me a design challenge  sustainability speed bump  that's keeping you from being sustainable. And they said scaling  which is the build up of minerals inside of pipes. And they said  you know what happens is  mineral    just like at your house    mineral builds up. And then the aperture closes  and we have to flush the pipes with toxins  or we have to dig them up. So if we had some way to stop this scaling    and so I picked up some shells on the beach. And I asked them  what is scaling  What's inside your pipes  And they said  calcium carbonate. And I said  that's what this is  this is calcium carbonate. And they didn't know that. They didn't know that what a seashell is  it's templated by proteins  and then ions from the seawater crystallize in place to create a shell. So the same sort of a process  without the proteins  is happening on the inside of their pipes. They didn't know. This is not for lack of information  it's a lack of integration. You know  it's a silo  people in silos. They didn't know that the same thing was happening. So one of them thought about it and said  OK  well  if this is just crystallization that happens automatically out of seawater    self assembly    then why aren't shells infinite in size  What stops the scaling  Why don't they just keep on going  And I said  well  in the same way that they exude a protein and it starts the crystallization    and then they all sort of leaned in    they let go of a protein that stops the crystallization. It literally adheres to the growing face of the crystal. And  in fact  there is a product called TPA that's mimicked that protein    that stop protein    and it's an environmentally friendly way to stop scaling in pipes. That changed everything. From then on  you could not get these engineers back in the boat. The first day they would take a hike  and it was  click  click  click  click. Five minutes later they were back in the boat. We're done. You know  I've seen that island. After this  they were crawling all over. They would snorkel for as long as we would let them snorkel. What had happened was that they realized that there were organisms out there that had already solved the problems that they had spent their careers trying to solve. Learning about the natural world is one thing  learning from the natural world    that's the switch. That's the profound switch. What they realized was that the answers to their questions are everywhere  they just needed to change the lenses with which they saw the world.  .  billion years of field testing.    to       Craig Venter will probably tell you  I think there's a lot more than    million    well adapted solutions. The important thing for me is that these are solutions solved in context. And the context is the Earth    the same context that we're trying to solve our problems in. So it's the conscious emulation of life's genius. It's not slavishly mimicking    although Al is trying to get the hairdo going    it's not a slavish mimicry  it's taking the design principles  the genius of the natural world  and learning something from it. Now  in a group with so many IT people  I do have to mention what I'm not going to talk about  and that is that your field is one that has learned an enormous amount from living things  on the software side. So there's computers that protect themselves  like an immune system  and we're learning from gene regulation and biological development. And we're learning from neural nets  genetic algorithms  evolutionary computing. That's on the software side. But what's interesting to me is that we haven't looked at this  as much. I mean  these machines are really not very high tech in my estimation in the sense that there's dozens and dozens of carcinogens in the water in Silicon Valley. So the hardware is not at all up to snuff in terms of what life would call a success. So what can we learn about making    not just computers  but everything  The plane you came in  cars  the seats that you're sitting on. How do we redesign the world that we make  the human made world  More importantly  what should we ask in the next    years  And there's a lot of cool technologies out there that life has. What's the syllabus  Three questions  for me  are key. How does life make things  This is the opposite  this is how we make things. It's called heat  beat and treat    that's what material scientists call it. And it's carving things down from the top  with    percent waste left over and only   percent product. You heat it up  you beat it with high pressures  you use chemicals. OK. Heat  beat and treat. Life can't afford to do that. How does life make things  How does life make the most of things  That's a geranium pollen. And its shape is what gives it the function of being able to tumble through air so easily. Look at that shape. Life adds information to matter. In other words  structure. It gives it information. By adding information to matter  it gives it a function that's different than without that structure. And thirdly  how does life make things disappear into systems  Because life doesn't really deal in things  there are no things in the natural world divorced from their systems. Really quick syllabus. As I'm reading more and more now  and following the story  there are some amazing things coming up in the biological sciences. And at the same time  I'm listening to a lot of businesses and finding what their sort of grand challenges are. The two groups are not talking to each other. At all. What in the world of biology might be helpful at this juncture  to get us through this sort of evolutionary knothole that we're in  I'm going to try to go through     really quickly. One that's exciting to me is self assembly. Now  you've heard about this in terms of nanotechnology. Back to that shell  the shell is a self assembling material. On the lower left there is a picture of mother of pearl forming out of seawater. It's a layered structure that's mineral and then polymer  and it makes it very  very tough. It's twice as tough as our high tech ceramics. But what's really interesting  unlike our ceramics that are in kilns  it happens in seawater. It happens near  in and near  the organism's body. This is Sandia National Labs. A guy named Jeff Brinker has found a way to have a self assembling coding process. Imagine being able to make ceramics at room temperature by simply dipping something into a liquid  lifting it out of the liquid  and having evaporation force the molecules in the liquid together  so that they jigsaw together in the same way as this crystallization works. Imagine making all of our hard materials that way. Imagine spraying the precursors to a PV cell  to a solar cell  onto a roof  and having it self assemble into a layered structure that harvests light. Here's an interesting one for the IT world  bio silicon. This is a diatom  which is made of silicates. And so silicon  which we make right now    it's part of our carcinogenic problem in the manufacture of our chips    this is a bio mineralization process that's now being mimicked. This is at UC Santa Barbara. Look at these diatoms. This is from Ernst Haeckel's work. Imagine being able to    and  again  it's a templated process  and it solidifies out of a liquid process    imagine being able to have that sort of structure coming out at room temperature. Imagine being able to make perfect lenses. On the left  this is a brittle star  it's covered with lenses that the people at Lucent Technologies have found have no distortion whatsoever. It's one of the most distortion free lenses we know of. And there's many of them  all over its entire body. What's interesting  again  is that it self assembles. A woman named Joanna Aizenberg  at Lucent  is now learning to do this in a low temperature process to create these sort of lenses. She's also looking at fiber optics. That's a sea sponge that has a fiber optic. Down at the very base of it  there's fiber optics that work better than ours  actually  to move light  but you can tie them in a knot  they're incredibly flexible. Here's another big idea  CO  as a feedstock. A guy named Geoff Coates  at Cornell  said to himself  you know  plants do not see CO  as the biggest poison of our time. We see it that way. Plants are busy making long chains of starches and glucose  right  out of CO . He's found a way    he's found a catalyst    and he's found a way to take CO  and make it into polycarbonates. Biodegradable plastics out of CO     how plant like. Solar transformations  the most exciting one. There are people who are mimicking the energy harvesting device inside of purple bacterium  the people at ASU. Even more interesting  lately  in the last couple of weeks  people have seen that there's an enzyme called hydrogenase that's able to evolve hydrogen from proton and electrons  and is able to take hydrogen up    basically what's happening in a fuel cell  in the anode of a fuel cell and in a reversible fuel cell. In our fuel cells  we do it with platinum  life does it with a very  very common iron. And a team has now just been able to mimic that hydrogen juggling hydrogenase. That's very exciting for fuel cells    to be able to do that without platinum. Power of shape  here's a whale. We've seen that the fins of this whale have tubercles on them. And those little bumps actually increase efficiency in  for instance  the edge of an airplane    increase efficiency by about    percent. Which is an amazing fossil fuel savings  if we were to just put that on the edge of a wing. Color without pigments  this peacock is creating color with shape. Light comes through  it bounces back off the layers  it's called thin film interference. Imagine being able to self assemble products with the last few layers playing with light to create color. Imagine being able to create a shape on the outside of a surface  so that it's self cleaning with just water. That's what a leaf does. See that up close picture  That's a ball of water  and those are dirt particles. And that's an up close picture of a lotus leaf. There's a company making a product called Lotusan  which mimics    when the building facade paint dries  it mimics the bumps in a self cleaning leaf  and rainwater cleans the building. Water is going to be our big  grand challenge  quenching thirst. Here are two organisms that pull water. The one on the left is the Namibian beetle pulling water out of fog. The one on the right is a pill bug    pulls water out of air  does not drink fresh water. Pulling water out of Monterey fog and out of the sweaty air in Atlanta  before it gets into a building  are key technologies. Separation technologies are going to be extremely important. What if we were to say  no more hard rock mining  What if we were to separate out metals from waste streams  small amounts of metals in water  That's what microbes do  they chelate metals out of water. There's a company here in San Francisco called MR  that is embedding mimics of the microbes' molecules on filters to mine waste streams. Green chemistry is chemistry in water. We do chemistry in organic solvents. This is a picture of the spinnerets coming out of a spider and the silk being formed from a spider. Isn't that beautiful  Green chemistry is replacing our industrial chemistry with nature's recipe book. It's not easy  because life uses only a subset of the elements in the periodic table. And we use all of them  even the toxic ones. To figure out the elegant recipes that would take the small subset of the periodic table  and create miracle materials like that cell  is the task of green chemistry. Timed degradation  packaging that is good until you don't want it to be good anymore  and dissolves on cue. That's a mussel you can find in the waters out here  and the threads holding it to a rock are timed  at exactly two years  they begin to dissolve. Healing  this is a good one. That little guy over there is a tardigrade. There is a problem with vaccines around the world not getting to patients. And the reason is that the refrigeration somehow gets broken  what's called the  cold chain  gets broken. A guy named Bruce Rosner looked at the tardigrade    which dries out completely  and yet stays alive for months and months and months  and is able to regenerate itself. And he found a way to dry out vaccines    encase them in the same sort of sugar capsules as the tardigrade has within its cells    meaning that vaccines no longer need to be refrigerated. They can be put in a glove compartment  OK. Learning from organisms. This is a session about water    learning about organisms that can do without water  in order to create a vaccine that lasts and lasts and lasts without refrigeration. I'm not going to get to   . But what I am going to do is tell you that the most important thing  besides all of these adaptations  is the fact that these organisms have figured out a way to do the amazing things they do while taking care of the place that's going to take care of their offspring. When they're involved in foreplay  they're thinking about something very  very important    and that's having their genetic material remain         generations from now. And that means finding a way to do what they do without destroying the place that'll take care of their offspring. That's the biggest design challenge. Luckily  there are millions and millions of geniuses willing to gift us with their best ideas. Good luck having a conversation with them. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Talk about foreplay  I    we need to get to     but really quickly. Janine Benyus  Oh really  CA  Yeah. Just like  you know  like the    second version of        and   . Because we just    your slides are so gorgeous  and the ideas are so big  I can't stand to let you go down without seeing        and   . JB  OK  put this    OK  I'll just hold this thing. OK  great. OK  so that's the healing one. Sensing and responding  feedback is a huge thing. This is a locust. There can be    million of them in a square kilometer  and yet they don't collide with one another. And yet we have  .  million car collisions a year. Right. There's a person at Newcastle who has figured out that it's a very large neuron. And she's actually figuring out how to make a collision avoidance circuitry based on this very large neuron in the locust. This is a huge and important one  number   . And that's the growing fertility. That means  you know  net fertility farming. We should be growing fertility. And  oh yes    we get food  too. Because we have to grow the capacity of this planet to create more and more opportunities for life. And really  that's what other organisms do as well. In ensemble  that's what whole ecosystems do  they create more and more opportunities for life. Our farming has done the opposite. So  farming based on how a prairie builds soil  ranching based on how a native ungulate herd actually increases the health of the range  even wastewater treatment based on how a marsh not only cleans the water  but creates incredibly sparkling productivity. This is the simple design brief. I mean  it looks simple because the system  over  .  billion years  has worked this out. That is  those organisms that have not been able to figure out how to enhance or sweeten their places  are not around to tell us about it. That's the twelfth one. Life    and this is the secret trick  this is the magic trick    life creates conditions conducive to life. It builds soil  it cleans air  it cleans water  it mixes the cocktail of gases that you and I need to live. And it does that in the middle of having great foreplay and meeting their needs. So it's not mutually exclusive. We have to find a way to meet our needs  while making of this place an Eden. CA  Janine  thank you so much. I'm going to give you four specific examples  I'm going to cover at the end about how a company called Silk tripled their sales  how an artist named Jeff Koons went from being a nobody to making a whole bunch of money and having a lot of impact  to how Frank Gehry redefined what it meant to be an architect. And one of my biggest failures as a marketer in the last few years    a record label I started that had a CD called  Sauce.  Before I can do that I've got to tell you about sliced bread  and a guy named Otto Rohwedder. Now  before sliced bread was invented in the     s I wonder what they said  Like the greatest invention since the telegraph or something. But this guy named Otto Rohwedder invented sliced bread  and he focused  like most inventors did  on the patent part and the making part. And the thing about the invention of sliced bread is this    that for the first    years after sliced bread was available no one bought it  no one knew about it  it was a complete and total failure. And the reason is that until Wonder came along and figured out how to spread the idea of sliced bread  no one wanted it. That the success of sliced bread  like the success of almost everything we've talked about at this conference  is not always about what the patent is like  or what the factory is like    it's about can you get your idea to spread  or not. And I think that the way you're going to get what you want  or cause the change that you want to change  to happen  is to figure out a way to get your ideas to spread. And it doesn't matter to me whether you're running a coffee shop or you're an intellectual  or you're in business  or you're flying hot air balloons. I think that all this stuff applies to everybody regardless of what we do. That what we are living in is a century of idea diffusion. That people who can spread ideas  regardless of what those ideas are  win. When I talk about it I usually pick business  because they make the best pictures that you can put in your presentation  and because it's the easiest sort of way to keep score. But I want you to forgive me when I use these examples because I'm talking about anything that you decide to spend your time to do. At the heart of spreading ideas is TV and stuff like TV. TV and mass media made it really easy to spread ideas in a certain way. I call it the  TV industrial complex.  The way the TV industrial complex works  is you buy some ads  interrupt some people  that gets you distribution. You use the distribution you get to sell more products. You take the profit from that to buy more ads. And it goes around and around and around  the same way that the military industrial complex worked a long time ago. That model of  and we heard it yesterday    if we could only get onto the homepage of Google  if we could only figure out how to get promoted there  or grab that person by the throat  and tell them about what we want to do. If we did that then everyone would pay attention  and we would win. Well  this TV industrial complex informed my entire childhood and probably yours. I mean  all of these products succeeded because someone figured out how to touch people in a way they weren't expecting  in a way they didn't necessarily want  with an ad  over and over again until they bought it. And the thing that's happened is  they canceled the TV industrial complex. That just over the last few years  what anybody who markets anything has discovered is that it's not working the way that it used to. This picture is really fuzzy  I apologize  I had a bad cold when I took it. But the product in the blue box in the center is my poster child. I go to the deli  I'm sick  I need to buy some medicine. The brand manager for that blue product spent     million dollars trying to interrupt me in one year.     million dollars interrupting me with TV commercials and magazine ads and Spam and coupons and shelving allowances and spiff    all so I could ignore every single message. And I ignored every message because I don't have a pain reliever problem. I buy the stuff in the yellow box because I always have. And I'm not going to invest a minute of my time to solve her problem  because I don't care. Here's a magazine called  Hydrate.  It's     pages about water. Articles about water  ads about water. Imagine what the world was like    years ago  with just the Saturday Evening Post and Time and Newsweek. Now there are magazines about water. New product from Coke Japan  water salad. Coke Japan comes out with a new product every three weeks  because they have no idea what's going to work and what's not. I couldn't have written this better myself. It came out four days ago    I circled the important parts so you can see them here. They've come out... Arby's is going to spend    million dollars promoting an oven mitt with the voice of Tom Arnold  hoping that that will get people to go to Arby's and buy a roast beef sandwich. Now  I had tried to imagine what could possibly be in an animated TV commercial featuring Tom Arnold  that would get you to get in your car  drive across town and buy a roast beef sandwich. Now  this is Copernicus  and he was right  when he was talking to anyone who needs to hear your idea.  The world revolves around me.  Me  me  me  me. My favorite person    me. I don't want to get email from anybody  I want to get  memail.  So consumers  and I don't just mean people who buy stuff at the Safeway  I mean people at the Defense Department who might buy something  or people at  you know  the New Yorker who might print your article. Consumers don't care about you at all  they just don't care. Part of the reason is    they've got way more choices than they used to  and way less time. And in a world where we have too many choices and too little time  the obvious thing to do is just ignore stuff. And my parable here is you're driving down the road and you see a cow  and you keep driving because you've seen cows before. Cows are invisible. Cows are boring. Who's going to stop and pull over and say     Oh  look  a cow.  Nobody. But if the cow was purple    isn't that a great special effect  I could do that again if you want. If the cow was purple  you'd notice it for a while. I mean  if all cows were purple you'd get bored with those  too. The thing that's going to decide what gets talked about  what gets done  what gets changed  what gets purchased  what gets built  is   Is it remarkable   And  remarkable  is a really cool word  because we think it just means  neat   but it also means  worth making a remark about.  And that is the essence of where idea diffusion is going. That two of the hottest cars in the United States is a        dollar giant car  big enough to hold a Mini in its trunk. People are paying full price for both  and the only thing they have in common is that they don't have anything in common. Every week  the number one best selling DVD in America changes. It's never  The Godfather   it's never  Citizen Kane   it's always some third rate movie with some second rate star. But the reason it's number one is because that's the week it came out. Because it's new  because it's fresh. People saw it and said  I didn't know that was there  and they noticed it. Two of the big success stories of the last    years in retail    one sells things that are super expensive in a blue box  and one sells things that are as cheap as they can make them. The only thing they have in common is that they're different. We're now in the fashion business  no matter what we do for a living  we're in the fashion business. And people in the fashion business know what it's like to be in the fashion business    they're used to it. The rest of us have to figure out how to think that way. How to understand that it's not about interrupting people with big full page ads  or insisting on meetings with people. But it's a totally different sort of process that determines which ideas spread  and which ones don't. They sold a billion dollars' worth of Aeron chairs by reinventing what it meant to sell a chair. They turned a chair from something the purchasing department bought  to something that was a status symbol about where you sat at work. This guy  Lionel Poil ne  the most famous baker in the world    he died two and a half months ago  and he was a hero of mine and a dear friend. He lived in Paris. Last year  he sold    million dollars' worth of French bread. Every loaf baked in a bakery he owned  by one baker at a time  in a wood fired oven. And when Lionel started his bakery  the French pooh pooh ed it. They didn't want to buy his bread. It didn't look like  French bread.  It wasn't what they expected. It was neat  it was remarkable  and slowly  it spread from one person to another person until finally  it became the official bread of three star restaurants in Paris. Now he's in London  and he ships by FedEx all around the world. What marketers used to do is make average products for average people. That's what mass marketing is. Smooth out the edges  go for the center  that's the big market. They would ignore the geeks  and God forbid  the laggards. It was all about going for the center. But in a world where the TV industrial complex is broken  I don't think that's a strategy we want to use any more. I think the strategy we want to use is to not market to these people because they're really good at ignoring you. But market to these people because they care. These are the people who are obsessed with something. And when you talk to them  they'll listen  because they like listening    it's about them. And if you're lucky  they'll tell their friends on the rest of the curve  and it'll spread. It'll spread to the entire curve. They have something I call  otaku     it's a great Japanese word. It describes the desire of someone who's obsessed to say  drive across Tokyo to try a new ramen noodle place  because that's what they do  they get obsessed with it. To make a product  to market an idea  to come up with any problem you want to solve that doesn't have a constituency with an otaku  is almost impossible. Instead  you have to find a group that really  desperately cares about what it is you have to say. Talk to them and make it easy for them to tell their friends. There's a hot sauce otaku  but there's no mustard otaku. That's why there's lots and lots of kinds of hot sauces  and not so many kinds of mustard. Not because it's hard to make interesting mustard    you could make interesting mustard    but people don't  because no one's obsessed with it  and thus no one tells their friends. Krispy Kreme has figured this whole thing out. It has a strategy  and what they do is  they enter a city  they talk to the people  with the otaku  and then they spread through the city to the people who've just crossed the street. This yoyo right here cost     dollars  but it sleeps for    minutes. Not everybody wants it but they don't care. They want to talk to the people who do  and maybe it'll spread. These guys make the loudest car stereo in the world. It's as loud as a     jet. You can't get in  the car's got bulletproof glass  because it'll blow out the windshield otherwise. But the fact remains that when someone wants to put a couple of speakers in their car  if they've got the otaku or they've heard from someone who does  they go ahead and they pick this. It's really simple    you sell to the people who are listening  and just maybe  those people tell their friends. So when Steve Jobs talks to        people at his keynote  who are all tuned in from     countries watching his two hour commercial    that's the only thing keeping his company in business    it's that those        people care desperately enough to watch a two hour commercial  and then tell their friends. Pearl Jam     albums released in the last two years. Every one made a profit. How  They only sell them on their website. Those people who buy them have the otaku  and then they tell their friends  and it spreads and it spreads. This hospital crib cost        dollars     times the standard. But hospitals are buying it faster than any other model. Hard Candy nail polish  doesn't appeal to everybody  but to the people who love it  they talk about it like crazy. This paint can right here saved the Dutch Boy paint company  making them a fortune. It costs    percent more than regular paint because Dutch Boy made a can that people talk about  because it's remarkable. They didn't just slap a new ad on the product  they changed what it meant to build a paint product. AmIhotornot.com    everyday         people go to this site  run by two volunteers  and I can tell you they are hard graders    They didn't get this way by advertising a lot. They got this way by being remarkable  sometimes a little too remarkable. And this picture frame has a cord going out the back  and you plug it into the wall. My father has this on his desk  and he sees his grandchildren everyday  changing constantly. And every single person who walks into his office hears the whole story of how this thing ended up on his desk. And one person at a time  the idea spreads. These are not diamonds  not really. They're made from  cremains.  After you're cremated you can have yourself made into a gem. Oh  you like my ring  It's my grandmother. Fastest growing business in the whole mortuary industry. But you don't have to be Ozzie Osborne    you don't have to be super outrageous to do this. What you have to do is figure out what people really want and give it to them. A couple of quick rules to wrap up. The first one is  Design is free when you get to scale. The people who come up with stuff that's remarkable more often than not figure out how to put design to work for them. Number two  The riskiest thing you can do now is be safe. Proctor and Gamble knows this  right  The whole model of being Proctor and Gamble is always about average products for average people. That's risky. The safe thing to do now is to be at the fringes  be remarkable. And being very good is one of the worst things you can possibly do. Very good is boring. Very good is average. It doesn't matter whether you're making a record album  or you're an architect  or you have a tract on sociology. If it's very good  it's not going to work  because no one's going to notice it. So my three stories. Silk put a product that does not need to be in the refrigerated section next to the milk in the refrigerated section. Sales tripled. Why  Milk  milk  milk  milk  milk    not milk. For the people who were there and looking at that section  it was remarkable. They didn't triple their sales with advertising  they tripled it by doing something remarkable. That is a remarkable piece of art. You don't have to like it  but a    foot tall dog made out of bushes in the middle of New York City is remarkable. Frank Gehry didn't just change a museum  he changed an entire city's economy by designing one building that people from all over the world went to see. Now  at countless meetings at  you know  the Portland City Council  or who knows where  they said  we need an architect    can we get Frank Gehry  Because he did something that was at the fringes. And my big failure  I came out with an entire    A record album and hopefully a whole bunch of record albums in SACD  this remarkable new format    and I marketed it straight to people with        dollar stereos. People with        dollar stereos don't like new music. So what you need to do is figure out who does care. Who is going to raise their hand and say   I want to hear what you're doing next   and sell something to them. The last example I want to give you. This is a map of Soap Lake  Washington. As you can see  if that's nowhere  it's in the middle of it. But they do have a lake. And people used to come from miles around to swim in the lake. They don't anymore. So the founding fathers said   We've got some money to spend. What can we build here   And like most committees  they were going to build something pretty safe. And then an artist came to them    this is a true artist's rendering    he wants to build a    foot tall lava lamp in the center of town. That's a purple cow  that's something worth noticing. I don't know about you  but if they build it  that's where I'm going to go. Thank you very much for your attention. I don't know your name. Audience Member  Howard. Howard. Thom Mayne  Howard  I'm sitting next to Howard. I don't know Howard  obviously  and he's going  I hope you're not next. Amazing. Amazing performance. I kind of erased everything in my brain to follow that. Let me start some place. I'm interested    I kind of do the same thing  but I don't move my body.  Laughter  And instead of using human figures to develop ideas of time and space  I work in the mineral world. I work with more or less inert matter. And I organize it. And  well  it's also a bit different because an architect versus  let's say  a dance company finally is a negotiation between one's private world  one's conceptual world  the world of ideas  the world of aspirations  of inventions  with the relationship of the exterior world and all the limitations  the naysayers. Because I have to say  for my whole career  if there's anything that's been consistent  it's been that you can't do it. No matter what I've done  what I've tried to do  everybody says it can't be done. And it's continuous across the complete spectrum of the various kind of realities that you confront with your ideas. And to be an architect  somehow you have to negotiate between left and right  and you have to negotiate between this very private place where ideas take place and the outside world  and then make it understood. I can start any number of places  because this process is also    I think    very different from some of the morning sessions  which you had such a kind of very clear  such a lineal idea  like the last one  say  with Howard  that I think the creative process in architecture  the design process  is extremely circuitous. It's labyrinthine. It's Calvino's idea of the quickest way between two points is the circuitous line  not the straight line. And definitely my life has been part of that. I'm going to start with some simple kind of notions of how we organize things. But basically  what we do is  we try to give coherence to the world. We make physical things  buildings that become a part in an accretional process  they make cities. And those things are the reflection of the processes  and the time that they are made. And what I'm doing is attempting to synthesize the way one sees the world and the territories which are useful as generative material. Because  really  all I'm interested in  always  as an architect  is the way things are produced because that's what I do. Right  And it's not based on an a priori notion. I have no interest at all in conceiving something in my brain and saying   This is what it looks like.  In fact  somebody mentioned    Ewan  maybe it was you in your introduction    about this is what architects    did somebody say it's what business people come to  it's what the corporate world comes to when they want to make it look like something at the end of the line  Huh. Wow. It doesn't work that way for me at all. I have no interest in that whatsoever. Architecture is the beginning of something  because it's    if you're not involved in first principles  if you're not involved in the absolute  the beginning of that generative process  it's cake decoration. And I've nothing wrong with cake decoration and cake decorators  if anybody's involved in cake decorations    it's not what I'm interested in doing.  Laughter  And so  in the formation of things  in giving it form  in concretizing these things  it starts with some notion of how one organizes. And I've had for    years an interest in a series of complexities where a series of forces are brought to bear  and to understand the nature of the final result of that  representing the building itself. There's been a continual relationship between inventions  which are private  and reality  which has been important to me. A project which is part of an exhibition in Copenhagen    years ago  which was the modeling of a hippocampus    the territory of the brain that records short term memory    and the documentation of that  the imaginative and documentation of that through a series of drawings which literally attempt to organize that experience. And it had to do with the notion of walking a kilometer  observing every kilometer a particular object of desire  and then placing that within this. And the notion was that I could make an organization not built on normal coherencies  but built on non sequiturs  built on randomness. And I'd been extremely interested in this notion of randomness as it produces architectural work and as it definitely connects to the notion of the city  an accretional notion of the city  and that led to various ideas of organization. And then this led to broader ideas of buildings that come together through the multiplicity of systems. And it's not any single system that makes the work. It's the relationship    it's the dynamics between the systems    which have the power to transform and invent and produce an architecture that is    that would otherwise not exist. And those systems could be identified  and they could be grouped together. And of course  today  with the technology of the computer and with the rapid prototyping  etc.  we have the mechanisms to understand and to respond to these systems  and to allow them to adjust to the various accommodations of functionalities because that's all we do. We're producing spaces that accommodate human activity. And what I'm interested in is not the styling of that  but the relationship of that as it enhances that activity. And that directly connects to ideas of city making. This is a project that we just finished in Penang for a very  very large city project that came directly out of this process  which is the result of the multiplicity of forces that produce it. And the project    again  enormous  enormous competition    on the Hudson River and in New York that we were asked to do three years ago  which uses these processes. And what you're looking at are possibilities that have to do with the generation of the city as one applies a methodology that uses notions of these multiple forces  that deals with the enormity of the problem  the complexity of the problem  when we're designing cities at larger and larger aggregates. Because one of the issues today is that the economic aggregate is driving the development aggregate  and as the aggregates get larger we require more and more complex investigation processes to solve these problems. And that led us directly to the Olympic Village. I was in New York on Monday presenting it to the IOC. We won the competition    what was it  nine months ago  Again  a direct reflection from using these processes to develop extremely complicated  very large scale organisms. And then  also  was working with broad strategies. In this case  we only used    of the    acres of land  and the    acres was a park and would become the legacy of the Olympic Village. And it would become the second largest park in the boroughs  etc. Its position  of course  in the middle of Manhattan    it's on Hunter's Point. And then the broader ideas of city making start having direct influences on architecture  on the elements that make up the broader scheme  the buildings themselves  and start guiding us. Architecture for me has been an investigation of a multiplicity of forces that could come from literally any place. And so I can start this discussion in any number of places  and I've chosen three or four to talk about. And it has also to do with an interest in the vast kind of territory that architecture touches. It literally is connected to anything in terms of knowledge base. There's just no place that it doesn't somehow have a connective tissue to. This is Jim Dine  and it's the absence of presence  etc. It's the clothing  the skin  without the presence of the character. It became kind of an idea for the notion of the surface of a work  and it was used in a project where we could unravel that surface  and it was a figurative idea that was going to be folded and made into a very  kind of complex space. And the idea was the relationship of the space  which was made up of the fold of the image  and the dialectic or the conflict between the figuration  and the clarity of the image and the complexity of the space  which were in dialog. And it made us rethink the whole notion of how we work and how we make things  and it led us to ideas that were closer to fashion design as we flattened out surfaces  and then brought them back together as they could make spatial combinations. And this was the first prototype in Korea  as we're dealing with a dynamic envelope  and then the same characteristic of the fabric. It has a material identity and it's translucent and it's porous  and it allows us for a very different notion of what a skin of a building is. And that turned right away into another project. This is the Caltrans building in Los Angeles. And now we're seeing as the skin and the body is differentiated. Again  it's a very  very simple notion. If you look at most buildings  what you look at is the building  the facade  and it is the building. And all of a sudden we're kind of moving away  and we're separating the skin from the body  and that's going to lead to broader performance criteria  which I'm going to talk about in a minute. And you're looking at how it drapes over and differentiates from the body. And then  again  the building itself  middle of Los Angeles  right across from City Hall. And as it moves  it takes pieces of the earth with it. It bends up. It's part of a sign system  which was part of the kind of legacy of Los Angeles    the two dimension  three dimension signing  etc. And then it allows one to penetrate the work itself. It's transparent  and it allows you to understand  I think  what is always the most interesting thing in any building  which is the actual constructional processes that make it. And it's probably the most intense kind of territory of the work  which is not occupied  because architecture is always the most interesting in some mechanism when it's separated from function  and this is an area that allows for that. And then the skin starts transforming into other materials. We're using light as a building material in this case. We're working with Keith Sonnier in New York  and we're making this large outside room  which is possible in Los Angeles  and which is very much reflective of the urban  the contemporary urban environments that you would find in Shibuya or you'd find in Mexico City or Sao Paulo  etc.  that have to do with activating the city over a longer span of time. And that was very much part of the notion of the urban objective of this project in Los Angeles. And  again  all of it promoting transparency. And an image which may be closest talks about the use of light as a medium  that light becomes literally a building material. Well  that immediately turned into something much broader  and as a scope. And again  we're looking at an early sketch where I'm understanding now that the skin can be a transition between the ground and the tower. This is a building in San Francisco which is under construction. And now it turned into something much  much broader as a problem  and it has to do with performance. This will be the first building in the United States that took    well  I can't say it took the air conditioning out. It's a hybrid. I wanted a pure thing  and I can't get it. It's a wrong attitude  actually  because the hybrid is probably more interesting. But we took the air conditioning out of the tower. There's some air conditioning left in the base  but the skin now moves on hydraulics. It forces air through a Venturi force if there's no wind. It adjusts continually. And we removed the air conditioning. Huge  huge thing. Half a million dollars a year delta.    of these    it's just under a million square feet        and some thousand square feet       of these would power Sausalito    the delta on this. And so now what we're looking at  as the projects get larger in scale  as they interface with broader problems  that they expand the capabilities in terms of their performance. Well  I could also start here. We could talk about the relationship at a more biological sense of the relationship of building and ground. Well  our research    my generation for sure  people who were going to school in the late '  s    made very much a shift out of the internal focus of architecture  looking at architecture within its own territory  and we were much more affected by film  by what was going on in the art world  etc. This is  of course  Michael Heizer. And when I saw this  first an image and then visited  it completely changed the way I thought after that point. And I understood that building really could be the augmentation of the Earth's surface  and it completely shifted the notion of building ground in the most basic sense. And then    well  he was probably looking at this    this is Nazca  this is     years ago    the most amazing four kilometer land sculptures. They're just totally incredible. And that led us to then completely rethinking how we draw  how we work. This is the first sketch of a high school in Pomona    well  whatever it is  a model  a conceptual  kind of idea. And it's the reshaping of the Earth to make it occupiable. So it puts         square feet of stuff that make a high school work in the surface of that Earth. There it is modeled as it was developing into a piece of work. And there it is  again  as it's starting to get resolved tectonically  and then there's the school. And  of course  we're interested in participating with education. I have absolutely no interest in producing a building that just accommodates X  Y and Z function. What I'm interested in are how these ideas participate in the educational process of young people. It demands some sort of notion of inquiry because it's a system that's developed not sculpturally. It's an idea that started from my first discussion. It has to do with a broad  consistent logic  and that logic could be understood as one occupies the building. And there's an overt    at least  there's an attempt to make a very overt notion of a building that connects to the land in a very different way because I was interested in a very didactic approach to the problem  as one would understand that. And the second project that was just finished in Los Angeles that uses some of the same ideas. It uses landscape as a major idea. Then  again  we're doing the headquarters for NOAA    National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Agency    outside of Washington in Maryland. And this is how they see the world. They have    satellites zipping around at plus or minus     miles  and the site's in red. And what we really want to do    well  the architects  if there are architects out there  this is the Laugier Hut  this is the primitive hut that's been around for so long    and what we wanted to do is really build this  because they see themselves as the caretakers of the world  and we wanted them to look down at their satellite  how they see their own site  that eight acre site  and we wanted nothing left. We wanted it to stay green. There's actually three baseball fields on it right now  and they're going to stay there. We put one piece directly north south  and it holds the dishes at the ears  right  And then right below that the processing  and the mission lift  and the mission control room  and all the other spaces are underground. And what you look at is an aircraft carrier that's performance driven by the cone vision of these satellite dishes. And that the building itself is occupied in the lower portion  broken up by a series of courts  and it's five acres of uninterrupted  horizontal space for their administrative offices. And then that  in turn  propelled us to look at larger scale projects where this notion of landscape building interface becomes a connective tissue. The new capital competition for Berlin  four years ago. And again we just finished the ECB    actually Coop Himmelblau in Vienna just won this project  where the building was separated into a series of landscape elements that became part of a connective tissue of a park  which is parallel to the river  and develops ideas of the buildings themselves and becomes part of the connective fabric    the social  cultural and the landscape  recreational fabric of the city. And the building is no longer seen as an autonomous thing  but something that's only inextricably connected to this city and this place at this time. And a project that was realized in Austria  the Hooper Bank  which again used this idea of connecting typology  the traditional buildings  and morphology  or the relationship of the development of land as an idea  into a complex  which is a piece of a city where we can see part of it is literally just this augmenting  this movement of the land that's a very simple idea of just lifting it up and occupying it  and other parts are much more energetic and intense. And talk about that intensity in terms of the collisions of the kind of events they make that have to do with putting a series of systems together  and then where part of it is in the ground  part of it is oppositional lifts. One enters the building as it lifts off the ground  and it becomes part of the idea. And then the skin    the edges of this    all promote the dynamic  the movement of the building as a series of seismic shifts  geologic shifts. Right  And it makes for event space and then it breaks in places that allow you to peer into the interior  and those interiors  again  are promoting transparency for the workplace  which has been a continual interest of ours. And then  again  in a more  kind of traditional setting  this is a graduate student housing in Toronto  and it's very much about the relationship of a building as it makes a connective tissue to the city. The main idea was the gateway  where it breaks the site  and the building occupies both the public space and the private space. And it's that territory of    it's this thing. I visited the site many times  and everybody  kind of    you can see this from two kilometers away  it's an exact center of the street  and the whole notion is to engage the public  to engage buildings as part of the public tissue of the city. And finally  one of the most interesting projects    it's a courthouse. And what I want to talk about    this is the Supreme Court  of course    and  well  I'm dealing with Michael Hogan  the Chief Justice of Oregon. You could not proceed without making this negotiation between one's own values and the relationship of the character you're working with and how he understands the court  because I'm showing him  of course  Corbusier at Savoy  which is       which is the beginning of modern architecture. Well  then we get to this image. And this is where the project started. Because I'm going  I'm interested in the phenomenon that's taking place in here. And really what we're talking about is constructing reality. And I'm a character that's extremely interested in understanding the nature of that constructed reality because there's no such thing as nature any more. Nature is gone. Nature in the   th century sense  alright  Nature is only a cultural edifice today  right  We construct it and we construct those ideas. And then of course  this one  our governor at the moment. And we spent some time with Conan  believe it or not  and then that led us to  kind of  the very differences of our worlds from a legal and an artistic  architectural. And it forced us to talk about notions of how we work  and the dynamics of that  and what other sources of the work is. And it led us to the project  the courthouse  which is absolutely a part of a negotiation between tradition and pieces of the traditional courthouse. You'll find a stair that's the same length as the Supreme Court. Here's a piano nobile  which is a device used in the Renaissance. The courts were made of that. The skin is this series of layers that reflect even rusticated stonework  but which were embedded with fragments of the Constitution  which were part of the little process  all set on a plinth that defined it from the community. Thank you so much. I was asked to come here and speak about creation. And I only have    minutes  and I see they're counting already. And I can    in    minutes  I think I can touch only a very rather janitorial branch of creation  which I call  creativity.  Creativity is how we cope with creation. While creation sometimes seems a bit un graspable  or even pointless  creativity is always meaningful. See  for instance  in this picture. You know  creation is what put that dog in that picture  and creativity is what makes us see a chicken on his hindquarters. When you think about    you know  creativity has a lot to do with causality too. You know  when I was a teenager  I was a creator. I just did things. Then I became an adult and started knowing who I was  and tried to maintain that persona    I became creative. It wasn't until I actually did a book and a retrospective exhibition  that I could track exactly    looks like all the craziest things that I had done  all my drinking  all my parties    they followed a straight line that brings me to the point that actually I'm talking to you at this moment. Though it's actually true  you know  the reason I'm talking to you right now is because I was born in Brazil. If I was born in Monterey  probably would be in Brazil. You know  I was born in Brazil and grew up in the '  s under a climate of political distress  and I was forced to learn to communicate in a very specific way    in a sort of a semiotic black market. You couldn't really say what you wanted to say  you had to invent ways of doing it. You didn't trust information very much. That led me to another step of why I'm here today  is because I really liked media of all kinds. I was a media junkie  and eventually got involved with advertising. My first job in Brazil was actually to develop a way to improve the readability of billboards  and based on speed  angle of approach and actually blocks of text. It was very    actually  it was a very good study  and got me a job in an ad agency. And they also decided that I had to    to give me a very ugly Plexiglas trophy for it. And another point    why I'm here    is that the day I went to pick up the Plexiglas trophy  I rented a tuxedo for the first time in my life  picked the thing    didn't have any friends. On my way out  I had to break a fight apart. Somebody was hitting somebody else with brass knuckles. They were in tuxedos  and fighting. It was very ugly. And also    advertising people do that all the time     Laughter     and I    well  what happened is when I went back  it was on the way back to my car  the guy who got hit decided to grab a gun    I don't know why he had a gun    and shoot the first person he decided to be his aggressor. The first person was wearing a black tie  a tuxedo. It was me. Luckily  it wasn't fatal  as you can all see. And  even more luckily  the guy said that he was sorry and I bribed him for compensation money  otherwise I press charges. And that's how    with this money I paid for a ticket to come to the United States in       and that's very    the basic reason I'm talking to you here today  because I got shot.  Laughter   Applause  Well  when I started working with my own work  I decided that I shouldn't do images. You know  I became    I took this very iconoclastic approach. Because when I decided to go into advertising  I wanted to do    I wanted to airbrush naked people on ice  for whiskey commercials  that's what I really wanted to do.  Laughter  But I    they didn't let me do it  so I just    you know  they would only let me do other things. But I wasn't into selling whiskey  I was into selling ice. The first works were actually objects. It was kind of a mixture of found object  product design and advertising. And I called them relics. They were displayed first at Stux Gallery in     . This is the clown skull. Is a remnant of a race of    a very evolved race of entertainers. They lived in Brazil  long time ago.  Laughter  This is the Ashanti joystick. Unfortunately  it has become obsolete because it was designed for Atari platform. A Playstation II is in the works  maybe for the next TED I'll bring it. The rocking podium.  Laughter  This is the pre Columbian coffeemaker.  Laughter  Actually  the idea came out of an argument that I had at Starbucks  that I insisted that I wasn't having Colombian coffee  the coffee was actually pre Columbian. The Bonsai table. The entire Encyclopedia Britannica bound in a single volume  for travel purposes. And the half tombstone  for people who are not dead yet. I wanted to take that into the realm of images  and I decided to make things that had the same identity conflicts. So I decided to do work with clouds. Because clouds can mean anything you want. But now I wanted to work in a very low tech way  so something that would mean at the same time a lump of cotton  a cloud and Durer's praying hands    although this looks a lot more like Mickey Mouse's praying hands. But I was still  you know    this is a kitty cloud. They're called  Equivalents   after Alfred Stieglitz's work.  The Snail.  But I was still working with sculpture  and I was really trying to go flatter and flatter.  The Teapot.  I had a chance to go to Florence  in    I think it was '    and I saw Ghiberti's  Door of Paradise.  And he did something that was very tricky. He put together two different media from different periods of time. First  he got an age old way of making it  which was relief  and he worked this with three point perspective  which was brand new technology at the time. And it's totally overkill. And your eye doesn't know which level to read. And you become trapped into this kind of representation. So I decided to make these very simple renderings  that at first they are taken as a line drawing    you know  something that's very    and then I did it with wire. The idea was to    because everybody overlooks white    like pencil drawings  you know  And they would look at it     Ah  it's a pencil drawing.  Then you have this double take and see that it's actually something that existed in time. It had a physicality  and you start going deeper and deeper into sort of narrative that goes this way  towards the image. So this is  Monkey with Leica.   Relaxation.   Fiat Lux.  And the same way the history of representation evolved from line drawings to shaded drawings. And I wanted to deal with other subjects. I started taking that into the realm of landscape  which is something that's almost a picture of nothing. I made these pictures called  Pictures of Thread   and I named them after the amount of yards that I used to represent each picture. These always end up being a photograph at the end  or more like an etching in this case. So this is a lighthouse. This is        Yards   after Corot.        Yards   after Gerhard Richter. And I don't know how many yards  after John Constable. Departing from the lines  I decided to tackle the idea of points  like which is more similar to the type of representation that we find in photographs themselves. I had met a group of children in the Caribbean island of Saint Kitts  and I did work and play with them. I got some photographs from them. Upon my arrival in New York  I decided    they were children of sugar plantation workers. And by manipulating sugar over a black paper  I made portraits of them. These are     Applause     Thank you. This is  Valentina  the Fastest.  It was just the name of the child  with the little thing you get to know of somebody that you meet very briefly.  Valicia.   Jacynthe.  But another layer of representation was still introduced. Because I was doing this while I was making these pictures  I realized that I could add still another thing I was trying to make a subject    something that would interfere with the themes  so chocolate is very good  because it has    it brings to mind ideas that go from scatology to romance. And so I decided to make these pictures  and they were very large  so you had to walk away from it to be able to see them. So they're called  Pictures of Chocolate.  Freud probably could explain chocolate better than I. He was the first subject. And Jackson Pollock also. Pictures of crowds are particularly interesting  because  you know  you go to that    you try to figure out the threshold with something you can define very easily  like a face  goes into becoming just a texture.  Paparazzi.  I used the dust at the Whitney Museum to render some pieces of their collection. And I picked minimalist pieces because they're about specificity. And you render this with the most non specific material  which is dust itself. Like  you know  you have the skin particles of every single museum visitor. They do a DNA scan of this  they will come up with a great mailing list. This is Richard Serra. I bought a computer  and  they  told me it had millions of colors in it. You know an artist's first response to this is  who counted it  You know  And I realized that I never worked with color  because I had a hard time controlling the idea of single colors. But once they're applied to numeric structure  then you can feel more comfortable. So the first time I worked with colors was by making these mosaics of Pantone swatches. They end up being very large pictures  and I photographed with a very large camera    an  x   camera. So you can see the surface of every single swatch    like in this picture of Chuck Close. And you have to walk very far to be able to see it. Also  the reference to Gerhard Richter's use of color charts    and the idea also entering another realm of representation that's very common to us today  which is the bit map. I ended up narrowing the subject to Monet's  Haystacks.  This is something I used to do as a joke    you know  make    the same like    Robert Smithson's  Spiral Jetty     and then leaving traces  as if it was done on a tabletop. I tried to prove that he didn't do that thing in the Salt Lake. But then  just doing the models  I was trying to explore the relationship between the model and the original. And I felt that I would have to actually go there and make some earthworks myself. I opt for very simple line drawings    kind of stupid looking. And at the same time  I was doing these very large constructions  being     meters away. Now I would do very small ones  which would be like    but under the same light  and I would show them together  so the viewer would have to really figure it out what one he was looking. I wasn't interested in the very large things  or in the small things. I was more interested in the things in between  you know  because you can leave an enormous range for ambiguity there. This is like you see    the size of a person over there. This is a pipe. A hanger. And this is another thing that I did    you know working    everybody loves to watch somebody draw  but not many people have a chance to watch somebody draw in    a lot of people at the same time  to evidence a single drawing. And I love this work  because I did these cartoonish clouds over Manhattan for a period of two months. And it was quite wonderful  because I had an interest    an early interest    in theater  that's justified on this thing. In theater  you have the character and the actor in the same place  trying to negotiate each other in front of an audience. And in this  you'd have like a    something that looks like a cloud  and it is a cloud at the same time. So they're like perfect actors. My interest in acting  especially bad acting  goes a long way. Actually  I once paid like    dollars to see a very great actor to do a version of  King Lear   and I felt really robbed  because by the time the actor started being King Lear  he stopped being the great actor that I had paid money to see. On the other hand  you know  I paid like three dollars  I think    and I went to a warehouse in Queens to see a version of  Othello  by an amateur group. And it was quite fascinating  because you know the guy    his name was Joey Grimaldi    he impersonated the Moorish general    you know  for the first three minutes he was really that general  and then he went back into plumber  he worked as a plumber  so    plumber  general  plumber  general    so for three dollars  I saw two tragedies for the price of one. See  I think it's not really about impression  making people fall for a really perfect illusion  as much as it is to make    I usually work at the lowest threshold of visual illusion. Because it's not about fooling somebody  it's actually giving somebody a measure of their own belief  how much you want to be fooled. That's why we pay to go to magic shows and things like that. Well  I think that's it. My time is nearly up. Thank you very much. Well  I thought there would be a podium  so I'm a bit scared. Chris asked me to tell again how we found the structure of DNA. And since  you know  I follow his orders  I'll do it. But it slightly bores me. And  you know  I wrote a book. So I'll say something       I'll say a little about  you know  how the discovery was made  and why Francis and I found it. And then  I hope maybe I have at least five minutes to say what makes me tick now. In back of me is a picture of me when I was   . I was at the University of Chicago  in my third year  and I was in my third year because the University of Chicago let you in after two years of high school. So you    it was fun to get away from high school     Laughter     because I was very small  and I was no good in sports  or anything like that. But I should say that my background    my father was  you know  raised to be an Episcopalian and Republican  but after one year of college  he became an atheist and a Democrat. And my mother was Irish Catholic  and    but she didn't take religion too seriously. And by the age of     I was no longer going to Sunday Mass  and going on birdwatching walks with my father. So early on  I heard of Charles Darwin. I guess  you know  he was the big hero. And  you know  you understand life as it now exists through evolution. And at the University of Chicago I was a zoology major  and thought I would end up  you know  if I was bright enough  maybe getting a Ph.D. from Cornell in ornithology. Then  in the Chicago paper  there was a review of a book called  What is Life   by the great physicist  Schrodinger. And that  of course  had been a question I wanted to know. You know  Darwin explained life after it got started  but what was the essence of life  And Schrodinger said the essence was information present in our chromosomes  and it had to be present on a molecule. I'd never really thought of molecules before. You know chromosomes  but this was a molecule  and somehow all the information was probably present in some digital form. And there was the big question of  how did you copy the information  So that was the book. And so  from that moment on  I wanted to be a geneticist    understand the gene and  through that  understand life. So I had  you know  a hero at a distance. It wasn't a baseball player  it was Linus Pauling. And so I applied to Caltech and they turned me down. So I went to Indiana  which was actually as good as Caltech in genetics  and besides  they had a really good basketball team.  Laughter  So I had a really quite happy life at Indiana. And it was at Indiana I got the impression that  you know  the gene was likely to be DNA. And so when I got my Ph.D.  I should go and search for DNA. So I first went to Copenhagen because I thought  well  maybe I could become a biochemist  but I discovered biochemistry was very boring. It wasn't going anywhere toward  you know  saying what the gene was  it was just nuclear science. And oh  that's the book  little book. You can read it in about two hours. And    but then I went to a meeting in Italy. And there was an unexpected speaker who wasn't on the program  and he talked about DNA. And this was Maurice Wilkins. He was trained as a physicist  and after the war he wanted to do biophysics  and he picked DNA because DNA had been determined at the Rockefeller Institute to possibly be the genetic molecules on the chromosomes. Most people believed it was proteins. But Wilkins  you know  thought DNA was the best bet  and he showed this x ray photograph. Sort of crystalline. So DNA had a structure  even though it owed it to probably different molecules carrying different sets of instructions. So there was something universal about the DNA molecule. So I wanted to work with him  but he didn't want a former birdwatcher  and I ended up in Cambridge  England. So I went to Cambridge  because it was really the best place in the world then for x ray crystallography. And x ray crystallography is now a subject in  you know  chemistry departments. I mean  in those days it was the domain of the physicists. So the best place for x ray crystallography was at the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge. And there I met Francis Crick. I went there without knowing him. He was   . I was   . And within a day  we had decided that maybe we could take a shortcut to finding the structure of DNA. Not solve it like  you know  in rigorous fashion  but build a model  an electro model  using some coordinates of  you know  length  all that sort of stuff from x ray photographs. But just ask what the molecule    how should it fold up  And the reason for doing so  at the center of this photograph  is Linus Pauling. About six months before  he proposed the alpha helical structure for proteins. And in doing so  he banished the man out on the right  Sir Lawrence Bragg  who was the Cavendish professor. This is a photograph several years later  when Bragg had cause to smile. He certainly wasn't smiling when I got there  because he was somewhat humiliated by Pauling getting the alpha helix  and the Cambridge people failing because they weren't chemists. And certainly  neither Crick or I were chemists  so we tried to build a model. And he knew  Francis knew Wilkins. So Wilkins said he thought it was the helix. X ray diagram  he thought was comparable with the helix. So we built a three stranded model. The people from London came up. Wilkins and this collaborator  or possible collaborator  Rosalind Franklin  came up and sort of laughed at our model. They said it was lousy  and it was. So we were told to build no more models  we were incompetent. And so we didn't build any models  and Francis sort of continued to work on proteins. And basically  I did nothing. And    except read. You know  basically  reading is a good thing  you get facts. And we kept telling the people in London that Linus Pauling's going to move on to DNA. If DNA is that important  Linus will know it. He'll build a model  and then we're going to be scooped. And  in fact  he'd written the people in London  Could he see their x ray photograph  And they had the wisdom to say  no.  So he didn't have it. But there was ones in the literature. Actually  Linus didn't look at them that carefully. But about  oh     months after I got to Cambridge  a rumor began to appear from Linus Pauling's son  who was in Cambridge  that his father was now working on DNA. And so  one day Peter came in and he said he was Peter Pauling  and he gave me a copy of his father's manuscripts. And boy  I was scared because I thought  you know  we may be scooped. I have nothing to do  no qualifications for anything. And so there was the paper  and he proposed a three stranded structure. And I read it  and it was just    it was crap. So this was  you know  unexpected from the world's       and so  it was held together by hydrogen bonds between phosphate groups. Well  if the peak pH that cells have is around seven  those hydrogen bonds couldn't exist. We rushed over to the chemistry department and said   Could Pauling be right   And Alex Hust said   No.  So we were happy. And  you know  we were still in the game  but we were frightened that somebody at Caltech would tell Linus that he was wrong. And so Bragg said   Build models.  And a month after we got the Pauling manuscript    I should say I took the manuscript to London  and showed the people. Well  I said  Linus was wrong and that we're still in the game and that they should immediately start building models. But Wilkins said  no.  Rosalind Franklin was leaving in about two months  and after she left he would start building models. And so I came back with that news to Cambridge  and Bragg said   Build models.  Well  of course  I wanted to build models. And there's a picture of Rosalind. She really  you know  in one sense she was a chemist  but really she would have been trained    she didn't know any organic chemistry or quantum chemistry. She was a crystallographer. And I think part of the reason she didn't want to build models was  she wasn't a chemist  whereas Pauling was a chemist. And so Crick and I  you know  started building models  and I'd learned a little chemistry  but not enough. Well  we got the answer on the   th February '  . And it was because of a rule  which  to me  is a very good rule  Never be the brightest person in a room  and we weren't. We weren't the best chemists in the room. I went in and showed them a pairing I'd done  and Jerry Donohue    he was a chemist    he said  it's wrong. You've got    the hydrogen atoms are in the wrong place. I just put them down like they were in the books. He said they were wrong. So the next day  you know  after I thought   Well  he might be right.  So I changed the locations  and then we found the base pairing  and Francis immediately said the chains run in absolute directions. And we knew we were right. So it was a pretty  you know  it all happened in about two hours. From nothing to thing. And we knew it was big because  you know  if you just put A next to T and G next to C  you have a copying mechanism. So we saw how genetic information is carried. It's the order of the four bases. So in a sense  it is a sort of digital type information. And you copy it by going from strand separating. So  you know  if it didn't work this way  you might as well believe it  because you didn't have any other scheme. But that's not the way most scientists think. Most scientists are really rather dull. They said  we won't think about it until we know it's right. But  you know  we thought  well  it's at least    percent right or    percent right. So think about it. The next five years  there were essentially something like five references to our work in  Nature     none. And so we were left by ourselves  and trying to do the last part of the trio  how do you    what does this genetic information do  It was pretty obvious that it provided the information to an RNA molecule  and then how do you go from RNA to protein  For about three years we just    I tried to solve the structure of RNA. It didn't yield. It didn't give good x ray photographs. I was decidedly unhappy  a girl didn't marry me. It was really  you know  sort of a shitty time. So there's a picture of Francis and I before I met the girl  so I'm still looking happy. But there is what we did when we didn't know where to go forward  we formed a club and called it the RNA Tie Club. George Gamow  also a great physicist  he designed the tie. He was one of the members. The question was  How do you go from a four letter code to the    letter code of proteins  Feynman was a member  and Teller  and friends of Gamow. But that's the only    no  we were only photographed twice. And on both occasions  you know  one of us was missing the tie. There's Francis up on the upper right  and Alex Rich    the M.D. turned crystallographer    is next to me. This was taken in Cambridge in September of     . And I'm smiling  sort of forced  I think  because the girl I had  boy  she was gone. And so I didn't really get happy until       because then we found out  basically  you know  that there are three forms of RNA. And we knew  basically  DNA provides the information for RNA. RNA provides the information for protein. And that let Marshall Nirenberg  you know  take RNA    synthetic RNA    put it in a system making protein. He made polyphenylalanine  polyphenylalanine. So that's the first cracking of the genetic code  and it was all over by     . So there  that's what Chris wanted me to do  it was    so what happened since then  Well  at that time    I should go back. When we found the structure of DNA  I gave my first talk at Cold Spring Harbor. The physicist  Leo Szilard  he looked at me and said   Are you going to patent this   And    but he knew patent law  and that we couldn't patent it  because you couldn't. No use for it. And so DNA didn't become a useful molecule  and the lawyers didn't enter into the equation until          years later  when Boyer and Cohen in San Francisco and Stanford came up with their method of recombinant DNA  and Stanford patented it and made a lot of money. At least they patented something which  you know  could do useful things. And then  they learned how to read the letters for the code. And  boom  we've  you know  had a biotech industry. And  but we were still a long ways from  you know  answering a question which sort of dominated my childhood  which is  How do you nature nurture  And so I'll go on. I'm already out of time  but this is Michael Wigler  a very  very clever mathematician turned physicist. And he developed a technique which essentially will let us look at sample DNA and  eventually  a million spots along it. There's a chip there  a conventional one. Then there's one made by a photolithography by a company in Madison called NimbleGen  which is way ahead of Affymetrix. And we use their technique. And what you can do is sort of compare DNA of normal segs versus cancer. And you can see on the top that cancers which are bad show insertions or deletions. So the DNA is really badly mucked up  whereas if you have a chance of surviving  the DNA isn't so mucked up. So we think that this will eventually lead to what we call  DNA biopsies.  Before you get treated for cancer  you should really look at this technique  and get a feeling of the face of the enemy. It's not a    it's only a partial look  but it's a    I think it's going to be very  very useful. So  we started with breast cancer because there's lots of money for it  no government money. And now I have a sort of vested interest  I want to do it for prostate cancer. So  you know  you aren't treated if it's not dangerous. But Wigler  besides looking at cancer cells  looked at normal cells  and made a really sort of surprising observation. Which is  all of us have about    places in our genome where we've lost a gene or gained another one. So we're sort of all imperfect. And the question is well  if we're around here  you know  these little losses or gains might not be too bad. But if these deletions or amplifications occurred in the wrong gene  maybe we'll feel sick. So the first disease he looked at is autism. And the reason we looked at autism is we had the money to do it. Looking at an individual is about       dollars. And the parent of a child with Asperger's disease  the high intelligence autism  had sent his thing to a conventional company  they didn't do it. Couldn't do it by conventional genetics  but just scanning it we began to find genes for autism. And you can see here  there are a lot of them. So a lot of autistic kids are autistic because they just lost a big piece of DNA. I mean  big piece at the molecular level. We saw one autistic kid  about five million bases just missing from one of his chromosomes. We haven't yet looked at the parents  but the parents probably don't have that loss  or they wouldn't be parents. Now  so  our autism study is just beginning. We got three million dollars. I think it will cost at least    to    before you'd be in a position to help parents who've had an autistic child  or think they may have an autistic child  and can we spot the difference  So this same technique should probably look at all. It's a wonderful way to find genes. And so  I'll conclude by saying we've looked at    people with schizophrenia. And we thought we'd probably have to look at several hundred before we got the picture. But as you can see  there's seven out of    had a change which was very high. And yet  in the controls there were three. So what's the meaning of the controls  Were they crazy also  and we didn't know it  Or  you know  were they normal  I would guess they're normal. And what we think in schizophrenia is there are genes of predisposure  and whether this is one that predisposes    and then there's only a sub segment of the population that's capable of being schizophrenic. Now  we don't have really any evidence of it  but I think  to give you a hypothesis  the best guess is that if you're left handed  you're prone to schizophrenia.    percent of schizophrenic people are left handed  and schizophrenia has a very funny genetics  which means    percent of the people are genetically left handed  but only half of it showed. I don't have the time to say. Now  some people who think they're right handed are genetically left handed. OK. I'm just saying that  if you think  oh  I don't carry a left handed gene so therefore my  you know  children won't be at risk of schizophrenia. You might. OK  So it's  to me  an extraordinarily exciting time. We ought to be able to find the gene for bipolar  there's a relationship. And if I had enough money  we'd find them all this year. I thank you. Nature's my muse and it's been my passion. As a photographer for National Geographic  I've portrayed it for many. But five years ago  I went on a personal journey. I wanted to visualize the story of life. It's the hardest thing I've ever attempted  and there have been plenty of times when I felt like backing out. But there were also revelations. And one of those I'd like to share with you today. I went down to a remote lagoon in Australia  hoping to see the Earth the way it was three billion years ago  back before the sky turned blue. There's stromatolites down there    the first living things to capture photosynthesis    and it's the only place they still occur today. Going down there was like entering a time capsule  and I came out with a different sense of myself in time. The oxygen exhaled by those stromatolites is what we all breathe today. Stromatolites are the heroes in my story. I hope it's a story that has some resonance for our time. It's a story about you and me  nature and science. And with that said  I'd like to invite you for a short  brief journey of life through time. Our journey starts in space  where matter condenses into spheres over time ... solidifying into surface  molded by fire. The fire gave way  Earth emerged    but this was an alien planet. The moon was closer  things were different. Heat from within made geysers erupt    that is how the oceans were born. Water froze around the poles and shaped the edges of the Earth. Water is the key to life  but in frozen form  it is a latent force. And when it vanishes  Earth becomes Mars. But this planet is different    it's roiling inside. And where that energy touches water  something new emerges  life. It arises around cracks in the Earth. Mud and minerals become substrate  there are bacteria. Learn to multiply  thickening in places ... Growing living structures under an alien sky ... Stromatolites were the first to exhale oxygen. And they changed the atmosphere. A breath that's fossilized now as iron. Meteorites delivered chemistry  and perhaps membranes  too. Life needs a membrane to contain itself so it can replicate and mutate. These are diatoms  single celled phytoplankton with skeletons of silicon ... circuit boards of the future. Shallow seas nurtured life early on  and that's where it morphed into more complex forms. It grew as light and oxygen increased. Life hardened and became defensive. It learned to move and began to see. The first eyes grew on trilobites. Vision was refined in horseshoe crabs  among the first to leave the sea. They still do what they've done for ages  their enemies long gone. Scorpions follow prey out of the sea. Slugs became snails. Fish tried amphibian life. Frogs adapted to deserts. Lichens arose as a co op. Fungi married algae ... clinging to rock  and eating it too ... transforming barren land. True land plants arose  leafless at first. Once they learn how to stay upright  they grew in size and shape. The fundamental forms of ferns followed  to bear spores that foreshadowed seeds. Life flourished in swamps. On land  life turned a corner. Jaws formed first  teeth came later. Leatherbacks and tuataras are echoes from that era. It took time for life to break away from water  and it still beckons all the time. Life turned hard so it could venture inland. And the dragons that arose are still among us today. Jurassic Park still shimmers in part of Madagascar  and the center of Brazil  where plants called  cycads  remain rock hard. Forests arose and nurtured things with wings. One early form left an imprint  like it died only yesterday. And others fly today like echoes of the past. In birds  life gained new mobility. Flamingos covered continents. Migrations got underway. Birds witnessed the emergence of flowering plants. Water lilies were among the first. Plants began to diversify and grew  turning into trees. In Australia  a lily turned into a grass tree  and in Hawaii  a daisy became a silver sword. In Africa  Gondwana molded Proteas. But when that ancient continent broke up  life got lusher. Tropical rainforests arose  sparking new layers of interdependence. Fungi multiplied. Orchids emerged  genitalia shaped to lure insects ... a trick shared by the largest flower on Earth. Co evolution entwined insects and birds and plants forever. When birds can't fly  they become vulnerable. Kiwis are  and so are these hawks trapped near Antarctica. Extinction can come slowly  but sometimes it arrives fast. An asteroid hits  and the world went down in flames. But there were witnesses  survivors in the dark. When the skies cleared  a new world was born. A world fit for mammals. From tiny shrews  came  tenrecs  accustomed to the dark. New forms became bats. Civets. New predators  hyenas  getting faster and faster still. Grasslands created opportunities. Herd safety came with sharpened senses. Growing big was another answer  but size always comes at a price. Some mammals turned back to water. Walruses adapted with layers of fat. Sea lions got sleek. And cetaceans moved into a world without bounds. There are many ways to be a mammal. A 'roo hops in Oz  a horse runs in Asia  and a wolf evolves stilt legs in Brazil. Primates emerge from jungles  as tarsiers first  becoming lemurs not much later. Learning became reinforced. Bands of apes ventured into the open. And forests dried out once more. Going upright became a lifestyle. So who are we  Brothers of masculine chimps  sisters of feminine bonobos  We are all of them  and more. We're molded by the same life force. The blood veins in our hands echoed a course of water traces on the Earth. And our brains    our celebrated brains    reflect a drainage of a tidal marsh. Life is a force in its own right. It is a new element. And it has altered the Earth. It covers Earth like a skin. And where it doesn't  as in Greenland in winter  Mars is still not very far. But that likelihood fades as long as ice melts again. And where water is liquid  it becomes a womb for cells green with chlorophyll    and that molecular marvel is what's made a difference    it powers everything. The whole animal world today lives on a stockpile of bacterial oxygen that is cycled constantly through plants and algae  and their waste is our breath  and vice versa. This Earth is alive  and it's made its own membrane. We call it  atmosphere.  This is the icon of our journey. And you all here today can imagine and will shape where we go next. Thank you. Thank you. Hello. Actually  that's  hello  in Bauer Bodoni for the typographically hysterical amongst us. One of the threads that seems to have come through loud and clear in the last couple of days is this need to reconcile what the Big wants    the  Big  being the organization  the system  the country    and what the  Small  wants    the individual  the person. And how do you bring those two things together  Charlie Ledbetter  yesterday  I thought  talked very articulately about this need to bring consumers  to bring people into the process of creating things. And that's what I want to talk about today. So  bringing together the Small to help facilitate and create the Big  I think  is something that we believe in    something I believe in  and something that we kind of bring to life through what we do at Ideo. I call this first chapter    for the Brits in the room    the  Blinding Glimpse of the Bleeding Obvious.  Often  the good ideas are so staring at you right in the face that you kind of miss them. And I think  a lot of times  what we do is just  sort of  hold the mirror up to our clients  and sort of go   Duh  You know  look what's really going on.  And rather than talk about it in the theory  I think I'm just going to show you an example. We were asked by a large healthcare system in Minnesota to describe to them what their patient experience was. And I think they were expecting    they'd worked with lots of consultants before    I think they were expecting some kind of hideous org chart with thousands of bubbles and systemic this  that and the other  and all kinds of mappy stuff. Or even worse  some kind of ghastly death by Powerpoint thing with WowCharts and all kinds of  you know  God knows  whatever. The first thing we actually shared with them was this. I'll play this until your eyeballs completely dissolve. This is    seconds into the film. This is a minute   .     . I think something happens. I think a head may appear in a second.     .     .     . We showed them the whole cut  and they were all completely  what is this  And the point is when you lie in a hospital bed all day  all you do is look at the roof  and it's a really shitty experience. And just putting yourself in the position of the patient    this is Christian  who works with us at Ideo. He just lay in the hospital bed  and  kind of  stared at the polystyrene ceiling tiles for a really long time. That's what it's like to be a patient in the hospital. And they were sort  you know  blinding glimpse of bleeding obvious. Oh  my goodness. So  looking at the situation from the point of view of the person out    as opposed to the traditional position of the organization in    was  for these guys  quite a revelation. And so  that was a really catalytic thing for them. So they snapped into action. They said  OK  it's not about systemic change. It's not about huge  ridiculous things that we need to do. It's about tiny things that can make a huge amount of difference. So we started with them prototyping some really little things that we could do to have a huge amount of impact. The first thing we did was we took a little bicycle mirror and we Band Aided it here  onto a gurney  a hospital trolley  so that when you were wheeled around by a nurse or by a doctor  you could actually have a conversation with them. You could  kind of  see them in your rear view mirror  so it created a tiny human interaction. Very small example of something that they could do. Interestingly  the nurses themselves  sort of  snapped into action    said  OK  we embrace this. What can we do  The first thing they do is they decorated the ceiling. Which I thought was really    I showed this to my mother recently. I think my mother now thinks that I'm some sort of interior decorator. It's what I do for a living  sort of Laurence Llewelyn Bowen. Not particularly the world's best design solution for those of us who are real  sort of  hard core designers  but nonetheless  a fabulous empathic solution for people. Things that they started doing themselves    like changing the floor going into the patient's room so that it signified   This is my room. This is my personal space     was a really interesting sort of design solution to the problem. So you went from public space to private space. And another idea  again  that came from one of the nurses    which I love    was they took traditional  sort of  corporate white boards  then they put them on one wall of the patient's room  and they put this sticker there. So that what you could actually do was go into the room and write messages to the person who was sick in that room  which was lovely. So  tiny  tiny  tiny solutions that made a huge amount of impact. I thought that was a really  really nice example. So this is not particularly a new idea  kind of  seeing opportunities in things that are around you and snapping and turning them into a solution. It's a history of invention based around this. I'm going to read this because I want to get these names right. Joan Ganz Cooney saw her daughter    came down on a Saturday morning  saw her daughter watching the test card  waiting for programs to come on one morning and from that came Sesame Street. Malcolm McLean was moving from one country to another and was wondering why it took these guys so long to get the boxes onto the ship. And he invented the shipping container. George de Mestral    this is not bugs all over a Birkenstock    was walking his dog in a field and got covered in burrs  sort of little prickly things  and from that came Velcro. And finally  for the Brits  Percy Shaw    this is a big British invention    saw the cat's eyes at the side of the road  when he was driving home one night and from that came the Catseye. So there's a whole series of just using your eyes  seeing things for the first time  seeing things afresh and using them as an opportunity to create new possibilities. Second one  without sounding overly Zen  and this is a quote from the Buddha   Finding yourself in the margins  looking to the edges of things  is often a really interesting place to start.  Blinkered vision tends to produce  I think  blinkered solutions. So  looking wide  using your peripheral vision  is a really interesting place to look for opportunity. Again  another medical example here. We were asked by a device producer    we did the Palm Pilot and the Treo. We did a lot of sexy tech at Ideo    they'd seen this and they wanted a sexy piece of technology for medical diagnostics. This was a device that a nurse uses when they're doing a spinal procedure in hospital. They'll ask the nurses to input data. And they had this vision of the nurse  kind of  clicking away on this aluminum device and it all being incredibly  sort of  gadget lustish. When we actually went and watched this procedure taking place    and I'll explain this in a second    it became very obvious that there was a human dimension to this that they really weren't recognizing. When you're having a four inch needle inserted into your spine    which was the procedure that this device's data was about  it was for pain management    you're shit scared  you're freaking out. And so the first thing that pretty much every nurse did  was hold the patient's hand to comfort them. Human gesture    which made the fabulous two handed data input completely impossible. So  the thing that we designed  much less sexy but much more human and practical  was this. So  it's not a Palm Pilot by any stretch of the imagination  but it has a thumb scroll so you can do everything with one hand. So  again  going back to this    the idea that a tiny human gesture dictated the design of this product. And I think that's really  really important. So  again  this idea of workarounds. We use this phrase  workarounds  a lot  sort of  looking around us. I was actually looking around the TED and just watching all of these kind of things happen while I've been here. This idea of the way that people cobble together solutions in our life    and the things we kind of do in our environment that are somewhat subconscious but have huge potential    is something that we look at a lot. We wrote a book recently  I think you might have received it  called  Thoughtless Acts   It's been all about these kind of thoughtless things that people do  which have huge intention and huge opportunity. Why do we all follow the line in the street  This is a picture in a Japanese subway. People consciously follow things even though  why  we don't know. Why do we line up the square milk carton with the square fence  Because we kind of have to    we're just compelled to. We don't know why  but we do. Why do we wrap the teabag string around the cup handle  Again  we're sort of using the world around us to create our own design solutions. And we're always saying to our clients   You should look at this stuff. This stuff is really important. This stuff is really vital.  This is people designing their own experiences. You can draw from this. We sort of assume that because there's a pole in the street  that it's okay to use it  so we park our shopping cart there. It's there for our use  on some level. So  again  we sort of co opt our environment to do all these different things. We co opt other experiences    we take one item and transfer it to another. And this is my favorite one. My mother used to say to me   Just because your sister jumps in the lake doesn't mean you have to.  But  of course  we all do. We all follow each other every day. So somebody assumes that because somebody else has done something  that's permission for them to do the same thing. And there's almost this sort of semaphore around us all the time. I mean  shopping bag equals  parking meter out of order.  And we all  kind of  know how to read these signals now. We all talk to one another in this highly visual way without realizing what we're doing. Third section is this idea of not knowing  of consciously putting yourself backwards. I talk about unthinking situations all the time. Sort of having beginner's mind  scraping your mind clean and looking at things afresh. A friend of mine was a designer at IKEA  and he was asked by his boss to help design a storage system for children. This is the Billy bookcase    it's IKEA's biggest selling product. Hammer it together. Hammer it together with a shoe  if you're me  because they're impossible to assemble. But big selling bookcase. How do we replicate this for children  The reality is when you actually watch children  children don't think about things like storage in linear terms. Children assume permission in a very different way. Children live on things. They live under things. They live around things  and so their spatial awareness relationship  and their thinking around storage is totally different. So the first thing you have to do    this is Graham  the designer    is  sort of  put yourself in their shoes. And so  here he is sitting under the table. So  what came out of this  This is the storage system that he designed. So what is this  I hear you all ask. No  I don't. It's this  and I think this is a particularly lovely solution. So  you know  it's a totally different way of looking at the situation. It's a completely empathic solution    apart from the fact that teddy's probably not loving it. But a really nice way of re framing the ordinary  and I think that's one of the things. And putting yourself in the position of the person  and I think that's one of the threads that I've heard again from this conference is how do we put ourselves in other peoples' shoes and really feel what they feel  And then use that information to fuel solutions  And I think that's what this is very much about. Last section  green armband. We've all got them. It's about this really. I mean  it's about picking battles big enough to matter but small enough to win. Again  that's one of the themes that I think has come through loud and clear in this conference is  Where do we start  How do we start  What do we do to start  So  again  we were asked to design a water pump for a company called ApproTEC  in Kenya. They're now called KickStart. And  again  as designers  we wanted to make this thing incredibly beautiful and spend a lot of time thinking of the form. And that was completely irrelevant. When you put yourself in the position of these people  things like the fact that this has to be able to fold up and fit on a bicycle  become much more relevant than the form of it. The way it's produced  it has to be produced with indigenous manufacturing methods and indigenous materials. So it had to be looked at completely from the point of view of the user. We had to completely transfer ourselves over to their world. So what seems like a very clunky product is  in fact  incredibly useful. It's powered a bit like a Stairmaster    you pump up and down on it. Children can use it. Adults can use it. Everybody uses it. It's turning these guys    again  one of the themes    it's turning them into entrepreneurs. These guys are using this very successfully. And for us  it's been great because it's won loads of design awards. So we actually managed to reconcile the needs of the design company  the needs of the individuals in the company  to feel good about a product we were actually designing  and the needs of the individuals we were designing it for. There it is  pumping water from    feet. So as a final gesture we handed out these bracelets to all of you this morning. We've made a donation on everybody's behalf here to kick start  no pun intended  their next project. Because  again  I think  sort of  putting our money where our mouth is  here. We feel that this is an important gesture. So we've handed out bracelets. Small is the new big. I hope you'll all wear them. So that's it. Thank you. I want to talk today about    I've been asked to take the long view  and I'm going to tell you what I think are the three biggest problems for humanity from this long point of view. Some of these have already been touched upon by other speakers  which is encouraging. It seems that there's not just one person who thinks that these problems are important. The first is    death is a big problem. If you look at the statistics  the odds are not very favorable to us. So far  most people who have lived have also died. Roughly    percent of everybody who has been alive has died by now. So the annual death rate adds up to            sorry  the daily death rate            people per day  which is a huge number by any standard. The annual death rate  then  becomes    million. If we just look at the single  biggest cause of death    aging    it accounts for roughly two thirds of all human people who die. That adds up to an annual death toll of greater than the population of Canada. Sometimes  we don't see a problem because either it's too familiar or it's too big. Can't see it because it's too big. I think death might be both too familiar and too big for most people to see it as a problem. Once you think about it  you see this is not statistical points  these are    let's see  how far have I talked  I've talked for three minutes. So that would be  roughly      people have died since I've begun speaking. People like    it's roughly the population in this room has just died. Now  the human cost of that is obvious  once you start to think about it    the suffering  the loss    it's also  economically  enormously wasteful. I just look at the information  and knowledge  and experience that is lost due to natural causes of death in general  and aging  in particular. Suppose we approximated one person with one book  Now  of course  this is an underestimation. A person's lifetime of learning and experience is a lot more than you could put into a single book. But let's suppose we did this.    million people die of natural causes each year corresponds  then  to    million volumes destroyed. Library of Congress holds    million volumes. We are upset about the burning of the Library of Alexandria. It's one of the great cultural tragedies that we remember  even today. But this is the equivalent of three Libraries of Congress    burnt down  forever lost    each year. So that's the first big problem. And I wish Godspeed to Aubrey de Grey  and other people like him  to try to do something about this as soon as possible. Existential risk    the second big problem. Existential risk is a threat to human survival  or to the long term potential of our species. Now  why do I say that this is a big problem  Well  let's first look at the probability    and this is very  very difficult to estimate    but there have been only four studies on this in recent years  which is surprising. You would think that it would be of some interest to try to find out more about this given that the stakes are so big  but it's a very neglected area. But there have been four studies    one by John Lesley  wrote a book on this. He estimated a probability that we will fail to survive the current century     percent. Similarly  the Astronomer Royal  whom we heard speak yesterday  also has a    percent probability estimate. Another author doesn't give any numerical estimate  but says the probability is significant that it will fail. I wrote a long paper on this. I said assigning a less than    percent probability would be a mistake in light of the current evidence we have. Now  the exact figures here  we should take with a big grain of salt  but there seems to be a consensus that the risk is substantial. Everybody who has looked at this and studied it agrees. Now  if we think about what just reducing the probability of human extinction by just one percentage point    not very much    so that's equivalent to    million lives saved  if we just count the currently living people  the current generation. Now one percent of six billion people is equivalent to    million. So that's a large number. If we were to take into account future generations that will never come into existence if we blow ourselves up  then the figure becomes astronomical. If we could eventually colonize a chunk of the universe    the Virgo supercluster    maybe it will take us     million years to get there  but if we go extinct we never will. Then  even a one percentage point reduction in the extinction risk could be equivalent to this astronomical number       to the power of   . So if you take into account future generations as much as our own  every other moral imperative of philanthropic cost just becomes irrelevant. The only thing you should focus on would be to reduce existential risk because even the tiniest decrease in existential risk would just overwhelm any other benefit you could hope to achieve. And even if you just look at the current people  and ignore the potential that would be lost if we went extinct  it should still have a high priority. Now  let me spend the rest of my time on the third big problem  because it's more subtle and perhaps difficult to grasp. Think about some time in your life    some people might never have experienced it    but some people  there are just those moments that you have experienced where life was fantastic. It might have been at the moment of some great  creative inspiration you might have had when you just entered this flow stage. Or when you understood something you had never done before. Or perhaps in the ecstasy of romantic love. Or an aesthetic experience    a sunset or a great piece of art. Every once in a while we have these moments  and we realize just how good life can be when it's at its best. And you wonder  why can't it be like that all the time  You just want to cling onto this. And then  of course  it drifts back into ordinary life and the memory fades. And it's really difficult to recall  in a normal frame of mind  just how good life can be at its best. Or how bad it can be at its worst. The third big problem is that life isn't usually as wonderful as it could be. I think that's a big  big problem. It's easy to say what we don't want. Here are a number of things that we don't want    illness  involuntary death  unnecessary suffering  cruelty  stunted growth  memory loss  ignorance  absence of creativity. Suppose we fixed these things    we did something about all of these. We were very successful. We got rid of all of these things. We might end up with something like this  which is    I mean  it's a heck of a lot better than that. But is this really the best we can dream of  Is this the best we can do  Or is it possible to find something a little bit more inspiring to work towards  And if we think about this  I think it's very clear that there are ways in which we could change things  not just by eliminating negatives  but adding positives. On my wish list  at least  would be  much longer  healthier lives  greater subjective well being  enhanced cognitive capacities  more knowledge and understanding  unlimited opportunity for personal growth beyond our current biological limits  better relationships  an unbounded potential for spiritual  moral and intellectual development. If we want to achieve this  what  in the world  would have to change  And this is the answer    we would have to change. Not just the world around us  but we  ourselves. Not just the way we think about the world  but the way we are    our very biology. Human nature would have to change. Now  when we think about changing human nature  the first thing that comes to mind are these human modification technologies    growth hormone therapy  cosmetic surgery  stimulants like Ritalin  Adderall  anti depressants  anabolic steroids  artificial hearts. It's a pretty pathetic list. They do great things for a few people who suffer from some specific condition  but for most people  they don't really transform what it is to be human. And they also all seem a little bit    most people have this instinct that  well  sure  there needs to be anti depressants for the really depressed people. But there's a kind of queasiness that these are unnatural in some way. It's worth recalling that there are a lot of other modification technologies and enhancement technologies that we use. We have skin enhancements  clothing. As far as I can see  all of you are users of this enhancement technology in this room  so that's a great thing. Mood modifiers have been used from time immemorial    caffeine  alcohol  nicotine  immune system enhancement  vision enhancement  anesthetics    we take that very much for granted  but just think about how great progress that is    like  having an operation before anesthetics was not fun. Contraceptives  cosmetics and brain reprogramming techniques    that sounds ominous  but the distinction between what is a technology    a gadget would be the archetype    and other ways of changing and rewriting human nature is quite subtle. So if you think about what it means to learn arithmetic or to learn to read  you're actually  literally rewriting your own brain. You're changing the microstructure of your brain as you go along. So in a broad sense  we don't need to think about technology as only little gadgets  like these things here  but even institutions and techniques  psychological methods and so forth. Forms of organization can have a profound impact on human nature. Looking ahead  there is a range of technologies that are almost certain to be developed sooner or later. We are very ignorant about what the time scale for these things are  but they all are consistent with everything we know about physical laws  laws of chemistry  etc. It's possible to assume  setting aside a possibility of catastrophe  that sooner or later we will develop all of these. And even just a couple of these would be enough to transform the human condition. So let's look at some of the dimensions of human nature that seem to leave room for improvement. Health span is a big and urgent thing  because if you're not alive  then all the other things will be to little avail. Intellectual capacity    let's take that box  which falls into a lot of different sub categories  memory  concentration  mental energy  intelligence  empathy. These are really great things. Part of the reason why we value these traits is that they make us better at competing with other people    they're positional goods. But part of the reason    and that's the reason why we have ethical ground for pursuing these    is that they're also intrinsically valuable. It's just better to be able to understand more of the world around you and the people that you are communicating with  and to remember what you have learned. Modalities and special faculties. Now  the human mind is not a single unitary information processor  but it has a lot of different  special  evolved modules that do specific things for us. If you think about what we normally take as giving life a lot of its meaning    music  humor  eroticism  spirituality  aesthetics  nurturing and caring  gossip  chatting with people    all of these  very likely  are enabled by a special circuitry that we humans have  but that you could have another intelligent life form that lacks these. We're just lucky that we have the requisite neural machinery to process music and to appreciate it and enjoy it. All of these would enable  in principle    be amenable to enhancement. Some people have a better musical ability and ability to appreciate music than others have. It's also interesting to think about what other things are    so if these all enabled great values  why should we think that evolution has happened to provide us with all the modalities we would need to engage with other values that there might be  Imagine a species that just didn't have this neural machinery for processing music. And they would just stare at us with bafflement when we spend time listening to a beautiful performance  like the one we just heard    because of people making stupid movements  and they would be really irritated and wouldn't see what we were up to. But maybe they have another faculty  something else that would seem equally irrational to us  but they actually tap into some great possible value there. But we are just literally deaf to that kind of value. So we could think of adding on different  new sensory capacities and mental faculties. Bodily functionality and morphology and affective self control. Greater subjective well being. Be able to switch between relaxation and activity    being able to go slow when you need to do that  and to speed up. Able to switch back and forth more easily would be a neat thing to be able to do    easier to achieve the flow state  when you're totally immersed in something you are doing. Conscientiousness and sympathy. The ability to    it's another interesting application that would have large social ramification  perhaps. If you could actually choose to preserve your romantic attachments to one person  undiminished through time  so that wouldn't have to    love would never have to fade if you didn't want it to. That's probably not all that difficult. It might just be a simple hormone or something that could do this. It's been done in voles. You can engineer a prairie vole to become monogamous when it's naturally polygamous. It's just a single gene. Might be more complicated in humans  but perhaps not that much. This is the last picture that I want to    now we've got to use the laser pointer. A possible mode of being here would be a way of life    a way of being  experiencing  thinking  seeing  interacting with the world. Down here in this little corner  here  we have the little sub space of this larger space that is accessible to human beings    beings with our biological capacities. It's a part of the space that's accessible to animals  since we are animals  we are a subset of that. And then you can imagine some enhancements of human capacities. There would be different modes of being you could experience if you were able to stay alive for  say      years. Then you could live sorts of lives and accumulate wisdoms that are just not possible for humans as we currently are. So then  you move off to this larger sphere of  human     and you could continue that process and eventually explore a lot of this larger space of possible modes of being. Now  why is that a good thing to do  Well  we know already that in this little human circle there  there are these enormously wonderful and worthwhile modes of being    human life at its best is wonderful. We have no reason to believe that within this much  much larger space there would not also be extremely worthwhile modes of being  perhaps ones that would be way beyond our wildest ability even to imagine or dream about. And so  to fix this third problem  I think we need    slowly  carefully  with ethical wisdom and constraint    develop the means that enable us to go out in this larger space and explore it and find the great values that might hide there. Thanks. About    years ago  I went to visit a friend in Hong Kong. And at the time I was very superstitious. So  upon landing    this was still at the old Hong Kong airport that's Kai Tak  when it was smack in the middle of the city    I thought   If I see something good  I'm going to have a great time here in my two weeks. And if I see something negative  I'm going to be miserable  indeed.  So the plane landed in between the buildings and got to a full stop in front of this little billboard. And I actually went to see some of the design companies in Hong Kong in my stay there. And it turned out that    I just went to see  you know  what they are doing in Hong Kong. But I actually walked away with a great job offer. And I flew back to Austria  packed my bags  and  another week later  I was again on my way to Hong Kong still superstitions and thinking   Well  if that 'Winner' billboard is still up  I'm going to have a good time working here. But if it's gone  it's going to be really miserable and stressful.  So it turned out that not only was the billboard still up but they had put this one right next to it. On the other hand  it also taught me where superstition gets me because I really had a terrible time in Hong Kong. However  I did have a number of real moments of happiness in my life    of  you know  I think what the conference brochure refers to as  moments that take your breath away.  And since I'm a big list maker  I actually listed them all. Now  you don't have to go through the trouble of reading them and I won't read them for you. I know that it's incredibly boring to hear about other people's happinesses. What I did do  though is  I actually looked at them from a design standpoint and just eliminated all the ones that had nothing to do with design. And  very surprisingly  over half of them had  actually  something to do with design. So there are  of course  two different possibilities. There's one from a consumer's point of view    where I was happy while experiencing design. And I'll just give you one example. I had gotten my first Walkman. This is     . My brother had this great Yamaha motorcycle that he was willing to borrow to me freely. And The Police's  Synchronicity  cassette had just been released and there was no helmet law in my hometown of Bregenz. So you could drive up into the mountains freely blasting The Police on the new Sony Walkman. And I remember it as a true moment of happiness. You know  of course  they are related to this combination of at least two of them being  you know  design objects. And  you know  there's a scale of happiness when you talk about in design but the motorcycle incident would definitely be  you know  situated somewhere here    right in there between Delight and Bliss. Now  there is the other part  from a designer's standpoint    if you're happy while actually doing it. And one way to see how happy designers are when they're designing could be to look at the authors' photos on the back of their monographs  So  according to this  the Australians and the Japanese as well as the Mexicans are very happy. While  somewhat  the Spaniards ... and  I think  particularly  the Swiss don't seem to be doing all that well. Last November  a museum opened in Tokyo called The Mori Museum  in a skyscraper  up on the   th floor. And their inaugural exhibit was called  Happiness.  And I went  very eagerly  to see it  because    well  also  with an eye on this conference. And they interestingly sectioned the exhibit off into four different areas. Under  Arcadia   they showed things like this  from the Edo period    a hundred ways to write  happiness  in different forms. Or they had this apple by Yoko Ono    that  of course  later on was  you know  made into the label for The Beatles. Under  Nirvana  they showed this Constable painting. And there was a little    an interesting theory about abstraction. This is a blue field    it's actually an Yves Klein painting. And the theory was that if you abstract an image  you really  you know open as much room for the un representable    and  therefore  you know  are able to involve the viewer more. Then  under  Desire   they showed these Shunsho paintings    also from the Edo period    ink on silk. And  lastly  under  Harmony   they had this   th century mandala from Tibet. Now  what I took away from the exhibit was that maybe with the exception of the mandala most of the pieces in there were actually about the visualization of happiness and not about happiness. And I felt a little bit cheated  because the visualization    that's a really easy thing to do. And  you know  my studio    we've done it all the time. This is  you know  a book. A happy dog    and you take it out  it's an aggressive dog. It's a happy David Byrne and an angry David Byrne. Or a jazz poster with a happy face and a more aggressive face. You know  that's not a big deal to accomplish. It has gotten to the point where  you know  within advertising or within the movie industry   happy  has gotten such a bad reputation that if you actually want to do something with the subject and still appear authentic  you almost would have to  you know  do it from a cynical point of view. This is  you know  the movie poster. Or we  a couple of weeks ago  designed a box set for The Talking Heads where the happiness visualized on the cover definitely has  very much  a dark side to it. Much  much more difficult is this  where the designs actually can evoke happiness    and I'm going to just show you three that actually did this for me. This is a campaign done by a young artist in New York  who calls himself  True.  Everybody who has ridden the New York subway system will be familiar with these signs  True printed his own version of these signs. Met every Wednesday at a subway stop with    of his friends. They divided up the different subway lines and added their own version. So this is one. Now  the way this works in the system is that nobody ever looks at these signs. So you're you're really bored in the subway  and you kind of stare at something. And it takes you a while until it actually    you realize that this says something different than what it normally says. I mean  that's  at least  how it made me happy. Now  True is a real humanitarian. He didn't want any of his friends to be arrested  so he supplied everybody with this fake volunteer card. And also gave this fake letter from the MTA to everybody    sort of like pretending that it's an art project financed by The Metropolitan Transit Authority. Another New York project. This is at P.S.      a sculpture that's basically a square room by James Turrell  that has a retractable ceiling. Opens up at dusk and dawn every day. You don't see the horizon. You're just in there  watching the incredible  subtle changes of color in the sky. And the room is truly something to be seen. People's demeanor changes when they go in there. And  for sure  I haven't looked at the sky in the same way after spending an hour in there. There are  of course  more than those three projects that I'm showing here. I would definitely say that observing Vik Muniz'  Cloud  a couple of years ago in Manhattan for sure made me happy  as well. But my last project is  again  from a young designer in New York. He's from Korea originally. And he took it upon himself to print        speech bubbles    empty speech bubbles stickers  large ones and small ones. And he goes around New York and just puts them  empty as they are  on posters. And other people go and fill them in. This one says   Please let me die in peace.  I think that was    the most surprising to myself was that the writing was actually so good. This is on a musician poster  that says   I am concerned that my CD will not sell more than         units and that  as a result  my recoupable advance from my label will be taken from me  after which  my contract will be cancelled  and I'll be back doing Journey covers on Bleecker Street.  I think the reason this works so well is because everybody involved wins. Jee gets to have his project  the public gets a sweeter environment  and different public gets a place to express itself  and the advertisers finally get somebody to look at their ads. Well  there was a question  of course  that was on my mind for a while  You know  can I do more of the things that I like doing in design and less of the ones that I don't like to be doing  Which brought me back to my list making    you know  just to see what I actually like about my job. You know  one is  just working without pressure. Then  working concentrated  without being frazzled. Or  as Nancy said before  like really immerse oneself into it. Try not to get stuck doing the same thing    or try not get stuck behind the computer all day. This is  you know  related to it  getting out of the studio. Then  of course  trying to  you know  work on things where the content is actually important for me. And being able to enjoy the end results. And then I found another list in one of my diaries that actually contained all the things that I thought I learned in my life so far. And  just about at that time  an Austrian magazine called and asked if we would want to do six spreads    design six spreads that work like dividing pages between the different chapters in the magazine  And the whole thing just fell together. So I just picked one of the things that I thought I learned    in this case   Everything I do always comes back to me     and we made these spreads right out of this. So it was   Everything I do always comes back to me.  A couple of weeks ago  a French company asked us to design five billboards for them. Again  we could supply the content for it. So I just picked another one. And this was two weeks ago. We flew to Arizona    the designer who works with me  and myself    and photographed this one. So it's   Trying to look good limits my life.  And then we did one more of these. This is  again  for a magazine  dividing pages. This is   Having     this is the same thing  it's just  you know  photographed from the side. This is from the front. Then it's   guts.  Again  it's the same thing     guts  is just the same room  reworked. Then it's   always works out.  Then it's  for   with the light on. And it's  me.  Thank you so much. When I'm starting talks like this  I usually do a whole spiel about sustainability because a lot of people out there don't know what that is. This is a crowd that does know what it is  so I'll like just do like the    second crib note version. Right  So just bear with me. We'll go real fast  you know  Fill in the blanks. So  you know  sustainability  small planet. Right  Picture a little Earth  circling around the sun. You know  about a million years ago  a bunch of monkeys fell out of trees  got a little clever  harnessed fire  invented the printing press  made  you know  luggage with wheels on it. And  you know  built the society that we now live in. Unfortunately  while this society is  without a doubt  the most prosperous and dynamic the world has ever created  it's got some major  major flaws. One of them is that every society has an ecological footprint. It has an amount of impact on the planet that's measurable. How much stuff goes through your life  how much waste is left behind you. And we  at the moment  in our society  have a really dramatically unsustainable level of this. We're using up about five planets. If everybody on the planet lived the way we did  we'd need between five  six  seven  some people even say    planets to make it. Clearly we don't have    planets. Again  you know  mental  visual     planets  one planet     planets  one planet. Right  We don't have that. So that's one problem. The second problem is that the planet that we have is being used in wildly unfair ways. Right  North Americans  such as myself  you know  we're basically sort of wallowing  gluttonous hogs  and we're eating all sorts of stuff. And  you know  then you get all the way down to people who live in the Asia Pacific region  or even more  Africa. And people simply do not have enough to survive. This is producing all sorts of tensions  all sorts of dynamics that are deeply disturbing. And there's more and more people on the way. Right  So  this is what the planet's going to look like in    years. It's going to be a pretty crowded place  at least eight billion people. So to make matters even more difficult  it's a very young planet. A third of the people on this planet are kids. And those kids are growing up in a completely different way than their parents did  no matter where they live. They've been exposed to this idea of our society  of our prosperity. And they may not want to live exactly like us. They may not want to be Americans  or Brits  or Germans  or South Africans  but they want their own version of a life which is more prosperous  and more dynamic  and more  you know  enjoyable. And all of these things combine to create an enormous amount of torque on the planet. And if we cannot figure out a way to deal with that torque  we are going to find ourselves more and more and more quickly facing situations which are simply unthinkable. Everybody in this room has heard the worst case scenarios. I don't need to go into that. But I will ask the question  what's the alternative  And I would say that  at the moment  the alternative is unimaginable. You know  so on the one hand we have the unthinkable  on the other hand we have the unimaginable. We don't know yet how to build a society which is environmentally sustainable  which is shareable with everybody on the planet  which promotes stability and democracy and human rights  and which is achievable in the time frame necessary to make it through the challenges we face. We don't know how to do this yet. So what's Worldchanging  Well  Worldchanging you might think of as being a bit of a news service for the unimaginable future. You know  what we're out there doing is looking for examples of tools  models and ideas  which  if widely adopted  would change the game. A lot of times  when I do a talk like this  I talk about things that everybody in this room I'm sure has already heard of  but most people haven't. So I thought today I'd do something a little different  and talk about what we're looking for  rather than saying  you know  rather than giving you tried and true examples. Talk about the kinds of things we're scoping out. Give you a little peek into our editorial notebook. And given that I have    minutes to do this  this is going to go kind of quick. So  I don't know  just stick with me. Right  So  first of all  what are we looking for  Bright Green city. One of the biggest levers that we have in the developed world for changing the impact that we have on the planet is changing the way that we live in cities. We're already an urban planet  that's especially true in the developed world. And people who live in cities in the developed world tend to be very prosperous  and thus use a lot of stuff. If we can change the dynamic  by first of all creating cities that are denser and more livable ... Here  for example  is Vancouver  which if you haven't been there  you ought to go for a visit. It's a fabulous city. And they are doing density  new density  better than probably anybody else on the planet right now. They're actually managing to talk North Americans out of driving cars  which is a pretty great thing. So you have density. You also have growth management. You leave aside what is natural to be natural. This is in Portland. That is an actual development. That land there will remain pasture in perpetuity. They've bounded the city with a line. Nature  city. Nothing changes. Once you do those things  you can start making all sorts of investments. You can start doing things like  you know  transit systems that actually work to transport people  in effective and reasonably comfortable manners. You can also start to change what you build. This is the Beddington Zero Energy Development in London  which is one of the greenest buildings in the world. It's a fabulous place. We're able to now build buildings that generate all their own electricity  that recycle much of their water  that are much more comfortable than standard buildings  use all natural light  etc.  and  over time  cost less. Green roofs. Bill McDonough covered that last night  so I won't dwell on that too much. But once you also have people living in close proximity to each other  one of the things you can do is    as information technologies develop    you can start to have smart places. You can start to know where things are. When you know where things are  it becomes easier to share them. When you share them  you end up using less. So one great example is car share clubs  which are really starting to take off in the U.S.  have already taken off in many places in Europe  and are a great example. If you're somebody who drives  you know  one day a week  do you really need your own car  Another thing that information technology lets us do is start figuring out how to use less stuff by knowing  and by monitoring  the amount we're actually using. So  here's a power cord which glows brighter the more energy that you use  which I think is a pretty cool concept  although I think it ought to work the other way around  that it gets brighter the more you don't use. But  you know  there may even be a simpler approach. We could just re label things. This light switch that reads  on the one hand  flashfloods  and on the other hand  off. How we build things can change as well. This is a bio morphic building. It takes its inspiration in form from life. Many of these buildings are incredibly beautiful  and also much more effective. This is an example of bio mimicry  which is something we're really starting to look a lot more for. In this case  you have a shell design which was used to create a new kind of exhaust fan  which is greatly more effective. There's a lot of this stuff happening  it's really pretty remarkable. I encourage you to look on Worldchanging if you're into it. We're starting to cover this more and more. There's also neo biological design  where more and more we're actually using life itself and the processes of life to become part of our industry. So this  for example  is hydrogen generating algae. So we have a model in potential  an emerging model that we're looking for of how to take the cities most of us live in  and turn them into Bright Green cities. But unfortunately  most of the people on the planet don't live in the cites we live in. They live in the emerging megacities of the developing world. And there's a statistic I often like to use  which is that we're adding a city of Seattle every four days  a city the size of Seattle to the planet every four days. I was giving a talk about two months ago  and this guy  who'd done some work with the U.N.  came up to me and was really flustered  and he said  look  you've got that totally wrong  it's totally wrong. It's every seven days. So  we're adding a city the size of Seattle every seven days  and most of those cities look more like this than the city that you or I live in. Most of those cites are growing incredibly quickly. They don't have existing infrastructure  they have enormous numbers of people who are struggling with poverty  and enormous numbers of people are trying to figure out how to do things in new ways. So what do we need in order to make developing nation megacities into Bright Green megacities  Well  the first thing we need is  we need leapfrogging. And this is one of the things that we are looking for everywhere. The idea behind leapfrogging is that if you are a person  or a country  who is stuck in a situation where you don't have the tools and technologies that you need  there's no reason for you to invest in last generation's technologies. Right  That you're much better off  almost universally  looking for a low cost or locally applicable version of the newest technology. One place we're all familiar with seeing this is with cell phones. Right  All throughout the developing world  people are going directly to cell phones  skipping the whole landline stage. If there are landlines in many developing world cities  they're usually pretty crappy systems that break down a lot and cost enormous amounts of money. So I rather like this picture here. I particularly like the Ganesh in the background  talking on the cell phone. So what we have  increasingly  is cell phones just permeating out through society. We've heard all about this here this week  so I won't say too much more than that  other than to say what is true for cell phones is true for all sorts of technologies. The second thing is tools for collaboration  be they systems of collaboration  or intellectual property systems which encourage collaboration. Right  When you have free ability for people to freely work together and innovate  you get different kinds of solutions. And those solutions are accessible in a different way to people who don't have capital. Right  So  you know  we have open source software  we have Creative Commons and other kinds of Copyleft solutions. And those things lead to things like this. This is a Telecentro in Sao Paulo. This is a pretty remarkable program using free and open source software  cheap  sort of hacked together machines  and basically sort of abandoned buildings    has put together a bunch of community centers where people can come in  get high speed internet access  learn computer programming skills for free. And a quarter million people every year use these now in Sao Paulo. And those quarter million people are some of the poorest people in Sao Paolo. I particularly like the little Linux penguin in the back.  Laughter  So one of the things that that's leading to is a sort of southern cultural explosion. And one of the things we're really  really interested in at Worldchanging is the ways in which the south is re identifying itself  and re categorizing itself in ways that have less and less to do with most of us in this room. So it's not  you know  Bollywood isn't just answering Hollywood. Right  You know  Brazilian music scene isn't just answering the major labels. It's doing something new. There's new things happening. There's interplay between them. And  you know  you get amazing things. Like  I don't know if any of you have seen the movie  City of God   Yeah  it's a fabulous movie if you haven't seen it. And it's all about this question  in a very artistic and indirect kind of way. You have other radical examples where the ability to use cultural tools is spreading out. These are people who have just been visited by the Internet bookmobile in Uganda. And who are waving their first books in the air  which  I just think that's a pretty cool picture. You know  So you also have the ability for people to start coming together and acting on their own behalf in political and civic ways  in ways that haven't happened before. And as we heard last night  as we've heard earlier this week  are absolutely  fundamentally vital to the ability to craft new solutions  is we've got to craft new political realities. And I would personally say that we have to craft new political realities  not only in places like India  Afghanistan  Kenya  Pakistan  what have you  but here at home as well. Another world is possible. And sort of the big motto of the anti globalization movement. Right  We tweak that a lot. We talk about how another world isn't just possible  another world's here. That it's not just that we have to sort of imagine there being a different  vague possibility out there  but we need to start acting a little bit more on that possibility. We need to start doing things like Lula  President of Brazil. How many people knew of Lula before today  OK  so  much  much better than the average crowd  I can tell you that. So Lula  he's full of problems  full of contradictions  but one of the things that he's doing is  he is putting forward an idea of how we engage in international relations that completely shifts the balance from the standard sort of north south dialogue into a whole new way of global collaboration. I would keep your eye on this fellow. Another example of this sort of second superpower thing is the rise of these games that are what we call  serious play.  We're looking a lot at this. This is spreading everywhere. This is from  A Force More Powerful.  It's a little screenshot.  A Force More Powerful  is a video game that  while you're playing it  it teaches you how to engage in non violent insurrection and regime change.  Laughter  Here's another one. This is from a game called  Food Force   which is a game that teaches children how to run a refugee camp. These things are all contributing in a very dynamic way to a huge rise in  especially in the developing world  in people's interest in and passion for democracy. We get so little news about the developing world that we often forget that there are literally millions of people out there struggling to change things to be fairer  freer  more democratic  less corrupt. And  you know  we don't hear those stories enough. But it's happening all over the place  and these tools are part of what's making it possible. Now when you add all those things together  when you add together leapfrogging and new kinds of tools  you know  second superpower stuff  etc.  what do you get  Well  very quickly  you get a Bright Green future for the developing world. You get  for example  green power spread throughout the world. You get    this is a building in Hyderabad  India. It's the greenest building in the world. You get grassroots solutions  things that work for people who have no capital or limited access. You get barefoot solar engineers carrying solar panels into the remote mountains. You get access to distance medicine. These are Indian nurses learning how to use PDAs to access databases that have information that they don't have access to at home in a distant manner. You get new tools for people in the developing world. These are LED lights that help the roughly billion people out there  for whom nightfall means darkness  to have a new means of operating. These are refrigerators that require no electricity  they're pot within a pot design. And you get water solutions. Water's one of the most pressing problems. Here's a design for harvesting rainwater that's super cheap and available to people in the developing world. Here's a design for distilling water using sunlight. Here's a fog catcher  which  if you live in a moist  jungle like area  will distill water from the air that's clean and drinkable. Here's a way of transporting water. I just love this  you know    I mean carrying water is such a drag  and somebody just came up with the idea of well  what if you rolled it. Right  I mean  that's a great design. This is a fabulous invention  LifeStraw. Basically you can suck any water through this and it will become drinkable by the time it hits your lips. So  you know  people who are in desperate straits can get this. This is one of my favorite Worldchanging kinds of things ever. This is a merry go round invented by the company Roundabout  which pumps water as kids play. You know  Seriously    give that one a hand  it's pretty great. And the same thing is true for people who are in absolute crisis. Right  We're expecting to have upwards of     million refugees by the year      because of climate change and political instability. How do we help people like that  Well  there's all sorts of amazing new humanitarian designs that are being developed in collaborative ways all across the planet. Some of those designs include models for acting  such as new models for village instruction in the middle of refugee camps. New models for pedagogy for the displaced. And we have new tools. This is one of my absolute favorite things anywhere. Does anyone know what this is  Audience  It detects landmines. Alex Steffen  Exactly  this is a landmine detecting flower. If you are living in one of the places where the roughly half billion unaccounted for mines are scattered  you can fling these seeds out into the field. And as they grow up  they will grow up around the mines  their roots will detect the chemicals in them  and where the flowers turn red you don't step. Yeah  so seeds that could save your life. You know  I also love it because it seems to me that the example  the tools we use to change the world  ought to be beautiful in themselves. You know  that it's not just enough to survive. We've got to make something better than what we've got. And I think that we will. Just to wrap up  in the immortal words of H.G. Wells  I think that better things are on the way. I think that  in fact  that  all of the past is but the beginning of a beginning. All that the human mind has accomplished is but the dream before the awakening.  I hope that that turns out to be true. The people in this room have given me more confidence than ever that it will. Thank you very much. I work with a species called  Bonobo.  And I'm happy most of the time  because I think this is the happiest species on the planet. It's kind of a well kept secret. This species lives only in the Congo. And they're not in too many zoos  because of their sexual behavior. Their sexual behavior is too human like for most of us to be comfortable with. But    actually  we have a lot to learn from them  because they're a very egalitarian society and they're a very empathetic society. And sexual behavior is not confined to one aspect of their life that they sort of set aside. It permeates their entire life. And it's used for communication. And it's used for conflict resolution. And I think perhaps somewhere in our history we sort of  divided our lives up into lots of parts. We divided our world up with lots of categories. And so everything sort of has a place that it has to fit. But I don't think that we were that way initially. There are many people who think that the animal world is hard wired and that there's something very  very special about man. Maybe it's his ability to have causal thought. Maybe it's something special in his brain that allows him to have language. Maybe it's something special in his brain that allows him to make tools or to have mathematics. Well  I don't know. There were Tasmanians who were discovered around the     s and they had no fire. They had no stone tools. To our knowledge they had no music. So when you compare them to the Bonobo  the Bonobo is a little hairier. He doesn't stand quite as upright. But there are a lot of similarities. And I think that as we look at culture  we kind of come to understand how we got to where we are. And I don't really think it's in our biology  I think we've attributed it to our biology  but I don't really think it's there. So what I want to do now is introduce you to a species called the Bonobo. This is Kanzi. He's a Bonobo. Right now  he's in a forest in Georgia. His mother originally came from a forest in Africa. And she came to us when she was just at puberty  about six or seven years of age. Now this shows a Bonobo on your right  and a chimpanzee on your left. Clearly  the chimpanzee has a little bit harder time of walking. The Bonobo  although shorter than us and their arms still longer  is more upright  just as we are. This shows the Bonobo compared to an australopithecine like Lucy. As you can see  there's not a lot of difference between the way a Bonobo walks and the way an early australopithecine would have walked. As they turn toward us you'll see that the pelvic area of early australopithecines is a little flatter and doesn't have to rotate quite so much from side to side. So the    the bipedal gait is a little easier. And now we see all four. Video  Narrator  The wild Bonobo lives in central Africa  in the jungle encircled by the Congo River. Canopied trees as tall as    meters      feet  grow densely in the area. It was a Japanese scientist who first undertook serious field studies of the Bonobo  almost three decades ago. Bonobos are built slightly smaller than the chimpanzee. Slim bodied  Bonobos are by nature very gentle creatures. Long and careful studies have reported many new findings on them. One discovery was that wild Bonobos often walk bidpedally. What's more  they are able to walk upright for long distances. Susan Savage Rumbaugh  video   Let's go say hello to Austin first and then go to the A frame. SS  This is Kanzi and I  in the forest. None of the things you will see in this particular video are trained. None of them are tricks. They all happened to be captured on film spontaneously  by NHK of Japan. We have eight Bonobos. Video  Look at all this stuff that's here for our campfire. SS  An entire family at our research centre. Video  You going to help get some sticks  Good. We need more sticks  too. I have a lighter in my pocket if you need one. That's a wasps' nest. You can get it out. I hope I have a lighter. You can use the lighter to start the fire. SS  So Kanzi is very interested in fire. He doesn't do it yet without a lighter  but I think if he saw someone do it  he might be able to do    make a fire without a lighter. He's learning about how to keep a fire going. He's learning the uses for a fire  just by watching what we do with fire. This is a smile on the face of a Bonobo. These are happy vocalizations. Video  You're happy. You're very happy about this part. You've got to put some water on the fire. You see the water  Good job. SS  Forgot to zip up the back half of his backpack. But he likes to carry things from place to place. Video  Austin  I hear you saying  Austin.  SS  He talks to other Bonobos at the lab  long distance  farther than we can hear. This is his sister. This is her first time to try to drive a golf cart. Video  Goodbye. SS  She's got the pedals down  but not the wheel. She switches from reverse to forward and she holds onto the wheel  rather than turns it. Like us  she knows that that individual in the mirror is her. Video  Narrator  By raising Bonobos in a culture that is both Bonobo and human  and documenting their development across two decades  scientists are exploring how cultural forces may have operated during human evolution. His name is Nyota. It means  star  in Swahili. Panbanisha is trying to give Nyota a haircut with a pair of scissors. In the wild  the parent Bonobo is known to groom its offspring. Here Panbanisha uses scissors  instead of her hands  to groom Nyota. Very impressive. Subtle maneuvering of the hands is required to perform delicate tasks like this. Nyota tries to imitate Panbanisha by using the scissors himself. Realizing that Nyota might get hurt  Panbanisha  like any human mother  carefully tugs to get the scissors back. He can now cut through tough animal hide. SS  Kanzi's learned to make stone tools. Video  Kanzi now makes his tools  just as our ancestors may have made them  two and a half million years ago    by holding the rocks in both hands  to strike one against the other. He has learned that by using both hands and aiming his glancing blows  he can make much larger  sharper flakes. Kanzi chooses a flake he thinks is sharp enough. The tough hide is difficult to cut  even with a knife. The rock that Kanzi is using is extremely hard and ideal for stone tool making  but difficult to handle  requiring great skill. Kanzi's rock is from Gona  Ethiopia and is identical to that used by our African ancestors two and a half million years ago. These are the rocks Kanzi used and these are the flakes he made. The flat sharp edges are like knife blades. Compare them to the tools our ancestors used  they bear a striking resemblance to Kanzi's. Panbanisha is longing to go for a walk in the woods. She keeps staring out the window. SS  This is    let me show you something we didn't think they would do. Video  For several days now  Panbanisha has not been outside. SS  I normally talk about language. Video  Then Panbanisha does something unexpected. SS  But since I'm advised not to do what I normally do  I haven't told you that these apes have language. It's a geometric language. Video  She takes a piece of chalk and begins writing something on the floor. What is she writing  SS  She's also saying the name of that  with her voice. Video  Now she comes up to Dr. Sue and starts writing again. SS  These are her symbols on her keyboard. They speak when she touches them. Video  Panbanisha is communicating to Dr. Sue where she wants to go.  A frame  represents a hut in the woods. Compare the chalk writing with the lexigram on the keyboard. Panbanisha began writing the lexigrams on the forest floor. SS  video   Very nice. Beautiful  Panbanisha. SS  At first we didn't really realize what she was doing  until we stood back and looked at it and rotated it. Video  This lexigram also refers to a place in the woods. The curved line is very similar to the lexigram. The next symbol Panbanisha writes represents  collar.  It indicates the collar that Panbanisha must wear when she goes out. SS  That's an institutional requirement. Video  This symbol is not as clear as the others  but one can see Panbanisha is trying to produce a curved line and several straight lines. Researchers began to record what Panbanisha said  by writing lexigrams on the floor with chalk. Panbanisha watched. Soon she began to write as well. The Bonobo's abilities have stunned scientists around the world. How did they develop  SS  video   We found that the most important thing for permitting Bonobos to acquire language is not to teach them. It's simply to use language around them  because the driving force in language acquisition is to understand what others  that are important to you  are saying to you. Once you have that capacity  the ability to produce language comes rather naturally and rather freely. So we want to create an environment in which Bonobos  like all of the individuals with whom they are interacting    we want to create an environment in which they have fun  and an environment in which the others are meaningful individuals for them. Narrator  This environment brings out unexpected potential in Kanzi and Panbanisha. Panbanisha is enjoying playing her harmonica  until Nyota  now one year old  steals it. Then he peers eagerly into his mother's mouth. Is he looking for where the sound came from  Dr. Sue thinks it's important to allow such curiosity to flourish. This time Panbanisha is playing the electric piano. She wasn't forced to learn the piano  she saw a researcher play the instrument and took an interest. Researcher  Go ahead. Go ahead. I'm listening. Do that real fast part that you did. Yeah  that part. Narrator  Kanzi plays the xylophone  using both hands he enthusiastically accompanies Dr. Sue's singing. Kanzi and Panbanisha are stimulated by this fun filled environment  which promotes the emergence of these cultural capabilities. Researcher  OK  now get the monsters. Get them. Take the cherries too. Now watch out  stay away from them now. Now you can chase them again. Time to chase them. Now you have to stay away. Get away. Run away. Run. Now we can chase them again. Go get them. Oh no  Good Kanzi. Very good. Thank you so much. Narrator  None of us  Bonobo or human  can possibly even imagine  SS  So we have a bi species environment  we call it a  panhomoculture.  We're learning how to become like them. We're learning how to communicate with them  in really high pitched tones. We're learning that they probably have a language in the wild. And they're learning to become like us. Because we believe that it's not biology  it's culture. So we're sharing tools and technology and language with another species. Thank you. If you'd like to learn how to play the lobster  we have some here. And that's not a joke  we really do. So come up afterwards and I'll show you how to play a lobster. So  actually  I started working on what's called the mantis shrimp a few years ago because they make sound. This is a recording I made of a mantis shrimp that's found off the coast of California. And while that's an absolutely fascinating sound  it actually turns out to be a very difficult project. And while I was struggling to figure out how and why mantis shrimp  or stomatopods  make sound  I started to think about their appendages. And mantis shrimp are called  mantis shrimp  after the praying mantises  which also have a fast feeding appendage. And I started to think  well  maybe it will be interesting  while listening to their sounds  to figure out how these animals generate very fast feeding strikes. And so today I'll talk about the extreme stomatopod strike  work that I've done in collaboration with Wyatt Korff and Roy Caldwell. So  mantis shrimp come in two varieties  there are spearers and smashers. And this is a spearing mantis shrimp  or stomatopod. And he lives in the sand  and he catches things that go by overhead. So  a quick strike like that. And if we slow it down a bit  this is the mantis shrimp    the same species    recorded at       frames a second  played back at    frames per second. And you can see it's just a really spectacular extension of the limbs  exploding upward to actually just catch a dead piece of shrimp that I had offered it. Now  the other type of mantis shrimp is the smasher stomatopod  and these guys open up snails for a living. And so this guy gets the snail all set up and gives it a good whack. So  I'll play it one more time. He wiggles it in place  tugs it with his nose  and smash. And a few smashes later  the snail is broken open  and he's got a good dinner. So  the smasher raptorial appendage can stab with a point at the end  or it can smash with the heel. And today I'll talk about the smashing type of strike. And so the first question that came to mind was  well  how fast does this limb move  Because it's moving pretty darn fast on that video. And I immediately came upon a problem. Every single high speed video system in the biology department at Berkeley wasn't fast enough to catch this movement. We simply couldn't capture it on video. And so this had me stymied for quite a long period of time. And then a BBC crew came cruising through the biology department  looking for a story to do about new technologies in biology. And so we struck up a deal. I said   Well  if you guys rent the high speed video system that could capture these movements  you guys can film us collecting the data.  And believe it or not  they went for it.  Laughter  So we got this incredible video system. It's very new technology    it just came out about a year ago    that allows you to film at extremely high speeds in low light. And low light is a critical issue with filming animals  because if it's too high  you fry them.  Laughter  So this is a mantis shrimp. There are the eyes up here  and there's that raptorial appendage  and there's the heel. And that thing's going to swing around and smash the snail. And the snail's wired to a stick  so he's a little bit easier to set up the shot. And    yeah. I hope there aren't any snail rights activists around here. So this was filmed at       frames per second  and I'm playing it back at   . And so this is slowed down     times. And as you'll notice  it's still pretty gosh darn fast slowed down     times. It's an incredibly powerful movement. The whole limb extends out. The body flexes backwards    just a spectacular movement. And so what we did is  we took a look at these videos  and we measured how fast the limb was moving to get back to that original question. And we were in for our first surprise. So what we calculated was that the limbs were moving at the peak speed ranging from    meters per second all the way up to    meters per second. And for those of you who prefer miles per hour  that's over    miles per hour in water. And this is really darn fast. In fact  it's so fast we were able to add a new point on the extreme animal movement spectrum. And mantis shrimp are officially the fastest measured feeding strike of any animal system. So our first surprise. So that was really cool and very unexpected. So  you might be wondering  well  how do they do it  And actually  this work was done in the     s by a famous biologist named Malcolm Burrows. And what he showed in mantis shrimp is that they use what's called a  catch mechanism   or  click mechanism.  And what this basically consists of is a large muscle that takes a good long time to contract  and a latch that prevents anything from moving. So the muscle contracts  and nothing happens. And once the muscle's contracted completely  everything's stored up    the latch flies upward  and you've got the movement. And that's basically what's called a  power amplification system.  It takes a long time for the muscle to contract  and a very short time for the limb to fly out. And so I thought that this was sort of the end of the story. This was how mantis shrimps make these very fast strikes. But then I took a trip to the National Museum of Natural History. And if any of you ever have a chance  backstage of the National Museum of Natural History is one of the world's best collections of preserved mantis shrimp. And what    this is serious business for me. So  this    what I saw  on every single mantis shrimp limb  whether it's a spearer or a smasher  is a beautiful saddle shaped structure right on the top surface of the limb. And you can see it right here. It just looks like a saddle you'd put on a horse. It's a very beautiful structure. And it's surrounded by membranous areas. And those membranous areas suggested to me that maybe this is some kind of dynamically flexible structure. And this really sort of had me scratching my head for a while. And then we did a series of calculations  and what we were able to show is that these mantis shrimp have to have a spring. There needs to be some kind of spring loaded mechanism in order to generate the amount of force that we observe  and the speed that we observe  and the output of the system. So we thought  OK  this must be a spring    the saddle could very well be a spring. And we went back to those high speed videos again  and we could actually visualize the saddle compressing and extending. And I'll just do that one more time. And then if you take a look at the video    it's a little bit hard to see    it's outlined in yellow. The saddle is outlined in yellow. You can actually see it extending over the course of the strike  and actually hyperextending. So  we've had very solid evidence showing that that saddle shaped structure actually compresses and extends  and does  in fact  function as a spring. The saddle shaped structure is also known as a  hyperbolic paraboloid surface   or an  anticlastic surface.  And this is very well known to engineers and architects  because it's a very strong surface in compression. It has curves in two directions  one curve upward and opposite transverse curve down the other  so any kind of perturbation spreads the forces over the surface of this type of shape. So it's very well known to engineers  not as well known to biologists. It's also known to quite a few people who make jewelry  because it requires very little material to build this type of surface  and it's very strong. So if you're going to build a thin gold structure  it's very nice to have it in a shape that's strong. Now  it's also known to architects. One of the most famous architects is Eduardo Catalano  who popularized this structure. And what's shown here is a saddle shaped roof that he built that's    and a half feet spanwise. It's two and a half inches thick  and supported at two points. And one of the reasons why he designed roofs this way is because it's    he found it fascinating that you could build such a strong structure that's made of so few materials and can be supported by so few points. And all of these are the same principles that apply to the saddle shaped spring in stomatopods. In biological systems it's important not to have a whole lot of extra material requirements for building it. So  very interesting parallels between the biological and the engineering worlds. And interestingly  this turns out    the stomatopod saddle turns out to be the first described biological hyperbolic paraboloid spring. That's a bit long  but it is sort of interesting. So the next and final question was  well  how much force does a mantis shrimp produce if they're able to break open snails  And so I wired up what's called a load cell. A load cell measures forces  and this is actually a piezoelectronic load cell that has a little crystal in it. And when this crystal is squeezed  the electrical properties change and it    which    in proportion to the forces that go in. So these animals are wonderfully aggressive  and are really hungry all the time. And so all I had to do was actually put a little shrimp paste on the front of the load cell  and they'd smash away at it. And so this is just a regular video of the animal just smashing the heck out of this load cell. And we were able to get some force measurements out. And again  we were in for a surprise. I purchased a     pound load cell  thinking  no animal could produce more than     pounds at this size of an animal. And what do you know  They immediately overloaded the load cell. So these are actually some old data where I had to find the smallest animals in the lab  and we were able to measure forces of well over     pounds generated by an animal about this big. And actually  just last week I got a     pound load cell up and running  and I've clocked these animals generating well over     pounds of force. And again  I think this will be a world record. I have to do a little bit more background reading  but I think this will be the largest amount of force produced by an animal of a given    per body mass. So  really incredible forces. And again  that brings us back to the importance of that spring in storing up and releasing so much energy in this system. But that was not the end of the story. Now  things    I'm making this sound very easy  this is actually a lot of work. And I got all these force measurements  and then I went and looked at the force output of the system. And this is just very simple    time is on the X axis and the force is on the Y axis. And you can see two peaks. And that was what really got me puzzled. The first peak  obviously  is the limb hitting the load cell. But there's a really large second peak half a millisecond later  and I didn't know what that was. So now  you'd expect a second peak for other reasons  but not half a millisecond later. Again  going back to those high speed videos  there's a pretty good hint of what might be going on. Here's that same orientation that we saw earlier. There's that raptorial appendage    there's the heel  and it's going to swing around and hit the load cell. And what I'd like you to do in this shot is keep your eye on this  on the surface of the load cell  as the limb comes flying through. And I hope what you are able to see is actually a flash of light. Audience  Wow. Sheila Patek  And so if we just take that one frame  what you can actually see there at the end of that yellow arrow is a vapor bubble. And what that is  is cavitation. And cavitation is an extremely potent fluid dynamic phenomenon which occurs when you have areas of water moving at extremely different speeds. And when this happens  it can cause areas of very low pressure  which results in the water literally vaporizing. And when that vapor bubble collapses  it emits sound  light and heat  and it's a very destructive process. And so here it is in the stomatopod. And again  this is a situation where engineers are very familiar with this phenomenon  because it destroys boat propellers. People have been struggling for years to try and design a very fast rotating boat propeller that doesn't cavitate and literally wear away the metal and put holes in it  just like these pictures show. So this is a potent force in fluid systems  and just to sort of take it one step further  I'm going to show you the mantis shrimp approaching the snail. This is taken at        frames per second  and I have to give full credit to the BBC cameraman  Tim Green  for setting this shot up  because I could never have done this in a million years    one of the benefits of working with professional cameramen. You can see it coming in  and an incredible flash of light  and all this cavitation spreading over the surface of the snail. So really  just an amazing image  slowed down extremely  to extremely slow speeds. And again  we can see it in slightly different form there  with the bubble forming and collapsing between those two surfaces. In fact  you might have even seen some cavitation going up the edge of the limb. So to solve this quandary of the two force peaks  what I think was going on is  that first impact is actually the limb hitting the load cell  and the second impact is actually the collapse of the cavitation bubble. And these animals may very well be making use of not only the force and the energy stored with that specialized spring  but the extremes of the fluid dynamics. And they might actually be making use of fluid dynamics as a second force for breaking the snail. So  really fascinating double whammy  so to speak  from these animals. So  one question I often get after this talk    so I figured I'd answer it now    is  well  what happens to the animal  Because obviously  if it's breaking snails  the poor limb must be disintegrating. And indeed it does. That's the smashing part of the heel on both these images  and it gets worn away. In fact  I've seen them wear away their heel all the way to the flesh. But one of the convenient things about being an arthropod is that you have to molt. And every three months or so these animals molt  and they build a new limb and it's no problem. Very  very convenient solution to that particular problem. So  I'd like to end on sort of a wacky note. Maybe this is all wacky to folks like you  I don't know. So  the saddles    that saddle shaped spring    has actually been well known to biologists for a long time  not as a spring but as a visual signal. And there's actually a spectacular colored dot in the center of the saddles of many species of stomatopods. And this is quite interesting  to find evolutionary origins of visual signals on what's really  in all species  their spring. And I think one explanation for this could be going back to the molting phenomenon. So these animals go into a molting period where they're unable to strike    their bodies become very soft. And they're literally unable to strike or they will self destruct. This is for real. And what they do is  up until that time period when they can't strike  they become really obnoxious and awful  and they strike everything in sight  it doesn't matter who or what. And the second they get into that time point when they can't strike any more  they just signal. They wave their legs around. And it's one of the classic examples in animal behavior of bluffing. It's a well established fact of these animals that they actually bluff. They can't actually strike  but they pretend to. And so I'm very curious about whether those colored dots in the center of the saddles are conveying some kind of information about their ability to strike  or their strike force  and something about the time period in the molting cycle. So sort of an interesting strange fact to find a visual structure right in the middle of their spring. So to conclude  I mostly want to acknowledge my two collaborators  Wyatt Korff and Roy Caldwell  who worked closely with me on this. And also the Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science  which gave me three years of funding to just do science all the time  and for that I'm very grateful. Thank you very much. We're going to talk    my    a new lecture  just for TED    and I'm going show you some illusions that we've created for TED  and I'm going to try to relate this to happiness. What I was thinking about with happiness is  what gives happiness    or happiness  which I equate with joy in my particular area  and I think there's something very fundamental. And I was thinking about this. And it's in terms of both illusions and movies that we go see and jokes and magic shows is that there's something about these things where our expectations are violated in some sort of pleasing way. You go see a movie. And it has an unexpected twist    something that you didn't expect    and you find a joyful experience. You look at those sort of illusions in my book and it's not as what you'd expect. And there's something joyful about it. And it's the same thing with jokes and all these sorts of things. So  what I'm going to try and do in my lecture is go a little bit further and see if I can violate your expectations in a pleasing way. I mean  sometimes expectations that are violated are not pleasant  but I'm going to try to do it in a pleasant way  in a very primal way  so I can make the audience here happy. So I'm going to show you some ways that we can violate your expectations. First of all  I want to show you the particular illusion here. I want you first of all when it pops up on the screen to notice that the two holes are perpendicular to each other. These are all perceptual tricks. These are real objects that I'm going to show you. Now I'm going to show you how it is done. I've looped the film here so you can get a very interesting experience. I want you to see how this illusion is constructed  and it's going to rotate so you see that it's inside out. Now watch  as it rotates back  how quickly your perception snaps. OK now. Watch it as it rotates back again. And this is a very bright audience  all right  See if you can stop it from happening  even though you know     percent it's true that    bam  You can't undo it. What does that tell you about yourselves  We're going to do it again. No doubt about it. See if you can stop it from happening. No. It's difficult. And we can violate your expectations in a whole variety of ways about representation  about shape  about color and so forth and it's very primal. And it's an interesting question to ponder  why these things    we find these things joyful. Why would we find them joyful  So  here's something that Lionel did a while ago. I like these sort of little things like this. Again  this is not an optical trick. This is what you would see. In other words  it's not a camera cut. It's a perceptual trick. OK. We can violate your expectations about shape. We can violate your expectations on representation    what an image represents. What do you see here  How many of you here see dolphins  Raise your hand if you see dolphins. OK  those people who raised their hands  afterwards  the rest of the audience  go talk to them  all right  Actually  this is the best example of priming by experience that I know. If you are a child under the age of    who haven't been ruined yet  you will look at this image and see dolphins. Now  some of you adults here are saying   What dolphins  What dolphins   But in fact  if you reversed the figure ground    in other words  the dark areas here    I forgot to ask for a pointer    but if you reverse it  you'll see a whole series of little dolphins. By the way  if you're also a student at CalTech    they also tend to just see the dolphins. It's based on experience. Now  something like this can be used because this is after all talk about design  too. This was done by Saatchi and Saatchi  and they actually got away with this ad in Australia. So  if you look at this ad for beer  all those people are in sort of provocative positions. But they got it passed  and actually won the Clio awards  so it's funny how you can do these things. Remember that sort of  um. This is the joke I did when the Florida ballot was going around. You know  count the dots for Gore  count the dots for Bush  count 'em again ... You can violate your expectations about experience. Here is an outside water fountain that I created with some friends of mine  but you can stop the water in drops and    actually make all the drops levitate. This is something we're building for  you know  amusement parks and that kind of stuff. Now let's take a static image. Can you see this  Do you see the middle section moving down and the outer sections moving up  It's completely static. It's a static image. How many people see this illusion  It's completely static. Right. Now  when    it's interesting that when we look at an image we see  you know  color  depth  texture. And you can look at this whole scene and analyze it. You can see the woman is in closer than the wall and so forth. But the whole thing is actually flat. It's painted. It's trompe l'oeil. And it was such a good trompe l'oeil that people got irritated when they tried to talk to the woman and she wouldn't respond. Now  you can make design mistakes. Like this building in New York. So that when you see it from this side  it looks like the balconies tilt up  and when you walk around to the other side it looks like the balconies go down. So there are cases where you have mistakes in design that incorporate illusions. Or  you take this particular un retouched photograph. Now  interestingly enough  I get a lot of emails from people who say   Is there any perceptual difference between males and females   And I really say   No.  I mean  women can navigate through the world just as well as males can    and why wouldn't they  However  this is the one illusion that women can consistently do better than males  in matching which head because they rely on fashion cues. They can match the hat. Okay  now getting to a part    I want to show design in illusions. I believe that the first example of illusions being used purposely was by da Vinci in this anamorphic image of an eye. So that when you saw from one little angle was like this. And this little technique got popular in the   th century and the   th century to disguise hidden meanings  where you could flip the image and see it from one little point of view like this. But these are early incorporations of illusions brought to    sort of high point with Hans Holbein's  Ambassadors.  And Hans Holbein worked for Henry VIII. This was hung on a wall where you could walk down from the stair and you can see this hidden skull. All right  now I'm going to show you some designers who work with illusions to give that element of surprise. One of my favorites is Scott Kim. I worked with Scott to create some illusions for TED that I hope you will enjoy. We have one here on TED and happiness. OK now. Arthur  Ganson  hasn't talked yet  but his is going to be a delightful talk and he has some of his really fantastic machines outside. And so  we    Scott created this wonderful tribute to Arthur Ganson. Well  there's analog and digital. Thought that was appropriate here. And figure goes to ground. And for the musicians. And of course  since happiness    we want  joy to the world.  Now  another great designer    he's very well known in Japan    Shigeo Fukuda. And he just builds some fantastic things. This is simply amazing. This is a pile of junk that when you view it from one particular angle  you see its reflection in the mirror as a perfect piano. Pianist transforms to violinist. This is really wild. This assemblage of forks  knives and spoons and various cutlery  welded together. It gives a shadow of a motorcycle. You learn something in the sort of thing that I do  which is there are people out there with a lot of time on their hands. Ken Knowlton does wonderful composite images  like creating Jacques Cousteau out of seashells    un retouched seashells  but just by rearranging them. He did Einstein out of dice because  after all  Einstein said   God does not play dice with the universe.  Bert Herzog out of un retouched keyboards. Will Shortz  crossword puzzle. John Cederquist does these wonderful trompe l'oeil cabinets. Now  I'm going to skip ahead since I'm sort of running  behind . I want to show you quickly what I've created  some new type of illusions. I've done something with taking the Pixar type illusions. So you see these kids the same size here  running down the hall. The two table tops of the same size. They're looking out two directions at once. You have a larger piece fitting in with a smaller. And that's something for you to think about  all right  So you see larger pieces fitting in within smaller pieces here. Does everyone see that  Which is impossible. You can see the two kids are looking out simultaneously out of two different directions at once. Now can you believe these two table tops are the same size and shape  They are. So  if you measured them  they would be. And as I say  those two figures are identical in size and shape. And it's interesting  by doing this in this sort of rendered fashion  how much stronger the illusions are. Any case  I hope this has brought you a little joy and happiness  and if you're interested in seeing more cool effects  see me outside. I'd be happy to show you lots of things. I'm supposed to scare you  because it's about fear  right  And you should be really afraid  but not for the reasons why you think you should be. You should be really afraid that    if we stick up the first slide on this thing    there we go    that you're missing out. Because if you spend this week thinking about Iraq and thinking about Bush and thinking about the stock market  you're going to miss one of the greatest adventures that we've ever been on. And this is what this adventure's really about. This is crystallized DNA. Every life form on this planet    every insect  every bacteria  every plant  every animal  every human  every politician     Laughter  is coded in that stuff. And if you want to take a single crystal of DNA  it looks like that. And we're just beginning to understand this stuff. And this is the single most exciting adventure that we have ever been on. It's the single greatest mapping project we've ever been on. If you think that the mapping of America's made a difference  or landing on the moon  or this other stuff  it's the map of ourselves and the map of every plant and every insect and every bacteria that really makes a difference. And it's beginning to tell us a lot about evolution. It turns out that what this stuff is    and Richard Dawkins has written about this    is  this is really a river out of Eden. So  the  .  billion base pairs inside each of your cells is really a history of where you've been for the past billion years. And we could start dating things  and we could start changing medicine and archeology. It turns out that if you take the human species about     years ago  white Europeans diverged from black Africans in a very significant way. White Europeans were subject to the plague. And when they were subject to the plague  most people didn't survive  but those who survived had a mutation on the CCR  receptor. And that mutation was passed on to their kids because they're the ones that survived  so there was a great deal of population pressure. In Africa  because you didn't have these cities  you didn't have that CCR  population pressure mutation. We can date it to     years ago. That is one of the reasons why AIDS is raging across Africa as fast as it is  and not as fast across Europe. And we're beginning to find these little things for malaria  for sickle cell  for cancers. And in the measure that we map ourselves  this is the single greatest adventure that we'll ever be on. And this Friday  I want you to pull out a really good bottle of wine  and I want you to toast these two people. Because this Friday     years ago  Watson and Crick found the structure of DNA  and that is almost as important a date as the   th of February when we first mapped ourselves  but anyway  we'll get to that. I thought we'd talk about the new zoo. So  all you guys have heard about DNA  all the stuff that DNA does  but some of the stuff we're discovering is kind of nifty because this turns out to be the single most abundant species on the planet. If you think you're successful or cockroaches are successful  it turns out that there's ten trillion trillion Pleurococcus sitting out there. And we didn't know that Pleurococcus was out there  which is part of the reason why this whole species mapping project is so important. Because we're just beginning to learn where we came from and what we are. And we're finding amoebas like this. This is the amoeba dubia. And the amoeba dubia doesn't look like much  except that each of you has about  .  billion letters  which is what makes you you  as far as gene code inside each of your cells  and this little amoeba which  you know  sits in water in hundreds and millions and billions  turns out to have     billion base pairs of gene code inside. So  this little thingamajig has a genome that's     times the size of yours. And if you're thinking of efficient information storage mechanisms  it may not turn out to be chips. It may turn out to be something that looks a little like that amoeba. And  again  we're learning from life and how life works. This funky little thing  people didn't used to think that it was worth taking samples out of nuclear reactors because it was dangerous and  of course  nothing lived there. And then finally somebody picked up a microscope and looked at the water that was sitting next to the cores. And sitting next to that water in the cores was this little Deinococcus radiodurans  doing a backstroke  having its chromosomes blown apart every day  six  seven times  restitching them  living in about     times the radiation that would kill you. And by now you should be getting a hint as to how diverse and how important and how interesting this journey into life is  and how many different life forms there are  and how there can be different life forms living in very different places  maybe even outside of this planet. Because if you can live in radiation that looks like this  that brings up a whole series of interesting questions. This little thingamajig  we didn't know this thingamajig existed. We should have known that this existed because this is the only bacteria that you can see to the naked eye. So  this thing is  .   millimeters. It lives in a deep trench off the coast of Namibia. And what you're looking at with this namibiensis is the biggest bacteria we've ever seen. So  it's about the size of a little period on a sentence. Again  we didn't know this thing was there three years ago. We're just beginning this journey of life in the new zoo. This is a really odd one. This is Ferroplasma. The reason why Ferroplasma is interesting is because it eats iron  lives inside the equivalent of battery acid  and excretes sulfuric acid. So  when you think of odd life forms  when you think of what it takes to live  it turns out this is a very efficient life form  and they call it an archaea. Archaea means  the ancient ones.  And the reason why they're ancient is because this thing came up when this planet was covered by things like sulfuric acid in batteries  and it was eating iron when the earth was part of a melted core. So  it's not just dogs and cats and whales and dolphins that you should be aware of and interested in on this little journey. Your fear should be that you are not  that you're paying attention to stuff which is temporal. I mean  George Bush    he's going to be gone  alright  Life isn't. Whether the humans survive or don't survive  these things are going to be living on this planet or other planets. And it's just beginning to understand this code of DNA that's really the most exciting intellectual adventure that we've ever been on. And you can do strange things with this stuff. This is a baby gar. Conservation group gets together  tries to figure out how to breed an animal that's almost extinct. They can't do it naturally  so what they do with this thing is they take a spoon  take some cells out of an adult gar's mouth  code  take the cells from that and insert it into a fertilized cow's egg  reprogram cow's egg    different gene code. When you do that  the cow gives birth to a gar. We are now experimenting with bongos  pandas  elims  Sumatran tigers  and the Australians    bless their hearts    are playing with these things. Now  the last of these things died in September     . These are Tasmanian tigers. The last known one died at the Hobart Zoo. But it turns out that as we learn more about gene code and how to reprogram species  we may be able to close the gene gaps in deteriorate DNA. And when we learn how to close the gene gaps  then we can put a full string of DNA together. And if we do that  and insert this into a fertilized wolf's egg  we may give birth to an animal that hasn't walked the earth since     . And then you can start going back further  and you can start thinking about dodos  and you can think about other species. And in other places  like Maryland  they're trying to figure out what the primordial ancestor is. Because each of us contains our entire gene code of where we've been for the past billion years  because we've evolved from that stuff  you can take that tree of life and collapse it back  and in the measure that you learn to reprogram  maybe we'll give birth to something that is very close to the first primordial ooze. And it's all coming out of things that look like this. These are companies that didn't exist five years ago. Huge gene sequencing facilities the size of football fields. Some are public. Some are private. It takes about   billion dollars to sequence a human being the first time. Takes about   million dollars the second time. We will have a       dollar genome within the next five to eight years. That means each of you will contain on a CD your entire gene code. And it will be really boring. It will read like this. The really neat thing about this stuff is that's life. And Laurie's going to talk about this one a little bit. Because if you happen to find this one inside your body  you're in big trouble  because that's the source code for Ebola. That's one of the deadliest diseases known to humans. But plants work the same way and insects work the same way  and this apple works the same way. This apple is the same thing as this floppy disk. Because this thing codes ones and zeros  and this thing codes A  T  C  Gs  and it sits up there  absorbing energy on a tree  and one fine day it has enough energy to say  execute  and it goes  thump . Right  And when it does that  pushes a .EXE  what it does is  it executes the first line of code  which reads just like that  AATCAGGGACCC  and that means  make a root. Next line of code  make a stem. Next line of code  TACGGGG  make a flower that's white  that blooms in the spring  that smells like this. In the measure that you have the code and the measure that you read it    and  by the way  the first plant was read two years ago  the first human was read two years ago  the first insect was read two years ago. The first thing that we ever read was in       a little bacteria called Haemophilus influenzae. In the measure that you have the source code  as all of you know  you can change the source code  and you can reprogram life forms so that this little thingy becomes a vaccine  or this little thingy starts producing biomaterials  which is why DuPont is now growing a form of polyester that feels like silk in corn. This changes all rules. This is life  but we're reprogramming it. This is what you look like. This is one of your chromosomes. And what you can do now is  you can outlay exactly what your chromosome is  and what the gene code on that chromosome is right here  and what those genes code for  and what animals they code against  and then you can tie it to the literature. And in the measure that you can do that  you can go home today  and get on the Internet  and access the world's biggest public library  which is a library of life. And you can do some pretty strange things because in the same way as you can reprogram this apple  if you go to Cliff Tabin's lab at the Harvard Medical School  he's reprogramming chicken embryos to grow more wings. Why would Cliff be doing that  He doesn't have a restaurant. The reason why he's reprogramming that animal to have more wings is because when you used to play with lizards as a little child  and you picked up the lizard  sometimes the tail fell off  but it regrew. Not so in human beings  you cut off an arm  you cut off a leg    it doesn't regrow. But because each of your cells contains your entire gene code  each cell can be reprogrammed  if we don't stop stem cell research and if we don't stop genomic research  to express different body functions. And in the measure that we learn how chickens grow wings  and what the program is for those cells to differentiate  one of the things we're going to be able to do is to stop undifferentiated cells  which you know as cancer  and one of the things we're going to learn how to do is how to reprogram cells like stem cells in such a way that they express bone  stomach  skin  pancreas. And you are likely to be wandering around    and your children    on regrown body parts in a reasonable period of time  in some places in the world where they don't stop the research. How's this stuff work  If each of you differs from the person next to you by one in a thousand  but only three percent codes  which means it's only one in a thousand times three percent  very small differences in expression and punctuation can make a significant difference. Take a simple declarative sentence. Right  That's perfectly clear. So  men read that sentence  and they look at that sentence  and they read this. Okay  Now  women look at that sentence and they say  uh uh  wrong. This is the way it should be seen. That's what your genes are doing. That's why you differ from this person over here by one in a thousand. Right  But  you know  he's reasonably good looking  but... I won't go there. You can do this stuff even without changing the punctuation. You can look at this  right  And they look at the world a little differently. They look at the same world and they say... That's how the same gene code    that's why you have        genes  mice have        genes  husbands have        genes. Mice and men are the same. Wives know that  but anyway. You can make very small changes in gene code and get really different outcomes  even with the same string of letters. That's what your genes are doing every day. That's why sometimes a person's genes don't have to change a lot to get cancer. These little chippies  these things are the size of a credit card. They will test any one of you for        genetic conditions. That brings up questions of privacy and insurability and all kinds of stuff  but it also allows us to start going after diseases  because if you run a person who has leukemia through something like this  it turns out that three diseases with completely similar clinical syndromes are completely different diseases. Because in ALL leukemia  that set of genes over there over expresses. In MLL  it's the middle set of genes  and in AML  it's the bottom set of genes. And if one of those particular things is expressing in your body  then you take Gleevec and you're cured. If it is not expressing in your body  if you don't have one of those types    a particular one of those types    don't take Gleevec. It won't do anything for you. Same thing with Receptin if you've got breast cancer. Don't have an HER   receptor  Don't take Receptin. Changes the nature of medicine. Changes the predictions of medicine. Changes the way medicine works. The greatest repository of knowledge when most of us went to college was this thing  and it turns out that this is not so important any more. The U.S. Library of Congress  in terms of its printed volume of data  contains less data than is coming out of a good genomics company every month on a compound basis. Let me say that again  A single genomics company generates more data in a month  on a compound basis  than is in the printed collections of the Library of Congress. This is what's been powering the U.S. economy. It's Moore's Law. So  all of you know that the price of computers halves every    months and the power doubles  right  Except that when you lay that side by side with the speed with which gene data's being deposited in GenBank  Moore's Law is right here  it's the blue line. This is on a log scale  and that's what superexponential growth means. This is going to push computers to have to grow faster than they've been growing  because so far  there haven't been applications that have been required that need to go faster than Moore's Law. This stuff does. And here's an interesting map. This is a map which was finished at the Harvard Business School. One of the really interesting questions is  if all this data's free  who's using it  This is the greatest public library in the world. Well  it turns out that there's about    trillion bits moving inside from the United States to the United States  about  .  trillion is going over to those European countries  about  . 's going to Japan  there's almost no communication between Japan  and nobody else is literate in this stuff. It's free. No one's reading it. They're focusing on the war  they're focusing on Bush  they're not interested in life. So  this is what a new map of the world looks like. That is the genomically literate world. And that is a problem. In fact  it's not a genomically literate world. You can break this out by states. And you can watch states rise and fall depending on their ability to speak a language of life  and you can watch New York fall off a cliff  and you can watch New Jersey fall off a cliff  and you can watch the rise of the new empires of intelligence. And you can break it out by counties  because it's specific counties. And if you want to get more specific  it's actually specific zip codes. So  you want to know where life is happening  Well  in Southern California it's happening in      . And that's it. And that's the triangle between Salk  Scripps  UCSD  and it's called Torrey Pines Road. That means you don't need to be a big nation to be successful  it means you don't need a lot of people to be successful  and it means you can move most of the wealth of a country in about three or four carefully picked    s. Same thing in Massachusetts. Looks more spread out but    oh  by the way  the ones that are the same color are contiguous. What's the net effect of this  In an agricultural society  the difference between the richest and the poorest  the most productive and the least productive  was five to one. Why  Because in agriculture  if you had    kids and you grow up a little bit earlier and you work a little bit harder  you could produce about five times more wealth  on average  than your neighbor. In a knowledge society  that number is now     to  . It really matters if you're literate  not just in reading and writing in English and French and German  but in Microsoft and Linux and Apple. And very soon it's going to matter if you're literate in life code. So  if there is something you should fear  it's that you're not keeping your eye on the ball. Because it really matters who speaks life. That's why nations rise and fall. And it turns out that if you went back to the     s  the most productive nation on earth was Australia  per person. And New Zealand was way up there. And then the U.S. came in about       and then Switzerland about       and then the U.S. got back on top    beat up their chocolates and cuckoo clocks. And today  of course  you all know that the most productive nation on earth is Luxembourg  producing about one third more wealth per person per year than America. Tiny landlocked state. No oil. No diamonds. No natural resources. Just smart people moving bits. Different rules. Here's differential productivity rates. Here's how many people it takes to produce a single U.S. patent. So  about       Americans        Koreans         Brits          Argentines. You want to know why Argentina's crashing  It's got nothing to do with inflation. It's got nothing to do with privatization. You can take a Harvard educated Ivy League economist  stick him in charge of Argentina. He still crashes the country because he doesn't understand how the rules have changed. Oh  yeah  and it takes about  .  million Indians. Well  watch what happens to India. India and China used to be    percent of the global economy just at the Industrial Revolution  and they are now about  .  percent. Two billion people. One third of the global population producing   percent of the wealth because they didn't get this change  because they kept treating their people like serfs instead of like shareholders of a common project. They didn't keep the people who were educated. They didn't foment the businesses. They didn't do the IPOs. Silicon Valley did. And that's why they say that Silicon Valley has been powered by ICs. Not integrated circuits  Indians and Chinese. Here's what's happening in the world. It turns out that if you'd gone to the U.N. in       when it was founded  there were    countries in this world. It turns out there's now about    . Country after country is splitting  seceding  succeeding  failing    and it's all getting very fragmented. And this has not stopped. In the     s  these are sovereign states that did not exist before     . And this doesn't include fusions or name changes or changes in flags. We're generating about  .   states per year. People are taking control of their own states  sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse. And the really interesting thing is  you and your kids are empowered to build great empires  and you don't need a lot to do it. And  given that the music is over  I was going to talk about how you can use this to generate a lot of wealth  and how code works. Moderator  Two minutes. Juan Enriquez  No  I'm going to stop there and we'll do it next year because I don't want to take any of Laurie's time. But thank you very much. I'd like to begin this song I wrote about ceaseless yearning and never ending want with a poem of popular Petrarchan paradoxes by Sir Thomas Wyatt the Elder   I find no peace  and all my war is done  I fear and hope  I burn and freeze like ice  I fly above the wind  and yet I cannot arise  And naught I have  and all the world I seize upon.    I want what I can't have  need what I can't want     Have what I don't have  what I want     What I can't have  need what I can't want     Have what I don't have  what I want     What I can't have  need what I can't want     Have what I don't have  what I want     What I can't have  need what I can't want     Have what I don't have  what I want     What I can't have  need what I can't want     Have but I don't have     It feels like all I got is loss on a bad back     Gone with the last train  honey don't you fret     Every cloud has a silver lining     Just a little rain  just a little rain  just a little rain     I want what I can't have  need what I can't want     Have what I don't have  what I want     What I can't have  need what I can't want     Have but I don't have     My mind won't stop  and my heart says go     Nobody knows how to hold me     My mind won't stop  and my heart says       Good things come to those who wait      And I can't stand in ...

Now  I've got a story for you. When I arrived off the plane  after a very long journey from the West of England  my computer  my beloved laptop  had gone mad  and had    oh     a bit like that     and the display on it    anyway  the whole thing had burst. And I went to the IT guys here and a gentleman mended my computer  and then he said   What are you doing here   and I said  I'm playing the cello and I'm doing a bit of singing   and he said   Oh  I sort of play the cello as well.  And I said   Do you really   Anyway  so you're in for a treat  because he's fantastic  and his name's Mark. I am also joined by my partner in crime  Thomas Dolby. This song is called  Farther than the Sun.    Strung in the wind I called you     but you did not hear ...     And you're a plant that needs poor soil     and I have treated you too well     to give up flowers ...     Oh  I have been too rich for you ...     Farther than the sun from me     Farther than I'd have you be     And I go north  I get so cold     My heart is lava under stone     You are not worthy     You are not worthy ...     With your calculating eyes     spinning figures     you cannot see me     You cannot see me ...     And if I tell myself enough     I'll believe it     You are not worthy     The sea  it freezes over ...     to trap the light     And I'm in love with being in love     and you were never quite the one     In Gerda's eyes     Fragments of what you've become     And all the moths that fly at night     believe electric light is bright     You are not worthy     You are not worthy     With your calculating eyes     Spinning figures     You cannot see me  no     And if I tell myself enough     I'll believe it     You are not worthy     Farther than the sun from me     Farther than I'd have you be     And I go north  I get so cold     My heart is lava under stone     You are not worthy     You are not worthy     With your calculating eyes     Spinning figures     You cannot see me  no ...     And if I tell myself enough  I'll believe it   Thank you very much. So I'm going to speak about a problem that I have and that's that I'm a philosopher. When I go to a party and people ask me what do I do and I say   I'm a professor   their eyes glaze over. When I go to an academic cocktail party and there are all the professors around  they ask me what field I'm in and I say   philosophy     their eyes glaze over. When I go to a philosopher's party and they ask me what I work on and I say   consciousness   their eyes don't glaze over    their lips curl into a snarl. And I get hoots of derision and cackles and growls because they think   That's impossible  You can't explain consciousness.  The very chutzpah of somebody thinking that you could explain consciousness is just out of the question. My late  lamented friend Bob Nozick  a fine philosopher  in one of his books   Philosophical Explanations   is commenting on the ethos of philosophy    the way philosophers go about their business. And he says  you know   Philosophers love rational argument.  And he says   It seems as if the ideal argument for most philosophers is you give your audience the premises and then you give them the inferences and the conclusion  and if they don't accept the conclusion  they die. Their heads explode.  The idea is to have an argument that is so powerful that it knocks out your opponents. But in fact that doesn't change people's minds at all. It's very hard to change people's minds about something like consciousness  and I finally figured out the reason for that. The reason for that is that everybody's an expert on consciousness. We heard the other day that everybody's got a strong opinion about video games. They all have an idea for a video game  even if they're not experts. But they don't consider themselves experts on video games  they've just got strong opinions. I'm sure that people here who work on  say  climate change and global warming  or on the future of the Internet  encounter people who have very strong opinions about what's going to happen next. But they probably don't think of these opinions as expertise. They're just strongly held opinions. But with regard to consciousness  people seem to think  each of us seems to think   I am an expert. Simply by being conscious  I know all about this.  And so  you tell them your theory and they say   No  no  that's not the way consciousness is  No  you've got it all wrong.  And they say this with an amazing confidence. And so what I'm going to try to do today is to shake your confidence. Because I know the feeling    I can feel it myself. I want to shake your confidence that you know your own innermost minds    that you are  yourselves  authoritative about your own consciousness. That's the order of the day here. Now  this nice picture shows a thought balloon  a thought bubble. I think everybody understands what that means. That's supposed to exhibit the stream of consciousness. This is my favorite picture of consciousness that's ever been done. It's a Saul Steinberg of course    it was a New Yorker cover. And this fellow here is looking at the painting by Braque. That reminds him of the word baroque  barrack  bark  poodle  Suzanne R.    he's off to the races. There's a wonderful stream of consciousness here and if you follow it along  you learn a lot about this man. What I particularly like about this picture  too  is that Steinberg has rendered the guy in this sort of pointillist style. Which reminds us  as Rod Brooks was saying yesterday  what we are  what each of us is    what you are  what I am    is approximately     trillion little cellular robots. That's what we're made of. No other ingredients at all. We're just made of cells  about     trillion of them. Not a single one of those cells is conscious  not a single one of those cells knows who you are  or cares. Somehow  we have to explain how when you put together teams  armies  battalions of hundreds of millions of little robotic unconscious cells    not so different really from a bacterium  each one of them    the result is this. I mean  just look at it. The content    there's color  there's ideas  there's memories  there's history. And somehow all that content of consciousness is accomplished by the busy activity of those hoards of neurons. How is that possible  Many people just think it isn't possible at all. They think   No  there can't be any sort of naturalistic explanation of consciousness.  This is a lovely book by a friend of mine named Lee Siegel  who's a professor of religion  actually  at the University of Hawaii  and he's an expert magician  and an expert on the street magic of India  which is what this book is about   Net of Magic.  And there's a passage in it which I would love to share with you. It speaks so eloquently to the problem.  'I'm writing a book on magic ' I explain  and I'm asked  'Real magic ' By 'real magic ' people mean miracles  thaumaturgical acts  and supernatural powers. 'No ' I answer. 'Conjuring tricks  not real magic.' 'Real magic ' in other words  refers to the magic that is not real  while the magic that is real  that can actually be done  is not real magic.  Now  that's the way a lot of people feel about consciousness. Real consciousness is not a bag of tricks. If you're going to explain this as a bag of tricks  then it's not real consciousness  whatever it is. And  as Marvin said  and as other people have said   Consciousness is a bag of tricks.  This means that a lot of people are just left completely dissatisfied and incredulous when I attempt to explain consciousness. So this is the problem. So I have to do a little bit of the sort of work that a lot of you won't like  for the same reason that you don't like to see a magic trick explained to you. How many of you here  if somebody    some smart aleck    starts telling you how a particular magic trick is done  you sort of want to block your ears and say   No  no  I don't want to know  Don't take the thrill of it away. I'd rather be mystified. Don't tell me the answer.  A lot of people feel that way about consciousness  I've discovered. And I'm sorry if I impose some clarity  some understanding on you. You'd better leave now if you don't want to know some of these tricks. But I'm not going to explain it all to you. I'm going to do what philosophers do. Here's how a philosopher explains the sawing the lady in half trick. You know the sawing the lady in half trick  The philosopher says   I'm going to explain to you how that's done. You see  the magician doesn't really saw the lady in half.   He merely makes you think that he does.  And you say   Yes  and how does he do that   He says   Oh  that's not my department  I'm sorry.  So now I'm going to illustrate how philosophers explain consciousness. But I'm going to try to also show you that consciousness isn't quite as marvelous    your own consciousness isn't quite as wonderful    as you may have thought it is. This is something  by the way  that Lee Siegel talks about in his book. He marvels at how he'll do a magic show  and afterwards people will swear they saw him do X  Y  and Z. He never did those things. He didn't even try to do those things. People's memories inflate what they think they saw. And the same is true of consciousness. Now  let's see if this will work. All right. Let's just watch this. Watch it carefully. I'm working with a young computer animator documentarian named Nick Deamer  and this is a little demo that he's done for me  part of a larger project some of you may be interested in. We're looking for a backer. It's a feature length documentary on consciousness. OK  now  you all saw what changed  right  How many of you noticed that every one of those squares changed color  Every one. I'll just show you by running it again. Even when you know that they're all going to change color  it's very hard to notice. You have to really concentrate to pick up any of the changes at all. Now  this is an example    one of many    of a phenomenon that's now being studied quite a bit. It's one that I predicted in the last page or two of my      book   Consciousness Explained   where I said if you did experiments of this sort  you'd find that people were unable to pick up really large changes. If there's time at the end  I'll show you the much more dramatic case. Now  how can it be that there are all those changes going on  and that we're not aware of them  Well  earlier today  Jeff Hawkins mentioned the way your eye saccades  the way your eye moves around three or four times a second. He didn't mention the speed. Your eye is constantly in motion  moving around  looking at eyes  noses  elbows  looking at interesting things in the world. And where your eye isn't looking  you're remarkably impoverished in your vision. That's because the foveal part of your eye  which is the high resolution part  is only about the size of your thumbnail held at arms length. That's the detail part. It doesn't seem that way  does it  It doesn't seem that way  but that's the way it is. You're getting in a lot less information than you think. Here's a completely different effect. This is a painting by Bellotto. It's in the museum in North Carolina. Bellotto was a student of Canaletto's. And I love paintings like that    the painting is actually about as big as it is right here. And I love Canalettos  because Canaletto has this fantastic detail  and you can get right up and see all the details on the painting. And I started across the hall in North Carolina  because I thought it was probably a Canaletto  and would have all that in detail. And I noticed that on the bridge there  there's a lot of people    you can just barely see them walking across the bridge. And I thought as I got closer I would be able to see all the detail of most people  see their clothes  and so forth. And as I got closer and closer  I actually screamed. I yelled out because when I got closer  I found the detail wasn't there at all. There were just little artfully placed blobs of paint. And as I walked towards the picture  I was expecting detail that wasn't there. The artist had very cleverly suggested people and clothes and wagons and all sorts of things  and my brain had taken the suggestion. You're familiar with a more recent technology  which is    There  you can get a better view of the blobs. See  when you get close they're really just blobs of paint. You will have seen something like this    this is the reverse effect. I'll just give that to you one more time. Now  what does your brain do when it takes the suggestion  When an artful blob of paint or two  by an artist  suggests a person    say  one of Marvin Minsky's little society of mind    do they send little painters out to fill in all the details in your brain somewhere  I don't think so. Not a chance. But then  how on Earth is it done  Well  remember the philosopher's explanation of the lady  It's the same thing. The brain just makes you think that it's got the detail there. You think the detail's there  but it isn't there. The brain isn't actually putting the detail in your head at all. It's just making you expect the detail. Let's just do this experiment very quickly. Is the shape on the left the same as the shape on the right  rotated  Yes. How many of you did it by rotating the one on the left in your mind's eye  to see if it matched up with the one on the right  How many of you rotated the one on the right  OK. How do you know that's what you did  There's in fact been a very interesting debate raging for over    years in cognitive science    various experiments started by Roger Shepherd  who measured the angular velocity of rotation of mental images. Yes  it's possible to do that. But the details of the process are still in significant controversy. And if you read that literature  one of the things that you really have to come to terms with is even when you're the subject in the experiment  you don't know. You don't know how you do it. You just know that you have certain beliefs. And they come in a certain order  at a certain time. And what explains the fact that that's what you think  Well  that's where you have to go backstage and ask the magician. This is a figure that I love  Bradley  Petrie  and Dumais. You may think that I've cheated  that I've put a little whiter than white boundary there. How many of you see that sort of boundary  with the Necker cube floating in front of the circles  Can you see it  Well  you know  in effect  the boundary's really there  in a certain sense. Your brain is actually computing that boundary  the boundary that goes right there. But now  notice there are two ways of seeing the cube  right  It's a Necker cube. Everybody can see the two ways of seeing the cube  OK. Can you see the four ways of seeing the cube  Because there's another way of seeing it. If you're seeing it as a cube floating in front of some circles  some black circles  there's another way of seeing it. As a cube  on a black background  as seen through a piece of Swiss cheese. Can you get it  How many of you can't get it  That'll help. Now you can get it. These are two very different phenomena. When you see the cube one way  behind the screen  those boundaries go away. But there's still a sort of filling in  as we can tell if we look at this. We don't have any trouble seeing the cube  but where does the color change  Does your brain have to send little painters in there  The purple painters and the green painters fight over who's going to paint that bit behind the curtain  No. Your brain just lets it go. The brain doesn't need to fill that in. When I first started talking about the Bradley  Petrie  Dumais example that you just saw    I'll go back to it  this one    I said that there was no filling in behind there. And I supposed that that was just a flat truth  always true. But Rob Van Lier has recently shown that it isn't. Now  if you think you see some pale yellow    I'll run this a few more times. Look in the gray areas  and see if you seem to see something sort of shadowy moving in there    yeah  it's amazing. There's nothing there. It's no trick.   Failure to Detect Changes in Scenes  slide  This is Ron Rensink's work  which was in some degree inspired by that suggestion right at the end of the book. Let me just pause this for a second if I can. This is change blindness. What you're going to see is two pictures  one of which is slightly different from the other. You see here the red roof and the gray roof  and in between them there will be a mask  which is just a blank screen  for about a quarter of a second. So you'll see the first picture  then a mask  then the second picture  then a mask. And this will just continue  and your job as the subject is to press the button when you see the change. So  show the original picture for     milliseconds. Blank. Show the next picture for     milliseconds. Blank. And keep going  until the subject presses the button  saying   I see the change.  So now we're going to be subjects in the experiment. We're going to start easy. Some examples. No trouble there. Can everybody see  All right. Indeed  Rensink's subjects took only a little bit more than a second to press the button. Can you see that one   .  seconds. How many don't see it still  What's on the roof of that barn  It's easy. Is it a bridge or a dock  There are a few more really dramatic ones  and then I'll close. I want you to see a few that are particularly striking. This one because it's so large and yet it's pretty hard to see. Can you see it  Audience  Yes. Dan Dennett  See the shadows going back and forth  Pretty big. So   .  seconds is the median time for subjects in his experiment there. I love this one. I'll end with this one  just because it's such an obvious and important thing. How many still don't see it  How many still don't see it  How many engines on the wing of that Boeing  Right in the middle of the picture  Thanks very much for your attention. What I wanted to show you is that scientists  using their from the outside  third person methods  can tell you things about your own consciousness that you would never dream of  and that  in fact  you're not the authority on your own consciousness that you think you are. And we're really making a lot of progress on coming up with a theory of mind. Jeff Hawkins  this morning  was describing his attempt to get theory  and a good  big theory  into the neuroscience. And he's right. This is a problem. Harvard Medical School once    I was at a talk    director of the lab said   In our lab  we have a saying. If you work on one neuron  that's neuroscience. If you work on two neurons  that's psychology.  We have to have more theory  and it can come as much from the top down. Thank you very much. I'm not quite sure whether I really want to see a snare drum at nine o'clock or so in the morning. But anyway  it's just great to see such a full theater  and really I must thank Herbie Hancock and his colleagues for such a great presentation.  Applause  One of the interesting things  of course  is the combination of that raw hand on the instrument and technology  and of course what he said about listening to our young people. Of course  my job is all about listening  and my aim  really  is to teach the world to listen. That's my only real aim in life. And it sounds quite simple  but actually it's quite a big  big job. Because you know  when you look at a piece of music    for example  if I just open my little motorbike bag    we have here  hopefully  a piece of music that is full of little black dots on the page. And  you know  we open it up and I read the music. So technically  I can actually read this. I will follow the instructions  the tempo markings  the dynamics. I will do exactly as I'm told. And so therefore  because time is short  if I just play you literally the first maybe two lines or so. It's very straightforward. There's nothing too difficult about the piece. But here I'm being told that the piece of music is very quick. I'm being told where to play on the drum. I'm being told which part of the stick to use. And I'm being told the dynamic. And I'm also being told that the drum is without snares. Snares on  snares off. So therefore  if I translate this piece of music  we have this idea.  Music  And so on. My career would probably last about five years. However  what I have to do as a musician is do everything that is not on the music. Everything that there isn't time to learn from a teacher  or to talk about  even  from a teacher. But it's the things that you notice when you're not actually with your instrument that in fact become so interesting  and that you want to explore through this tiny  tiny surface of a drum. So there  we experience the translation. Now we'll experience the interpretation.  Music   Applause  Now my career may last a little longer  But in a way  you know  it's the same if I look at you and I see a nice bright young lady with a pink top on. I see that you're clutching a teddy bear  etc.  etc. So I get a basic idea as to what you might be about  what you might like  what you might do as a profession  etc.  etc. However  that's just  you know  the initial idea I may have that we all get when we actually look  and we try to interpret  but actually it's so unbelievably shallow. In the same way  I look at the music  I get a basic idea  I wonder what technically might be hard  or  you know  what I want to do. Just the basic feeling. However  that is simply not enough. And I think what Herbie said    please listen  listen. We have to listen to ourselves  first of all. If I play  for example  holding the stick    where literally I do not let go of the stick    you'll experience quite a lot of shock coming up through the arm. And you feel really quite    believe it or not    detached from the instrument and from the stick  even though I'm actually holding the stick quite tightly. By holding it tightly  I feel strangely more detached. If I just simply let go and allow my hand  my arm  to be more of a support system  suddenly I have more dynamic with less effort. Much more. And I just feel  at last  one with the stick and one with the drum. And I'm doing far  far less. So in the same way that I need time with this instrument  I need time with people in order to interpret them. Not just translate them  but interpret them. If  for example  I play just a few bars of a piece of music for which I think of myself as a technician    that is  someone who is basically a percussion player ...  Music  And so on. If I think of myself as a musician ...  Music  And so on. There is a little bit of a difference there that is worth just     Applause     thinking about. And I remember when I was    years old  and I started playing tympani and percussion  and my teacher said   Well  how are we going to do this  You know  music is about listening.  And I said   Yes  I agree with that. So what's the problem   And he said   Well  how are you going to hear this  How are you going to hear that   And I said   Well  how do you hear it   He said   Well  I think I hear it through here.  And I said   Well  I think I do too    but I also hear it through my hands  through my arms  cheekbones  my scalp  my tummy  my chest  my legs and so on.  And so we began our lessons every single time tuning drums    in particular  the kettle drums  or tympani    to such a narrow pitch interval  so something like ... that of a difference. Then gradually ... and gradually ... and it's amazing that when you do open your body up  and open your hand up to allow the vibration to come through  that in fact the tiny  tiny difference ... can be felt with just the tiniest part of your finger  there. And so what we would do is that I would put my hands on the wall of the music room  and together we would  listen  to the sounds of the instruments  and really try to connect with those sounds far  far more broadly than simply depending on the ear. Because of course  the ear is  I mean  subject to all sorts of things. The room we happen to be in  the amplification  the quality of the instrument  the type of sticks ... etc.  etc. They're all different. Same amount of weight  but different sound colors. And that's basically what we are. We're just human beings  but we all have our own little sound colors  as it were  that make up these extraordinary personalities and characters and interests and things. And as I grew older  I then auditioned for the Royal Academy of Music in London  and they said   Well  no  we won't accept you  because we haven't a clue  you know  of the future of a so called 'deaf' musician.  And I just couldn't quite accept that. And so therefore  I said to them   Well  look  if you refuse    if you refuse me through those reasons  as opposed to the ability to perform and to understand and love the art of creating sound    then we have to think very  very hard about the people you do actually accept.  And as a result    once we got over a little hurdle  and having to audition twice    they accepted me. And not only that    what had happened was that it changed the whole role of the music institutions throughout the United Kingdom. Under no circumstances were they to refuse any application whatsoever on the basis of whether someone had no arms  no legs    they could still perhaps play a wind instrument if it was supported on a stand. No circumstances at all were used to refuse any entry. And every single entry had to be listened to  experienced and then based on the musical ability    then that person could either enter or not. So therefore  this in turn meant that there was an extremely interesting bunch of students who arrived in these various music institutions. And I have to say  many of them now in the professional orchestras throughout the world. The interesting thing about this as well  though    is quite simply that not only were people connected with sound    which is basically all of us  and we well know that music really is our daily medicine. I say  music   but actually I mean  sound.  Because you know  some of the extraordinary things I've experienced as a musician  when you may have a    year old lad who has got the most incredible challenges  who may not be able to control his movements  who may be deaf  who may be blind  etc.  etc.    suddenly  if that young lad sits close to this instrument  and perhaps even lies underneath the marimba  and you play something that's so incredibly organ like  almost    I don't really have the right sticks  perhaps    but something like this. Let me change.  Music  Something that's so unbelievably simple    but he would be experiencing something that I wouldn't be  because I'm on top of the sound. I have the sound coming this way. He would have the sound coming through the resonators. If there were no resonators on here  we would have ...  Music  So he would have a fullness of sound that those of you in the front few rows wouldn't experience  those of you in the back few rows wouldn't experience either. Every single one of us  depending on where we're sitting  will experience this sound quite  quite differently. And of course  being the participator of the sound  and that is starting from the idea of what type of sound I want to produce    for example  this sound. Can you hear anything  Exactly. Because I'm not even touching it. But yet  we get the sensation of something happening. In the same way that when I see tree moves  then I imagine that tree making a rustling sound. Do you see what I mean  Whatever the eye sees  then there's always sound happening. So there's always  always that huge    I mean  just this kaleidoscope of things to draw from. So all of my performances are based on entirely what I experience  and not by learning a piece of music  putting on someone else's interpretation of it  buying all the CDs possible of that particular piece of music  and so on and so forth. Because that isn't giving me enough of something that is so raw and so basic  and something that I can fully experience the journey of. So it may be that  in certain halls  this dynamic may well work.  Music  It may be that in other halls  they're simply not going to experience that at all and so therefore  my level of soft  gentle playing may have to be ...  Music  Do you see what I mean  So  because of this explosion in access to sound  especially through the deaf community  this has not only affected how music institutions  how schools for the deaf treat sound    and not just as a means of therapy    although of course  being a participator of music  that definitely is the case as well. But it's meant that acousticians have had to really think about the types of halls they put together. There are so few halls in this world that actually have very good acoustics  dare I say. But by that I mean where you can absolutely do anything you imagine. The tiniest  softest  softest sound to something that is so broad  so huge  so incredible  There's always something    it may sound good up there  may not be so good there. May be great there  but terrible up there. Maybe terrible over there  but not too bad there  etc.  etc. So to find an actual hall is incredible    for which you can play exactly what you imagine  without it being cosmetically enhanced. And so therefore  acousticians are actually in conversation with people who are hearing impaired  and who are participators of sound. And this is quite interesting. I cannot  you know  give you any detail as far as what is actually happening with those halls  but it's just the fact that they are going to a group of people for whom so many years we've been saying   Well  how on Earth can they experience music  You know  they're deaf.  We just    we go like that  and we imagine that that's what deafness is about. Or we go like that  and we imagine that's what blindness is about. If we see someone in a wheelchair  we assume they cannot walk. It may be that they can walk three  four  five steps. That  to them  means they can walk. In a year's time  it could be two extra steps. In another year's time  three extra steps. Those are hugely important aspects to think about. So when we do listen to each other  it's unbelievably important for us to really test our listening skills  to really use our bodies as a resonating chamber  to stop the judgment. For me  as a musician who deals with    percent of new music  it's very easy for me to say   Oh yes  I like that piece. Oh no  I don't like that piece.  And so on. And you know  I just find that I have to give those pieces of music real time. It may be that the chemistry isn't quite right between myself and that particular piece of music  but that doesn't mean I have the right to say it's a bad piece of music. And you know  it's just one of the great things about being a musician  is that it is so unbelievably fluid. So there are no rules  no right  no wrong  this way  that way. If I asked you to clap    maybe I can do this. If I can just say   Please clap and create the sound of thunder.  I'm assuming we've all experienced thunder. Now  I don't mean just the sound  I mean really listen to that thunder within yourselves. And please try to create that through your clapping. Try. Just    please try. Very good  Snow. Snow. Have you ever heard snow  Audience  No. Evelyn Glennie  Well then  stop clapping.  Laughter  Try again. Try again. Snow. See  you're awake. Rain. Not bad. Not bad. You know  the interesting thing here  though  is that I asked a group of kids not so long ago exactly the same question. Now    great imagination  thank you very much. However  not one of you got out of your seats to think   Right  How can I clap  OK  maybe ...  Claps  Maybe I can use my jewelry to create extra sounds. Maybe I can use the other parts of my body to create extra sounds.  Not a single one of you thought about clapping in a slightly different way other than sitting in your seats there and using two hands. In the same way that when we listen to music  we assume that it's all being fed through here. This is how we experience music. Of course it's not. We experience thunder    thunder  thunder. Think  think  think. Listen  listen  listen. Now    what can we do with thunder  I remember my teacher. When I first started  my very first lesson  I was all prepared with sticks  ready to go. And instead of him saying   OK  Evelyn  please  feet slightly apart  arms at a more or less    degree angle  sticks in a more or less V shape  keep this amount of space here  etc. Please keep your back straight  etc.  etc.  etc.     where I was probably just going to end up absolutely rigid  frozen  and I would not be able to strike the drum  because I was thinking of so many other things    he said   Evelyn  take this drum away for seven days  and I'll see you next week.  So  heavens  What was I to do  I no longer required the sticks  I wasn't allowed to have these sticks. I had to basically look at this particular drum  see how it was made  what these little lugs did  what the snares did. Turned it upside down  experimented with the shell  experimented with the head. Experimented with my body  experimented with jewelry  experimented with all sorts of things. And of course  I returned with all sorts of bruises and things like that    but nevertheless  it was such an unbelievable experience  because then  where on Earth are you going to experience that in a piece of music  Where on Earth are you going to experience that in a study book  So we never  ever dealt with actual study books. So for example  one of the things that we learn when we are dealing with being a percussion player  as opposed to a musician  is basically straightforward single stroke rolls. Like that. And then we get a little faster and a little faster and a little faster. And so on and so forth. What does this piece require  Single stroke rolls. So why can't I then do that whilst learning a piece of music  And that's exactly what he did. And interestingly  the older I became  and when I became a full time student at a so called  music institution   all of that went out of the window. We had to study from study books. And constantly  the question   Well  why  Why  What is this relating to  I need to play a piece of music.   Oh  well  this will help your control    Well  how  Why do I need to learn that  I need to relate it to a piece of music. You know. I need to say something.  Why am I practicing paradiddles  Is it just literally for control  for hand stick control  Why am I doing that  I need to have the reason  and the reason has to be by saying something through the music.  And by saying something through music  which basically is sound  we then can reach all sorts of things to all sorts of people. But I don't want to take responsibility of your emotional baggage. That's up to you  when you walk through a hall. Because that then determines what and how we listen to certain things. I may feel sorrowful  or happy  or exhilarated  or angry when I play certain pieces of music  but I'm not necessarily wanting you to feel exactly the same thing. So please  the next time you go to a concert  just allow your body to open up  allow your body to be this resonating chamber. Be aware that you're not going to experience the same thing as the performer is. The performer is in the worst possible position for the actual sound  because they're hearing the contact of the stick on the drum  or the mallet on the bit of wood  or the bow on the string  etc.  or the breath that's creating the sound from wind and brass. They're experiencing that rawness there. But yet they're experiencing something so unbelievably pure  which is before the sound is actually happening. Please take note of the life of the sound after the actual initial strike  or breath  is being pulled. Just experience the whole journey of that sound in the same way that I wished I'd experienced the whole journey of this particular conference  rather than just arriving last night. But I hope maybe we can share one or two things as the day progresses. But thank you very much for having me  In       with Rachel Carson's  Silent Spring   I think for people like me in the world of the making of things  the canary in the mine wasn't singing. And so the question that we might not have birds became kind of fundamental to those of us wandering around looking for the meadowlarks that seemed to have all disappeared. And the question was  were the birds singing  Now  I'm not a scientist  that'll be really clear. But  you know  we've just come from this discussion of what a bird might be. What is a bird  Well  in my world  this is a rubber duck. It comes in California with a warning     This product contains chemicals known by the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm.  This is a bird. What kind of culture would produce a product of this kind and then label it and sell it to children  I think we have a design problem. Someone heard the six hours of talk that I gave called  The Monticello Dialogues  on NPR  and sent me this as a thank you note     We realize that design is a signal of intention  but it also has to occur within a world  and we have to understand that world in order to imbue our designs with inherent intelligence  and so as we look back at the basic state of affairs in which we design  we  in a way  need to go to the primordial condition to understand the operating system and the frame conditions of a planet  and I think the exciting part of that is the good news that's there  because the news is the news of abundance  and not the news of limits  and I think as our culture tortures itself now with tyrannies and concerns over limits and fear  we can add this other dimension of abundance that is coherent  driven by the sun  and start to imagine what that would be like to share.  That was a nice thing to get. That was one sentence. Henry James would be proud. This is    I put it down at the bottom  but that was extemporaneous  obviously. The fundamental issue is that  for me  design is the first signal of human intentions. So what are our intentions  and what would our intentions be    if we wake up in the morning  we have designs on the world    well  what would our intention be as a species now that we're the dominant species  And it's not just stewardship and dominion debate  because really  dominion is implicit in stewardship    because how could you dominate something you had killed  And stewardship's implicit in dominion  because you can't be steward of something if you can't dominate it. So the question is  what is the first question for designers  Now  as guardians    let's say the state  for example  which reserves the right to kill  the right to be duplicitous and so on    the question we're asking the guardian at this point is are we meant  how are we meant  to secure local societies  create world peace and save the environment  But I don't know that that's the common debate. Commerce  on the other hand  is relatively quick  essentially creative  highly effective and efficient  and fundamentally honest  because we can't exchange value for very long if we don't trust each other. So we use the tools of commerce primarily for our work  but the question we bring to it is  how do we love all the children of all species for all time  And so we start our designs with that question. Because what we realize today is that modern culture appears to have adopted a strategy of tragedy. If we come here and say   Well  I didn't intend to cause global warming on the way here   and we say   That's not part of my plan   then we realize it's part of our de facto plan. Because it's the thing that's happening because we have no other plan. And I was at the White House for President Bush  meeting with every federal department and agency  and I pointed out that they appear to have no plan. If the end game is global warming  they're doing great. If the end game is mercury toxification of our children downwind of coal fire plants as they scuttled the Clean Air Act  then I see that our education programs should be explicitly defined as   Brain death for all children. No child left behind.  So  the question is  how many federal officials are ready to move to Ohio and Pennsylvania with their families  So if you don't have an endgame of something delightful  then you're just moving chess pieces around  if you don't know you're taking the king. So perhaps we could develop a strategy of change  which requires humility. And in my business as an architect  it's unfortunate the word  humility  and the word  architect  have not appeared in the same paragraph since  The Fountainhead.  So if anybody here has trouble with the concept of design humility  reflect on this    it took us       years to put wheels on our luggage. So  as Kevin Kelly pointed out  there is no endgame. There is an infinite game  and we're playing in that infinite game. And so we call it  cradle to cradle   and our goal is very simple. This is what I presented to the White House. Our goal is a delightfully diverse  safe  healthy and just world  with clean air  clean water  soil and power    economically  equitably  ecologically and elegantly enjoyed  period. What don't you like about this  Which part of this don't you like  So we realized we want full diversity  even though it can be difficult to remember what De Gaulle said when asked what it was like to be President of France. He said   What do you think it's like trying to run a country with     kinds of cheese   But at the same time  we realize that our products are not safe and healthy. So we've designed products and we analyzed chemicals down to the parts per million. This is a baby blanket by Pendleton that will give your child nutrition instead of Alzheimer's later in life. We can ask ourselves  what is justice  and is justice blind  or is justice blindness  And at what point did that uniform turn from white to black  Water has been declared a human right by the United Nations. Air quality is an obvious thing to anyone who breathes. Is there anybody here who doesn't breathe  Clean soil is a critical problem    the nitrification  the dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico. A fundamental issue that's not being addressed. We've seen the first form of solar energy that's beat the hegemony of fossil fuels in the form of wind here in the Great Plains  and so that hegemony is leaving. And if we remember Sheikh Yamani when he formed OPEC  they asked him   When will we see the end of the age of oil   I don't know if you remember his answer  but it was   The Stone Age didn't end because we ran out of stones.  We see that companies acting ethically in this world are outperforming those that don't. We see the flows of materials in a rather terrifying prospect. This is a hospital monitor from Los Angeles  sent to China. This woman will expose herself to toxic phosphorous  release four pounds of toxic lead into her childrens' environment  which is from copper. On the other hand  we see great signs of hope. Here's Dr. Venkataswamy in India  who's figured out how to do mass produced health. He has given eyesight to two million people for free. We see in our material flows that car steels don't become car steel again because of the contaminants of the coatings    bismuth  antimony  copper and so on. They become building steel. On the other hand  we're working with Berkshire Hathaway  Warren Buffett and Shaw Carpet  the largest carpet company in the world. We've developed a carpet that is continuously recyclable  down to the parts per million. The upper is Nylon   that can go back to caprolactam  the bottom  a polyolephine    infinitely recyclable thermoplastic. Now if I was a bird  the building on my left is a liability. The building on my right  which is our corporate campus for The Gap with an ancient meadow  is an asset    its nesting grounds. Here's where I come from. I grew up in Hong Kong  with six million people in    square miles. During the dry season  we had four hours of water every fourth day. And the relationship to landscape was that of farmers who have been farming the same piece of ground for    centuries. You can't farm the same piece of ground for    centuries without understanding nutrient flow. My childhood summers were in the Puget Sound of Washington  among the first growth and big growth. My grandfather had been a lumberjack in the Olympics  so I have a lot of tree karma I am working off. I went to Yale for graduate school  studied in a building of this style by Le Corbusier  affectionately known in our business as Brutalism. If we look at the world of architecture  we see with Mies'      tower for Berlin  the question might be   Well  where's the sun   And this might have worked in Berlin  but we built it in Houston  and the windows are all closed. And with most products appearing not to have been designed for indoor use  this is actually a vertical gas chamber. When I went to Yale  we had the first energy crisis  and I was designing the first solar heated house in Ireland as a student  which I then built    which would give you a sense of my ambition. And Richard Meier  who was one of my teachers  kept coming over to my desk to give me criticism  and he would say   Bill  you've got to understand     solar energy has nothing to do with architecture.  I guess he didn't read Vitruvius. In       we did the first so called  green office  in America for Environmental Defense. We started asking manufacturers what were in their materials. They said   They're proprietary  they're legal  go away.  The only indoor quality work done in this country at that time was sponsored by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company  and it was to prove there was no danger from secondhand smoke in the workplace. So  all of a sudden  here I am  graduating from high school in       and this happens  and we realize that  away  went away. Remember we used to throw things away  and we'd point to away  And yet  NOAA has now shown us  for example    you see that little blue thing above Hawaii  That's the Pacific Gyre. It was recently dragged for plankton by scientists  and they found six times as much plastic as plankton. When asked  they said   It's kind of like a giant toilet that doesn't flush.  Perhaps that's away. So we're looking for the design rules of this    this is the highest biodiversity of trees in the world  Irian Jaya      species of tree  and we described this in the book   Cradle to Cradle.  The book itself is a polymer. It is not a tree. That's the name of the first chapter     This Book is Not a Tree.  Because in poetics  as Margaret Atwood pointed out   we write our history on the skin of fish with the blood of bears.  And with so much polymer  what we really need is technical nutrition  and to use something as elegant as a tree    imagine this design assignment  Design something that makes oxygen  sequesters carbon  fixes nitrogen  distills water  accrues solar energy as fuel  makes complex sugars and food  creates microclimates  changes colors with the seasons and self replicates. Well  why don't we knock that down and write on it  So  we're looking at the same criteria as most people    you know  can I afford it  Does it work  Do I like it  We're adding the Jeffersonian agenda  and I come from Charlottesville  where I've had the privilege of living in a house designed by Thomas Jefferson. We're adding life  liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Now if we look at the word  competition   I'm sure most of you've used it. You know  most people don't realize it comes from the Latin competere  which means strive together. It means the way Olympic athletes train with each other. They get fit together  and then they compete. The Williams sisters compete    one wins Wimbledon. So we've been looking at the idea of competition as a way of cooperating in order to get fit together. And the Chinese government has now    I work with the Chinese government now    has taken this up. We're also looking at survival of the fittest  not in just competition terms in our modern context of destroy the other or beat them to the ground  but really to fit together and build niches and have growth that is good. Now most environmentalists don't say growth is good  because  in our lexicon  asphalt is two words  assigning blame. But if we look at asphalt as our growth  then we realize that all we're doing is destroying the planetary's fundamental underlying operating system. So when we see E equals mc squared come along  from a poet's perspective  we see energy as physics  chemistry as mass  and all of a sudden  you get this biology. And we have plenty of energy  so we'll solve that problem  but the biology problem's tricky  because as we put through all these toxic materials that we disgorge  we will never be able to recover that. And as Francis Crick pointed out  nine years after discovering DNA with Mr. Watson  that life itself has to have growth as a precondition    it has to have free energy  sunlight and it needs to be an open system of chemicals. So we're asking for human artifice to become a living thing  and we want growth  we want free energy from sunlight and we want an open metabolism for chemicals. Then  the question becomes not growth or no growth  but what do you want to grow  So instead of just growing destruction  we want to grow the things that we might enjoy  and someday the FDA will allow us to make French cheese. So therefore  we have these two metabolisms  and I worked with a German chemist  Michael Braungart  and we've identified the two fundamental metabolisms. The biological one I'm sure you understand  but also the technical one  where we take materials and put them into closed cycles. We call them biological nutrition and technical nutrition. Technical nutrition will be in an order of magnitude of biological nutrition. Biological nutrition can supply about     million humans  which means that if we all wore Birkenstocks and cotton  the world would run out of cork and dry up. So we need materials in closed cycles  but we need to analyze them down to the parts per million for cancer  birth defects  mutagenic effects  disruption of our immune systems  biodegradation  persistence  heavy metal content  knowledge of how we're making them and their production and so on. Our first product was a textile where we analyzed       chemicals in the textile industry. Using those intellectual filters  we eliminated       .  We were left with    chemicals. We have since databased the      most commonly used chemicals in human manufacturing  and we're releasing this database into the public in six weeks. So designers all over the world can analyze their products down to the parts per million for human and ecological health. We've developed a protocol so that companies can send these same messages all the way through their supply chains  because when we asked most companies we work with    about a trillion dollars    and say   Where does your stuff come from   They say   Suppliers.   And where does it go    Customers.  So we need some help there. So the biological nutrients  the first fabrics    the water coming out was clean enough to drink. Technical nutrients    this is for Shaw Carpet  infinitely reusable carpet. Here's nylon going back to caprolactam back to carpet. Biotechnical nutrients    the Model U for Ford Motor  a cradle to cradle car    concept car. Shoes for Nike  where the uppers are polyesters  infinitely recyclable  the bottoms are biodegradable soles. Wear your old shoes in  your new shoes out. There is no finish line. The idea here of the car is that some of the materials go back to the industry forever  some of the materials go back to soil    it's all solar powered. Here's a building at Oberlin College we designed that makes more energy than it needs to operate and purifies its own water. Here's a building for The Gap  where the ancient grasses of San Bruno  California  are on the roof. And this is our project for Ford Motor Company. It's the revitalization of the River Rouge in Dearborn. This is obviously a color photograph. These are our tools. These are how we sold it to Ford. We saved Ford    million dollars doing it this way  day one  which is the equivalent of the Ford Taurus at a four percent margin of an order for     million dollars worth of cars. Here it is. It's the world's largest green roof     and a half acres. This is the roof  saving money  and this is the first species to arrive here. These are killdeer. They showed up in five days. And we now have     pound auto workers learning bird songs on the Internet. We're developing now protocols for cities    that's the home of technical nutrients. The country    the home of biological. And putting them together. And so I will finish by showing you a new city we're designing for the Chinese government. We're doing    cities for China right now  based on cradle to cradle as templates. Our assignment is to develop protocols for the housing for     million people in    years. We did a mass energy balance    if they use brick  they will lose all their soil and burn all their coal. They'll have cities with no energy and no food. We signed a Memorandum of Understanding    here's Madam Deng Nan  Deng Xiaoping's daughter    for China to adopt cradle to cradle. Because if they toxify themselves  being the lowest cost producer  send it to the lowest cost distribution    Wal Mart    and then we send them all our money  what we'll discover is that we have what  effectively  when I was a student  was called mutually assured destruction. Now we do it by molecule. These are our cities. We're building a new city next to this city  look at that landscape. This is the site. We don't normally do green fields  but this one is about to be built  so they brought us in to intercede. This is their plan. It's a rubber stamp grid that they laid right on that landscape. And they brought us in and said   What would you do   This is what they would end up with  which is another color photograph. So this is the existing site  so this is what it looks like now  and here's our proposal. So the way we approached this is we studied the hydrology very carefully. We studied the biota  the ancient biota  the current farming and the protocols. We studied the winds and the sun to make sure everybody in the city will have fresh air  fresh water and direct sunlight in every single apartment at some point during the day. We then take the parks and lay them out as ecological infrastructure. We lay out the building areas. We start to integrate commercial and mixed use so the people all have centers and places to be. The transportation is all very simple  everybody's within a five minute walk of mobility. We have a    hour street  so that there's always a place that's alive. The waste systems all connect. If you flush a toilet  your feces will go to the sewage treatment plants  which are sold as assets  not liabilities. Because who wants the fertilizer factory that makes natural gas  The waters are all taken in to construct the wetlands for habitat restorations. And then it makes natural gas  which then goes back into the city to power the fuel for the cooking for the city. So this is    these are fertilizer gas plants. And then the compost is all taken back to the roofs of the city  where we've got farming  because what we've done is lifted up the city  the landscape  into the air to    to restore the native landscape on the roofs of the buildings. The solar power of all the factory centers and all the industrial zones with their light roofs powers the city. And this is the concept for the top of the city. We've lifted the earth up onto the roofs. The farmers have little bridges to get from one roof to the next. We inhabit the city with work live space on all the ground floors. And so this is the existing city  and this is the new city. When you think about resilience and technology it's actually much easier. You're going to see some other speakers today  I already know  who are going to talk about breaking bones stuff  and  of course  with technology it never is. So it's very easy  comparatively speaking  to be resilient. I think that  if we look at what happened on the Internet  with such an incredible last half a dozen years  that it's hard to even get the right analogy for it. A lot of how we decide  how we're supposed to react to things and what we're supposed to expect about the future depends on how we bucket things and how we categorize them. And so I think the tempting analogy for the boom bust that we just went through with the Internet is a gold rush. It's easy to think of this analogy as very different from some of the other things you might pick. For one thing  both were very real. In       in that Gold Rush  they took over      million worth of gold out of California. It was very real. The Internet was also very real. This is a real way for humans to communicate with each other. It's a big deal. Huge boom. Huge boom. Huge bust. Huge bust. You keep going  and both things are lots of hype. I don't have to remind you of all the hype that was involved with the Internet    like GetRich.com. But you had the same thing with the Gold Rush.  Gold. Gold. Gold.  Sixty eight rich men on the Steamer Portland. Stacks of yellow metal. Some have      . Many have more. A few bring out         dollars each. People would get very excited about this when they read these articles.  The Eldorado of the United States of America  the discovery of inexhaustible gold mines in California.  And the parallels between the Gold Rush and the Internet Rush continue very strongly. So many people left what they were doing. And what would happen is    and the Gold Rush went on for years. People on the East Coast in       when they first started to get the news  they thought   Ah  this isn't real.  But they keep hearing about people getting rich  and then in      they still hear that. And they think it's not real. By about       they're thinking   Am I the stupidest person on Earth by not rushing to California   And they start to decide they are. These are community affairs  by the way. Local communities on the East Coast would get together and whole teams of        people would caravan across the United States  and they would form companies. These were typically not solitary efforts. But no matter what  if you were a lawyer or a banker  people dropped what they were doing  no matter what skill set they had  to go pan for gold. This guy on the left  Dr. Richard Beverley Cole  he lived in Philadelphia and he took the Panama route. They would take a ship down to Panama  across the isthmus  and then take another ship north. This guy  Dr. Toland  went by covered wagon to California. This has its parallels  too. Doctors leaving their practices. These are both very successful    a physician in one case  a surgeon in the other. Same thing happened on the Internet. You get DrKoop.com. In the Gold Rush  people literally jumped ship. The San Francisco harbor was clogged with     ships at the peak because the ships would get there and the crews would abandon to go search for gold. So there were literally     captains and     ships. They turned the ships into hotels  because they couldn't sail them anywhere. You had dotcom fever. And you had gold fever. And you saw some of the excesses that the dotcom fever created and the same thing happened. The fort in San Francisco at the time had about       soldiers. Half of them deserted to go look for gold. And they wouldn't let the other half out to go look for the first half because they were afraid they wouldn't come back. And one of the soldiers wrote home  and this is the sentence that he put   The struggle between right and six dollars a month and wrong and    dollars a day is a rather severe one.  They had bad burn rate in the Gold Rush. A very bad burn rate. This is actually from the Klondike Gold Rush. This is the White Pass Trail. They loaded up their mules and their horses. And they didn't plan right. And they didn't know how far they would really have to go  and they overloaded the horses with hundreds and hundreds of pounds of stuff. In fact it was so bad that most of the horses died before they could get where they were going. It got renamed the  Dead Horse Trail.  And the Canadian Minister of the Interior wrote this at the time   Thousands of pack horses lie dead along the way  sometimes in bunches under the cliffs  with pack saddles and packs where they've fallen from the rock above  sometimes in tangled masses  filling the mud holes and furnishing the only footing for our poor pack animals on the march  often  I regret to say  exhausted  but still alive  a fact we were unaware of  until after the miserable wretches turned beneath the hooves of our cavalcade. The eyeless sockets of the pack animals everywhere account for the myriads of ravens along the road. The inhumanity which this trail has been witness to  the heartbreak and suffering which so many have undergone  cannot be imagined. They certainly cannot be described.  And you know  without the smell that would have accompanied that  we had the same thing on the Internet  very bad burn rate calculations. I'll just play one of these and you'll remember it. This is a commercial that was played on the Super Bowl in the year     . Bride     Then why does she have my invitation  Announcer  What may be a little thing to some ... Bride     You are mine  little man. Announcer  Could be a really big deal to you. Husband     Is that your wife  Husband     Not for another    minutes. Announcer  After all  it's your special day. OurBeginning.com. Life's an event. Announce it to the world. Jeff Bezos  It's very difficult to figure out what that ad is for. But they spent three and a half million dollars in the      Super Bowl to air that ad  even though  at the time  they only had a million dollars in annual revenue. Now  here's where our analogy with the Gold Rush starts to diverge  and I think rather severely. And that is  in a gold rush  when it's over  it's over. Here's this guy   There are many men in Dawson at the present time who feel keenly disappointed. They've come thousands of miles on a perilous trip  risked life  health and property  spent months of the most arduous labor a man can perform and at length with expectations raised to the highest pitch have reached the coveted goal only to discover the fact that there is nothing here for them.  And that was  of course  the very common story. Because when you take out that last piece of gold    and they did incredibly quickly. I mean  if you look at the      Gold Rush    the entire American river region  within two years    every stone had been turned. And after that  only big companies who used more sophisticated mining technologies started to take gold out of there. So there's a much better analogy that allows you to be incredibly optimistic and that analogy is the electric industry. And there are a lot of similarities between the Internet and the electric industry. With the electric industry you actually have to    one of them is that they're both sort of thin  horizontal  enabling layers that go across lots of different industries. It's not a specific thing. But electricity is also very  very broad  so you have to sort of narrow it down. You know  it can be used as an incredible means of transmitting power. It's an incredible means of coordinating  in a very fine grained way  information flows. There's a bunch of things that are interesting about electricity. And the part of the electric revolution that I want to focus on is sort of the golden age of appliances. The killer app that got the world ready for appliances was the light bulb. So the light bulb is what wired the world. And they weren't thinking about appliances when they wired the world. They were really thinking about    they weren't putting electricity into the home  they were putting lighting into the home. And  but it really    it got the electricity. It took a long time. This was a huge    as you would expect    a huge capital build out. All the streets had to be torn up. This is work going on down in lower Manhattan where they built some of the first electric power generating stations. And they're tearing up all the streets. The Edison Electric Company  which became Edison General Electric  which became General Electric  paid for all of this digging up of the streets. It was incredibly expensive. But that is not the    and that's not the part that's really most similar to the Web. Because  remember  the Web got to stand on top of all this heavy infrastructure that had been put in place because of the long distance phone network. So all of the cabling and all of the heavy infrastructure    I'm going back now to  sort of  the explosive part of the Web in       when it was growing       percent a year. How could it grow at       percent a year in      when people weren't really investing in the Web  Well  it was because that heavy infrastructure had already been laid down. So the light bulb laid down the heavy infrastructure  and then home appliances started coming into being. And this was huge. The first one was the electric fan    this was the      electric fan. And the appliances  the golden age of appliances really lasted    it depends how you want to measure it    but it's anywhere from    to    years. It goes on a long time. It starts about     . And the electric fan was a big success. The electric iron  also very big. By the way  this is the beginning of the asbestos lawsuit. There's asbestos under that handle there. This is the first vacuum cleaner  the      Skinner Vacuum  from the Hoover Company. And this one weighed    pounds and took two people to operate and cost a quarter of a car. So it wasn't a big seller. This was truly  truly an early adopter product    the      Skinner Vacuum. But three years later  by       it weighed    pounds. Now  not all these things were highly successful. This is the electric tie press  which never really did catch on. People  I guess  decided that they would not wrinkle their ties. These never really caught on either  the electric shoe warmer and drier. Never a big seller. This came in  like  six different colors. I don't know why. But I thought  you know  sometimes it's just not the right time for an invention  maybe it's time to give this one another shot. So I thought we could build a Super Bowl ad for this. We'd need the right partner. And I thought that really    I thought that would really work  to give that another shot. Now  the toaster was huge because they used to make toast on open fires  and it took a lot of time and attention. I want to point out one thing. This is    you guys know what this is. They hadn't invented the electric socket yet. So this was    remember  they didn't wire the houses for electricity. They wired them for lighting. So your    your appliances would plug in. They would    each room typically had a light bulb socket at the top. And you'd plug it in there. In fact  if you've seen the Carousel of Progress at Disney World  you've seen this. Here are the cables coming up into this light fixture. All the appliances plug in there. And you would just unscrew your light bulb if you wanted to plug in an appliance. The next thing that really was a big  big deal was the washing machine. Now  this was an object of much envy and lust. Everybody wanted one of these electric washing machines. On the left hand side  this was the soapy water. And there's a rotor there    that this motor is spinning. And it would clean your clothes. This is the clean rinse water. So you'd take the clothes out of here  put them in here  and then you'd run the clothes through this electric ringer. And this was a big deal. You'd keep this on your porch. It was a little bit messy and kind of a pain. And you'd run a long cord into the house where you could screw it into your light socket. And that's actually kind of an important point in my presentation  because they hadn't invented the off switch. That was to come much later    the off switch on appliances    because it didn't make any sense. I mean  you didn't want this thing clogging up a light socket. So you know  when you were done with it  you unscrewed it. That's what you did. You didn't turn it off. And as I said before  they hadn't invented the electric outlet either  so the washing machine was a particularly dangerous device. And there are    when you research this  there are gruesome descriptions of people getting their hair and clothes caught in these devices. And they couldn't yank the cord out because it was screwed into a light socket inside the house. And there was no off switch  so it wasn't very good. And you might think that that was incredibly stupid of our ancestors to be plugging things into a light socket like this. But  you know  before I get too far into condemning our ancestors  I thought I'd show you  this is my conference room. This is a total kludge  if you ask me. First of all  this got installed upside down. This light socket    and so the cord keeps falling out  so I taped it in. This is supposed    don't even get me started. But that's not the worst one. This is what it looks like under my desk. I took this picture just two days ago. So we really haven't progressed that much since     . It's a total  total mess. And  you know  we think it's getting better  but have you tried to install    .   yourself  I challenge you to try. It's very hard. I know Ph.D.s in Computer Science    this process has brought them to tears  absolute tears.  Laughter  And that's assuming you already have DSL in your house. Try to get DSL installed in your house. The engineers who do it everyday can't do it. They have to    typically  they come three times. And one friend of mine was telling me a story  not only did they get there and have to wait  but then the engineers  when they finally did get there  for the third time  they had to call somebody. And they were really happy that the guy had a speakerphone because then they had to wait on hold for an hour to talk to somebody to give them an access code after they got there. So we're not    we're pretty kludge y ourselves. By the way  DSL is a kludge. I mean  this is a twisted pair of copper that was never designed for the purpose it's being put to    you know it's the whole thing    we're very  very primitive. And that's kind of the point. Because  you know  resilience    if you think of it in terms of the Gold Rush  then you'd be pretty depressed right now because the last nugget of gold would be gone. But the good thing is  with innovation  there isn't a last nugget. Every new thing creates two new questions and two new opportunities. And if you believe that  then you believe that where we are    this is what I think    I believe that where we are with the incredible kludge    and I haven't even talked about user interfaces on the Web    but there's so much kludge  so much terrible stuff    we are at the      Hurley washing machine stage with the Internet. That's where we are. We don't get our hair caught in it  but that's the level of primitiveness of where we are. We're in     . And if you believe that  then stuff like this doesn't bother you. This is        All the negatives add up to making the online experience not worth the trouble.         Amazon.toast.  In        Amazon.bomb.  My mom hates this picture. She    but you know  if you really do believe that it's the very  very beginning  if you believe it's the      Hurley washing machine  then you're incredibly optimistic. And I do think that that's where we are. And I do think there's more innovation ahead of us than there is behind us. And in       Sears    I want to get this exactly right. This was the advertisement that they ran in     . It says   Use your electricity for more than light.  And I think that's where we are. We're very  very early. Thank you very much. Mockingbirds are badass. They are. Mockingbirds    that's Mimus polyglottos    are the emcees of the animal kingdom. They listen and mimic and remix what they like. They rock the mic outside my window every morning. I can hear them sing the sounds of the car alarms like they were songs of spring. I mean  if you can talk it  a mockingbird can squawk it. So check it  I'm gonna to catch mockingbirds. I'm going to trap mockingbirds all across the nation and put them gently into mason jars like mockingbird Molotov cocktails. Yeah. And as I drive through a neighborhood  say  where people got a lotta  I'll take a mockingbird I caught in a neighborhood where folks ain't got nada and just let it go  you know. Up goes the bird  out come the words   Juanito  Juanito  vente a comer mi hijo   Oh  I'm going to be the Johnny Appleseed of sound. Cruising random city streets  rocking a drop top Cadillac with a big backseat  packing like    brown paper Walmart bags full of loaded mockingbirds  and I'll get everybody. I'll get the nitwit on the network news saying   We'll be back in a moment with more on the crisis.  I'll get some asshole at a watering hole asking what brand the ice is. I'll get that lady at the laundromat who always seems to know what being nice is. I'll get your postman making dinner plans. I'll get the last time you lied. I'll get   Baby  just give me the frickin' TV guide.  I'll get a lonely  little sentence with real error in it   Yeah  I guess I could come inside  but only for a minute.  I'll get an ESL class in Chinatown learning  It's Raining  It's Pouring.  I'll put a mockingbird on a late night train just to get an old man snoring. I'll get your ex lover telling someone else   Good morning.  I'll get everyone's good mornings. I don't care how you make 'em. Aloha. Konichiwa. Shalom. Ah Salam Alaikum. Everybody means everybody  means everybody here. And so maybe I'll build a gilded cage. I'll line the bottom with old notebook pages. Inside it  I will place a mockingbird for    short explanation  hippie parents. What does a violin have to do with technology  Where in the world is this world heading  On one end  gold bars    on the other  an entire planet. We are    billion light years from the edge. That's a guess. Space is length and breadth continued indefinitely  but you cannot buy a ticket to travel commercially to space in America because countries are beginning to eat like us  live like us and die like us. You might wanna avert your gaze  because that is a newt about to regenerate its limb  and shaking hands spreads more germs than kissing. There's about    million phage per job. It's a very strange world inside a nanotube. Women can talk  black men ski  white men build strong buildings  we build strong suns. The surface of the Earth is absolutely riddled with holes  and here we are  right in the middle. It is the voice of life that calls us to come and learn. When all the little mockingbirds fly away  they're going to sound like the last four days. I will get uptown gurus  downtown teachers  broke ass artists and dealers  and Filipino preachers  leaf blowers  bartenders  boob job doctors  hooligans  garbage men  your local Congressmen in the spotlight  guys in the overhead helicopters. Everybody gets heard. Everybody gets this one  honest mockingbird as a witness. And I'm on this. I'm on this 'til the whole thing spreads  with chat rooms and copycats and moms maybe tucking kids into bed singing   Hush  little baby  don't say a word. Wait for the man with the mockingbird.  Yeah. And then come the news crews  and the man in the street interviews  and the letters to the editor. Everybody asking  just who is responsible for this citywide  nationwide mockingbird cacophony  and somebody finally is going to tip the City Council of Monterey  California off to me  and they'll offer me a key to the city. A gold plated  oversized key to the city and that is all I need  'cause if I get that  I can unlock the air. I'll listen for what's missing  and I'll put it there. Thank you  TED. Chris Anderson  Wow. Wow. I am a vicar in the Church of England. I've been a priest in the Church for    years. For most of that time  I've been struggling and grappling with questions about the nature of God. Who is God  And I'm very aware that when you say the word  God   many people will turn off immediately. And most people  both within and outside the organized church  still have a picture of a celestial controller  a rule maker  a policeman in the sky who orders everything  and causes everything to happen. He will protect his own people  and answer the prayers of the faithful. And in the worship of my church  the most frequently used adjective about God is  almighty.  But I have a problem with that. I have become more and more uncomfortable with this perception of God over the years. Do we really believe that God is the kind of male boss that we've been presenting in our worship and in our liturgies over all these years  Of course  there have been thinkers who have suggested different ways of looking at God. Exploring the feminine  nurturing side of divinity. Suggesting that God expresses Himself or Herself through powerlessness  rather than power. Acknowledging that God is unknown and unknowable by definition. Finding deep resonances with other religions and philosophies and ways of looking at life as part of what is a universal and global search for meaning. These ideas are well known in liberal academic circles  but clergy like myself have been reluctant to air them  for fear of creating tension and division in our church communities  for fear of upsetting the simple faith of more traditional believers. I have chosen not to rock the boat. Then  on December   th last year  just two months ago  that underwater earthquake triggered the tsunami. And two weeks later  Sunday morning   th of January  I found myself standing in front of my congregation    intelligent  well meaning  mostly thoughtful Christian people    and I needed to express  on their behalf  our feelings and our questions. I had my own personal responses  but I also have a public role  and something needed to be said. And this is what I said. Shortly after the tsunami I read a newspaper article written by the Archbishop of Canterbury    fine title    about the tragedy in Southern Asia. The essence of what he said was this  the people most affected by the devastation and loss of life do not want intellectual theories about how God let this happen. He wrote   If some religious genius did come up with an explanation of exactly why all these deaths made sense  would we feel happier  or safer  or more confident in God   If the man in the photograph that appeared in the newspapers  holding the hand of his dead child was standing in front of us now  there are no words that we could say to him. A verbal response would not be appropriate. The only appropriate response would be a compassionate silence and some kind of practical help. It isn't a time for explanation  or preaching  or theology  it's a time for tears. This is true. And yet here we are  my church in Oxford  semi detached from events that happened a long way away  but with our faith bruised. And we want an explanation from God. We demand an explanation from God. Some have concluded that we can only believe in a God who shares our pain. In some way  God must feel the anguish  and grief  and physical pain that we feel. In some way the eternal God must be able to enter into the souls of human beings and experience the torment within. And if this is true  it must also be that God knows the joy and exaltation of the human spirit  as well. We want a God who can weep with those who weep  and rejoice with those who rejoice. This seems to me both a deeply moving and a convincing re statement of Christian belief about God. For hundreds of years  the prevailing orthodoxy  the accepted truth  was that God the Father  the Creator  is unchanging and therefore by definition cannot feel pain or sadness. Now the unchanging God feels a bit cold and indifferent to me. And the devastating events of the   th century have forced people to question the cold  unfeeling God. The slaughter of millions in the trenches and in the death camps have caused people to ask   Where is God in all this  Who is God in all this   And the answer was   God is in this with us  or God doesn't deserve our allegiance anymore.  If God is a bystander  observing but not involved  then God may well exist  but we don't want to know about Him. Many Jews and Christians now feel like this  I know. And I am among them. So we have a suffering God    a God who is intimately connected with this world and with every living soul. I very much relate to this idea of God. But it isn't enough. I need to ask some more questions  and I hope they are questions that you will want to ask  as well  some of you. Over the last few weeks I have been struck by the number of times that words in our worship have felt a bit inappropriate  a bit dodgy. We have a pram service on Tuesday mornings for mums and their pre school children. And last week we sang with the children one of their favorite songs   The Wise Man Built His House Upon the Rock.  Perhaps some of you know it. Some of the words go like this   The foolish man built his house upon the sand   And the floods came up   And the house on the sand went crash.  Then in the same week  at a funeral  we sang the familiar hymn  We Plow the Fields and Scatter   a very English hymn. In the second verse comes the line   The wind and waves obey Him.  Do they  I don't feel we can sing that song again in church  after what's happened. So the first big question is about control. Does God have a plan for each of us  Is God in control  Does God order each moment  Does the wind and the waves obey Him  From time to time  one hears Christians telling the story of how God organized things for them  so that everything worked out all right    some difficulty overcome  some illness cured  some trouble averted  a parking space found at a crucial time. I can remember someone saying this to me  with her eyes shining with enthusiasm at this wonderful confirmation of her faith and the goodness of God. But if God can or will do these things    intervene to change the flow of events    then surely he could have stopped the tsunami. Do we have a local God who can do little things like parking spaces  but not big things like     mile per hour waves  That's just not acceptable to intelligent Christians  and we must acknowledge it. Either God is responsible for the tsunami  or God is not in control. After the tragedy  survival stories began to emerge. You probably heard some of them  the man who surfed the wave  the teenage girl who recognized the danger because she had just been learning about tsunamis at school. Then there was the congregation who had left their usual church building on the shore to hold a service in the hills. The preacher delivered an extra long sermon  so that they were still out of harm's way when the wave struck. Afterwards someone said that God must have been looking after them. So the next question is about partiality. Can we earn God's favor by worshipping Him or believing in Him  Does God demand loyalty  like any medieval tyrant  A God who looks after His own  so that Christians are OK  while everyone else perishes  A cosmic us and them  and a God who is guilty of the worst kind of favoritism  That would be appalling  and that would be the point at which I would hand in my membership. Such a God would be morally inferior to the highest ideals of humanity. So who is God  if not the great puppet master or the tribal protector  Perhaps God allows or permits terrible things to happen  so that heroism and compassion can be shown. Perhaps God is testing us  testing our charity  or our faith. Perhaps there is a great  cosmic plan that allows for horrible suffering so that everything will work out OK in the end. Perhaps  but these ideas are all just variations on God controlling everything  the supreme commander toying with expendable units in a great campaign. We are still left with a God who can do the tsunami and allow Auschwitz. In his great novel   The Brothers Karamazov   Dostoevsky gives these words to Ivan  addressed to his naive and devout younger brother  Alyosha   If the sufferings of children go to make up the sum of sufferings which is necessary for the purchase of truth  then I say beforehand that the entire truth is not worth such a price. We cannot afford to pay so much for admission. It is not God that I do not accept. I merely  most respectfully  return Him the ticket.  Or perhaps God set the whole universe going at the beginning and then relinquished control forever  so that natural processes could occur  and evolution run its course. This seems more acceptable  but it still leaves God with the ultimate moral responsibility. Is God a cold  unfeeling spectator  Or a powerless lover  watching with infinite compassion things God is unable to control or change  Is God intimately involved in our suffering  so that He feels it in His own being  If we believe something like this  we must let go of the puppet master completely  take our leave of the almighty controller  abandon traditional models. We must think again about God. Maybe God doesn't do things at all. Maybe God isn't an agent like all of us are agents. Early religious thought conceived God as a sort of superhuman person  doing things all over the place. Beating up the Egyptians  drowning them in the Red Sea  wasting cities  getting angry. The people knew their God by His mighty acts. But what if God doesn't act  What if God doesn't do things at all  What if God is in things  The loving soul of the universe. An in dwelling compassionate presence  underpinning and sustaining all things. What if God is in things  In the infinitely complex network of relationships and connections that make up life. In the natural cycle of life and death  the creation and destruction that must happen continuously. In the process of evolution. In the incredible intricacy and magnificence of the natural world. In the collective unconscious  the soul of the human race. In you  in me  mind and body and spirit. In the tsunami  in the victims. In the depth of things. In presence and in absence. In simplicity and complexity. In change and development and growth. How does this in ness  this innerness  this interiority of God work  It's hard to conceive  and begs more questions. Is God just another name for the universe  with no independent existence at all  I don't know. To what extent can we ascribe personality to God  I don't know. In the end  we have to say   I don't know.  If we knew  God would not be God. To have faith in this God would be more like trusting an essential benevolence in the universe  and less like believing a system of doctrinal statements. Isn't it ironic that Christians who claim to believe in an infinite  unknowable being then tie God down in closed systems and rigid doctrines  How could one practice such a faith  By seeking the God within. By cultivating my own inwardness. In silence  in meditation  in my inner space  in the me that remains when I gently put aside my passing emotions and ideas and preoccupations. In awareness of the inner conversation. And how would we live such a faith  How would I live such a faith  By seeking intimate connection with your inwardness. The kind of relationships when deep speaks to deep. If God is in all people  then there is a meeting place where my relationship with you becomes a three way encounter. There is an Indian greeting  which I'm sure some of you know   Namaste   accompanied by a respectful bow  which  roughly translated means   That which is of God in me greets that which of God is in you.  Namaste. And how would one deepen such a faith  By seeking the inwardness which is in all things. In music and poetry  in the natural world of beauty and in the small ordinary things of life  there is a deep  indwelling presence that makes them extraordinary. It needs a profound attentiveness and a patient waiting  a contemplative attitude and a generosity and openness to those whose experience is different from my own. When I stood up to speak to my people about God and the tsunami  I had no answers to offer them. No neat packages of faith  with Bible references to prove them. Only doubts and questioning and uncertainty. I had some suggestions to make    possible new ways of thinking about God. Ways that might allow us to go on  down a new and uncharted road. But in the end  the only thing I could say for sure was   I don't know   and that just might be the most profoundly religious statement of all. Thank you. That splendid music  the coming in music   The Elephant March  from  Aida   is the music I've chosen for my funeral. And you can see why. It's triumphal. I won't feel anything  but if I could  I would feel triumphal at having lived at all  and at having lived on this splendid planet  and having been given the opportunity to understand something about why I was here in the first place  before not being here. Can you understand my quaint English accent  Like everybody else  I was entranced yesterday by the animal session. Robert Full and Frans Lanting and others  the beauty of the things that they showed. The only slight jarring note was when Jeffrey Katzenberg said of the mustang   the most splendid creatures that God put on this earth.  Now of course  we know that he didn't really mean that  but in this country at the moment  you can't be too careful. I'm a biologist  and the central theorem of our subject  the theory of design  Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. In professional circles everywhere  it's of course universally accepted. In non professional circles outside America  it's largely ignored. But in non professional circles within America  it arouses so much hostility    it's fair to say that American biologists are in a state of war. The war is so worrying at present  with court cases coming up in one state after another  that I felt I had to say something about it. If you want to know what I have to say about Darwinism itself  I'm afraid you're going to have to look at my books  which you won't find in the bookstore outside. Contemporary court cases often concern an allegedly new version of creationism  called  Intelligent Design   or ID. Don't be fooled. There's nothing new about ID. It's just creationism under another name  rechristened    I choose the word advisedly    for tactical  political reasons. The arguments of so called ID theorists are the same old arguments that had been refuted again and again  since Darwin down to the present day. There is an effective evolution lobby coordinating the fight on behalf of science  and I try to do all I can to help them  but they get quite upset when people like me dare to mention that we happen to be atheists as well as evolutionists. They see us as rocking the boat  and you can understand why. Creationists  lacking any coherent scientific argument for their case  fall back on the popular phobia against atheism  Teach your children evolution in biology class  and they'll soon move on to drugs  grand larceny and sexual  pre version.  In fact  of course  educated theologians from the Pope down are firm in their support of evolution. This book   Finding Darwin's God   by Kenneth Miller  is one of the most effective attacks on Intelligent Design that I know and it's all the more effective because it's written by a devout Christian. People like Kenneth Miller could be called a  godsend  to the evolution lobby  because they expose the lie that evolutionism is  as a matter of fact  tantamount to atheism. People like me  on the other hand  rock the boat. But here  I want to say something nice about creationists. It's not a thing I often do  so listen carefully. I think they're right about one thing. I think they're right that evolution is fundamentally hostile to religion. I've already said that many individual evolutionists  like the Pope  are also religious  but I think they're deluding themselves. I believe a true understanding of Darwinism is deeply corrosive to religious faith. Now  it may sound as though I'm about to preach atheism  and I want to reassure you that that's not what I'm going to do. In an audience as sophisticated as this one  that would be preaching to the choir. No  what I want to urge upon you    Instead  what I want to urge upon you is militant atheism. But that's putting it too negatively. If I was a person who were interested in preserving religious faith  I would be very afraid of the positive power of evolutionary science  and indeed science generally  but evolution in particular  to inspire and enthrall  precisely because it is atheistic. Now  the difficult problem for any theory of biological design is to explain the massive statistical improbability of living things. Statistical improbability in the direction of good design     complexity  is another word for this. The standard creationist argument    there is only one  they're all reduced to this one    takes off from a statistical improbability. Living creatures are too complex to have come about by chance  therefore  they must have had a designer. This argument of course  shoots itself in the foot. Any designer capable of designing something really complex has to be even more complex himself  and that's before we even start on the other things he's expected to do  like forgive sins  bless marriages  listen to prayers    favor our side in a war    disapprove of our sex lives  and so on. Complexity is the problem that any theory of biology has to solve  and you can't solve it by postulating an agent that is even more complex  thereby simply compounding the problem. Darwinian natural selection is so stunningly elegant because it solves the problem of explaining complexity in terms of nothing but simplicity. Essentially  it does it by providing a smooth ramp of gradual  step by step increment. But here  I only want to make the point that the elegance of Darwinism is corrosive to religion  precisely because it is so elegant  so parsimonious  so powerful  so economically powerful. It has the sinewy economy of a beautiful suspension bridge. The God theory is not just a bad theory. It turns out to be    in principle    incapable of doing the job required of it. So  returning to tactics and the evolution lobby  I want to argue that rocking the boat may be just the right thing to do. My approach to attacking creationism is    unlike the evolution lobby    my approach to attacking creationism is to attack religion as a whole. And at this point I need to acknowledge the remarkable taboo against speaking ill of religion  and I'm going to do so in the words of the late Douglas Adams  a dear friend who  if he never came to TED  certainly should have been invited. Richard Dawkins  He was. Good. I thought he must have been. He begins this speech  which was tape recorded in Cambridge shortly before he died    he begins by explaining how science works through the testing of hypotheses that are framed to be vulnerable to disproof  and then he goes on. I quote   Religion doesn't seem to work like that. It has certain ideas at the heart of it  which we call 'sacred' or 'holy.' What it means is  here is an idea or a notion that you're not allowed to say anything bad about. You're just not. Why not  Because you're not.   Why should it be that it's perfectly legitimate to support the Republicans or Democrats  this model of economics versus that  Macintosh instead of Windows  but to have an opinion about how the universe began  about who created the universe    no  that's holy. So  we're used to not challenging religious ideas  and it's very interesting how much of a furor Richard creates when he does it.     He meant me  not that one.  Everybody gets absolutely frantic about it  because you're not allowed to say these things. Yet when you look at it rationally  there's no reason why those ideas shouldn't be as open to debate as any other  except that we've agreed somehow between us that they shouldn't be.  And that's the end of the quote from Douglas. In my view  not only is science corrosive to religion  religion is corrosive to science. It teaches people to be satisfied with trivial  supernatural non explanations  and blinds them to the wonderful  real explanations that we have within our grasp. It teaches them to accept authority  revelation and faith  instead of always insisting on evidence. There's Douglas Adams  magnificent picture from his book   Last Chance to See.  Now  there's a typical scientific journal  The Quarterly Review of Biology. And I'm going to put together  as guest editor  a special issue on the question   Did an asteroid kill the dinosaurs   And the first paper is a standard scientific paper  presenting evidence   Iridium layer at the K T boundary  and potassium argon dated crater in Yucatan  indicate that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs.  Perfectly ordinary scientific paper. Now  the next one.  The President of the Royal Society has been vouchsafed a strong inner conviction that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs.   It has been privately revealed to Professor Huxtane that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs.   Professor Hordley was brought up to have total and unquestioning faith      that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs.   Professor Hawkins has promulgated an official dogma binding on all loyal Hawkinsians that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs.  That's inconceivable  of course. But suppose     Supporters of the Asteroid Theory cannot be patriotic citizens  In       a reporter asked George Bush  Sr. whether he recognized the equal citizenship and patriotism of Americans who are atheists. Mr. Bush's reply has become infamous.  No  I don't know that atheists should be considered citizens  nor should they be considered patriots. This is one nation under God.  Bush's bigotry was not an isolated mistake  blurted out in the heat of the moment and later retracted. He stood by it in the face of repeated calls for clarification or withdrawal. He really meant it. More to the point  he knew it posed no threat to his election    quite the contrary. Democrats as well as Republicans parade their religiousness if they want to get elected. Both parties invoke  one nation under God.  What would Thomas Jefferson have said   In every country and in every age  the priest has been hostile to liberty  Incidentally  I'm not usually very proud of being British  but you can't help making the comparison. In practice  what is an atheist  An atheist is just somebody who feels about Yahweh the way any decent Christian feels about Thor or Baal or the golden calf. As has been said before  we are all atheists about most of the gods that humanity has ever believed in. Some of us just go one god further. And however we define atheism  it's surely the kind of academic belief that a person is entitled to hold without being vilified as an unpatriotic  unelectable non citizen. Nevertheless  it's an undeniable fact that to own up to being an atheist is tantamount to introducing yourself as Mr. Hitler or Miss Beelzebub. And that all stems from the perception of atheists as some kind of weird  way out minority. Natalie Angier wrote a rather sad piece in the New Yorker  saying how lonely she felt as an atheist. She clearly feels in a beleaguered minority. But actually  how do American atheists stack up numerically  The latest survey makes surprisingly encouraging reading. Christianity  of course  takes a massive lion's share of the population  with nearly     million. But what would you think was the second largest group  convincingly outnumbering Jews with  .  million  Muslims at  .  million  Hindus  Buddhists and all other religions put together  The second largest group  with nearly    million  is the one described as non religious or secular. You can't help wondering why vote seeking politicians are so proverbially overawed by the power of  for example  the Jewish lobby    the state of Israel seems to owe its very existence to the American Jewish vote    while at the same time  consigning the non religious to political oblivion. This secular non religious vote  if properly mobilized  is nine times as numerous as the Jewish vote. Why does this far more substantial minority not make a move to exercise its political muscle  Well  so much for quantity. How about quality  Is there any correlation  positive or negative  between intelligence and tendency to be religious   Them folks misunderestimated me  The survey that I quoted  which is the ARIS survey  didn't break down its data by socio economic class or education  IQ or anything else. But a recent article by Paul G. Bell in the Mensa magazine provides some straws in the wind. Mensa  as you know  is an international organization for people with very high IQ. And from a meta analysis of the literature  Bell concludes that  I quote     Of    studies carried out since      on the relationship between religious belief  and one's intelligence or educational level  all but four found an inverse connection. That is  the higher one's intelligence or educational level  the less one is likely to be religious.  Well  I haven't seen the original    studies  and I can't comment on that meta analysis  but I would like to see more studies done along those lines. And I know that there are    if I could put a little plug here    there are people in this audience easily capable of financing a massive research survey to settle the question  and I put the suggestion up  for what it's worth. But let me know show you some data that have been properly published and analyzed  on one special group    namely  top scientists. In       Larson and Witham polled the cream of American scientists  those who'd been honored by election to the National Academy of Sciences  and among this select group  belief in a personal God dropped to a shattering seven percent. About    percent are agnostic  the rest could fairly be called atheists. Similar figures obtained for belief in personal immortality. Among biological scientists  the figure is even lower   .  percent  only  believe in God. Physical scientists  it's  .  percent. I've not seen corresponding figures for elite scholars in other fields  such as history or philosophy  but I'd be surprised if they were different. So  we've reached a truly remarkable situation  a grotesque mismatch between the American intelligentsia and the American electorate. A philosophical opinion about the nature of the universe  which is held by the vast majority of top American scientists and probably the majority of the intelligentsia generally  is so abhorrent to the American electorate that no candidate for popular election dare affirm it in public. If I'm right  this means that high office in the greatest country in the world is barred to the very people best qualified to hold it    the intelligentsia    unless they are prepared to lie about their beliefs. To put it bluntly  American political opportunities are heavily loaded against those who are simultaneously intelligent and honest. I'm not a citizen of this country  so I hope it won't be thought unbecoming if I suggest that something needs to be done. And I've already hinted what that something is. From what I've seen of TED  I think this may be the ideal place to launch it. Again  I fear it will cost money. We need a consciousness raising  coming out campaign for American atheists. This could be similar to the campaign organized by homosexuals a few years ago  although heaven forbid that we should stoop to public outing of people against their will. In most cases  people who out themselves will help to destroy the myth that there is something wrong with atheists. On the contrary  they'll demonstrate that atheists are often the kinds of people who could serve as decent role models for your children  the kinds of people an advertising agent could use to recommend a product  the kinds of people who are sitting in this room. There should be a snowball effect  a positive feedback  such that the more names we have  the more we get. There could be non linearities  threshold effects. When a critical mass has been obtained  there's an abrupt acceleration in recruitment. And again  it will need money. I suspect that the word  atheist  itself contains or remains a stumbling block far out of proportion to what it actually means  and a stumbling block to people who otherwise might be happy to out themselves. So  what other words might be used to smooth the path  oil the wheels  sugar the pill  Darwin himself preferred  agnostic     and not only out of loyalty to his friend Huxley  who coined the term. Darwin said   I have never been an atheist in the same sense of denying the existence of a God. I think that generally an 'agnostic' would be the most correct description of my state of mind.  He even became uncharacteristically tetchy with Edward Aveling. Aveling was a militant atheist who failed to persuade Darwin to accept the dedication of his book on atheism    incidentally  giving rise to a fascinating myth that Karl Marx tried to dedicate  Das Kapital  to Darwin  which he didn't  it was actually Edward Aveling. What happened was that Aveling's mistress was Marx's daughter  and when both Darwin and Marx were dead  Marx's papers became muddled up with Aveling's papers  and a letter from Darwin saying   My dear sir  thank you very much but I don't want you to dedicate your book to me   was mistakenly supposed to be addressed to Marx  and that gave rise to this whole myth  which you've probably heard. It's a sort of urban myth  that Marx tried to dedicate  Kapital  to Darwin. Anyway  it was Aveling  and when they met  Darwin challenged Aveling.  Why do you call yourselves atheists    'Agnostic  '  retorted Aveling   was simply 'atheist' writ respectable  and 'atheist' was simply 'agnostic' writ aggressive.  Darwin complained   But why should you be so aggressive   Darwin thought that atheism might be well and good for the intelligentsia  but that ordinary people were not  quote   ripe for it.  Which is  of course  our old friend  the  don't rock the boat  argument. It's not recorded whether Aveling told Darwin to come down off his high horse. But in any case  that was more than     years ago. You'd think we might have grown up since then. Now  a friend  an intelligent lapsed Jew  who  incidentally  observes the Sabbath for reasons of cultural solidarity  describes himself as a  tooth fairy agnostic.  He won't call himself an atheist because it's  in principle  impossible to prove a negative  but  agnostic  on its own might suggest that God's existence was therefore on equal terms of likelihood as his non existence. So  my friend is strictly agnostic about the tooth fairy  but it isn't very likely  is it  Like God. Hence the phrase   tooth fairy agnostic.  Bertrand Russell made the same point using a hypothetical teapot in orbit about Mars. You would strictly have to be agnostic about whether there is a teapot in orbit about Mars  but that doesn't mean you treat the likelihood of its existence as on all fours with its non existence. The list of things which we strictly have to be agnostic about doesn't stop at tooth fairies and teapots  it's infinite. If you want to believe one particular one of them    unicorns or tooth fairies or teapots or Yahweh    the onus is on you to say why. The onus is not on the rest of us to say why not. We  who are atheists  are also a fairyists and a teapotists. But we don't bother to say so. And this is why my friend uses  tooth fairy agnostic  as a label for what most people would call atheist. Nonetheless  if we want to attract deep down atheists to come out publicly  we're going to have find something better to stick on our banner than  tooth fairy  or  teapot agnostic.  So  how about  humanist   This has the advantage of a worldwide network of well organized associations and journals and things already in place. My problem with it is only its apparent anthropocentrism. One of the things we've learned from Darwin is that the human species is only one among millions of cousins  some close  some distant. And there are other possibilities  like  naturalist   but that also has problems of confusion  because Darwin would have thought naturalist     Naturalist  means  of course  as opposed to  supernaturalist     and it is used sometimes    Darwin would have been confused by the other sense of  naturalist   which he was  of course  and I suppose there might be others who would confuse it with  nudism . Such people might be those belonging to the British lynch mob  which last year attacked a pediatrician in mistake for a pedophile. I think the best of the available alternatives for  atheist  is simply  non theist.  It lacks the strong connotation that there's definitely no God  and it could therefore easily be embraced by teapot or tooth fairy agnostics. It's completely compatible with the God of the physicists. When atheists like Stephen Hawking and Albert Einstein use the word  God   they use it of course as a metaphorical shorthand for that deep  mysterious part of physics which we don't yet understand.  Non theist  will do for all that  yet unlike  atheist   it doesn't have the same phobic  hysterical responses. But I think  actually  the alternative is to grasp the nettle of the word  atheism  itself  precisely because it is a taboo word  carrying frissons of hysterical phobia. Critical mass may be harder to achieve with the word  atheist  than with the word  non theist   or some other non confrontational word. But if we did achieve it with that dread word  atheist  itself  the political impact would be even greater. Now  I said that if I were religious  I'd be very afraid of evolution    I'd go further  I would fear science in general  if properly understood. And this is because the scientific worldview is so much more exciting  more poetic  more filled with sheer wonder than anything in the poverty stricken arsenals of the religious imagination. As Carl Sagan  another recently dead hero  put it   How is it that hardly any major religion has looked at science and concluded  'This is better than we thought  The universe is much bigger than our prophet said  grander  more subtle  more elegant'  Instead they say  'No  no  no  My god is a little god  and I want him to stay that way.' A religion  old or new  that stressed the magnificence of the universe as revealed by modern science  might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe hardly tapped by the conventional faiths.  Now  this is an elite audience  and I would therefore expect about    percent of you to be religious. Many of you probably subscribe to our polite cultural belief that we should respect religion. But I also suspect that a fair number of those secretly despise religion as much as I do. If you're one of them  and of course many of you may not be  but if you are one of them  I'm asking you to stop being polite  come out  and say so. And if you happen to be rich  give some thought to ways in which you might make a difference. The religious lobby in this country is massively financed by foundations    to say nothing of all the tax benefits    by foundations  such as the Templeton Foundation and the Discovery Institute. We need an anti Templeton to step forward. If my books sold as well as Stephen Hawking's books  instead of only as well as Richard Dawkins' books  I'd do it myself. People are always going on about   How did September the   th change you   Well  here's how it changed me. Let's all stop being so damned respectful. Thank you very much. I just want to say  over the last few years I've been    had the opportunity to do this closing conference. And I've had some incredible warm up acts. About eight years ago  Billy Graham opened for me. And I thought that there was    I thought that there was absolutely no way in hell to top that. But I just wanted to say    and I mean this without irony    I think I can speak for everybody in the audience when I say that I wish to God that you were the President of the United States. OK  this is the title of my talk today. I just want to give you a quick overview. First of all  please remember I'm completely politically correct  and I mean everything with great affection. If any of you have sensitive stomachs or are feeling queasy  now is the time to check your Blackberry. Just to review  this is my TEDTalk. We're going to do some jokes  some gags  some little skits    and then we're going to talk about the L  point. So  one of the questions I ask myself is  was this the most distressing TED ever  Let's try and sum things up  shall we  Images of limb regeneration and faces filled with smallpox     percent of the conference. Mentions of polar bears drowning  four percent. Images of the earth being wiped out by flood or bird flu     percent. And David Pogue singing show tunes. Because this is the most distressing TED ever  I've been working with Neil Gershenfeld on next year's TED Bag. And if the    if the conference is anywhere near this distressing  then we're going to have a scream bag next year. It's going to be a cradle to cradle scream bag  of course. So you're going to be able to go like this. Bring it over here and open it up. Aaaah  Meanwhile  back at TED University  this wonderful woman is teaching you how to chop Sun Chips. So Robert Wright    I don't know  I felt like if there was anyone that Helen needed to give antidepressants to  it might have been him. I want to deliberately interfere with his dopamine levels. He was talking about morality. Economy class morality is  we want to bomb you back to the Stone Age. Business class morality is  don't bomb Japan    they built my car. And first class morality is  don't bomb Mexico    they clean my house. Yes  it is politically incorrect. All right  now I want to do a little bit of a thing for you ... All right  now these are the wha    I'd say   mumble  mumble    mumble  mumble  mumble  mumble  mumble     ahh  So I wanted to show you guys    I wanted to talk about a revolutionary new computer interface that lets you work with images just as easily as you    as a completely natural user interface. And you can    you can use really natural hand gestures to like  go like this. Now we had a Harvard professor here    she was from Harvard  I just wanted to mention and    and she was actually a professor from Harvard. And she was talking about seven dimensional  inverted universes. With  you know  of course  there's the gravity brain. There's the weak brain. And then there's my weak brain  which is too    too    absolutely too weak to understand what the fuck she was talking about. Now    one of the things that is very important to me is to try and figure out what on Earth am I here for. And that's why I went out and I picked up a best selling business book. You know  it basically uses as its central premise Greek mythology. And it's by a guy named Pastor Rick Warren  and it's called  The Porpoise Driven Life.  And Rick is as a pagan god  which I thought was kind of appropriate  in a certain way. And now we're going to have kind of a little more visualization about Rick Warren. OK. All right. Now  red is Rick Warren  and green is Daniel Dennett  OK  The scales here are religiosity from zero percent  or atheist  to     percent  Bible literally true. And then this is books sold    the logarithmic scale.                  three million     million      million. OK  now they're duking it out. Now they're duking it out. And Rick Warren's kind of pulling ahead  kind of pulling ahead. Yup  and his installed base is getting a little bigger. But Darwin's dangerous idea is coming back. It's coming back. Let me turn the trails on  so you can see that a little bit better. Now  one of the things that's very important is  Nicholas Negroponte talked to us about one lap dance per    I'm sorry    about One Laptop Per Child. Now let's talk about some of the characteristics that are important for this revolutionary device. I'll tell you a little bit about the design parameters  and then I'll show it to you in person. First of all  it needs to be small. It needs to be flat  so it's transportable. Lightweight. Portable. Uses very  very little power. Very  very high resolution. Has to be visible in bright daylight. Will work anywhere. And broadly applicable across many platforms. Now  we've actually done some research    Neil Gershenfeld and the Fab Labs went out into the market. They did some research  we came back  and we think we have the perfect prototype of what the students in the field are actually asking for. And here it is  the      computer. OK  OK  OK  OK    excellent  excellent. Now  I bought this device from Clifford Stoll for about     bucks. And he and his team of junior high school students were doing real science. So we're trying to check and trying to douse here  and see who uses marijuana. See who uses marijuana. Are we going to be able to find any marijuana  Jim Young  Only if we open enough locker doors. OK  now smallpox is an extremely distressing illness. We had Dr. Larry Brilliant talking about how we eradicated smallpox. I wanted to show you the stages of smallpox. We start. This is day one. Day two. Day three  she gets a massively big pox on her shoulder. Day three. Day four. Day five and day six. Now the good news is  because I'm a trained medical professional  I know that even though she'll be scarred for life  she's going to make a full recovery. Now the good news about Architects for Humanity is they're really kind of the most amazing group. They've been sponsoring a design competition to come up with innovative medical housing solutions  clinic solutions  in Africa  and they've had a design competition. Now the wonderful thing is  Larry Brilliant was just appointed the head of the Google Foundation  and so he decided that he would support    he would support Cameron's work. And the way he decided to support that work was by shipping over        shipping containers of Google snacks. So I want to show you some prototypes. The U.N.    you know  they took    years just to add a flap to a tent  but I think we have some more exciting things. This is a home made entirely out of Fruit Roll Ups. And those roll up cookies coated with white chocolate. And the really wonderful thing about this is  when you're done  well    you can eat it. But the thing that I'm really  really excited about is this incredible granola house. And the granola house has a special Sun Chip roof to collect water and recycle it. And it's    well  on this side it has regular Sour Patch Kids and Gummy Bears to let in the light. But on this side  it has sugary Gummy Bears  to diffuse the light more slightly. And we    we wanted just to show you what this might look like in situ. So  Einstein    Einstein  tell me    what's your favorite song  No  I said what's your favorite song  No  I said what's your favorite song   Free Bird.  OK  so  Einstein  what's your favorite singing group  Could you say that again  What's your favorite singing group  OK  one more time    I'm just going to give you a little help. Your favorite singing group    it's Diana Ross and the    Audience  Supremes  Tom Reilly  Exactly. Could we have the sound up on the laptop  please   Free Bird  kind of reminds me that if you    if you listen to  Free Bird  backwards  this is what you might hear. Computer  Satan. Satan. Satan. Satan. Satan. Satan. Satan. TR  Now it's a little hard to hear the whole message  so I wanted to    so I wanted to help you a little bit. Computer  My sweet Satan. Dan Dennett worships Satan. Buy  The Purpose Driven Life   or Satan will take your soul. TR  So  we've talked a lot about global warming  but  you know  as Jill said  it sounds kind of nice    good weather in the wintertime  and New York City. And as Jay Walker pointed out  that is just not scary enough. So Al  I actually think I'm rather good at branding. So I've tried to figure out a good design process to come up with a new term to replace  global warming.  So we started with Babel Fish. We put in global warming. And then we decided that we'd change it from English to Dutch    into  Het globale Verwarmen.  From Dutch to  Korean   into  Hordahordaneecheewa.   Korean  to Portuguese  Aquecer se Global. Then Portuguese to Pig Latin. Aquecer se ucked fay. And then finally back into the English  which is  we're totally fucked. Now I don't know about you  but Michael Shermer talked about the willingness for human beings    evolutionarily  they're designed to see patterns in things. For example  in cheese sandwiches. Now can you look at that carefully and see if you see the Virgin Mary  I tried to make it a little bit clearer. Is it the Virgin Mary  Or is it Mena Trott  So  I talked to Josh Prince Ramus about the convention center and the conferences. It's getting awfully big. It's getting just a little bit too big. It's bursting at the seams here a little bit. So we tried to come up with a program    how we could remake this structure to better accommodate TED. So first of all we decided    that we needed about one third bookstore  one third Google cafe  about    percent registration     percent luxury hotel  about five percent for restrooms. And then of course  we wanted to have the simulcast lounge  the lobby and the Steinbeck forum. Now let me show you how that literally translated into the design program. So first  one of the problems with Monterey is that if there is global warming and Greenland melts as you say  the ocean level is going to rise    feet and flood the hell out of the convention center. So we're going to build this new building on stilts. So we build this building on stilts  then up here    is where we're going to put the new Steinbeck auditorium. And the wonderful thing about the new bookstore is  it's going to be shaped in a spiral that's organized by the Dewey Decimal System. Then we're going to make an escalator that helps you get up there. And finally  we're going to put the Marriott Hotel and the Portola Plaza on the top. Now I don't know about you  but sometimes I have these images in my head of separated at birth. I don't know about you  but when I see Aubrey de Grey  I immediately go to Gandalf the Grey. OK. Now  we've heard  of course  that we're all soldiers here. So what I'd really  really like you to do now is  pick up your white piece of paper. Does everybody have their white piece of paper  And I want you to get out a pen  and I want you to write a terrorist note. If we put up the ELMO for a moment    if we put up the ELMO  then we'll get  you know  I'll give you a model that you can work from  OK  And then I want you to fold that note into a paper airplane. And once you've folded it into a paper airplane  I want you to take some anthrax    and I want you to put that in the paper airplane. And then I want you to throw it on Jim Young. Luckily  I was the recipient of the TED Prize this year. And I wanted to see    I want to dedicate this film to my father  Homer. OK. Now this film isn't really hard enough  so I wanted to make it a little bit harder. So I'm going to try and do this while reciting pi.  .                                                                       . Can we cue the music please  Now I wanted to use this talk to talk about global warming a little bit. Back in       you can see that the mountain range of Brokeback Mountain was covered in     inches of snow pack. Parenthetically  over there on the slopes  I did want to show you that black men ski. But over the years     years later  the snow packs eroded  and  if you notice  the trees have started turning yellow. The water level of the lake has started drying up. A few years later  there's no snow left at all. And all the trees have turned brown. This year  unfortunately the lakebed's turned into an absolute cracked dry bed. And I fear  if we do nothing for our planet  in    years  it's going to look like this. Mr. Vice President  I wish I knew how to quit you. Thank you very much. I'd like to speak about technology trends  which is something that many of you follow    but we also follow  for related reasons. Obviously  being a technology magazine  technology trends are something that we write about and need to know about. But also it's part of being any monthly magazine    you live in the future. And we have a long lead time. We have to plan issues many months in advance  we have to guess at what public appetites are going to be six months  nine months down the road. So we're in the forecasting business. We also  like a lot of companies  create a product that's based on technology trends. In this case  ours is about ideas and information  and  if we're lucky  some entertainment. But the concept's quite the same. And so we have to understand not only why tech's important  where it's going  but also  very importantly  when    the timing is everything. And it's interesting  when you look at the predictions made during the peak of the boom in the     s  about e commerce  or Internet traffic  or broadband adoption  or Internet advertising  they were all right    they were just wrong in time. Almost every one of those has come true just a few years later. But the difference of a few years on stock market valuations is obviously extreme. And that's why timing is everything. You've probably seen something like this before. This is the classic Gartner Hype Curve  which talks about kind of the trajectory of a technology's lifespan. And just for fun  we put a bunch of technologies on it  to show whether they were kind of rising for the first high peak  or whether they were about to crash into the trough of disillusionment  or rise back in the slope of enlightenment  etc. And this is one way to do technology forecasting  get a sense of where technology is and then anticipate the next upturn. We tend to do any technology that we think is sufficiently important  we'll typically do it twice. Once  we want to do it first. We want to be the first to do it  for the geeks who appreciate that  we'll catch it right there at the technology trigger. You can see in       we put Linux on the cover. But then it comes back. And sufficiently big technologies are going to hit the mainstream  and they're going to burst out. And then it's time to do it again. Last year. And that's one way that we try to time technology trends. I'd like to talk about a way of thinking about technology trends that I call my  grand unified theory of predicting the future   but it's closer to a petite unified theory of predicting the future. It's based on the presumption  the observation even  that all important technologies go through four stages in their life    at least one of the four stages  sometimes all four of the stages. And at each one of these stages  can be seen as a collision    a collision with something else    for example  a critical price line that changes both the technology and also changes its effect on the world. It's an inflection point. And these are the inflection points that tell you what the next chapter in that technology's life is going to be  and maybe how you can do something about it. The first is the critical price. The first stage in a technology's advance is that it'll fall below a critical price. After it falls below a critical price  it will tend  if it's successful  to rise above a critical mass  a penetration. Many technologies  at that point  displace another technology  and that's another important point. And then finally  a lot of technologies commoditize. Towards the end of their life  they become nearly free. Each one of those is an opportunity to do something about it  it's an opportunity for the technology to change. And even if you missed  you know  the first boom of Wi Fi    you know  Wi Fi did the critical price  it did the critical mass  but hasn't done displacement yet  and hasn't done free yet    there's still more opportunity in that. I'd like to demonstrate what I mean by this by telling the story of the DVD  which is a technology which has done all of these. The DVD  as you know  was introduced in the mid     s and it was quite expensive. But you can see that by       it had fallen below     dollars  and     dollars was a psychological threshold. And it started to take off. And you can see that the units started to trend up  the hidden inflection point    it was taking off. The next thing it hit  a year later  was critical mass. In this case     percent is often a good proxy for critical mass in a household. And what's interesting here is that something else took off along with it  home theater units. Suddenly you have a DVD in the house  you've got high quality digital video  you have a reason to have a big screen television  you have a reason for Dolby  .  surround sound. And maybe you have reasons for starting to connect them  and bring the rest of your entertainment in. What's interesting also is    note that Netflix was founded in     . Reed Hastings is here. He clearly saw that that was a moment  that was an inflection point that he could do something with. The next phase it hit was displacement. You can see around      it finally out sold the VCR. And here too  you can see the implications in the world at large. Netflix was right    the Netflix model could capitalize on the DVD in a way that the video rental stores couldn't. Among the DVD's many assets is that it's very small  you can stick it in the mailer and post it cheaply. That gave an advantage  that was an implication of the technology's rise that wasn't obvious to everybody. And then finally  DVDs are approaching free. There's a company called Apex  a no name Chinese firm  who has  several times in the past year  been the number one DVD seller in America. Their average price  for last year  was    dollars. You're aware of the perhaps apocryphal Wal Mart stampede over the    dollar DVD. But they're getting very  very cheap  and look at the interesting implication of it. As they get cheaper  the premium brands  the Sonys and such  are losing market share  and the no names  the Apexes  are gaining them. They're being commodified  and that's what happens when things go to zero. It's a tough market out there. Now they've introduced these four ways of looking at technology  these four stages of technology's life. I'd like to talk about some other technologies out there  just technologies on our radar    and I'll use this lens  these four  as a way to kind of tell you where each one of those technologies is in its development. They're not necessarily the top    technologies out there    they're just examples of technologies that are in each one of these periods. But I think that the implications of them approaching these crossovers  these intersections  are interesting to think about. Start with gene sequencing. As you probably know  gene sequencing    in a large part  because it's built on computers    is falling in price at a kind of a Moore's Law like level. It is now possible    will be possible  and if Craig Venter indeed comes today  he may tell you something about this    to sequence the human genome for    million dollars by the end of this year. That's as opposed to billions just a few years ago. You know  our ability to capture the tools of creation is getting closer and closer. What's interesting is that at the same time  the number of genes that we're discovering is rising very quickly. Each one of these genes has potential diagnostic test. There will come a day when you can have hundreds of thousands of tests done  very cheaply  if you want to know. You can learn about your own mosaic. Here's another technology that's approaching a critical price. This is a fascinating research from WHO that shows the effect of generic drugs on anti retroviral drug compounds and cocktails. In January       the price was        dollars  or    dollars a day. The generics came in  first in Brazil and elsewhere  and the effect was just dramatic on pricing. Today it's less than    cents a day. And what's interesting is if you look at the price elasticity  if you look at the correlation between these two  as the anti retrovirals come down  the number of people you can treat goes radically up. And the Clinton Foundation and WHO believe that they can treat three million people worldwide by         two million in sub Saharan Africa. And the falling price of drugs has a lot to do with that. Linux is another good example. Now we've switched to critical mass. These are now technologies that are hitting critical mass. If you look here  here's Linux in red  and it's hit    percent. Interestingly  it's done a crossover before  but not the crossovers that matter. The crossover that's going to matter is the one with the blue. But you can look and see the direction those lines are going  you can see that at the    percent  it's now taken seriously. It's not just for the geeks any more. That is  I imagine  what people in Redmond wake up in the middle of the night thinking about. Another technology that we see all around us out here is hybrid cars. I don't know whether anybody has a Prius       but they're fantastic. And if you look at the trends here  by about         and I don't think this is a crazy forecast    they'll be two percent of auto sales. Two percent isn't    percent  but in the car business  which is slow moving  that's huge  that's arrival. At two percent  you start seeing them on the roads everywhere. And what's interesting about the hybrids taking off is you've now introduced electric motors to the automobile industry. It's the first radical change in automobile technology in     years. And once you have electric motors  you can do anything  you can change the structure of the car in any way you want. You can have regenerative braking  you can have drive by wire  you can have replaceable body shapes    it's a little thing that starts with a hybrid  but it can lead to a whole new era of the car. Voice Over IP is something you may have heard something about. Again  it's kind of coming out of nowhere  it's a little hard to use right now. There's a company created by the Kazaa founders called Skype. Look at these numbers. They launched it in August of last year  they already have nearly four million registered users    that's critical mass. And the same thing's happening on the carrier side. You're looking at IP taking over from some of the traditional telecom standards. This is a tipping point    if Malcolm's here  forgive me    and it's going to change the economics  and the speed  and the players in the industry. It's going to look a little bit like that. And finally  free. Free is really  really interesting. Free is something that comes with digital  because the reproduction costs are essentially free. It comes with IP  because it's such an efficient protocol. It comes with fiber optics  because there's so much bandwidth. Free is really  you know  the gift of Silicon Valley to the world. It's an economic force  it's a technical force. It's a deflationary force  if not handled right. It is abundance  as opposed to scarcity. Free is probably the most interesting thing. And here you have just the number of songs that can be stored on a hard drive. You know  there could be a film's  unclear  there  but it's basically  every song ever made could be stored on     dollars worth of storage by     . It takes that entire element  the physical element  of songs off the table. And you've seen the numbers. I mean  you know  the music industry is imploding in front of our very eyes  and Hollywood's worried as well. They're facing a force that they haven't faced before. And their response is draconian  and not necessarily the one that's going to get them out of this. And finally  I'll give you one last example of free    perhaps the most powerful of all. I mentioned fiber optics    their abundance tends to make things free. This is the price of a phone call to India per minute. And what's interesting is that it was just      when it was more than two dollars a minute. India had  still has  a regulated phone system and so did we. It was surprisingly non innovative  moved very slowly  but then there was just so much fiber out there  you couldn't hold back  and look how quickly the price fell. It's seven cents a minute  in many cases. And the consequence of cheap phone calling  free phone calling  to India  is the pissed off programmer  is the outsourcing. It is probably one of the most dramatic shifts in globalization and one of the most powerful economic tools that we're seeing in our world today. The force of India  and then China  and any other country that can contact our markets and will work with our companies    because the communications are free    is just beginning to be felt. And I think that's probably one of the most important technology trends that we're looking at today. Thank you. Sergey Brin  I want to discuss a question I know that's been pressing on many of your minds. We spoke to you last several years ago. And before I get started today  since many of you are wondering  I just wanted to get it out of the way. The answer is boxers. Now I hope all of you feel better. Do you know what this might be  Does anyone know what that is  Audience  Yes. SB  What is it  Audience  It's people logging on to Google around the world. SB  Wow  OK. I didn't really realize what it was when I first saw it. But this is what helped me see it. This is what we run at the office  that actually runs real time. Here it's slightly logged. But here you can see around the world how people are using Google. And every one of those rising dots represents probably about        searches  or something like that. And they're labeled by color right now  by language. So you can see  here we are in the U.S.  and they're all coming up red. There we are in Monterey    hopefully I can get it right. You can see that Japan is busy at night  right there. We have Tokyo coming in in Japanese. There's a lot of activity in China. There's a lot of activity in India. There's some in the Middle East  the little pockets. And Europe  which is right now in the middle of the day  is going really strong with a whole wide variety of languages. Now you can also see  if I turn this around here    hopefully I won't shake the world too much. But you can also see  there are places where there's not so much. Australia  because there just aren't very many people there. And this is something that we should really work on  which is Africa  which is just a few trickles  basically in South Africa and a few other urban cities. But basically  what we've noticed is these queries  which come in at thousands per second  are available everywhere there is power. And pretty much everywhere there is power  there is the Internet. And even in Antarctica    well  at least this time of year    we from time to time will see a query rising up. And if we had it plotted correctly  I think the International Space Station would have it  too. So this is some of the challenge that we have here  is you can see that it's actually kind of hard to get the    there we go. This is how we have to move the bits around to actually get the people the answers to their questions. You can see that there's a lot of data running around. It has to go all over the world  through fibers  through satellites  through all kinds of connections. And it's pretty tricky for us to maintain the latencies as low as we try to. Hopefully your experience is good. But you can see also  once again    so some places are much more wired than others  and you can see all the bandwidth across the U.S.  going up over to Asia  Europe in the other direction  and so forth. Now what I would like to do is just to show you what one second of this activity would look like. And if we can switch to slides    all right  here we go. So this is slowed down. This is what one second looks like. And this is what we spend a lot of our time doing  is just making sure that we can keep up with this kind of traffic load. Now  each one of those queries has an interesting life and tale of its own. I mean  it could be somebody's health  it could be somebody's career  something important to them. And it could potentially be something as important as tomato sauce  or in this case  ketchup. So this is a query that we had    I guess it's a popular band that was more popular in some parts of the world than others. You can see that it got started right here. In the U.S. and Spain  it was popular at the same time. But it didn't have quite the same pickup in the U.S. as it did in Spain. And then from Spain  it went to Italy  and then Germany got excited  and maybe right now the U.K. is enjoying it. And so I guess the U.S. finally  finally started to like it  too. And I just wanted to play it for you. Anyway  you can all enjoy it for yourselves    hopefully that search will work. As a part of    you know  part of what we want to do to grow our company is to have more searches. And what that means is we want to have more people who are healthy and educated. More animals  if they start doing searches as well. But partly  we want to make the world a better place  and so one thing that we're embarking upon is the Google Foundation  and we're in the process of setting that up. We also have a program already called Google Grants that now serves over     different charities around the world  and these are some of the charities that are on there. And it's something I'm very excited to be a part of. In fact  many of the organizations that are here    the Acumen Fund  I think ApproTEC we have running  I'm not sure if that one's up yet    and many of the people who have presented here are running through Google Grants. They run Google ads  and we just give them the ad credit so they can let organizations know. One of the earlier results that we got    we have a Singaporean businessman who is now sponsoring a village of    Vietnamese girls for their education  and that was one of the earliest results. And as I said  now there have been many  many stories that have come in  because we do have hundreds of charities in there  and the Google Foundation will be an even broader endeavor. Now does anybody know who this is  A ha  Audience  Orkut. SB  Yes  Somebody got it. This is Orkut. Is anybody here on Orkut  Do we have any  Okay  not very many people know about it. I'll explain it in a second. This is one of our engineers. We find that they work better when they're submerged and covered with leaves. That's how we churn those products out. Orkut had a vision to create a social network. I know all of you are thinking   Yet another social network.  But it was a dream of his  and we  basically  when people really want to do something  well  we generally let them. So this is what he built. We just released it in a test phase last month  and it's been taking off. This is our VP of Engineering. You can see the red hair  and I don't know if you can see the nose ring there. And these are all of his friends. So this is how    we just deployed it    we just decided that people would send each other invitations to get into the service  and so we just had the people in our company initially send them out. And now we've grown to over         members. And they spread  actually  very quickly  even outside the U.S. You can see  even though the U.S. is still the majority here    though  by the way  search wise  it's only about    percent of our traffic    but it's already going to Japan  and the U.K.  and Europe  and all the rest of the countries. So it's a fun little project. There are a variety of demographics. I won't bore you with these. But it's just the kind of thing that we just try out for fun and see where it goes. And    well  I'll leave you in suspense. Larry  you can explain this one. Larry Page  Thank you  Sergey. So one of the things    both Sergey and I went to a Montessori school  and I think  for some reason  this has been incorporated in Google. And Sergey mentioned Orkut  which is something that  you know  Orkut wanted to do in his time  and we call this    at Google  we've embodied this as  the    percent time   and the idea is  for    percent of your time  if you're working at Google  you can do what you think is the best thing to do. And many  many things at Google have come out of that  such as Orkut and also Google News. And I think many other things in the world also have come out of this. Mendel  who was supposed to be teaching high school students  actually  you know  discovered the laws of genetics    as a hobby  basically. So many  many useful things come out of this. And News  which I just mentioned  was started by a researcher. And he just    he    after       he got really interested in the news. And he said   Why don't I look at the news better   And so he started clustering it by category  and then he started using it  and then his friends started using it. And then  besides just looking cute on a baby's bottom  we made it a Googlette  which is basically a small project at Google. So it'd be like three people  or something like that  and they would try to make a product. And we wouldn't really be sure if it's going to work or not. And in News' case  you know  they had a couple of people working on it for a while  and then more and more people started using it  and then we put it out on the Internet  and more and more people started using it. And now it's a real  full blown project with more people on it. And this is how we keep our innovation running. I think usually  as companies get bigger  they find it really hard to have small  innovative projects. And we had this problem  too  for a while  and we said   Oh  we really need a new concept.  You know  the Googlettes    that's a small project that we're not quite sure if it's going to work or not  but we hope it will  and if we do enough of them  some of them will really work and turn out  such as News. But then we had a problem because then we had over     projects. And I don't know about all of you  but I have trouble keeping     things in my head at once. And we found that if we just wrote all of them down and ordered them    and these are kind of made up. Don't really pay attention to them. For example  the  Buy Iceland  was from a media article. We would never do such a crazy thing  but    in any case  we found if we just basically wrote them all down and ordered them  that most people would actually agree what the ordering should be. And this was kind of a surprise to me  but we found that as long as you keep the     things in your head  which you did by writing them down  that you could do a pretty good job deciding what to do and where to put your resources. And so that's basically what we've done since we instituted that a few years ago  and I think it has really allowed us to be innovative and still stay reasonably well organized. The other thing we discovered is that people like to work on things that are important  and so naturally  people sort of migrate to the things that are high priorities. I just wanted to highlight a couple of things that are new  or you might not know about. And the top thing  actually  is the Deskbar. So this is a new    how many of you use the Google Toolbar  Raise your hands. How many of you use the Deskbar  All right  see  You guys should try it out. But if you go to our site and search for  Deskbar   you'll get this. And the idea is  instead of a toolbar  it's just present all the time on your screen on the bottom  and you can do searches really easily. And it's sort of like a better version of the toolbar. Thank you  Sergey. This is another example of a project that somebody at Google was really passionate about  and they just  they got going  and it's really  really a great product  and really taking off. Google Answers is something we started  which is really cool  which lets you    for five to     dollars  you can type a question in  and then there's a pool of researchers that go out and research it for you  and it's guaranteed and all that  and you can get actually very good answers to things without spending all that time yourself. Froogle lets you search shopping information  and Blogger lets you publish things. But all of these    well  these were all sort of innovative things that we did that    you know  we try many  many different things in our company. We also like to innovate in our physical space  and we noticed in meetings  you know  you have to wait a long time for projectors to turn on and off  and they're noisy  so people shut them off. And we didn't like that  so we actually  in maybe a couple of weeks  we built these little enclosures that enclosed the projectors  and so we can leave them on all the time and they're completely silent. And as a result  we were able to build some software that also lets us manage a meeting  so when you walk into a meeting room now  it lists all the meetings that are happening  you can very easily take notes  and they just get emailed automatically to all the people that were present in the meeting. And as we become more of a global company  we find these things really affect us    you know  can we work effectively with people who aren't in the room  And things like that. And simple things like this can really make a big difference. We also have a lot of engineers in those meetings  and they don't always do their laundry as much as they should. And so we found it was pretty helpful to have laundry machines  for our younger employees especially  and ... we also allow dogs and things like that  and we've had  I think  a really fun culture at our company  which helps people work and enjoy what they're doing. This is actually our  cult picture.  I just wanted to show quickly. We had this on our website for a while  but we found that after we put it on our website  we didn't get any job applications anymore. But anyway  every year we've taken the whole company on a ski trip. A lot of work happens in companies from people knowing each other  and informally. And I think we've done a good job encouraging that. It makes it a really fun place to work. Along with our logos  too  which I think really embody our culture when we change things. In the early days  we were actually advised we should never change our logo because we should establish our brand  you know  because  you know  you'd never want to change your logo. You want it to be consistent. And we said   Well  that doesn't sound so much fun. Why don't we try changing it every day   One of the things that really excites me about what we're doing now is we have this thing called AdSense  and this is a little bit foreshadowing    this is from before Dean dropped out. But the idea is  like  on a newspaper  for example  we show you relevant ads. And this is hard to read  but this says  Battle for New Hampshire  Howard Dean for President     articles on Howard Dean. And these ads are generated automatically    like in this case  on the Washington Post    from the content on the site. And so we use our over         advertisers and millions of advertisements  so we pick the one that's most relevant to what you're actually looking at  much as we do on search. So the idea is we can make advertising useful  not just annoying  right  And the nice thing about this  we have a self serve program  and many thousands of websites have signed up  and this let's them really make money. And I    you know  there's a number of people I met    I met this guy who runs a conservation site at a party  and he said   You know  I wasn't making any money. I just put this thing on my site and I'm making        dollars a month. And  you know  thank you. I don't have to do my other job now.  And I think this is really important for us  because it makes the Internet work better. It makes content get better  it makes searching work better  when people can really make their livelihood from producing great content. So this session is supposed to be about the future  so I'd thought I'd talk at least briefly about it. And the idea behind this is to do the perfect job doing search  you really have to be smart. Because you can type  you know  any kind of thing into Google  and you expect an answer back  right  But finding things is tricky  and so you really want intelligence. And in fact  the ultimate search engine would be smart. It would be artificial intelligence. And so that's something we work on  and we even have some people who are excited enough and crazy enough to work on it now  and that's really their goal. So we always hope that Google will be smart  but we're always surprised when other people think that it is. And so I just wanted to give a funny example of this. This is a blog from Iraq  and it's not really what I'm going to talk about  but I just wanted to show you an example. Maybe  Sergey  you can highlight this. So we decided    actually  the highlight's right there. Oh  thank you. So   related searches   right there. You can't see it that well  but we decided we should put in this feature into our AdSense ads  called  related searches.  And so we'd say  you know   Did you mean 'search for'     what is this  in this case   Saddam Hussein   because this blog is about Iraq    and you know  in addition to the ads  and we thought this would be a great idea. And so there is this blog of a young person who was kind of depressed  and he said   You know  I'm sleeping a lot.  He was just kind of writing about his life. And our algorithms    not a person  of course  but our algorithms  our computers    read his blog and decided that the related search was   I am bored.  And he read this  and he thought a person had decided that he was boring  and it was very unfortunate  and he said   You know  what are these  you know  bastards at Google doing  Why don't they like my blog   And so then we read his blog  which was getting    you know  sort of going from bad to worse  and we said the related search was   Retards.  And then  you know  he got even more mad  and he wrote    like  started swearing and so on. And then we produced  You suck.  And finally  it ended with  Kiss my ass.  And so basically  he thought he was dealing with something smart  and of course  you know  we just sort of wrote this program and we tried it out  and it didn't quite work  and we don't have this feature anymore. So with that  maybe I can switch back to the world. I wanted to end just by saying that there's a couple things that really make me excited to be involved with Google  and one of those is that we're able to make money largely through advertising  and one of the benefits that I didn't expect from that was that we're able to serve everyone in the world without worrying about  you know  places that don't have as much money. So we don't have to worry about our products being sold  for example  for less money in places that are poor  and then they get re imported into the U.S.    for example  with the drug industry. And I think we're really lucky to have that kind of business model because everyone in the world has access to our search  and I think that's a tremendous  tremendous benefit. The other thing I wanted to mention just briefly is that we have a tremendous ability and responsibility to provide people the right information  and we view ourselves like a newspaper or a magazine    that we should provide very objective information. And so in our search results  we never accept payment for our search results. We accept payment for advertising  and we mark it as such. And that's unlike many of our competitors. And I think decisions we're able to make like that have a tremendous impact on the world  and it makes me really proud to be involved with Google. So thank you. The immersive ugliness of our everyday environments in America is entropy made visible. We can't overestimate the amount of despair that we are generating with places like this. And mostly  I want to persuade you that we have to do better if we're going to continue the project of civilization in America. By the way  this doesn't help. Nobody's having a better day down here because of that. There are a lot of ways you can describe this. You know  I like to call it  the national automobile slum.  You can call it suburban sprawl. I think it's appropriate to call it the greatest misallocation of resources in the history of the world. You can call it a technosis externality clusterfuck. And it's a tremendous problem for us. The outstanding    the salient problem about this for us is that these are places that are not worth caring about. We're going to talk about that some more. A sense of place  your ability to create places that are meaningful and places of quality and character depends entirely on your ability to define space with buildings  and to employ the vocabularies  grammars  syntaxes  rhythms and patterns of architecture in order to inform us who we are. The public realm in America has two roles  it is the dwelling place of our civilization and our civic life  and it is the physical manifestation of the common good. And when you degrade the public realm  you will automatically degrade the quality of your civic life and the character of all the enactments of your public life and communal life that take place there. The public realm comes mostly in the form of the street in America because we don't have the       year old cathedral plazas and market squares of older cultures. And your ability to define space and to create places that are worth caring about all comes from a body of culture that we call the culture of civic design. This is a body of knowledge  method  skill and principle that we threw in the garbage after World War II and decided we don't need that anymore  we're not going to use it. And consequently  we can see the result all around us. The public realm has to inform us not only where we are geographically  but it has to inform us where we are in our culture. Where we've come from  what kind of people we are  and it needs to  by doing that  it needs to afford us a glimpse to where we're going in order to allow us to dwell in a hopeful present. And if there is one tremendous    if there is one great catastrophe about the places that we've built  the human environments we've made for ourselves in the last    years  it is that it has deprived us of the ability to live in a hopeful present. The environments we are living in  more typically  are like these. You know  this happens to be the asteroid belt of architectural garbage two miles north of my town. And remember  to create a place of character and quality  you have to be able to define space. So how is that being accomplished here  If you stand on the apron of the Wal Mart over here and try to look at the Target store over here  you can't see it because of the curvature of the Earth.  Laughter  That's nature's way of telling you that you're doing a poor job of defining space. Consequently  these will be places that nobody wants to be in. These will be places that are not worth caring about. We have about  you know         places that are not worth caring about in the United States today. When we have enough of them  we're going to have a nation that's not worth defending. And I want you to think about that when you think about those young men and women who are over in places like Iraq  spilling their blood in the sand  and ask yourself   What is their last thought of home   I hope it's not the curb cut between the Chuck E. Cheese and the Target store because that's not good enough for Americans to be spilling their blood for.  Applause  We need better places in this country. Public space. This is a good public space. It's a place worth caring about. It's well defined. It is emphatically an outdoor public room. It has something that is terribly important    it has what's called an active and permeable membrane around the edge. That's a fancy way of saying it's got shops  bars  bistros  destinations    things go in and out of it. It's permeable. The beer goes in and out  the waitresses go in and out  and that activates the center of this place and makes it a place that people want to hang out in. You know  in these places in other cultures  people just go there voluntarily because they like them. We don't have to have a craft fair here to get people to come here.  Laughter  You know  you don't have to have a Kwanzaa festival. People just go because it's pleasurable to be there. But this is how we do it in the United States. Probably the most significant public space failure in America  designed by the leading architects of the day  Harry Cobb and I.M. Pei  Boston City Hall Plaza. A public place so dismal that the winos don't even want to go there.  Laughter  And we can't fix it because I.M. Pei's still alive  and every year Harvard and M.I.T. have a joint committee to repair it. And every year they fail to because they don't want to hurt I.M. Pei's feelings. This is the other side of the building. This was the winner of an international design award in  I think        something like that. It wasn't Pei and Cobb  another firm designed this  but there's not enough Prozac in the world to make people feel OK about going down this block. This is the back of Boston City Hall  the most important  you know  significant civic building in Albany    excuse me    in Boston. And what is the message that is coming  what are the vocabularies and grammars that are coming  from this building and how is it informing us about who we are  This  in fact  would be a better building if we put mosaic portraits of Josef Stalin  Pol Pot  Saddam Hussein  and all the other great despots of the   th century on the side of the building  because then we'd honestly be saying what the building is really communicating to us. You know  that it's a despotic building  it wants us to feel like termites.  Laughter  This is it on a smaller scale  the back of the civic center in my town  Saratoga Springs  New York. By the way  when I showed this slide to a group of Kiwanians in my town  they all rose in indignation from their creamed chicken   Laughter  and they shouted at me and said   It was raining that day when you took that picture   Because this was perceived to be a weather problem.  Laughter  You know  this is a building designed like a DVD player.  Laughter  Audio jack  power supply    and look  you know these things are important architectural jobs for firms  right  You know  we hire firms to design these things. You can see exactly what went on  three o'clock in the morning at the design meeting. You know  eight hours before deadline  four architects trying to get this building in on time  right  And they're sitting there at the long boardroom table with all the drawings  and the renderings  and all the Chinese food caskets are lying on the table  and    I mean  what was the conversation that was going on there   Laughter  Because you know what the last word was  what the last sentence was of that meeting. It was   Fuck it.   Laughter   Applause  That    that is the message of this form of architecture. The message is  We don't give a fuck  We don't give a fuck. So I went back on the nicest day of the year  just to    you know    do some reality testing  and in fact  he will not even go down there because  Laughter  it's not interesting enough for his clients  you know  the burglars  the muggers. It's not civically rich enough for them to go down there. OK. The pattern of Main Street USA    in fact  this pattern of building downtown blocks  all over the world  is fairly universal. It's not that complicated  buildings more than one story high  built out to the sidewalk edge  so that people who are  you know  all kinds of people can get into the building. Other activities are allowed to occur upstairs  you know  apartments  offices  and so on. You make provision for this activity called shopping on the ground floor. They haven't learned that in Monterey. If you go out to the corner right at the main intersection right in front of this conference center  you'll see an intersection with four blank walls on every corner. It's really incredible. Anyway  this is how you compose and assemble a downtown business building  and this is what happened when in Glens Falls  New York  when we tried to do it again  where it was missing  right  So the first thing they do is they pop up the retail a half a story above grade to make it sporty. OK. That completely destroys the relationship between the business and the sidewalk  where the theoretical pedestrians are.  Laughter  Of course  they'll never be there  as long as this is in that condition. Then because the relationship between the retail is destroyed  we pop a handicapped ramp on that  and then to make ourselves feel better  we put a nature Band Aid in front of it. And that's how we do it. I call them  nature Band Aids  because there's a general idea in America that the remedy for mutilated urbanism is nature. And in fact  the remedy for wounded and mutilated urbanism is good urbanism  good buildings. Not just flower beds  not just cartoons of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. You know  that's not good enough. We have to do good buildings. The street trees have really four jobs to do and that's it  To spatially denote the pedestrian realm  to protect the pedestrians from the vehicles in the carriageway  to filter the sunlight onto the sidewalk  and to soften the hardscape of the buildings and to create a ceiling    a vaulted ceiling    over the street  at its best. And that's it. Those are the four jobs of the street trees. They're not supposed to be a cartoon of the North Woods  they're not supposed to be a set for  The Last of the Mohicans.  You know  one of the problems with the fiasco of suburbia is that it destroyed our understanding of the distinction between the country and the town  between the urban and the rural. They're not the same thing. And we're not going to cure the problems of the urban by dragging the country into the city  which is what a lot of us are trying to do all the time. Here you see it on a small scale    the mothership has landed  R  D  and C  PO have stepped out to test the bark mulch to see if they can inhabit this planet.  Laughter  A lot of this comes from the fact that the industrial city in America was such a trauma that we developed this tremendous aversion for the whole idea of the city  city life  and everything connected with it. And so what you see fairly early  in the mid   th century  is this idea that we now have to have an antidote to the industrial city  which is going to be life in the country for everybody. And that starts to be delivered in the form of the railroad suburb  the country villa along the railroad line  which allows people to enjoy the amenity of the city  but to return to the countryside every night. And believe me  there were no Wal Marts or convenience stores out there then  so it really was a form of country living. But what happens is  of course  it mutates over the next    years and it turns into something rather insidious. It becomes a cartoon of a country house  in a cartoon of the country. And that's the great non articulated agony of suburbia and one of the reasons that it lends itself to ridicule. Because it hasn't delivered what it's been promising for half a century now. And these are typically the kind of dwellings we find there  you know. Basically  a house with nothing on the side because this house wants to state  emphatically   I'm a little cabin in the woods. There's nothing on either side of me. I don't have any eyes on the side of my head. I can't see.  So you have this one last facade of the house  the front  which is really a cartoon of a facade of a house. Because    notice the porch here. Unless the people that live here are Munchkins  nobody's going to be using that. This is really  in fact  a television broadcasting a show      called  We're Normal.  We're normal  we're normal  we're normal  we're normal  we're normal. Please respect us  we're normal  we're normal  we're normal. But we know what's going on in these houses  you know. We know that little Skippy is loading his Uzi down here  getting ready for homeroom.  Laughter  We know that Heather  his sister Heather     years old  is turning tricks up here to support her drug habit. Because these places  these habitats  are inducing immense amounts of anxiety and depression in children  and they don't have a lot of experience with medication. So they take the first one that comes along  often. These are not good enough for Americans. These are the schools we are sending them to  The Hannibal Lecter Central School  Las Vegas  Nevada. This is a real school  You know  but there's obviously a notion that if you let the inmates of this thing out  that they would snatch a motorist off the street and eat his liver. So every effort is made to keep them within the building. Notice that nature is present.  Laughter  We're going to have to change this behavior whether we like it or not. We are entering an epochal period of change in the world  and    certainly in America    the period that will be characterized by the end of the cheap oil era. It is going to change absolutely everything. Chris asked me not to go on too long about this  and I won't  except to say there's not going to be a hydrogen economy. Forget it. It's not going to happen. We're going to have to do something else instead. We're going to have to down scale  re scale  and re size virtually everything we do in this country and we can't start soon enough to do it. We're going to have     Applause     we're going to have to live closer to where we work. We're going to have to live closer to each other. We're going have to grow more food closer to where we live. The age of the       mile Caesar salad is coming to an end. We're going to have to    we have a railroad system that the Bulgarians would be ashamed of  We gotta do better than that  And we should have started two days before yesterday. We are fortunate that the new urbanists were there  for the last    years  excavating all that information that was thrown in the garbage by our parents' generation after World War II. Because we're going to need it if we're going to learn how to reconstruct towns. We're going to need to get back this body of methodology and principle and skill in order to re learn how to compose meaningful places  places that are integral  that allow    that are living organisms in the sense that they contain all the organs of our civic life and our communal life  deployed in an integral fashion. So that  you know  the residences make sense deployed in relation to the places of business  of culture and of governance. We're going to have to re learn what the building blocks of these things are  the street  the block  how to compose public space that's both large and small  the courtyard  the civic square and how to really make use of this property. We can see some of the first ideas for retro fitting some of the catastrophic property that we have in America. The dead malls  what are we going to do with them  Well  in point of fact  most of them are not going to make it. They're not going to be retro fitted  they're going to be the salvage yards of the future. Some of them we're going to fix  though. And we're going to fix them by imposing back on them street and block systems and returning to the building lot as the normal increment of development. And if we're lucky  the result will be revivified town centers and neighborhood centers in our existing towns and cities. And by the way  our towns and cities are where they are  and grew where they were because they occupy all the important sites. And most of them are still going to be there  although the scale of them is probably going to be diminished. We've got a lot of work to do. We're not going to be rescued by the hyper car  we're not going to be rescued by alternative fuels. No amount or combination of alternative fuels is going to allow us to continue running what we're running  the way we're running it. We're going to have to do everything very differently. And America's not prepared. We are sleepwalking into the future. We're not ready for what's coming at us. So I urge you all to do what you can. Life in the mid   st century is going to be about living locally. Be prepared to be good neighbors. Be prepared to find vocations that make you useful to your neighbors and to your fellow citizens. One final thing    I've been very disturbed about this for years  but I think it's particularly important for this audience. Please  please  stop referring to yourselves as  consumers.  OK  Consumers are different than citizens. Consumers do not have obligations  responsibilities and duties to their fellow human beings. And as long as you're using that word consumer in the public discussion  you will be degrading the quality of the discussion we're having. And we're going to continue being clueless going into this very difficult future that we face. So thank you very much. Please go out and do what you can to make this a land full of places that are worth caring about and a nation that will be worth defending.  Applause  There's a lot of exciting things happening in the design world and at IDEO this past year  and I'm pleased to get a chance to share some of those with you. I didn't attend the first TED back in      but I've been to a lot of them since that time. I thought it  would  kind of be interesting to think back to that time when Richard got the whole thing started. Thank you very much  Richard  it's been a big  enjoyable part of my life  coming here. And so thinking back  I was thinking those of us in Silicon Valley were really focused on products or objects    certainly technological objects. And so it was great fun in those days  and some of those of you who are in the audience were my clients. We'd come in with some prototype underneath a black cloth and we'd put it on the conference table  and we'd pull off the black cloth and everybody would  ooh  and  ah.  That was a really good time. And so we'll continue to focus on products  as we always have. And if you were here last year  I probably wrestled you to the floor and tried to show you my new EyeModule    which was a camera that plugged into the Handspring. And I took a lot of pictures last year  very few people knew what I was up to  but I took a lot of pictures. This year    maybe you could show the slides    this year we're carrying this Treo  which we had a lot to do with and helped Handspring design it. Also  though we designed it a few years ago    it's just become ubiquitous in the last year or so    this Heartstream defibrillator which is saving lives. Maybe you've seen them in the airports  They seem to be everywhere now. Lots of lives are being saved by those. And  we're just about to announce the Zinio Reader product that I believe will make magazines even more enjoyable to read. So  we really will continue to focus on products. But something's happened in the last    years since Richard started TED  and that's that people like us    I know people in other places have caught onto this for a long time  but for us  we've really just started ... we've kind of climbed Maslow's hierarchy a little bit    and so we're now focused more and more on human centered design  human centeredness in an approach to design. That really involves designing behaviors and personality into products. And I think you're starting to see that  and it's making our job even more enjoyable. Interestingly enough  we used to primarily build   D models    you know  you've seen some today    and   D renderings. Then we'd go and we'd show those as communicating our ideas. But firms like ours are having to move to a point where we get those objects that we're designing and get them in motion  showing how they'll be used. And so in order to do that we've been forming internal video production groups in order to make these kind of experience prototypes that show just what we mean about the man machine relationship. And it's a much better way to see. It's kind of like architects who show people in their houses  as opposed to them being empty. So I thought that I would show you a few videos to show off this new  broader definition of design in products and services and environments. I have a few of them    they're no more than a minute or a minute and a half apiece    but I thought you might be interested in seeing some of our work over the last year  and how it responds in video. So  Prada New York  we were asked by Rem Koolhaas and OMA to help us conceive the technology that's in their retail store in New York. He wanted a new kind of store    a new one    a store that had a cultural role as well as a retail one. And that meant actually designing custom technology as opposed to just buying things off the shelf and putting them to use. So  there're lots of things. Everything has RF tags  there's RF tags on the user  on the cards  there's the staff devices that are all around the store. You pick them up  and once you see something that you're interested in  the staff person can scan them in and then they can be shown on any screen throughout the store. You can look at color  and sizes  and how it appeared on the runway  or whatever. And so then the object    the merchandise that you're interested in    can be scanned. It's taken into the dressing room  and in the dressing room there are scanners so that we know exactly what clothing you have in the dressing room. We can put that up on a touch screen and you can play with that  and get more information about the clothing that you're interested in as you're trying it on. It's been used a lot of places  but I particularly like the use here of liquid crystal displays in the changing room. The last time I went to see this store  there was a huge buzz about people standing outside and wondering   Am I going to actually get to see the people changing clothes here   But if you push the button  of course  the whole wall goes dark. So you can try to get approval  or not  for whatever you're wearing. And then one of my favorite features of the technology is the magic mirror  where you put on the clothes. There's a big display in the mirror  and you can turn around    but there's a three second delay. So you can see what you look like from the back or all the way around  as you look. About a year and a half ago we were asked to design an installation in the museum    this is a new wing of the Science Museum in London  and it's primarily about digital and biomedical issues. And a group at Itch  which is now part of IDEO  designed this interactive wall that's about four stories tall. I don't know if anybody's seen this    it's pretty spectacular in the room. Anyway  it's based on the London subway system. And so you can see that the goal is to bring some of the feedback that the people who had gone to the museum were giving  and get it up on the wall so everybody could see. Just for everybody to see. So you enter your information. Then  like the London tube system  the little trains go around with what you're thinking about. And then when you get to a station  it's expanded so that you can actually read it. Then when you exit the IMAX theatre on the fourth floor    mostly teenagers coming out of there    there's this big open space that has these tables in it that have interactive games which are quite fun  also designed by Durrell  Bishop  and Andrew  Hirniak  of Itch. And the topics include things that the museum is about  male fertility  choosing the sex of your baby or what a driverless car might be like. There's lots of room  so people can come up and understand what it is before they get involved. And also  it's not shown in the video  but these are very beautiful. They go to the top of the wall and when they reach all the way to the top  after they've bounced around  they disperse into bits and go off into the atmosphere. The next video is not done by us. This is CBS Sunday Morning that aired about two weeks ago. Scott Adams ran into us and asked us if we wouldn't help to design the ultimate cubicle for Dilbert  which sounded like a fun thing and so we couldn't pass it up. He's always been interested in technology in the future. the world's expert on what's wrong with cubicles. So we thought  well  wouldn't it be fun to get together with some of the smartest design guys in the world and try to figure out if we could make the cubicle better  Narrator  Though they work in a wide open office space spectacularly set under San Francisco's Oakland Bay Bridge  the team built their own little cubicles to fully experience the problems. Woman  A one way mirror. I can look out  you can look at yourself. Narrator  They took pictures. Woman  You feel so trapped  when someone kind of leans over and you're sort of held captive there for a minute. SA  So far it's chaos  but a lot of people are doing stuff  so that's good. We'll see what happens. Narrator  The first group builds a cubicle in which the walls are screens for the computer and for family photos. In the second group's scenario  the walls are alive and actually give Dilbert a group hug. Behind the humor is the idea of making the cubicle more human.  David Kelley  So here's the final thing  complete with orange lighting that follows the sun across    that follows the tracks of the sun    across the sky. So you feel that in your cubicle. And my favorite feature  which is a flower in a vase that wilts when you leave in disappointment  and then when you come back  it comes up to greet you  happy to see you. DK  You know  it has homey touches like a built in fish tank in the walls  or something to be aggressive with to release tension. DK  And of course  a hammock for your afternoon nap that stretches across your cubicle. DK  This next project  we were asked to design a pavilion to celebrate the recycling of the water on the Millennium Dome in London. The dome has an incredible amount of water that washes off of it  as well as wastewater. So this building actually celebrates the water as it comes out of the recycling plant and goes into the reed bed so that it can be filtered for the final time. The pavilion's design goal was to be kind of quiet and peaceful. In contrast to if you went inside the dome  where it's kind of wild and crazy and everybody's learning all kinds of things  or fooling around  or whatever they're doing. But it was intended to be quite quiet. And then you would wander around and gather information  in a straightforward fashion  about the recycling process and what's being done  and how they're going to reuse the water once it comes through the plant. And then  if you saw  the panels actually rotate. So you can get the information on the front side  but as they rotate  you can see the actual recycling plant behind  with all the machines as they actually process the water. You can see  there's the plant. These are all very low budget videos  like quick prototypes. And we're announcing a new product here tonight  which is the first time this has ever been shown in public. It's called Spyfish  and it's a company called H Eye  started by Nigel Jagger in London. And it's a company that's trying to bring the experience    many people have boats  or enjoy being on boats  but a very small percentage of people actually have the capability or the interest in going under the water and actually seeing what's there  and enjoying what scuba divers do. This product  it has two cameras. You throw it over the side of your boat and you basically scuba dive without getting wet. For us    there's the object    for us  it was two projects. One  to design the interface so that the interface doesn't get in your way. You could have that kind of immersive experience of being underwater    of feeling like you're underwater    seeing what's going on. And the other one was to design the object and make sure that it was a consumer product and not a research tool. And so we spent a lot of time    this has been going on for about seven or eight years  this project    and  we're  just ready to start building them. It can dive to     feet  to where sunlight does not penetrate  and is equipped with powerful lights. It becomes your eyes and ears as you venture into the deep. The battery powered Spyfish sends the live video feed through a slender cable.  DK  This slender cable was a huge technological advancement and it allowed the whole thing to be the size that it is. Maneuvering the Spyfish is simple with the wireless remote control. You watch the video with superimposed graphics that indicate your depth and compass heading. The fluid graphics and ambient sounds combine to help you completely lose yourself underwater.  DK  And the last thing I'll talk about is ApproTEC  which is a project that I'm very excited about. ApproTEC is a company started by Dr. Martin Fisher  who's a good friend of mine. He's a Ph.D. from Stanford. He found himself in Kenya on a Fulbright and he had a very interesting insight  which is that he said   There must be entrepreneurs in Kenya  there must be entrepreneurs everywhere.  And he noticed that for weddings and funerals there they could find enough money to put something together. So he decided to start manufacturing products in Kenya with Kenyan manufacturers    designed by people like us  but taken there. And to this date    he's been gone for only a few years    he's started        companies. He's made        new jobs. And just the sales of the products    this is a non profit    the sales of these products is now .   of the GDP of Kenya. This is one guy doing this. This is a pretty spectacular thing. So we're in the process of helping them design deep well  low cost manual pumps in order for these people who have a quarter acre of land to be able to grow crops in the off season. What they do now is  they can grow crops in the rainy season but they can't grow them in the off season. And so by doing that  the woman that you saw in the first thing    she's a school teacher    always wanted to send her kids to college and she's going to be able to do it because of these things. So with seed squeezers  and pumps  and hay balers and very straightforward things that we're designing    my students are doing this as class projects and IDEO has donated their time to do this kind of work    it's really amazing to see his success  Martin's. We also were thinking about the experience of Richard  and so       we designed this hat  because I knew I'd be the last one in the day and I needed to deal with him. So I just have one more thing to say. Can you read it  Well  it's always kind of funny when he comes up and hovers. You know  you don't want to be rude to him and you don't want to feel guilty  and so I thought this would do it  where I just sit here. So we saw a lot of interesting things being designed today in this session  and from all the different presenters. And in my own practice  from product to ApproTEC  it's really exciting that we're taking a more human centered approach to design  that we're including behaviors and personalities in the things we do  and I think this is great. Designers are more trusted and more integrated into the business strategy of companies  and I have to say  for one  I feel very lucky at the progress that design has made since the first TED. Thanks a lot. I do two things  I design mobile computers and I study brains. And today's talk is about brains and  yay  somewhere I have a brain fan out there. I'm going to  if I can have my first slide up here  and you'll see the title of my talk and my two affiliations. So what I'm going to talk about is why we don't have a good brain theory  why it is important that we should develop one and what we can do about it. And I'll try to do all that in    minutes. I have two affiliations. Most of you know me from my Palm and Handspring days  but I also run a nonprofit scientific research institute called the Redwood Neuroscience Institute in Menlo Park  and we study theoretical neuroscience  and we study how the neocortex works. I'm going to talk all about that. I have one slide on my other life  the computer life  and that's the slide here. These are some of the products I've worked on over the last    years  starting back from the very original laptop to some of the first tablet computers and so on  and ending up most recently with the Treo  and we're continuing to do this. And I've done this because I really believe that mobile computing is the future of personal computing  and I'm trying to make the world a little bit better by working on these things. But this was  I have to admit  all an accident. I really didn't want to do any of these products and very early in my career I decided I was not going to be in the computer industry. And before I tell you about that  I just have to tell you this one little picture of graffiti there I picked off the web the other day. I was looking for a picture of graffiti  little text input language  and I found the website dedicated to teachers who want to make these  you know  the script writing things across the top of their blackboard  and they had added graffiti to it  and I'm sorry about that. So what happened was  when I was young and got out of engineering school at Cornell in '    I decided    I went to work for Intel and I was in the computer industry    and three months into that  I fell in love with something else  and I said   I made the wrong career choice here   and I fell in love with brains. This is not a real brain. This is a picture of one  a line drawing. But I don't remember exactly how it happened  but I have one recollection  which was pretty strong in my mind. In September       Scientific American came out with a single topic issue about the brain. And it was quite good. It was one of the best issues ever. And they talked about the neuron and development and disease and vision and all the things you might want to know about brains. It was really quite impressive. And one might have the impression that we really knew a lot about brains. But the last article in that issue was written by Francis Crick of DNA fame. Today is  I think  the   th anniversary of the discovery of DNA. And he wrote a story basically saying  well  this is all well and good  but you know what  we don't know diddley squat about brains and no one has a clue how these things work  so don't believe what anyone tells you. This is a quote from that article. He said   What is conspicuously lacking   he's a very proper British gentleman so   What is conspicuously lacking is a broad framework of ideas in which to interpret these different approaches.  I thought the word framework was great. He didn't say we didn't even have a theory. He says  we don't even know how to begin to think about it    we don't even have a framework. We are in the pre paradigm days  if you want to use Thomas Kuhn. And so I fell in love with this  and said look  we have all this knowledge about brains. How hard can it be  And this is something we can work on my lifetime. I felt I could make a difference  and so I tried to get out of the computer business  into the brain business. First  I went to MIT  the AI lab was there  and I said  well  I want to build intelligent machines  too  but the way I want to do it is to study how brains work first. And they said  oh  you don't need to do that. We're just going to program computers  that's all we need to do. And I said  no  you really ought to study brains. They said  oh  you know  you're wrong. And I said  no  you're wrong  and I didn't get in. But I was a little disappointed    pretty young    but I went back again a few years later and this time was in California  and I went to Berkeley. And I said  I'll go in from the biological side. So I got in    in the Ph.D. program in biophysics  and I was  all right  I'm studying brains now  and I said  well  I want to study theory. And they said  oh no  you can't study theory about brains. That's not something you do. You can't get funded for that. And as a graduate student  you can't do that. So I said  oh my gosh. I was very depressed. I said  but I can make a difference in this field. So what I did is I went back in the computer industry and said  well  I'll have to work here for a while  do something. That's when I designed all those computer products. And I said  I want to do this for four years  make some money  like I was having a family  and I would mature a bit  and maybe the business of neuroscience would mature a bit. Well  it took longer than four years. It's been about    years. But I'm doing it now  and I'm going to tell you about it. So why should we have a good brain theory  Well  there's lots of reasons people do science. One is    the most basic one is    people like to know things. We're curious  and we just go out and get knowledge  you know  Why do we study ants  Well  it's interesting. Maybe we'll learn something really useful about it  but it's interesting and fascinating. But sometimes  a science has some other attributes which makes it really  really interesting. Sometimes a science will tell something about ourselves  it'll tell us who we are. Rarely  you know  evolution did this and Copernicus did this  where we have a new understanding of who we are. And after all  we are our brains. My brain is talking to your brain. Our bodies are hanging along for the ride  but my brain is talking to your brain. And if we want to understand who we are and how we feel and perceive  we really understand what brains are. Another thing is sometimes science leads to really big societal benefits and technologies  or businesses  or whatever  that come out of it. And this is one  too  because when we understand how brains work  we're going to be able to build intelligent machines  and I think that's actually a good thing on the whole  and it's going to have tremendous benefits to society  just like a fundamental technology. So why don't we have a good theory of brains  And people have been working on it for     years. Well  let's first take a look at what normal science looks like. This is normal science. Normal science is a nice balance between theory and experimentalists. And so the theorist guys say  well  I think this is what's going on  and the experimentalist says  no  you're wrong. And it goes back and forth  you know  This works in physics. This works in geology. But if this is normal science  what does neuroscience look like  This is what neuroscience looks like. We have this mountain of data  which is anatomy  physiology and behavior. You can't imagine how much detail we know about brains. There were        people who went to the neuroscience conference this year  and every one of them is doing research in brains. A lot of data. But there's no theory. There's a little  wimpy box on top there. And theory has not played a role in any sort of grand way in the neurosciences. And it's a real shame. Now why has this come about  If you ask neuroscientists  why is this the state of affair  they'll first of all admit it. But if you ask them  they'll say  well  there's various reasons we don't have a good brain theory. Some people say  well  we don't still have enough data  we need to get more information  there's all these things we don't know. Well  I just told you there's so much data coming out your ears. We have so much information  we don't even know how to begin to organize it. What good is more going to do  Maybe we'll be lucky and discover some magic thing  but I don't think so. This is actually a symptom of the fact that we just don't have a theory. We don't need more data    we need a good theory about it. Another one is sometimes people say  well  brains are so complex  it'll take another    years. I even think Chris said something like this yesterday. I'm not sure what you said  Chris  but something like  well  it's one of the most complicated things in the universe. That's not true. You're more complicated than your brain. You've got a brain. And it's also  although the brain looks very complicated  things look complicated until you understand them. That's always been the case. And so all we can say  well  my neocortex  which is the part of the brain I'm interested in  has    billion cells. But  you know what  It's very  very regular. In fact  it looks like it's the same thing repeated over and over and over again. It's not as complex as it looks. That's not the issue. Some people say  brains can't understand brains. Very Zen like. Whoo.  Laughter  You know  it sounds good  but why  I mean  what's the point  It's just a bunch of cells. You understand your liver. It's got a lot of cells in it too  right  So  you know  I don't think there's anything to that. And finally  some people say  well  you know  I don't feel like a bunch of cells  you know. I'm conscious. I've got this experience  I'm in the world  you know. I can't be just a bunch of cells. Well  you know  people used to believe there was a life force to be living  and we now know that's really not true at all. And there's really no evidence that says    well  other than people just have disbelief that cells can do what they do. And so  if some people have fallen into the pit of metaphysical dualism  some really smart people  too  but we can reject all that. No  I'm going to tell you there's something else  and it's really fundamental  and this is what it is  there's another reason why we don't have a good brain theory  and it's because we have an intuitive  strongly held  but incorrect assumption that has prevented us from seeing the answer. There's something we believe that just  it's obvious  but it's wrong. Now  there's a history of this in science and before I tell you what it is  I'm going to tell you a bit about the history of it in science. You look at some other scientific revolutions  and this case  I'm talking about the solar system  that's Copernicus  Darwin's evolution  and tectonic plates  that's Wegener. They all have a lot in common with brain science. First of all  they had a lot of unexplained data. A lot of it. But it got more manageable once they had a theory. The best minds were stumped    really  really smart people. We're not smarter now than they were then. It just turns out it's really hard to think of things  but once you've thought of them  it's kind of easy to understand it. My daughters understood these three theories in their basic framework by the time they were in kindergarten. And now it's not that hard  you know  here's the apple  here's the orange  you know  the Earth goes around  that kind of stuff. Finally  another thing is the answer was there all along  but we kind of ignored it because of this obvious thing  and that's the thing. It was an intuitive  strong held belief that was wrong. In the case of the solar system  the idea that the Earth is spinning and the surface of the Earth is going like a thousand miles an hour  and the Earth is going through the solar system about a million miles an hour. This is lunacy. We all know the Earth isn't moving. Do you feel like you're moving a thousand miles an hour  Of course not. You know  and someone who said  well  it was spinning around in space and it's so huge  they would lock you up  and that's what they did back then. So it was intuitive and obvious. Now what about evolution  Evolution's the same thing. We taught our kids  well  the Bible says  you know  God created all these species  cats are cats  dogs are dogs  people are people  plants are plants  they don't change. Noah put them on the Ark in that order  blah  blah  blah. And  you know  the fact is  if you believe in evolution  we all have a common ancestor  and we all have a common ancestry with the plant in the lobby. This is what evolution tells us. And  it's true. It's kind of unbelievable. And the same thing about tectonic plates  you know  All the mountains and the continents are kind of floating around on top of the Earth  you know  It's like  it doesn't make any sense. So what is the intuitive  but incorrect assumption  that's kept us from understanding brains  Now I'm going to tell it to you  and it's going to seem obvious that that is correct  and that's the point  right  Then I'm going to have to make an argument why you're incorrect about the other assumption. The intuitive but obvious thing is that somehow intelligence is defined by behavior  that we are intelligent because of the way that we do things and the way we behave intelligently  and I'm going to tell you that's wrong. What it is is intelligence is defined by prediction. And I'm going to work you through this in a few slides here  give you an example of what this means. Here's a system. Engineers like to look at systems like this. Scientists like to look at systems like this. They say  well  we have a thing in a box  and we have its inputs and its outputs. The AI people said  well  the thing in the box is a programmable computer because that's equivalent to a brain  and we'll feed it some inputs and we'll get it to do something  have some behavior. And Alan Turing defined the Turing test  which is essentially saying  we'll know if something's intelligent if it behaves identical to a human. A behavioral metric of what intelligence is  and this has stuck in our minds for a long period of time. Reality though  I call it real intelligence. Real intelligence is built on something else. We experience the world through a sequence of patterns  and we store them  and we recall them. And when we recall them  we match them up against reality  and we're making predictions all the time. It's an eternal metric. There's an eternal metric about us sort of saying  do we understand the world  Am I making predictions  And so on. You're all being intelligent right now  but you're not doing anything. Maybe you're scratching yourself  or picking your nose  I don't know  but you're not doing anything right now  but you're being intelligent  you're understanding what I'm saying. Because you're intelligent and you speak English  you know what word is at the end of this     Silence  sentence. The word came into you  and you're making these predictions all the time. And then  what I'm saying is  is that the eternal prediction is the output in the neocortex. And that somehow  prediction leads to intelligent behavior. And here's how that happens. Let's start with a non intelligent brain. Well I'll argue a non intelligent brain  we got hold of an old brain  and we're going to say it's like a non mammal  like a reptile  so I'll say  an alligator  we have an alligator. And the alligator has some very sophisticated senses. It's got good eyes and ears and touch senses and so on  a mouth and a nose. It has very complex behavior. It can run and hide. It has fears and emotions. It can eat you  you know. It can attack. It can do all kinds of stuff. But we don't consider the alligator very intelligent  not like in a human sort of way. But it has all this complex behavior already. Now  in evolution  what happened  First thing that happened in evolution with mammals  we started to develop a thing called the neocortex. And I'm going to represent the neocortex here  by this box that's sticking on top of the old brain. Neocortex means new layer. It is a new layer on top of your brain. If you don't know it  it's the wrinkly thing on the top of your head that  it's got wrinkly because it got shoved in there and doesn't fit. No  really  that's what it is. It's about the size of a table napkin. And it doesn't fit  so it gets all wrinkly. Now look at how I've drawn this here. The old brain is still there. You still have that alligator brain. You do. It's your emotional brain. It's all those things  and all those gut reactions you have. And on top of it  we have this memory system called the neocortex. And the memory system is sitting over the sensory part of the brain. And so as the sensory input comes in and feeds from the old brain  it also goes up into the neocortex. And the neocortex is just memorizing. It's sitting there saying  ah  I'm going to memorize all the things that are going on  where I've been  people I've seen  things I've heard  and so on. And in the future  when it sees something similar to that again  so in a similar environment  or the exact same environment  it'll play it back. It'll start playing it back. Oh  I've been here before. And when you've been here before  this happened next. It allows you to predict the future. It allows you to  literally it feeds back the signals into your brain  they'll let you see what's going to happen next  will let you hear the word  sentence  before I said it. And it's this feeding back into the old brain that'll allow you to make very more intelligent decisions. This is the most important slide of my talk  so I'll dwell on it a little bit. And so  all the time you say  oh  I can predict the things. And if you're a rat and you go through a maze  and then you learn the maze  the next time you're in a maze  you have the same behavior  but all of a sudden  you're smarter because you say  oh  I recognize this maze  I know which way to go  I've been here before  I can envision the future. And that's what it's doing. In humans    by the way  this is true for all mammals  it's true for other mammals    and in humans  it got a lot worse. In humans  we actually developed the front part of the neocortex called the anterior part of the neocortex. And nature did a little trick. It copied the posterior part  the back part  which is sensory  and put it in the front part. And humans uniquely have the same mechanism on the front  but we use it for motor control. So we are now able to make very sophisticated motor planning  things like that. I don't have time to get into all this  but if you want to understand how a brain works  you have to understand how the first part of the mammalian neocortex works  how it is we store patterns and make predictions. So let me give you a few examples of predictions. I already said the word  sentence.  In music  if you've heard a song before  if you heard Jill sing those songs before  when she sings them  the next note pops into your head already    you anticipate it as you're going. If it was an album of music  the end of one album  the next song pops into your head. And these things happen all the time. You're making these predictions. I have this thing called the altered door thought experiment. And the altered door thought experiment says  you have a door at home  and when you're here  I'm changing it  I've got a guy back at your house right now  moving the door around  and they're going to take your doorknob and move it over two inches. And when you go home tonight  you're going to put your hand out there  and you're going to reach for the doorknob and you're going to notice it's in the wrong spot  and you'll go  whoa  something happened. It may take a second to figure out what it was  but something happened. Now I could change your doorknob in other ways. I can make it larger or smaller  I can change its brass to silver  I could make it a lever. I can change your door  put colors on  I can put windows in. I can change a thousand things about your door  and in the two seconds you take to open your door  you're going to notice that something has changed. Now  the engineering approach to this  the AI approach to this  is to build a door database. It has all the door attributes. And as you go up to the door  you know  let's check them off one at time. Door  door  door  you know  color  you know what I'm saying. We don't do that. Your brain doesn't do that. What your brain is doing is making constant predictions all the time about what is going to happen in your environment. As I put my hand on this table  I expect to feel it stop. When I walk  every step  if I missed it by an eighth of an inch  I'll know something has changed. You're constantly making predictions about your environment. I'll talk about vision here briefly. This is a picture of a woman. And when you look at people  your eyes are caught over at two to three times a second. You're not aware of this  but your eyes are always moving. And so when you look at someone's face  you'd typically go from eye to eye to eye to nose to mouth. Now  when your eye moves from eye to eye  if there was something else there like  a nose  you'd see a nose where an eye is supposed to be  and you'd go  oh shit  you know    There's something wrong about this person. And that's because you're making a prediction. It's not like you just look over there and say  what am I seeing now  A nose  that's okay. No  you have an expectation of what you're going to see. Every single moment. And finally  let's think about how we test intelligence. We test it by prediction. What is the next word in this  you know  This is to this as this is to this. What is the next number in this sentence  Here's three visions of an object. What's the fourth one  That's how we test it. It's all about prediction. So what is the recipe for brain theory  First of all  we have to have the right framework. And the framework is a memory framework  not a computation or behavior framework. It's a memory framework. How do you store and recall these sequences or patterns  It's spatio temporal patterns. Then  if in that framework  you take a bunch of theoreticians. Now biologists generally are not good theoreticians. It's not always true  but in general  there's not a good history of theory in biology. So I found the best people to work with are physicists  engineers and mathematicians  who tend to think algorithmically. Then they have to learn the anatomy  and they've got to learn the physiology. You have to make these theories very realistic in anatomical terms. Anyone who gets up and tells you their theory about how the brain works and doesn't tell you exactly how it's working in the brain and how the wiring works in the brain  it is not a theory. And that's what we're doing at the Redwood Neuroscience Institute. I would love to have more time to tell you we're making fantastic progress in this thing  and I expect to be back up on this stage  maybe this will be some other time in the not too distant future and tell you about it. I'm really  really excited. This is not going to take    years at all. So what will brain theory look like  First of all  it's going to be a theory about memory. Not like computer memory. It's not at all like computer memory. It's very  very different. And it's a memory of these very high dimensional patterns  like the things that come from your eyes. It's also memory of sequences. You cannot learn or recall anything outside of a sequence. A song must be heard in sequence over time  and you must play it back in sequence over time. And these sequences are auto associatively recalled  so if I see something  I hear something  it reminds me of it  and then it plays back automatically. It's an automatic playback. And prediction of future inputs is the desired output. And as I said  the theory must be biologically accurate  it must be testable  and you must be able to build it. If you don't build it  you don't understand it. So  one more slide here. What is this going to result in  Are we going to really build intelligent machines  Absolutely. And it's going to be different than people think. No doubt that it's going to happen  in my mind. First of all  it's going to be built up  we're going to build the stuff out of silicon. The same techniques we use for building silicon computer memories  we can use for here. But they're very different types of memories. And we're going to attach these memories to sensors  and the sensors will experience real live  real world data  and these things are going to learn about their environment. Now it's very unlikely the first things you're going to see are like robots. Not that robots aren't useful and people can build robots. But the robotics part is the hardest part. That's the old brain. That's really hard. The new brain is actually kind of easier than the old brain. So the first thing we're going to do are the things that don't require a lot of robotics. So you're not going to see C  PO. You're going to more see things like  you know  intelligent cars that really understand what traffic is and what driving is and have learned that certain types of cars with the blinkers on for half a minute probably aren't going to turn  things like that. We can also do intelligent security systems. Anywhere where we're basically using our brain  but not doing a lot of mechanics. Those are the things that are going to happen first. But ultimately  the world's the limit here. I don't know how this is going to turn out. I know a lot of people who invented the microprocessor and if you talk to them  they knew what they were doing was really significant  but they didn't really know what was going to happen. They couldn't anticipate cell phones and the Internet and all this kind of stuff. They just knew like  hey  they were going to build calculators and traffic light controllers. But it's going to be big. In the same way  this is like brain science and these memories are going to be a very fundamental technology  and it's going to lead to very unbelievable changes in the next     years. And I'm most excited about how we're going to use them in science. So I think that's all my time  I'm over it  and I'm going to end my talk right there. I'd like to start tonight by something completely different  asking you to join me by stepping off the land and jumping into the open ocean for a moment.    percent of the living space on the planet is in the open ocean  and it's where life    the title of our seminar tonight    it's where life began. And it's a lively and a lovely place  but we're rapidly changing the oceans with our    not only with our overfishing  our irresponsible fishing  our adding of pollutants like fertilizer from our cropland  but also  most recently  with climate change  and Steve Schneider  I'm sure  will be going into greater detail on this. Now  as we continue to tinker with the oceans  more and more reports are predicting that the kinds of seas that we're creating will be conducive to low energy type of animals  like jellyfish and bacteria. And this might be the kind of seas we're headed for. Now jellyfish are strangely hypnotic and beautiful  and you'll see lots of gorgeous ones at the aquarium on Friday  but they sting like hell  and jellyfish sushi and sashimi is just not going to fill you up. About     grams of jellyfish equals four calories. So it may be good for the waistline  but it probably won't keep you satiated for very long. And a sea that's just filled and teeming with jellyfish isn't very good for all the other creatures that live in the oceans  that is  unless you eat jellyfish. And this is this voracious predator launching a sneak attack on this poor little unsuspecting jellyfish there  a by the wind sailor. And that predator is the giant ocean sunfish  the Mola mola  whose primary prey are jellyfish. This animal is in  The Guinness World Book of Records  for being the world's heaviest bony fish. It reaches up to almost       pounds    on a diet of jellyfish  primarily. And I think it's kind of a nice little cosmological convergence here that the Mola mola    its common name is sunfish    that its favorite food is the moon jelly. So it's kind of nice  the sun and the moon getting together this way  even if one is eating the other. Now this is typically how you see sunfish  this is where they get their common name. They like to sunbathe  can't blame them. They just lay out on the surface of the sea and most people think they're sick or lazy  but that's a typical behavior  they lie out and bask on the surface. Their other name  Mola mola  is    it sounds Hawaiian  but it's actually Latin for millstone  and that's attributable to their roundish  very bizarre  cut off shape. It's as if  as they were growing  they just forgot the tail part. And that's actually what drew me to the Mola in the first place  was this terribly bizarre shape. You know  you look at sharks  and they're streamlined  and they're sleek  and you look at tuna  and they're like torpedoes    they just give away their agenda. They're about migration and strength  and then you look at the sunfish. And this is just so elegantly mysterious  it's just    it really kind of holds its cards a lot tighter than say  a tuna. So I was just intrigued with what    you know  what is this animal's story  Well  as with anything in biology  nothing really makes sense except in the light of evolution. The Mola's no exception. They appeared shortly after the dinosaurs disappeared     million years ago  at a time when whales still had legs  and they come from a rebellious little puffer fish faction    oblige me a little Kipling esque storytelling here. Of course evolution is somewhat random  and you know  about    million years ago there was this rebellious little puffer fish faction that said  oh  the heck with the coral reefs    we're going to head to the high seas. And lots of generations  lots of tweaking and torquing  and we turn our puffer into the Mola. You know  if you give Mother Nature enough time  that is what she will produce. They look    maybe they look kind of prehistoric and unfinished  abridged perhaps  but in fact  in fact they are the    they vie for the top position of the most evolutionarily derived fish in the sea  right up there with flat fish. They're    every single thing about that fish has been changed. And in terms of fishes    fishes appeared     million years ago  and they're pretty modern  just    million years ago  so    so interestingly  they give away their ancestry as they develop. They start as little eggs  and they're in  The Guinness World Book of Records  again for having the most number of eggs of any vertebrate on the planet. A single four foot female had     million eggs  can carry     million eggs in her ovaries    imagine    and they get to be over    feet long. Imagine what a    foot one has. And from that little egg  they pass through this spiky little porcupine fish stage  reminiscent of their ancestry  and develop    this is their little adolescent stage. They school as adolescents  and become behemoth loners as adults. That's a little diver up there in the corner. They're in  The Guinness World Book of Records  again for being the vertebrate growth champion of the world. From their little hatching size of their egg  into their little larval stage till they reach adulthood  they put on     million times an increase in weight.     million. Now imagine if you gave birth to a little baby  and you had to feed this thing. That would mean that your child  you would expect it to gain the weight of six Titanics. Now I don't know how you'd feed a child like that but    we don't know how fast the Molas grow in the wild  but captive growth studies at the Monterey Bay Aquarium    one of the first places to have them in captivity    they had one that gained     lbs in    months. I said  now  that's a true American. So being a loner is a great thing  especially in today's seas  because schooling used to be salvation for fishes  but it's suicide for fishes now. But unfortunately Molas  even though they don't school  they still get caught in nets as by catch. If we're going to save the world from total jellyfish domination  then we've got to figure out what the jellyfish predators    how they live their lives  like the Mola. And unfortunately  they make up a large portion of the California by catch    up to    percent of the drift net. And in the Mediterranean  in the swordfish net fisheries  they make up up to    percent. So we've got to figure out how they're living their lives. And how do you do that  How do you do that with an animal    very few places in the world. This is an open ocean creature. It knows no boundaries    it doesn't go to land. How do you get insight  How do you seduce an open ocean creature like that to spill its secrets  Well  there's some great new technology that has just recently become available  and it's just a boon for getting insight into open ocean animals. And it's pictured right here  that little tag up there. That little tag can record temperature  depth and light intensity  which is correlated with time  and from that we can get locations. And it can record this data for up to two years  and keep it in that tag  release at a pre programmed time  float to the surface  upload all that data  that whole travelogue  to satellite  which relays it directly to our computers  and we've got that whole dataset. And we didn't even have    we just had to tag the animal and then we went home and you know  sat at our desks. So the great thing about the Mola is that when we put the tag on them    if you look up here    that's streaming off  that's right where we put the tag. And it just so happens that's a parasite hanging off the Mola. Molas are infamous for carrying tons of parasites. They're just parasite hotels  even their parasites have parasites. I think Donne wrote a poem about that. But they have    genera of parasites  and so we figured just one more parasite won't be too much of a problem. And they happen to be a very good vehicle for carrying oceanographic equipment. They don't seem to mind  so far. So what are we trying to find out  We're focusing on the Pacific. We're tagging on the California coast  and we're tagging over in Taiwan and Japan. And we're interested in how these animals are using the currents  using temperature  using the open ocean  to live their lives. We'd love to tag in Monterey. Monterey is one of the few places in the world where Molas come in large numbers. Not this time of year    it's more around October. And we'd love to tag here    this is an aerial shot of Monterey    but unfortunately  the Molas here end up looking like this because another one of our locals really likes Molas but in the wrong way. The California sea lion takes the Molas as soon as they come into the bay  rips off their fins  fashions them into the ultimate Frisbee  Mola style  and then tosses them back and forth. And I'm not exaggerating  it is just    and sometimes they don't eat them  it's just spiteful. And you know  the locals think it's terrible behavior  it's just horrible watching this happen  day after day. The poor little Molas coming in  getting ripped to shreds  so we head down south  to San Diego. Not so many California sea lions down there. And the Molas there  you can find them with a spotter plane very easily  and they like to hang out under floating rafts of kelp. And under those kelps    this is why the Molas come there because it's spa time for the Molas there. As soon as they get under those rafts of kelp  the exfoliating cleaner fish come. And they come and give the Molas    you can see they strike this funny little position that says   I'm not threatening  but I need a massage.  And they'll put their fins out and their eyes go in the back of their head  and the fish come up and they just clean  clean  clean    because the Molas  you know  there's just a smorgasbord of parasites. And it's also a great place to go down south because the water's warmer  and the Molas are kind of friendly down there. I mean what other kind of fish  if you approach it right  will say   Okay  scratch me right there.  You truly can swim up to a Mola    they're very gentle    and if you approach them right  you can give them a scratch and they enjoy it. So we've also tagged one part of the Pacific  we've gone over to another part of the Pacific  and we've tagged in Taiwan  and we tagged in Japan. And over in these places  the Molas are caught in set nets that line these countries. And they're not thrown back as by catch  they're eaten. We were served a nine course meal of Mola after we tagged. Well  not the one we tagged  And everything from the kidney  to the testes  to the back bone  to the fin muscle to    I think that  s pretty much the whole fish    is eaten. So the hardest part of tagging  now  is after you put that tag on  you have to wait  months. And you're just wondering  oh  I hope the fish is safe  I hope  I hope it's going to be able to actually live its life out during the course that the tag is recording. The tags cost      dollars each  and then satellite time is another     dollars  so you're like  oh  I hope the tag is okay. And so the waiting is really the hardest part. I'm going to show you our latest dataset. And it hasn't been published  so it's totally privy information just for TED. And in showing you this  you know  when we're looking at this data  we're thinking  oh do these animals  do they cross the equator  Do they go from one side of the Pacific to the other  And we found that they kind of are homebodies. They're not big migrators. This is their track  we deployed the tag off of Tokyo  and the Mola in one month kind of got into the Kuroshio Current off of Japan and foraged there. And after four months  went up  you know  off of the north part of Japan. And that's kind of their home range. Now that's important  though  because if there's a lot of fishing pressure  that population doesn't get replenished. So that's a very important piece of data. But also what's important is that they're not slacker  lazy fish. They're super industrious. And this is a day in the life of a Mola  and if we    they're up and down  and up and down  and up and down  and up and up and down  up to    times a day. As the sun comes up  you see in the blue  they start their dive. Down    and as the sun gets brighter they go a little deeper  little deeper. They plumb the depths down to     meters  in temperatures to one degree centigrade  and this is why you see them on the surface    it's so cold down there. They've got to come up  warm  get that solar power  and then plunge back into the depths  and go up and down and up and down. And they're hitting a layer down there  it's called the deep scattering layer    which a whole variety of food's in that layer. So rather than just being some sunbathing slacker  they're really very industrious fish that dance this wild dance between the surface and the bottom and through temperature. We see the same pattern    now with these tags we're seeing a similar pattern for swordfishes  manta rays  tunas  a real three dimensional play. This is part of a much larger program called the Census of Marine Life  where they're going to be tagging all over the world and the Mola's going to enter into that. And what's exciting    you all travel  and you know the best thing about traveling is to be able to find the locals  and to find the great places by getting the local knowledge. Well now with the Census of Marine Life  we'll be able to sidle up to all the locals and explore    percent of our living space  with local knowledge. It's never    it's really never been a more exciting  or a vital time  to be a biologist. Which brings me to my last point  and what I think is kind of the most fun. I set up a website because I was getting so many questions about Molas and sunfish. And so I just figured I'd have the questions answered  and I'd be able to thank my funders  like National Geographic and Lindbergh. But people would write into the site with all sorts of  all sorts of stories about these animals and wanting to help me get samples for genetic analysis. And what I found most exciting is that everyone had a shared    a shared love and an interest in the oceans. I was getting reports from Catholic nuns  Jewish Rabbis  Muslims  Christians    everybody writing in  united by their love of life. And to me that    I don't think I could say it any better than the immortal Bard himself   One touch of nature makes the whole world kin.  And sure  it may be just one big old silly fish  but it's helping. If it's helping to unite the world  I think it's definitely the fish of the future. What I'm going to show you first  as quickly as I can  is some foundational work  some new technology that we brought to Microsoft as part of an acquisition almost exactly a year ago. This is Seadragon  and it's an environment in which you can either locally or remotely interact with vast amounts of visual data. We're looking at many  many gigabytes of digital photos here and kind of seamlessly and continuously zooming in  panning through it  rearranging it in any way we want. And it doesn't matter how much information we're looking at  how big these collections are or how big the images are. Most of them are ordinary digital camera photos  but this one  for example  is a scan from the Library of Congress  and it's in the     megapixel range. It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that ought to limit the performance of a system like this one is the number of pixels on your screen at any given moment. It's also very flexible architecture. This is an entire book  so this is an example of non image data. This is  Bleak House  by Dickens. Every column is a chapter. To prove to you that it's really text  and not an image  we can do something like so  to really show that this is a real representation of the text  it's not a picture. Maybe this is an artificial way to read an e book. I wouldn't recommend it. This is a more realistic case  an issue of The Guardian. Every large image is the beginning of a section. And this really gives you the joy and the good experience of reading the real paper version of a magazine or a newspaper  which is an inherently multi scale kind of medium. We've done something with the corner of this particular issue of The Guardian. We've made up a fake ad that's very high resolution    much higher than in an ordinary ad    and we've embedded extra content. If you want to see the features of this car  you can see it here. Or other models  or even technical specifications. And this really gets at some of these ideas about really doing away with those limits on screen real estate. We hope that this means no more pop ups and other rubbish like that    shouldn't be necessary. Of course  mapping is one of those obvious applications for a technology like this. And this one I really won't spend any time on  except to say that we have things to contribute to this field as well. But those are all the roads in the U.S. superimposed on top of a NASA geospatial image. So let's pull up  now  something else. This is actually live on the Web now  you can go check it out. This is a project called Photosynth  which marries two different technologies. One of them is Seadragon and the other is some very beautiful computer vision research done by Noah Snavely  a graduate student at the University of Washington  co advised by Steve Seitz at U.W. and Rick Szeliski at Microsoft Research. A very nice collaboration. And so this is live on the Web. It's powered by Seadragon. You can see that when we do these sorts of views  where we can dive through images and have this kind of multi resolution experience. But the spatial arrangement of the images here is actually meaningful. The computer vision algorithms have registered these images together so that they correspond to the real space in which these shots    all taken near Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies    all these shots were taken. So you see elements here of stabilized slide show or panoramic imaging  and these things have all been related spatially. I'm not sure if I have time to show you any other environments. Some are much more spatial. I would like to jump straight to one of Noah's original data sets    this is from an early prototype that we first got working this summer    to show you what I think is really the punch line behind the Photosynth technology  It's not necessarily so apparent from looking at the environments we've put up on the website. We had to worry about the lawyers and so on. This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame Cathedral that was done entirely computationally from images scraped from Flickr. You just type Notre Dame into Flickr  and you get some pictures of guys in T shirts  and of the campus and so on. And each of these orange cones represents an image that was discovered to belong to this model. And so these are all Flickr images  and they've all been related spatially in this way. We can just navigate in this very simple way. You know  I never thought that I'd end up working at Microsoft. It's very gratifying to have this kind of reception here. I guess you can see this is lots of different types of cameras  it's everything from cell phone cameras to professional SLRs  quite a large number of them  stitched together in this environment. If I can find some of the sort of weird ones    So many of them are occluded by faces  and so on. Somewhere in here there is actually a series of photographs    here we go. This is actually a poster of Notre Dame that registered correctly. We can dive in from the poster to a physical view of this environment. What the point here really is is that we can do things with the social environment. This is now taking data from everybody    from the entire collective memory  visually  of what the Earth looks like    and link all of that together. Those photos become linked  and they make something emergent that's greater than the sum of the parts. You have a model that emerges of the entire Earth. Think of this as the long tail to Stephen Lawler's Virtual Earth work. And this is something that grows in complexity as people use it  and whose benefits become greater to the users as they use it. Their own photos are getting tagged with meta data that somebody else entered. If somebody bothered to tag all of these saints and say who they all are  then my photo of Notre Dame Cathedral suddenly gets enriched with all of that data  and I can use it as an entry point to dive into that space  into that meta verse  using everybody else's photos  and do a kind of a cross modal and cross user social experience that way. And of course  a by product of all of that is immensely rich virtual models of every interesting part of the Earth  collected not just from overhead flights and from satellite images and so on  but from the collective memory. Thank you so much. Chris Anderson  Do I understand this right  What your software is going to allow  is that at some point  really within the next few years  all the pictures that are shared by anyone across the world are going to link together  BAA  Yes. What this is really doing is discovering  creating hyperlinks  if you will  between images. It's doing that based on the content inside the images. And that gets really exciting when you think about the richness of the semantic information a lot of images have. Like when you do a web search for images  you type in phrases  and the text on the web page is carrying a lot of information about what that picture is of. What if that picture links to all of your pictures  The amount of semantic interconnection and richness that comes out of that is really huge. It's a classic network effect. CA  Truly incredible. Congratulations. I'm really scared. I don't think we're going to make it. Probably by now most of you have seen Al Gore's amazing talk. Shortly after I saw that  we had some friends over for dinner with the family. The conversation turned to global warming  and everybody agreed  there's a real problem. We've got a climate crisis. So  we went around the table to talk about what we should do. The conversation came to my    year old daughter  Mary. She said   I agree with everything that's been said. I'm scared and I'm angry.  And then she turned to me and said   Dad  your generation created this problem  you'd better fix it.  Wow. All the conversation stopped. All the eyes turned to me. I didn't know what to say. Kleiner's second law is   There is a time when panic is the appropriate response.  And we've reached that time. We cannot afford to underestimate this problem. If we face irreversible and catastrophic consequences  we must act  and we must act decisively. I've got to tell you  for me  everything changed that evening. And so  my partners and I  we set off on this mission to learn more  to try to do much more. So  we mobilized. We got on airplanes. We went to Brazil. We went to China and to India  to Bentonville  Arkansas  to Washington  D.C. and to Sacramento. And so  what I'd like to do now is to tell you about what we've learned in those journeys. Because the more we learned  the more concerned we grew. You know  my partners at Kleiner and I were compulsive networkers  and so when we see a big problem or an opportunity like avian flu or personalized medicine  we just get together the smartest people we know. For this climate crisis  we assembled a network  really  of superstars  from policy activists to scientists and entrepreneurs and business leaders. Fifty or so of them. And so  I want to tell you about what we've learned in doing that and four lessons I've learned in the last year. The first lesson is that companies are really powerful  and that matters a lot. This is a story about how Wal Mart went green  and what that means. Two years ago  the CEO  Lee Scott  believed that green is the next big thing  and so Wal Mart made going green a top priority. They committed that they're going to take their existing stores and reduce their energy consumption by    percent  and their new stores by    percent  and do all that in seven years. The three biggest uses of energy in a store are heating and air conditioning  then lighting  and then refrigeration. So  look what they did. They painted the roofs of all their stores white. They put smart skylights through their stores so they could harvest the daylight and reduce the lighting demands. And  third  they put the refrigerated goods behind closed doors with LED lighting. I mean  why would you try to refrigerate a whole store  These are really simple  smart solutions based on existing technology. Why does Wal Mart matter  Well  it's massive. They're the largest private employer in America. They're the largest private user of electricity. They have the second largest vehicle fleet on the road. And they have one of the world's most amazing supply chains         suppliers. If Wal Mart were a country  it would be the sixth largest trading partner with China. And maybe most important  they have a big effect on other companies. When Wal Mart declares it's going to go green and be profitable  it has a powerful impact on other great institutions. So  let me tell you this  when Wal Mart achieves    percent energy reductions  that's going to be a very big deal. But I'm afraid it's not enough. We need Wal Mart and every other company to do the same. The second thing that we learned is that individuals matter  and they matter enormously. I've got another Wal Mart story for you  OK  Wal Mart has over     million U.S. customers. That's a third of the U.S. population.    million compact fluorescent light bulbs were sold last year. And Wal Mart has committed they're going to sell another     million light bulbs in the coming year. But it's not easy. Consumers don't really like these light bulbs. The light's kind of funny  they won't dim  takes a while for them to start up. But the pay off is really enormous.     million compact fluorescent light bulbs means that we'll save     million dollars in energy bills  and    million tons of CO  every year  year in and year out. It does seem really hard to get consumers to do the right thing. It is stupid that we use two tons of steel  glass and plastic to haul our sorry selves to the shopping mall. It's stupid that we put water in plastic bottles in Fiji and ship it here. It's hard to change consumer behavior because consumers don't know how much this stuff costs. Do you know  Do you know how much CO  you generated to drive here or fly here  I don't know  and I should. Those of us who care about all this would act better if we knew what the real costs were. But as long as we pretend that CO  is free  as long as these uses are nearly invisible  how can we expect change  I'm really afraid  because I think the kinds of changes we can reasonably expect from individuals are going to be clearly not enough. The third lesson we learned is that policy matters. It really matters. In fact  policy is paramount. I've got a behind the scenes story for you about that green tech network I described. At the end of our first meeting  we got together to talk about what the action items would be  how we'd follow up. And Bob Epstein raised a hand. He stood up. You know  Bob's that Berkeley techie type who started Sybase. Well  Bob said the most important thing we could do right now is to make it clear in Sacramento  California that we need a market based system of mandates that's going to cap and reduce greenhouse gases in California. It's necessary and  just as important  it's good for the California economy. So  eight of us went to Sacramento in August and we met with the seven undecided legislators and we lobbied for AB  . You know what  Six of those seven voted yes in favor of the bill  so it passed  and it passed by a vote of    to   . Please. Thank you. I think it's the most important legislation of     . Why  Because California was the first state in this country to mandate    percent reduction of greenhouse gases by     . And the result of that is  we're going to generate        new jobs  four billion dollars a year in annual income  and reduce the CO  emissions by     million tons a year. California emits only seven percent of U.S. CO  emissions. It's only a percent and a half of the country's CO  emissions. It's a great start  but I've got to tell you    where I started    I'm really afraid. In fact  I'm certain California's not enough. Here's a story about national policy that we could all learn from. You know Tom Friedman says   If you don't go  you don't know   Well  we went to Brazil to meet Dr. Jose Goldemberg. He's the father of the ethanol revolution. He told us that Brazil's government mandated that every gasoline station in the country would carry ethanol. And they mandated that their new vehicles would be flex fuel compatible  right  They'd run ethanol or ordinary gasoline. And so  here's what's happened in Brazil. They now have        ethanol pumps    this versus     in the U.S.  and a paltry two in California    and in three years their new car fleet has gone from four percent to    percent flex fuel. Compare that to the U.S.  five percent are flex fuel. And you know what  Most consumers who have them don't even know it. So  what's happened in Brazil is  they've replaced    percent of the gasoline consumed by their automotive fleet with ethanol. That's    billion dollars since      that they didn't ship to the Middle East. It's created a million jobs inside that country  and it's saved    million tons of CO . It's really substantial. That's    percent of the CO  emissions across their entire country. But Brazil's only  .  percent of the world's CO  emission. So  Brazil's ethanol miracle  I'm really afraid  is not enough. In fact  I'm afraid all of the best policies we have are not going to be enough. The fourth and final lesson we've learned is about the potential of radical innovation. So  I want to tell you about a tragic problem and a breakthrough technology. Every year a million and a half people die of a completely preventable disease. That's malaria.       people a day. All for want of two dollars' worth of medications that we can buy at the corner drugstore. Well  two dollars  two dollars is too much for Africa. So  a team of Berkeley researchers with    million dollars from the Gates Foundation is engineering  designing a radical new way to make the key ingredient  called artemisinin  and they're going to make that drug    times cheaper. And in doing so  they'll save a million lives    at least a million lives a year. A million lives. Their breakthrough technology is synthetic biology. This leverages millions of years of evolution by redesigning bugs to make really useful products. Now  what you do is  you get inside the microbe  you change its metabolic pathways  and you end up with a living chemical factory. Now  you may ask  John  what has this got to go with green and with climate crisis  Well  I'll tell you    a lot. We've now formed a company called Amyris  and this technology that they're using can be used to make better biofuels. Don't let me skip over that. Better biofuels are a really big deal. That means we can precisely engineer the molecules in the fuel chain and optimize them along the way. So  if all goes well  they're going to have designer bugs in warm vats that are eating and digesting sugars to excrete better biofuels. I guess that's better living through bugs. Alan Kay is famous for saying the best way to predict the future is to invent it. And  of course  at Kleiner we  kind of  apologize and say the second best way is to finance it. And that's why we're investing     million dollars in a wide range of really disruptive new technologies for innovation in green technologies. And we're encouraging others to do it as well. We're talking a lot about this. In       there were     million dollars invested in new technologies of the sort you see here. It doubled in      to  .  billion dollars. But I'm really afraid we need much  much more. For reference  fact one  Exxon's revenues in      were a billion dollars a day. Do you know  they only invested  .  percent of revenues in R D  Second fact  the President's new budget for renewable energy is barely a billion dollars in total. Less than one day of Exxon's revenues. Third fact  I bet you didn't know that there's enough energy in hot rocks under the country to supply America's energy needs for the next thousand years. And the federal budget calls for a measly    million dollars of R D in geothermal energy. It is almost criminal that we are not investing more in energy research in this country. And I am really afraid that it's absolutely not enough. So  in a year's worth of learning we found a bunch of surprises. Who would have thought that a mass retailer could make money by going green  Who would have thought that a database entrepreneur could transform California with legislation  Who would have thought that the ethanol biofuel miracle would come from a developing country in South America  And who would have thought that scientists trying to cure malaria could come up with breakthroughs in biofuels  And who would have thought that all that is not enough  Not enough to stabilize the climate. Not enough to keep the ice in Greenland from crashing into the ocean. The scientists tell us    and they're only guessing    that we've got to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by one half  and do it as fast as possible. Now  we may have the political will to do this in the U.S.  but I've got to tell you  we've got only one atmosphere  and so somehow we're going to have to find the political will to do this all around the world. The wild card in this deck is China. To size the problem  China's CO  emissions today are  .  gigatons  the U.S. is  . . Business as usual means we'll have    gigatons from China by     . That's about as much CO  as there is in the whole world. And if it's business as usual  we're going out of business. When I was in Davos  China's Mayor of Dalian was pressed about their CO  strategy  and he said the following   You know  Americans use seven times the CO  per capita as Chinese.  Then he asked   Why should China sacrifice our growth so that the West can continue to be profligate and stupid   Does anybody here have an answer for him  I don't. We've got to make this economic so that all people and all nations make the right outcome  the profitable outcome  and therefore the likely outcome. Energy's a six trillion dollar business worldwide. It is the mother of all markets. You remember that Internet  Well  I'll tell you what. Green technologies    going green    is bigger than the Internet. It could be the biggest economic opportunity of the   st century. Moreover  if we succeed  it's going to be the most important transformation for life on the planet since  as Bill Joy says  we went from methane to oxygen in the atmosphere. Now  here's the hard question  if the trajectory of all the world's companies and individuals and policies and innovation is not going to be enough  what are we going to do  I don't know. Everyone here cares about changing the world and has made a difference in that one way or another. So  our call to action    my call to you    is for you to make going green your next big thing  your gig. What can you do  You can personally get carbon neutral. Go to ClimateCrisis.org or CarbonCalculator.com and buy carbon credits. You could join other leaders in mandating  lobbying for mandated cap and trade in U.S. greenhouse gas reductions. There's six bills right now in Congress. Let's get one of them passed. And the most important thing you can do  I think  is to use your personal power and your Rolodex to lead your business  your institution  in going green. Do it like Wal Mart  get it to go green for its customers and its suppliers and for itself. Really think outside the box. Can you imagine what it would be like if Amazon or eBay or Google or Microsoft or Apple really went green and you caused that to happen  It could be bigger than Wal Mart. I can't wait to see what we TEDsters do about this crisis. And I really  really hope that we multiply all of our energy  all of our talent and all of our influence to solve this problem. Because if we do  I can look forward to the conversation I'm going to have with my daughter in    years. Thank you very much  Chris. Everybody who came up here said they were scared. I don't know if I'm scared  but this is my first time of addressing an audience like this. And I don't have any smart technology for you to look at. There are no slides  so you'll just have to be content with me. What I want to do this morning is share with you a couple of stories and talk about a different Africa. Already this morning there were some allusions to the Africa that you hear about all the time  the Africa of HIV AIDS  the Africa of malaria  the Africa of poverty  the Africa of conflict  and the Africa of disasters. While it is true that those things are going on  there's an Africa that you don't hear about very much. And sometimes I'm puzzled  and I ask myself why. This is the Africa that is changing  that Chris alluded to. This is the Africa of opportunity. This is the Africa where people want to take charge of their own futures and their own destinies. And this is the Africa where people are looking for partnerships to do this. That's what I want to talk about today. And I want to start by telling you a story about that change in Africa. On   th of September       Mr. Diepreye Alamieyeseigha  a governor of one of the oil rich states of Nigeria  was arrested by the London Metropolitan Police on a visit to London. He was arrested because there were transfers of eight million dollars that went into some dormant accounts that belonged to him and his family. This arrest occurred because there was cooperation between the London Metropolitan Police and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission of Nigeria    led by one of our most able and courageous people  Mr. Nuhu Ribadu. Alamieyeseigha was arraigned in London. Due to some slip ups  he managed to escape dressed as a woman and ran from London back to Nigeria where  according to our constitution  those in office as governors  president    as in many countries    have immunity and cannot be prosecuted. But what happened  people were so outraged by this behavior that it was possible for his state legislature to impeach him and get him out of office. Today  Alams    as we call him for short    is in jail. This is a story about the fact that people in Africa are no longer willing to tolerate corruption from their leaders. This is a story about the fact that people want their resources managed properly for their good  and not taken out to places where they'll benefit just a few of the elite. And therefore  when you hear about the corrupt Africa    corruption all the time    I want you to know that the people and the governments are trying hard to fight this in some of the countries  and that some successes are emerging. Does it mean the problem is over  The answer is no. There's still a long way to go  but that there's a will there. And that successes are being chalked up on this very important fight. So when you hear about corruption  don't just feel that nothing is being done about this    that you can't operate in any African country because of the overwhelming corruption. That is not the case. There's a will to fight  and in many countries  that fight is ongoing and is being won. In others  like mine  where there has been a long history of dictatorship in Nigeria  the fight is ongoing and we have a long way to go. But the truth of the matter is that this is going on. The results are showing  independent monitoring by the World Bank and other organizations show that in many instances the trend is downwards in terms of corruption  and governance is improving. A study by the Economic Commission for Africa showed a clear trend upwards in governance in    African countries. And let me say just one more thing before I leave this area of governance. That is that people talk about corruption  corruption. All the time when they talk about it you immediately think about Africa. That's the image  African countries. But let me say this  if Alams was able to export eight million dollars into an account in London    if the other people who had taken money  estimated at    to    billion now of developing countries' monies sitting abroad in the developed countries    if they're able to do this  what is that  Is that not corruption  In this country  if you receive stolen goods  are you not prosecuted  So when we talk about this kind of corruption  let us also think about what is happening on the other side of the globe    where the money's going and what can be done to stop it. I'm working on an initiative now  along with the World Bank  on asset recovery  trying to do what we can to get the monies that have been taken abroad    developing countries' moneys    to get that sent back. Because if we can get the    billion dollars sitting out there back  it may be far more for some of these countries than all the aid that is being put together. The second thing I want to talk about is the will for reform. Africans  after    they're tired  we're tired of being the subject of everybody's charity and care. We are grateful  but we know that we can take charge of our own destinies if we have the will to reform. And what is happening in many African countries now is a realization that no one can do it but us. We have to do it. We can invite partners who can support us  but we have to start. We have to reform our economies  change our leadership  become more democratic  be more open to change and to information. And this is what we started to do in one of the largest countries on the continent  Nigeria. In fact  if you're not in Nigeria  you're not in Africa. I want to tell you that. One in four sub Saharan Africans is Nigerian  and it has     million dynamic people    chaotic people    but very interesting people. You'll never be bored. What we started to do was to realize that we had to take charge and reform ourselves. And with the support of a leader who was willing  at the time  to do the reforms  we put forward a comprehensive reform program  which we developed ourselves. Not the International Monetary Fund. Not the World Bank  where I worked for    years and rose to be a vice president. No one can do it for you. You have to do it for yourself. We put together a program that would  one  get the state out of businesses it had nothing    it had no business being in. The state should not be in the business of producing goods and services because it's inefficient and incompetent. So we decided to privatize many of our enterprises. We    as a result  we decided to liberalize many of our markets. Can you believe that prior to this reform    which started at the end of       when I left Washington to go and take up the post of Finance Minister    we had a telecommunications company that was only able to develop       landlines in its entire    year history  Having a telephone in my country was a huge luxury. You couldn't get it. You had to bribe. You had to do everything to get your phone. When President Obasanjo supported and launched the liberalization of the telecommunications sector  we went from       landlines to    million GSM lines  and counting. Nigeria's telecoms market is the second fastest growing in the world  after China. We are getting investments of about a billion dollars a year in telecoms. And nobody knows  except a few smart people. The smartest one  first to come in  was the MTN company of South Africa. And in the three years that I was Finance Minister  they made an average of     million dollars profit per year.     million in a market    in a country that is a poor country  with an average per capita income just under     dollars per capita. So the market is there. When they kept this under wraps  but soon others got to know. Nigerians themselves began to develop some wireless telecommunications companies  and three or four others have come in. But there's a huge market out there  and people don't know about it  or they don't want to know. So privatization is one of the things we've done. The other thing we've also done is to manage our finances better. Because nobody's going to help you and support you if you're not managing your own finances well. And Nigeria  with the oil sector  had the reputation of being corrupt and not managing its own public finances well. So what did we try to do  We introduced a fiscal rule that de linked our budget from the oil price. Before we used to just budget on whatever oil we bring in  because oil is the biggest  most revenue earning sector in the economy     percent of our revenues come from oil. We de linked that  and once we did it  we began to budget at a price slightly lower than the oil price and save whatever was above that price. We didn't know we could pull it off  it was very controversial. But what it immediately did was that the volatility that had been present in terms of our economic development    where  even if oil prices were high  we would grow very fast. When they crashed  we crashed. And we could hardly even pay anything  any salaries  in the economy. That smoothened out. We were able to save  just before I left     billion dollars. Whereas    and this went to our reserves    when I arrived in       we had seven billion dollars in reserves. By the time I left  we had gone up to almost    billion dollars. And as we speak now  we have about    billion dollars in reserves due to proper management of our finances. And that shores up our economy  makes it stable. Our exchange rate that used to fluctuate all the time is now fairly stable and being managed so that business people have a predictability of prices in the economy. We brought inflation down from    percent to about    percent. And we had GDP grow from an average of  .  percent the previous decade to about  .  percent now. So all the changes and reforms we were able to make have shown up in results that are measurable in the economy. And what is more important  because we want to get away from oil and diversify    and there are so many opportunities in this one big country  as in many countries in Africa    what was remarkable is that much of this growth came not from the oil sector alone  but from non oil. Agriculture grew at better than eight percent. As telecoms sector grew  housing and construction  and I could go on and on. And this is to illustrate to you that once you get the macro economy straightened out  the opportunities in various other sectors are enormous. We have opportunities in agriculture  like I said. We have opportunities in solid minerals. We have a lot of minerals that no one has even invested in or explored. And we realized that without the proper legislation to make that possible  that wouldn't happen. So we've now got a mining code that is comparable with some of the best in the world. We have opportunities in housing and real estate. There was nothing in a country of     million people    no shopping malls as you know them here. This was an investment opportunity for someone that excited the imagination of people. And now  we have a situation in which the businesses in this mall are doing four times the turnover that they had projected. So  huge things in construction  real estate  mortgage markets. Financial services  we had    banks. Too many not doing their real business. We consolidated them from    to    banks by requiring that they increase their capital    share capital. And it went from about    million dollars to     million dollars. The banks    these banks are now consolidated  and that strengthening of the banking system has attracted a lot of investment from outside. Barclays Bank of the U.K. is bringing in     million. Standard Chartered has brought in     million. And I can go on. Dollars  on and on  into the system. We are doing the same with the insurance sector. So in financial services  a great deal of opportunity. In tourism  in many African countries  a great opportunity. And that's what many people know East Africa for  the wildlife  the elephants  and so on. But managing the tourism market in a way that can really benefit the people is very important. So what am I trying to say  I'm trying to tell you that there's a new wave on the continent. A new wave of openness and democratization in which  since       more than two thirds of African countries have had multi party democratic elections. Not all of them have been perfect  or will be  but the trend is very clear. I'm trying to tell you that since the past three years  the average rate of growth on the continent has moved from about  .  percent to about five percent per annum. This is better than the performance of many OECD countries. So it's clear that things are changing. Conflicts are down on the continent  from about    conflicts a decade ago  we are down to three or four conflicts    one of the most terrible  of course  of which is Darfur. And  you know  you have the neighborhood effect where if something is going on in one part of the continent  it looks like the entire continent is affected. But you should know that this continent is not    is a continent of many countries  not one country. And if we are down to three or four conflicts  it means that there are plenty of opportunities to invest in stable  growing  exciting economies where there's plenty of opportunity. And I want to just make one point about this investment. The best way to help Africans today is to help them to stand on their own feet. And the best way to do that is by helping create jobs. There's no issue with fighting malaria and putting money in that and saving children's lives. That's not what I'm saying. That is fine. But imagine the impact on a family  if the parents can be employed and make sure that their children go to school  that they can buy the drugs to fight the disease themselves. If we can invest in places where you yourselves make money whilst creating jobs and helping people stand on their own feet  isn't that a wonderful opportunity  Isn't that the way to go  And I want to say that some of the best people to invest in on the continent are the women. I have a CD here. I'm sorry that I didn't say anything on time. Otherwise  I would have liked you to have seen this. It says   Africa  Open for Business.  And this is a video that has actually won an award as the best documentary of the year. Understand that the woman who made it is going to be in Tanzania  where they're having the session in June. But it shows you Africans  and particularly African women  who against all odds have developed businesses  some of them world class. One of the women in this video  Adenike Ogunlesi  making children's clothes    which she started as a hobby and grew into a business. Mixing African materials  such as we have  with materials from elsewhere. So  she'll make a little pair of dungarees with corduroys  with African material mixed in. Very creative designs  has reached a stage where she even had an order from Wal Mart. For        pieces. So that shows you that we have people who are capable of doing. And the women are diligent. They are focused  they work hard. I could go on giving examples  Beatrice Gakuba of Rwanda  who opened up a flower business and is now exporting to the Dutch auction in Amsterdam each morning and is employing     other women and men to work with her. However  many of these are starved for capital to expand  because nobody believes outside of our countries that we can do what is necessary. Nobody thinks in terms of a market. Nobody thinks there's opportunity. But I'm standing here saying that those who miss the boat now  will miss it forever. So if you want to be in Africa  think about investing. Think about the Beatrices  think about the Adenikes of this world  who are doing incredible things  that are bringing them into the global economy  whilst at the same time making sure that their fellow men and women are employed  and that the children in those households get educated because their parents are earning adequate income. So I invite you to explore the opportunities. When you go to Tanzania  listen carefully  because I'm sure you will hear of the various openings that there will be for you to get involved in something that will do good for the continent  for the people and for yourselves. Thank you very much. So  I kind of believe that we're in like the  cave painting  era of computer interfaces. Like  they're very kind of    they don't go as deep or as emotionally engaging as they possibly could be and I'd like to change all that. Hit me. OK. So I mean  this is the kind of status quo interface  right  It's very flat  kind of rigid. And OK  so you could sex it up and like go to a much more lickable Mac  you know  but really it's the kind of same old crap we've had for the last  you know     years. Like I think we really put up with a lot of crap with our computers. I mean it's point and click  it's like the menus  icons  it's all the kind of same thing. And so one kind of information space that I take inspiration from is my real desk. It's so much more subtle  so much more visceral    you know  what's visible  what's not. And I'd like to bring that experience to the desktop. So I kind of have a    this is BumpTop. It's kind of like a new approach to desktop computing. So you can bump things    they're all physically  you know  manipulable and stuff. And instead of that point and click  it's like a push and pull  things collide as you'd expect them. Just like on my real desk  I can    let me just grab these guys    I can turn things into piles instead of just the folders that we have. And once things are in a pile I can browse them by throwing them into a grid  or you know  flip through them like a book or I can lay them out like a deck of cards. When they're laid out  I can pull things to new locations or delete things or just quickly sort a whole pile  you know  just immediately  right  And then  it's all smoothly animated  instead of these jarring changes you see in today's interfaces. Also  if I want to add something to a pile  well  how do I do that  I just toss it to the pile  and it's added right to the top. It's a kind of nice way. Also some of the stuff we can do is  for these individual icons we thought    I mean  how can we play with the idea of an icon  and push that further  And one of the things I can do is make it bigger if I want to emphasize it and make it more important. But what's really cool is that since there's a physics simulation running under this  it's actually heavier. So the lighter stuff doesn't really move but if I throw it at the lighter guys  right  So it's cute  but it's also like a subtle channel of conveying information  right  This is heavy so it feels more important. So it's kind of cool. Despite computers everywhere paper really hasn't disappeared  because it has a lot of  I think  valuable properties. And some of those we wanted to transfer to the icons in our system. So one of the things you can do to our icons  just like paper  is crease them and fold them  just like paper. Remember  you know  something for later. Or if you want to be destructive  you can just crumple it up and  you know  toss it to the corner. Also just like paper  around our workspace we'll pin things up to the wall to remember them later  and I can do the same thing here  and you know  you'll see post it notes and things like that around people's offices. And I can pull them off when I want to work with them. So  one of the criticisms of this kind of approach to organization is that  you know   Okay  well my real desk is really messy. I don't want that mess on my computer.  So one thing we have for that is like a grid align  kind of    so you get that more traditional desktop. Things are kind of grid aligned. More boring  but you still have that kind of colliding and bumping. And you can still do fun things like make shelves on your desktop. Let's just break this shelf. Okay  that shelf broke. I think beyond the icons  I think another really cool domain for this software    I think it applies to more than just icons and your desktop    but browsing photographs. I think you can really enrich the way we browse our photographs and bring it to that kind of shoebox of  you know  photos with your family on the kitchen table kind of thing. I can toss these things around. They're so much more tangible and touchable    and you know I can double click on something to take a look at it. And I can do all that kind of same stuff I showed you before. So I can pile things up  I can flip through it  I can  you know    okay  let's move this photo to the back  let's delete this guy here  and I think it's just a much more rich kind of way of interacting with your information. And that's BumpTop. Thanks  Thank you. And I feel like this whole evening has been very amazing to me. I feel it's sort of like the Vimalakirti Sutra  an ancient work from ancient India in which the Buddha appears at the beginning and a whole bunch of people come to see him from the biggest city in the area  Vaishali  and they bring some sort of jeweled parasols to make an offering to him. All the young people  actually  from the city. The old fogeys don't come because they're mad at Buddha  because when he came to their city he accepted    he always accepts the first invitation that comes to him  from whoever it is  and the local geisha  a movie star sort of person  raced the elders of the city in a chariot and invited him first. So he was hanging out with the movie star  and of course they were grumbling   He's supposed to be religious and all this. What's he doing over there at Amrapali's house with all his     monks   and so on. They were all grumbling  and so they boycotted him. They wouldn't go listen to him. But the young people all came. And they brought this kind of a jeweled parasol  and they put it on the ground. And as soon as they had laid all these  all their big stack of these jeweled parasols that they used to carry in ancient India  he performed a kind of special effect which made it into a giant planetarium  the wonder of the universe. Everyone looked in that  and they saw in there the total interconnectedness of all life in all universes. And of course  in the Buddhist cosmos there are millions and billions of planets with human life on it  and enlightened beings can see the life on all the other planets. So they don't    when they look out and they see those lights that you showed in the sky    they don't just see sort of pieces of matter burning or rocks or flames or gases exploding. They actually see landscapes and human beings and gods and dragons and serpent beings and goddesses and things like that. He made that special effect at the beginning to get everyone to think about interconnection and interconnectedness and how everything in life was totally interconnected. And then Leilei    I know his other name    told us about interconnection  and how we're all totally interconnected here  and how we've all known each other. And of course in the Buddhist universe  we've already done this already billions of times in many  many lifetimes in the past. And I didn't give the talk always. You did  and we had to watch you  and so forth. And we're all still trying to  I guess we're all trying to become TEDsters  if that's a modern form of enlightenment. I guess so. Because in a way  if a TEDster relates to all the interconnectedness of all the computers and everything  it's the forging of a mass awareness  of where everybody can really know everything that's going on everywhere in the planet. And therefore it will become intolerable    what compassion is  is where it will become intolerable for us  totally intolerable that we sit here in comfort and in pleasure and enjoying the life of the mind or whatever it is  and there are people who are absolutely riddled with disease and they cannot have a bite of food and they have no place  or they're being brutalized by some terrible person and so forth. It just becomes intolerable. With all of us knowing everything  we're kind of forced by technology to become Buddhas or something  to become enlightened. And of course  we all will be deeply disappointed when we do. Because we think that because we are kind of tired of what we do  a little bit tired  we do suffer. We do enjoy our misery in a certain way. We distract ourselves from our misery by running around somewhere  but basically we all have this common misery that we are sort of stuck inside our skins and everyone else is out there. And occasionally we get together with another person stuck in their skin and the two of us enjoy each other  and each one tries to get out of their own  and ultimately it fails of course  and then we're back into this thing. Because our egocentric perception    from the Buddha's point of view  misperception    is that all we are is what is inside our skin. And it's inside and outside  self and other  and other is all very different. And everyone here is unfortunately carrying that habitual perception  a little bit  right  You know  someone sitting next to you in a seat    that's OK because you're in a theater  but if you were sitting on a park bench and someone came up and sat that close to you  you'd freak out. What do they want from me  Like  who's that  And so you wouldn't sit that close to another person because of your notion that it's you versus the universe    that's all Buddha discovered. Because that cosmic basic idea that it is us all alone  each of us  and everyone else is different  then that puts us in an impossible situation  doesn't it  Who is it who's going to get enough attention from the world  Who's going to get enough out of the world  Who's not going to be overrun by an infinite number of other beings    if you're different from all the other beings  So where compassion comes is where you surprisingly discover you lose yourself in some way  through art  through meditation  through understanding  through knowledge actually  knowing that you have no such boundary  knowing your interconnectedness with other beings. You can experience yourself as the other beings when you see through the delusion of being separated from them. When you do that  you're forced to feel what they feel. Luckily  they say    I still am not sure    but luckily  they say that when you reach that point because some people have said in the Buddhist literature  they say   Oh who would really want to be compassionate  How awful  I'm so miserable on my own. My head is aching. My bones are aching. I go from birth to death. I'm never satisfied. I never have enough  even if I'm a billionaire  I don't have enough. I need a hundred billion.  So I'm like that. Imagine if I had to feel even a hundred other people's suffering. It would be terrible. But apparently  this is a strange paradox of life. When you're no longer locked in yourself  and as the wisdom or the intelligence or the scientific knowledge of the nature of the world  that enables you to let your mind spread out  and empathize  and enhance the basic human ability of empathizing  and realizing that you are the other being  somehow by that opening  you can see the deeper nature of life. And you can  you get away from this terrible iron circle of I  me  me  mine  like the Beatles used to sing. You know  we really learned everything in the '  s. Too bad nobody ever woke up to it  and they've been trying to suppress it since then. I  me  me  mine. It's like a perfect song  that song. A perfect teaching. But when we're relieved from that  we somehow then become interested in all the other beings. And we feel ourselves differently. It's totally strange. It's totally strange. The Dalai Lama always likes to say    he says that when you give birth in your mind to the idea of compassion  it's because you realize that you yourself and your pains and pleasures are finally too small a theater for your intelligence. It's really too boring whether you feel like this or like that  or what  you know    and the more you focus on how you feel  by the way  the worse it gets. Like  even when you're having a good time  when is the good time over  The good time is over when you think  how good is it  And then it's never good enough. I love that Leilei said that the way of helping those who are suffering badly on the physical plane or on other planes is having a good time  doing it by having a good time. I think the Dalai Lama should have heard that. I wish he'd been there to hear that. He once told me    he looked kind of sad  he worries very much about the haves and have nots. He looked a little sad  because he said  well  a hundred years ago  they went and took everything away from the haves. You know  the big communist revolutions  Russia and China and so forth. They took it all away by violence  saying they were going to give it to everyone  and then they were even worse. They didn't help at all. So what could possibly change this terrible gap that has opened up in the world today  And so then he looks at me. So I said   Well  you know  you're all in this yourself. You teach  it's generosity   was all I could think of. What is virtue  But of course  what you said  I think the key to saving the world  the key to compassion is that it is more fun. It should be done by fun. Generosity is more fun. That's the key. Everybody has the wrong idea. They think Buddha was so boring  and they're so surprised when they meet Dalai Lama and he's fairly jolly. Even though his people are being genocided    and believe me  he feels every blow on every old nun's head  in every Chinese prison. He feels it. He feels the way they are harvesting yaks nowadays. I won't even say what they do. But he feels it. And yet he's very jolly. He's extremely jolly. Because when you open up like that  then you can't just    what good does it do to add being miserable with others' misery  You have to find some vision where you see how hopeful it is  how it can be changed. Look at that beautiful thing Chiho showed us. She scared us with the lava man. She scared us with the lava man is coming  then the tsunami is coming  but then finally there were flowers and trees  and it was very beautiful. It's really lovely. So  compassion means to feel the feelings of others  and the human being actually is compassion. The human being is almost out of time. The human being is compassion because what is our brain for  Now  Jim's brain is memorizing the almanac. But he could memorize all the needs of all the beings that he is  he will  he did. He could memorize all kinds of fantastic things to help many beings. And he would have tremendous fun doing that. So the first person who gets happy  when you stop focusing on the self centered situation of  how happy am I  where you're always dissatisfied    as Mick Jagger told us. You never get any satisfaction that way. So then you decide   Well  I'm sick of myself. I'm going to think of how other people can be happy. I'm going to get up in the morning and think  what can I do for even one other person  even a dog  my dog  my cat  my pet  my butterfly   And the first person who gets happy when you do that  you don't do anything for anybody else  but you get happier  you yourself  because your whole perception broadens and you suddenly see the whole world and all of the people in it. And you realize that this    being with these people    is the flower garden that Chiho showed us. It is Nirvana. And my time is up. And I know the TED commandments. Thank you. Kurt Andersen  Like many architects  David is a hog for the limelight but is sufficiently reticent    or at least pretends to be    that he asked me to question him rather than speaking. In fact what we're going to talk about  I think  is in fact a subject that is probably better served by a conversation than an address. And I guess we have a bit of news clip to precede. Dan Rather  Since the September   th attack on the World Trade Center  many people have flocked to downtown New York to see and pay respects at what amounts to the    acre burial ground. Now  as CBS's Jim Axelrod reports  they're putting the finishing touches on a new way for people to visit and view the scene. Jim Axelrod  Forget the Empire State Building or the Statue of Liberty. There's a new place in New York where the crowds are thickest    Ground Zero. Tourist  I've taken my step daughter here from Indianapolis. This was    out of all the tourist sites in New York City    this was her number one pick. JA  Thousands now line up on lower Broadway. Tourist  I've been wanting to come down here since this happened. JA  Even on the coldest winter days. To honor and remember. Tourist  It's reality  it's us. It happened here. This is ours. JA  So many  in fact  that seeing has become a bit of a problem. Tourist  I think that people are very frustrated that they're not able to get closer to see what's going on. JA  But that is about to change. In record time  a team of architects and construction workers designed and built a viewing platform to ease the frustration and bring people closer. Man  They'll get an incredible panorama and understand  I think more completely  the sheer totality of the destruction of the place. JA  If you think about it  Ground Zero is unlike most any other tourist site in America. Unlike the Grand Canyon or the Washington Monument  people come here to see what's no longer there. David Rockwell  The first experience people will have here when they see this is not as a construction site but as this incredibly moving burial ground. JA  The walls are bare by design  so people can fill them with their own memorials the way they already have along the current perimeter. Tourist  From our hearts  it affected us just as much. JA  The ramps are made of simple material    the kind of plywood you see at construction sites    which is really the whole point. In the face of America's worst destruction people are building again. Jim Axelrod  CBS News  New York. KA  This is not an obvious subject to be in the sensuality segment  but certainly David you are known as    I know  a phrase you hate    an entertainment architect. Your work is highly sensual  even hedonistic. DR  I like that word. KA  It's about pleasure    casinos and hotels and restaurants. How did the shock that all of us    and especially all of us in New York    felt on the   th of September transmute into your desire to do this thing  DR  Well the truth of the matter is  post September   th  I felt myself in the role originally    first of all as someone who lives in Tribeca and whose neighborhood was devastated  and as someone who works less than a mile from there    that I was in the role of forcing     people who work with me in my firm  to continue to have the same level of enthusiasm about creating the places we had been creating. In fact we're finishing a book which is called  Pleasure   which is about sensual pleasure in spaces. But I've got to tell you    it became impossible to do that. We were really paralyzed. And I found myself the Friday after September   th    two days afterwards    literally unable to motivate anyone to do anything. We gave the office a few days off. And in discussing this with other architects  we had seen people saying in the press that they should rebuild the towers as they were    they should rebuild them    stories taller. And I thought it was astonishing to speculate  as if this were a competition  on something that was such a fresh wound. And I had a series of discussions    first with Rick Scofidio and Liz Diller  who collaborated with us on this  and several other people    and really felt like we had to find relevance in doing something. And that as people who create places  the ultimate way to help wasn't to pontificate or to make up scenarios  but to help right now. So we tried to come up with a way  as a group  to have a kind of design SWAT team. And that was the mission that we came up with. KA  Were you conscious of suddenly    as a designer whose work is all about fulfilling wants    suddenly fulfilling needs  DR  Well what I was aware of was  there was this overwhelming need to act now. And we were asked to participate in a few projects before this. There was a school  PS      that had been evacuated down at Ground Zero. They moved to an abandoned school. We took about    or    architects and designers and artists  and over four days    it was like this urban barn raising    to renovate it  and everyone wanted to help. It was just extraordinary. Tom Otterness contributed  Maira Kalman contributed and it became this cathartic experience for us. KA  And that was done  effectively  by October   or something  DR  Yeah. KA  Obviously  what you faced in trying to do something as substantial as this project    and this is only one of four that you've designed to surround the site    you must have run up against the incredibly byzantine  entrenched bureaucracy and powers that be in New York real estate and New York politics. DR  Well  it's a funny thing. We finished PS      and had dinner with a small group. I was actually asked to be a committee chair on an AIA committee to rebuild. And I sat in on several meetings. And there were the most circuitous grand plans that had to do with long term infrastructure and rebuilding the entire city. And the fact is that there were immediate wounds and needs that needed to be filled  and there was talk about inclusion and wanting it to be an inclusive process. And it wasn't an inclusive group. So we said  what is    KA  It was not an inclusive group  DR  It was not an inclusive group. It was predominantly a white  rich  corporate group that was not representative of the city. KA  Shocking. DR  Yeah  surprising. So Rick and Liz and Kevin and I came up with the idea. The city actually approached us. We first approached the city about Pier   . We saw how PS     worked. The families    the victims of the families    were going to this pier that was incredibly dehumanizing. KA  On the Hudson River  DR  Yeah. And the city actually    through Tim Zagat initially  and then through Christyne Nicholas  then we got to Giuliani    said   You know we don't want to do anything with Pier    right now  but we have an observation platform for the families down at Ground Zero that we'd like to be a more dignified experience for the families  and a way to protect it from the weather.  So I went down there with Rick and Liz and Kevin  and I've got to say  it was the most moving experience of my life. It was devastating to see the simple plywood platform with a rail around it  where the families of the victims had left notes to them. And there was no mediation between us and the experience. There was no filter. And I remembered on September   th  on   th Street  the roof of our building    we can see the World Trade Towers prominently    and I saw the first building collapse from a conference room on the eighth floor on a TV that we had set up. And then everyone was up on the roof  so I ran up there. And it was amazing how much harder it was to believe in real life than it was on TV. There was something about the comfort of the filter and how much information was between us and the experience. So seeing this in a very simple  dignified way was a very powerful experience. So we went back to the city and said we're not particularly interested in the upgrade of this as a VIP platform  but we've spent some time down there. At the same time the city had this need. They were looking for a solution to deal with    or    thousand people a day who were going down there  that had nowhere to go. And there was no way to deal with the traffic around the site. So dealing with it is just an immediate master plan. There was a way    there had to be a way    to get people to move around the site. KA  But then you've got to figure out a way    we will skip over the insanely tedious process of getting permits and getting everybody on board    but simply funding this thing. It looks like a fairly simple thing  but this was a half a million dollar project  DR  Well  we knew that if it wasn't privately funded  it wasn't going to happen. And we also  frankly  knew that if it didn't happen by the end of the Giuliani administration  then everyone who we were dealing with at the DOT and the Police Department and all of the    we were meeting with    or    people with the city at a time  and it was set up by the Office of Emergency Management. This incredible act on their part  because they really wanted this  and they sensed that this needed to happen. KA  And there was therefore this ticking clock  because Giuliani was obviously out three months after that. DR  Yeah. So the first thing we had to do was find a way to get this    we had to work with the families of the victims  through the city  to make sure that they knew this was happening. Because this didn't want to be a surprise. And we also had to be as under the radar screen as we could be in New York  because the key was not raising a lot of objection and sort of working as quietly as possible. We came up with the idea of setting up a foundation  mainly because when we found a contractor who would build this  he would not agree to do this  even if we would pay him the money. There needed to be a foundation in place. So we came up with a foundation  and actually what happened was one major developer in New York    KA  Who shall remain nameless  I guess  DR  Yeah. His initials are JS  and he owns Rockefeller Center  if that helps anyone    volunteered to help. And we met with him. The prices from the contractors were between five to         dollars. And Atlantic Heydt  who's the largest scaffolding contractor in the country  volunteered to do it at cost. So this developer said   You know what  we'll underwrite the entire expense.  And we said   That's incredible   And I think this was the   st  and we knew this had to be built and up by the   th. And we had to start construction the next day. We had a meeting that evening with his contractor of choice  and the contractor showed up with the drawings of the platform about half the size that we had drawn it. KA  Sort of like the Spinal Tap scene where you get the tiny little Stonehenge  I guess  DR  In fact  it was as if this was going to be window washing scaffolding. There was no sense of the fact that this is next to Saint Paul    that this is really a place that needs to be kind of dignified  and a place to reflect and remember. And I've got to say that we spent a lot of time in putting this together  watching the crowds that gathered at Saint Paul    which is just to the right    and moving around the site. And I live down there  so we spent a lot of time looking at the need. And I think people were amazed at two things    I think they were amazed at the destruction  but I think there was a sense of disbelief about the heroics of New Yorkers that I found very moving. Just the sort of everyday heroics of New Yorkers. So we were in this meeting and the contractor literally said   I'm going to lock the door  because this developer will not agree to have you leave till you've signed off on this.  And we said   Well  this is half the size  it doesn't have any of the design features that have been agreed upon by everyone    everyone in the city. We'd have to go back to the beginning to do this.  And I convinced him that we should leave the room with the agreement to build it as designed. The next day I got an email from the developer saying that he was withdrawing all funding. So we didn't know what to do  but we decided to cast a very wide net. We emailed out letters to as many people as we could    several people in the audience here    who were very helpful. KA  There was no thought of abandoning ship at that point  DR  No. In fact I told the contractor to go ahead. He had already ordered materials based on my go ahead. We knew that one way or another this was going to happen. And we just felt it had to happen. KA  You were funding it yourself and with contributions and this foundation. Richard  I think very correctly  made the point at the beginning    before all the chair designers came out    about the history of chair designers imposing aesthetic solutions on this kind of universal  banal  common problem of sitting. It seems to me with this  that it was the opposite of that. This was an unprecedented  singular design problem. DR  Well here's the issue  we knew that this was not in the sense of    we think about the site  and think about the need for a memorial. It was important that this not be categorized as a memorial. That this was a place for people to reflect  to remember    a kind of quiet place. So it led us to using design solutions that created as few filters between the viewer    as we said about the families' platform    and the experience as possible. It's all incredibly humble material. It's scaffolding and plywood. And it allows    by sort of the procession of the movement  up by Saint Paul's and down the other side    it gives you about     feet to go up    feet from the ground to where you get the     degree view. But the design was driven by a need to be quick  cheap  safe  respectful  flexible. One of the other things is this is designed to be moveable. Because when we looked at the four platforms around the site  one of which is an upgrade of the families' platform  we knew that these had to be moveable to respond to changing conditions  and the changing definition of what Ground Zero is. KA  Your work    I mean  we've talked about this before    a lot of your work  I think  is informed by your belief in  or your focus on the temporariness of all things and the evanescence of things  and a kind of  Eat  drink  and be merry  for tomorrow we die   sort of sense of existence. This is clearly not a work for the ages. You know  a couple of years this thing isn't going to be here. Did that require  as an architect  a new way of thinking about what you were doing  To think of it as this purely temporary installation  DR  No  I don't think so. I think this is  obviously  substantially different from anything we'd ever thought about doing before  just by the nature of it. Where it overlaps with thoughts about our work in general is  number one    the notion of collaboration as a sort of way to get things done. And Kevin Kennon  Rick Scofidio  Liz Diller and all the people within the city    Norman Lear  who I spoke to four hours before our deadline for funding  offered to give us a bridge loan to help us get through it. So the notion of collaboration    I think this reinforces how important that is. And in terms of the temporary nature of it  our goal was not to create something that would be there longer than it needed to be. I think what we were most interested in was promoting a kind of dialogue that we felt may not have been happening enough in this city  about what's really happening there. And a day or two before it opened was Giuliani's farewell address  where he proposed the idea of all of Ground Zero being a memorial. Which was very controversial  but it resonated with a lot of people. And I think regardless of what the position is about how this sacred piece of land is to be used  having it come out of actually seeing it in a real encounter  I think makes it a more powerful dialogue. And that's what we were interested in. So that  very much  is in the realm of things I've been interested in before. KA  It seems to me  among other things  a lovely piece of civic infrastructure. It enables that conversation to get serious. And six months after the fact    and only a few months away from the site being cleaned    we are very quickly  now  getting to the point where those conversations about what should go there are getting serious. Do you have    having been as physically involved in the site as you have been doing this project    have any ideas about what should or shouldn't be done  DR  Well  I think one thing that shouldn't be done is evaluate    I think right now the discussion is a very closed discussion on the master plan. The Protetch Gallery recently had a show on ideas for buildings  which had some sort of inventive ideas of buildings. KA  But it had some really terrible ideas. DR  And it also felt a little bit like a kind of competition of ideas  where I think the focus of ideas should be on master planning and uses. And I think there should be a broader    which there's starting to be    the dialogue is really opening up to  what does this site really want to be  And I truly believe until the issue of memorial is sorted out  that it's going to be very hard to have an intelligent discussion. There's a few discussions right now that I think are very positive  about depressing the West Side Highway and connecting this over  so that there's one uninterrupted piece of land. KA  Well  I think that's interesting. And it gets to another issue that was probably inappropriate to discuss six months ago  but perhaps isn't now  which is  not many of us love the World Trade Center as a piece of architecture  as what it had done to this city and that huge plaza. Is this an opportunity  is the silver lining    a silver lining  here    to rebuild some more traditional city grid  or not  DR  I think there's a real opportunity to engage in a discussion of why we live in cities. And why do we live in places where such dissimilar people collide up against us each day  I don't think it has much to do with    or    or    or    thousand new office spaces  regardless of what the number is. So yeah  I think there is a chance to re look at how we think about cities. And in fact  there's a proposal on the table now for building number seven. KA  Which was the building just north of the Towers  DR  Right  which the towers fell into. And the reason that's been held up is essentially by community outrage that they're not re opening the street to connect that back to the rest of the city. I think a public dialogue    I think  you know  I'd like to see an international competition  and a call for ideas for uses. KA  Whether it's arts  whether it's housing  whether it's what amount of shopping  DR  Right. And we're looking for other things. This small foundation we put together is looking for other ways to help. Including taking a small piece adjacent to the site and inviting    architects who currently don't have a voice in New York to do artist housing. And find other ways to encourage the discussion to be against sort of monolithic  single solutions  and more about a multiplicity of things. KA  Before we end  I know you have a piece of digital video of the experience of being on this platform  DR  John Kamen    who's here  actually    put together a two and a half minute piece that shows the platform in use. So I thought that would be good to end with. DR  We're looking from Fulton Street  west. One of the tricky issues we had with the Giuliani administration was I had forgotten how anti graffiti he was. And essentially our structure was designed to be written on. KA  As you say  it's not a memorial. But were you conscious of memorials  The Vietnam Memorial  Those kinds of forms  DR  We certainly did as much research as we could  and we were conscious of other memorials. And also the complexity and length of time they really take to do. It's     people on the committee for Oklahoma City  which is why we thought of this as a sort of ad hoc  spontaneous solution that expanded on Union Square and the places that were ad hoc memorials in the city already. The scaffolding you can see built up over the street is de mountable. What's interesting now is the nature of the site has totally changed  so that what you're aware of is not just the destruction of the buildings in Ground Zero  but all of the buildings around it    and the scars on the building around it  which are enormous. This shows Saint Paul's on the left. KA  I just want to thank you on behalf of New Yorkers for making this happen and getting this done. But the kind of virtually instantaneous nature of its erection  and its being there  almost before you could believe that a response of this magnitude could be accomplished  is part of its extraordinary    I don't know if beauty is the word    but presence. DR  It was an honor to do. And we were thrilled to be able to show it here. I get asked a lot what the difference between my work is and typical Pentagon long range strategic planners. And the answer I like to offer is what they typically do is they think about the future of wars in the context of war. And what I've spent    years doing in this business    and it's taken me almost    to figure it out    is I think about the future of wars in the context of everything else. So I tend to specialize on the scene between war and peace. The material I'm going to show you is one idea from a book with a lot of ideas. It's the one that takes me around the world right now interacting with foreign militaries quite a bit. The material was generated in two years of work I did for the Secretary of Defense  thinking about a new national grand strategy for the United States. I'm going to present a problem and try to give you an answer. Here's my favorite bonehead concept from the     s in the Pentagon  the theory of anti access  area denial asymmetrical strategies. Why do we call it that  Because it's got all those A's lined up I guess. This is gobbledygook for if the United States fights somebody we're going to be huge. They're going to be small. And if they try to fight us in the traditional  straight up manner we're going to kick their ass  which is why people don't try to do that any more. I met the last Air Force General who had actually shot down an enemy plane in combat. He's now a one star General. That's how distant we are from even meeting an air force willing to fly against ours. So that overmatched capability creates problems    catastrophic successes the White House calls them. And we're trying to figure that out  because it is an amazing capability. The question is  what's the good you can do with it  OK  The theory of anti access  area denial asymmetrical strategies    gobbledygook that we sell to Congress  because if we just told them we can kick anybody's asses they wouldn't buy us all the stuff we want. So we say  area denial  anti access asymmetrical strategies and their eyes glaze over. And they say   Will you build it in my district   Here's my parody and it ain't much of one. Let's talk about a battle space. I don't know  Taiwan Straits     . Let's talk about an enemy embedded within that battle space. I don't know  the Million Man Swim. The United States has to access that battle space instantaneously. They throw up anti access  area denial asymmetrical strategies. A banana peel on the tarmac. Trojan horses on our computer networks reveal all our Achilles' heels instantly. We say   China  it's yours.  Prometheus approach  largely a geographic definition  focuses almost exclusively on the start of conflict. We field the first half team in a league that insists on keeping score until the end of the game. That's the problem. We can run the score up against anybody  and then get our asses kicked in the second half    what they call fourth generation warfare. Here's the way I like to describe it instead. There is no battle space the U.S. Military cannot access. They said we couldn't do Afghanistan. We did it with ease. They said we couldn't do Iraq. We did it with     combat casualties in six weeks. We did it so fast we weren't prepared for their collapse. There is nobody we can't take down. The question is  what do you do with the power  So there's no trouble accessing battle spaces. What we have trouble accessing is the transition space that must naturally follow  and creating the peace space that allows us to move on. Problem is  the Defense Department over here beats the hell out of you. The State Department over here says   Come on boy  I know you can make it.  And that poor country runs off that ledge  does that cartoon thing and then drops. This is not about overwhelming force  but proportional force. It's about non lethal technologies  because if you fire real ammo into a crowd of women and children rioting you're going to lose friends very quickly. This is not about projecting power  but about staying power  which is about legitimacy with the locals. Who do you access in this transition space  You have to create internal partners. You have to access coalition partners. We asked the Indians for        peace keepers. I know their senior leadership  they wanted to give it to us. But they said to us   You know what  In that transition space you're mostly hat not enough cattle. We don't think you can pull it off  we're not going to give you our        peace keepers for fodder.  We asked the Russians for       . They said no. I was in China in August  I said   You should have        peace keepers in Iraq. It's your oil  not ours.  Which is the truth. It's their oil. And the Chinese said to me   Dr. Barnett  you're absolutely right. In a perfect world we'd have        there. But it's not a perfect world  and your administration isn't getting us any closer.  But we have trouble accessing our outcomes. We lucked out  frankly  on the selection. We face different opponents across these three. And it's time to start admitting you can't ask the same    year old to do it all  day in and day out. It's just too damn hard. We have an unparalleled capacity to wage war. We don't do the everything else so well. Frankly  we do it better than anybody and we still suck at it. We have a brilliant Secretary of War. We don't have a Secretary of Everything Else. Because if we did  that guy would be in front of the Senate  still testifying over Abu Ghraib. The problem is he doesn't exist. There is no Secretary of Everything Else. I think we have an unparalleled capacity to wage war. I call that the Leviathan Force. What we need to build is a force for the Everything Else. I call them the System Administrators. What I think this really represents is lack of an A to Z rule set for the world as a whole for processing politically bankrupt states. We have one for processing economically bankrupt states. It's the IMF Sovereign Bankruptcy Plan  OK  We argue about it every time we use it. Argentina just went through it  broke a lot of rules. They got out on the far end  we said   Fine  don't worry about it.  It's transparent. A certain amount of certainty gives the sense of a non zero outcome. We don't have one for processing politically bankrupt states that  frankly  everybody wants gone. Like Saddam  like Mugabe  like Kim Jong Il    people who kill in hundreds of thousands or millions. Like the         dead so far in Sudan. What would an A to Z system look like  I'm going to distinguish between what I call front half and back half. And let's call this red line  I don't know  mission accomplished. What we have extant right now  at the beginning of this system  is the U.N. Security Council as a grand jury. What can they do  They can indict your ass. They can debate it. They can write it on a piece of paper. They can put it in an envelope and mail it to you  and then say in no uncertain terms   Please cut that out.  That gets you about four million dead in Central Africa over the     s. That gets you         dead in the Sudan in the last    months. Everybody's got to answer their grandchildren some day what you did about the holocaust in Africa  and you better have an answer. We don't have anything to translate that will into action. What we do have is the U.S. enabled Leviathan Force that says   You want me to take that guy down  I'll take that guy down. I'll do it on Tuesday. It will cost you    billion dollars.  But here's the deal. As soon as I can't find anybody else to air out  I leave the scene immediately. That's called the Powell Doctrine. Way downstream we have the International Criminal Court. They love to put them on trial. They've got Milosevic right now. What are we missing  A functioning executive that will translate will into action  because we don't have it. Every time we lead one of these efforts we have to whip ourselves into this imminent threat thing. We haven't faced an imminent threat since the Cuban missile crisis in     . But we use this language from a bygone era to scare ourselves into doing something because we're a democracy and that's what it takes. And if that doesn't work we scream   He's got a gun   just as we rush in. And then we look over the body and we find an old cigarette lighter and we say   Jesus  it was dark.  Do you want to do it  France  France says   No  but I do like to criticize you after the fact.  What we need downstream is a great power enabled    what I call that Sys Admin Force. We should have had         troops streaming into Iraq on the heels of that Leviathan sweeping towards Baghdad. What do you get then  No looting  no military disappearing  no arms disappearing  no ammo disappearing  no Muqtada al Sadr    I'm wrecking his bones    no insurgency. Talk to anybody who was over there in the first six months. We had six months to feel the lob  to get the job done  and we dicked around for six months. And then they turned on us. Why  Because they just got fed up. They saw what we did to Saddam. They said   You're that powerful  you can resurrect this country. You're America.  What we need is an international reconstruction fund    Sebastian Mallaby  Washington Post  great idea. Model on the IMF. Instead of passing the hat each time  OK  Where are we going to find this guy  G    that's easy. Check out their agenda since     . All security dominated. They're going to decide up front how the money gets spent just like in the IMF. You vote according to how much money you put in the kitty. Here's my challenge to the Defense Department. You've got to build this force. You've got to seed this force. You've got to track coalition partners. Create a record of success. You will get this model. You tell me it's too hard to do. I'll walk this dog right through that six part series on the Balkans. We did it just like that. I'm talking about regularizing it  making it transparent. Would you like Mugabe gone  Would you like Kim Jong Il  who's killed about two million people  would you like him gone  Would you like a better system  This is why it matters to the military. They've been experiencing an identity crisis since the end of the Cold War. I'm not talking about the difference between reality and desire  which I can do because I'm not inside the beltway. I'm talking about the     s. The Berlin Wall falls. We do Desert Storm. The split starts to emerge between those in the military who see a future they can live with  and those who see a future that starts to scare them  like the U.S. submarine community  which watches the Soviet Navy disappear overnight. Ah  So they start moving from reality towards desire and they create their own special language to describe their voyage of self discovery and self actualization. The problem is you need a big  sexy opponent to fight against. And if you can't find one you've got to make one up. China  all grown up  going to be a looker  The rest of the military got dragged down into the muck across the     s and they developed this very derisive term to describe it  military operations other than war. I ask you  who joins the military to do things other than war  Actually  most of them. Jessica Lynch never planned on shooting back. Most of them don't pick up a rifle. I maintain this is code inside the Army for   We don't want to do this.  They spent the     s working the messy scene between globalized parts of the world What I call the core and the gap. The Clinton administration wasn't interested in running this. For eight years  after screwing up the relationship on day one    inauguration day with gays in the military    which was deft. So we were home alone for eight years. And what did we do home alone  We bought one military and we operated another. It's like the guy who goes to the doctor and says   Doctor  it hurts when I do this.  The doctor says   Stop doing that you idiot.  I used to give this brief inside the Pentagon in the early     s. I'd say   You're buying one military and you're operating another  and eventually it's going to hurt. It's wrong. Bad Pentagon  bad   And they'd say   Dr. Barnett  you are so right. Can you come back next year and remind us again   Some people say      heals the rift    jerks the long term transformation gurus out of their        foot view of history  drags them down in to the muck and says   You want a networked opponent  I've got one  he's everywhere  go find him.  It elevates MOOTW    how we pronounce that acronym    from crap to grand strategy  because that's how you're going to shrink that gap. Some people put these two things together and they call it empire  which I think is a boneheaded concept. Empire is about the enforcement of not just minimal rule sets  which you cannot do  but maximum rule sets which you must do. It's not our system of governance. Never how we've sought to interact with the outside world. I prefer that phrase System Administration. We enforce the minimal rule sets for maintaining connectivity to the global economy. Certain bad things you cannot do. How this impacts the way we think about the future of war. This is a concept which gets me vilified throughout the Pentagon. It makes me very popular as well. Everybody's got an opinion. Going back to the beginning of our country    historically  defenses meant protection of the homeland. Security has meant everything else. Written into our constitution  two different forces  two different functions. Raise an army when you need it  and maintain a navy for day to day connectivity. A Department of War  a Department of Everything Else. A big stick  a baton stick. Can of whup ass  the networking force. In      we merged these two things together in the Defense Department. Our long term rationale becomes  we're involved in a hair trigger stand off with the Soviets. To attack America is to risk blowing up the world. We connected national security to international security with about a seven minute time delay. That's not our problem now. They can kill three million in Chicago tomorrow and we don't go to the mattresses with nukes. That's the scary part. The question is how do we reconnect American national security with global security to make the world a lot more comfortable  and to embed and contextualize our employment of force around the planet  What's happened since is that bifurcation I described. We talked about this going all the way back to the end of the Cold War. Let's have a Department of War  and a Department of Something Else. Some people say   Hell       did it for you.  Now we've got a home game and an away game. The Department of Homeland Security is a strategic feel good measure. It's going to be the Department of Agriculture for the   st century. TSA    thousands standing around. Just be grateful Robert Reed didn't shove that bomb up his ass. Because we'd all be gay then. I supported the war in Iraq. He was a bad guy with multiple priors. It's not like we had to find him actually killing somebody live to arrest him. I knew we'd kick ass in the war with the Leviathan Force. I knew we'd have a hard time with what followed. But I know this organization doesn't change until it experiences failure. What do I mean by these two different forces  This is the Hobbesian Force. I love this force. I don't want to see it go. That plus nukes rules out great power war. This is the military the rest of the world wants us to build. It's why I travel all over the world talking to foreign militaries. What does this mean  It means you've got to stop pretending you can do these two very disparate skill sets with the same    year old. Switching back  morning  afternoon  evening  morning  afternoon  evening. Handing out aid  shooting back  handing out aid  shooting back. It's too much. The    year olds get tired from the switching  OK  That force on the left  you can train a    year old to do that. That force on the right is more like a    year old cop. You need the experience. What does this mean in terms of operations  The rule is going to be this. That Sys Admin force is the force that never comes home  does most of your work. You break out that Leviathan Force only every so often. But here's the promise you make to the American public  to your own people  to the world. You break out that Leviathan Force  you promise  you guarantee that you're going to mount one hell of a    immediately    follow on Sys Admin effort. Don't plan for the war unless you plan to win the peace. Other differences. Leviathan traditional partners  they all look like the Brits and their former colonies. Including us  I would remind you. The rest    wider array of partners. International organizations  non governmental organizations  private voluntary organizations  contractors. You're not going to get away from that. Leviathan Force  it's all about joint operations between the military services. We're done with that. What we need to do is inter agency operations  which frankly Condi Rice was in charge of. And I'm amazed nobody asked her that question when she was confirmed. I call the Leviathan Force your dad's military. I like them young  male  unmarried  slightly pissed off. I call the Sys Admin Force your mom's military. It's everything the man's military hates. Gender balanced much more  older  educated  married with children. The force on the left  up or out. The force on the right  in and out. The force on the left respects Posse Comitatus restrictions on the use of force inside the U.S. The force on the right's going to obliterate it. That's where the National Guard's going to be. The force on the left is never coming under the purview of the International Criminal Court. Sys Admin Force has to. Different definitions of network centricity. One takes down networks  one puts them up. And you've got to wage war here in such a way to facilitate that. Do we need a bigger budget  Do we need a draft to pull this off  Absolutely not. I've been told by the Revolution of Military Affairs crowd for years  we can do it faster  cheaper  smaller  just as lethal. I say   Great  I'm going to take the Sys Admin budget out of your hide.  Here's the larger point. You're going to build the Sys Admin Force inside the U.S. Military first. But ultimately you're going to civilianize it  probably two thirds. Inter agency ize it  internationalize it. So yes  it begins inside the Pentagon  but over time it's going to cross that river. I have been to the mountain top. I can see the future. I may not live long enough to get you there  but it's going to happen. We're going to have a Department of Something Else between war and peace. Last slide. Who gets custody of the kids  This is where the Marines in the audience get kind of tense. And this is when they think about beating the crap out of me after the talk. Read Max Boon. This is the history of the marines    small wars  small arms. The Marines are like my West Highland Terrier. They get up every morning  they want to dig a hole and they want to kill something. I don't want my Marines handing out aid. I want them to be Marines. That's what keeps the Sys Admin Force from being a pussy force. It keeps it from being the U.N. You shoot at these people the Marines are going to come over and kill you. Department of Navy  strategic subs go this way  surface combatants are over there  and the news is they may actually be that small. I call it the Smart Dust Navy. I tell young officers   You may command     ships in your career. Bad news is they may not have anybody on them.  Carriers go both ways because they're a swing asset. You'll see the pattern    airborne  just like carriers. Armor goes this way. Here's the dirty secret of the Air Force  you can win by bombing. But you need lots of these guys on the ground to win the peace. Shinseki was right with the argument. Air force  strategic airlift goes both ways. Bombers  fighters go over here. Special Operations Command down at Tampa. Trigger pullers go this way. Civil Affairs  that bastard child  comes over here. Return to the Army. The point about the trigger pullers and Special Operations Command. No off season  these guys are always active. They drop in  do their business  disappear. See me now. Don't talk about it later. I was never here. The world is my playground. I want to keep trigger pullers trigger happy. I want the rules to be as loose as possible. Because when the thing gets prevented in Chicago with the three million dead that perverts our political system beyond all recognition  these are the guys who are going to kill them first. So it's better off to have them make some mistakes along the way than to see that. Reserve component    National Guard reserves overwhelmingly Sys Admin. How are you going to get them to work for this force  Most firemen in this country do it for free. This is not about money. This is about being up front with these guys and gals. Last point  intelligence community    the muscle and the defense agencies go this way. What should be the CIA  open  analytical  open source should come over here. The information you need to do this is not secret. It's not secret. Read that great piece in the New Yorker about how our echo boomers     to     over in Iraq taught each other how to do Sys Admin work  over the Internet in chat rooms. They said   Al Qaeda could be listening.  They said   Well  Jesus  they already know this stuff.  Take a gift in the left hand. These are the sunglasses that don't scare people  simple stuff. Censors and transparency  the overheads go in both directions. Thanks. What I want to talk to you about today is virtual worlds  digital globes  the   D Web  the Metaverse. What does this all mean for us  What it means is the Web is going to become an exciting place again. It's going to become super exciting as we transform to this highly immersive and interactive world. With graphics  computing power  low latencies  these types of applications and possibilities are going to stream rich data into your lives. So the Virtual Earth initiative  and other types of these initiatives  are all about extending our current search metaphor. When you think about it  we're so constrained by browsing the Web  remembering URLs  saving favorites. As we move to search  we rely on the relevance rankings  the Web matching  the index crawling. But we want to use our brain  We want to navigate  explore  discover information. In order to do that  we have to put you as a user back in the driver's seat. We need cooperation between you and the computing network and the computer. So what better way to put you back in the driver's seat than to put you in the real world that you interact in every day  Why not leverage the learnings that you've been learning your entire life  So Virtual Earth is about starting off creating the first digital representation  comprehensive  of the entire world. What we want to do is mix in all types of data. Tag it. Attribute it. Metadata. Get the community to add local depth  global perspective  local knowledge. So when you think about this problem  what an enormous undertaking. Where do you begin  Well  we collect data from satellites  from airplanes  from ground vehicles  from people. This process is an engineering problem  a mechanical problem  a logistical problem  an operational problem. Here is an example of our aerial camera. This is panchromatic. It's actually four color cones. In addition  it's multi spectral. We collect four gigabits per second of data  if you can imagine that kind of data stream coming down. That's equivalent to a constellation of    satellites at highest res capacity. We fly these airplanes at       feet in the air. You can see the camera on the front. We collect multiple viewpoints  vantage points  angles  textures. We bring all that data back in. We sit here    you know  think about the ground vehicles  the human scale    what do you see in person  We need to capture that up close to establish that what it's like type experience. I bet many of you have seen the Apple commercials  kind of poking at the PC for their brilliance and simplicity. So a little unknown secret is    did you see the one with the guy  he's got the Web cam  The poor PC guy. They're duct taping his head. They're just wrapping it on him. Well  a little unknown secret is his brother actually works on the Virtual Earth team. But let me tell you    it doesn't affect his day job. We think a lot of good can come from this technology. This was after Katrina. We were the first commercial fleet of airplanes to be cleared into the disaster impact zone. We flew the area. We imaged it. We sent in people. We took pictures of interiors  disaster areas. We helped with the first responders  the search and rescue. Often the first time anyone saw what happened to their house was on Virtual Earth. We made it all freely available on the Web  just to    it was obviously our chance of helping out with the cause. When we think about how all this comes together  it's all about software  algorithms and math. You know  we capture this imagery but to build the   D models we need to do geo positioning. We need to do geo registering of the images. We have to bundle adjust them. Find tie points. Extract geometry from the images. This process is a very calculated process. In fact  it was always done manual. Hollywood would spend millions of dollars to do a small urban corridor for a movie because they'd have to do it manually. They'd drive the streets with lasers called LIDAR. They'd collected information with photos. They'd manually build each building. We do this all through software  algorithms and math    a highly automated pipeline creating these cities. We took a decimal point off what it cost to build these cities  and that's how we're going to be able to scale this out and make this reality a dream. We think about the user interface. What does it mean to look at it from multiple perspectives  An ortho view  a nadir view. How do you keep the precision of the fidelity of the imagery while maintaining the fluidity of the model  I'll wrap up by showing you the    this is a brand new peek I haven't really shown into the lab area of Virtual Earth. What we're doing is    people like this a lot  this bird's eye imagery we work with. It's this high resolution data. But what we've found is they like the fluidity of the   D model. A child can navigate with an Xbox controller or a game controller. So here what we're trying to do is we bring the picture and project it into the   D model space. You can see all types of resolution. From here  I can slowly pan the image over. I can get the next image. I can blend and transition. By doing this I don't lose the original detail. In fact  I might be recording history. The freshness  the capacity. I can turn this image. I can look at it from multiple viewpoints and angles. What we're trying to do is build a virtual world. We hope that we can make computing a user model you're familiar with  and really derive insights from you  from all different directions. I thank you very much for your time. I told you three things last year. I told you that the statistics of the world have not been made properly available. Because of that  we still have the old mindset of developing in industrialized countries  which is wrong. And that animated graphics can make a difference. Things are changing and today  on the United Nations Statistic Division Home Page  it says  by first of May  full access to the databases. And if I could share the image with you on the screen. So three things have happened. U.N. opened their statistic databases  and we have a new version of the software up working as a beta on the net  so you don't have to download it any longer. And let me repeat what you saw last year. The bubbles are the countries. Here you have the fertility rate    the number of children per woman    and there you have the length of life in years. This is         those were the industrialized countries  those were developing countries. At that time there was a  we  and  them.  There was a huge difference in the world. But then it changed  and it went on quite well. And this is what happens. You can see how China is the red  big bubble. The blue there is India. And they go over all this    I'm going to try to be a little more serious this year in showing you how things really changed. And it's Africa that stands out as the problem down here  doesn't it  Large families still  and the HIV epidemic brought down the countries like this. This is more or less what we saw last year  and this is how it will go on into the future. And I will talk on  is this possible  Because you see now  I presented statistics that don't exist. Because this is where we are. Will it be possible that this will happen  I cover my lifetime here  you know  I expect to live     years. And this is where we are today. Now could we look here instead at the economic situation in the world  And I would like to show that against child survival. We'll swap the axis. Here you have child mortality    that is  survival    four kids dying there      dying there. And this is GDP per capita on this axis. And this was     . And if I go back in time  I've added some historical statistics    here we go  here we go  here we go    not so much statistics     years ago. Some countries still had statistics. We are looking down in the archive  and when we are down into       there is only Austria and Sweden that can produce numbers. But they were down here. They had       dollars per person per year. And they lost one fifth of their kids before their first birthday. So this is what happens in the world  if we play the entire world. How they got slowly richer and richer  and they add statistics. Isn't it beautiful when they get statistics  You see the importance of that  And here  children don't live longer. The last century        was bad for the kids in Europe  because most of this statistics is Europe. It was only by the turn of the century that more than    percent of the children survived their first year. This is India coming up  with the first data from India. And this is the United States moving away here  earning more money. And we will soon see China coming up in the very far end corner here. And it moves up with Mao Tse Tung getting health  not getting so rich. There he died  then Deng Xiaoping brings money. It moves this way over here. And the bubbles keep moving up there  and this is what the world looks like today. Let us have a look at the United States. We have a function here    I can tell the world   Stay where you are.  And I take the United States    we still want to see the background    I put them up like this  and now we go backwards. And we can see that the United States goes to the right of the mainstream. They are on the money side all the time. And down in       the United States was a neighbor of India    present  contemporary India. And that means United States was richer  but lost more kids than India is doing today  proportionally. And look here    compare to the Philippines of today. The Philippines of today has almost the same economy as the United States during the First World War. But we have to bring United States forward quite a while to find the same health of the United States as we have in the Philippines. About      here  the health of the United States is the same as the Philippines. And this is the drama of this world which many call globalized  is that Asia  Arabic countries  Latin America  are much more ahead in being healthy  educated  having human resources than they are economically. There's a discrepancy in what's happening today in the emerging economies. There now  social benefits  social progress  are going ahead of economical progress. And         the United States had the same economy as Chile has today. And how long do we have to bring United States to get the same health as Chile has today  I think we have to go  there    we have       or         the United States has the same health as Chile. Chile's catching up  Within some years Chile may have better child survival than the United States. This is really a change  that you have this lag of more or less        years' difference on the health. And behind the health is the educational level. And there's a lot of infrastructure things  and general human resources are there. Now we can take away this    and I would like to show you the rate of speed  the rate of change  how fast they have gone. And we go back to       and I want to look at Japan. And I want to look at Sweden and the United States. And I'm going to stage a race here between this sort of yellowish Ford here and the red Toyota down there  and the brownish Volvo. And here we go. Here we go. The Toyota has a very bad start down here  you can see  and the United States Ford is going off road there. And the Volvo is doing quite fine. This is the war. The Toyota got off track  and now the Toyota is coming on the healthier side of Sweden    can you see that  And they are taking over Sweden  and they are now healthier than Sweden. That's the part where I sold the Volvo and bought the Toyota. And now we can see that the rate of change was enormous in Japan. They really caught up. And this changes gradually. We have to look over generations to understand it. And let me show you my own sort of family history    we made these graphs here. And this is the same thing  money down there  and health  you know  And this is my family. This is Sweden        when my great great grandma was born. Sweden was like Sierra Leone today. And this is when great grandma was born      . And Sweden was like Mozambique. And this is when my grandma was born      . She took care of me as a child  so I'm not talking about statistic now    now it's oral history in my family. That's when I believe statistics  when it's grandma verified statistics. I think it's the best way of verifying historical statistics. Sweden was like Ghana. It's interesting to see the enormous diversity within sub Saharan Africa. I told you last year  I'll tell you again  my mother was born in Egypt  and I    who am I  I'm the Mexican in the family. And my daughter  she was born in Chile  and the grand daughter was born in Singapore  now the healthiest country on this Earth. It bypassed Sweden about two to three years ago  with better child survival. But they're very small  you know  They're so close to the hospital we can never beat them out in these forests. But homage to Singapore. Singapore is the best one. Now this looks also like a very good story. But it's not really that easy  that it's all a good story. Because I have to show you one of the other facilities. We can also make the color here represent the variable    and what am I choosing here  Carbon dioxide emission  metric ton per capita. This is       and United States was emitting    tons per person. And China was emitting  .   and India was emitting  .   tons per capita. And what happens when we moved on  Well  you see the nice story of getting richer and getting healthier    everyone did it at the cost of emission of carbon dioxide. There is no one who has done it so far. And we don't have all the updated data any longer  because this is really hot data today. And there we are      . And in the discussion I attended with global leaders  you know  many say now the problem is that the emerging economies  they are getting out too much carbon dioxide. The Minister of the Environment of India said   Well  you were the one who caused the problem.  The OECD countries    the high income countries    they were the ones who caused the climate change.  But we forgive you  because you didn't know it. But from now on  we count per capita. From now on we count per capita. And everyone is responsible for the per capita emission.  This really shows you  we have not seen good economic and health progress anywhere in the world without destroying the climate. And this is really what has to be changed. I've been criticized for showing you a too positive image of the world  but I don't think it's like this. The world is quite a messy place. This we can call Dollar Street. Everyone lives on this street here. What they earn here    what number they live on    is how much they earn per day. This family earns about one dollar per day. We drive up the street here  we find a family here which earns about two to three dollars a day. And we drive away here    we find the first garden in the street  and they earn    to    dollars a day. And how do they live  If we look at the bed here  we can see that they sleep on a rug on the floor. This is what poverty line is       percent of the family income is just to cover the energy needs  the food for the day. This is two to five dollars. You have a bed. And here it's a much nicer bedroom  you can see. I lectured on this for Ikea  and they wanted to see the sofa immediately here. And this is the sofa  how it will emerge from there. And the interesting thing  when you go around here in the photo panorama  you see the family still sitting on the floor there. Although there is a sofa  if you watch in the kitchen  you can see that the great difference for women does not come between one to    dollars. It comes beyond here  when you really can get good working conditions in the family. And if you really want to see the difference  you look at the toilet over here. This can change. This can change. These are all pictures and images from Africa  and it can become much better. We can get out of poverty. My own research has not been in IT or anything like this. I spent    years in interviews with African farmers who were on the verge of famine. And this is the result of the farmers needs research. The nice thing here is that you can't see who are the researchers in this picture. That's when research functions in poor societies    you must really live with the people. When you're in poverty  everything is about survival. It's about having food. And these two young farmers  they are girls now    because the parents are dead from HIV and AIDS    they discuss with a trained agronomist. This is one of the best agronomists in Malawi  Junatambe Kumbira  and he's discussing what sort of cassava they will plant    the best converter of sunshine to food that man has found. And they are very  very eagerly interested to get advice  and that's to survive in poverty. That's one context. Getting out of poverty. The women told us one thing.  Get us technology. We hate this mortar  to stand hours and hours. Get us a mill so that we can mill our flour  then we will be able to pay for the rest ourselves.  Technology will bring you out of poverty  but there's a need for a market to get away from poverty. And this woman is very happy now  bringing her products to the market. But she's very thankful for the public investment in schooling so she can count  and won't be cheated when she reaches the market. She wants her kid to be healthy  so she can go to the market and doesn't have to stay home. And she wants the infrastructure    it is nice with a paved road. It's also good with credit. Micro credits gave her the bicycle  you know. And information will tell her when to go to market with which product. You can do this. I find my experience from    years of Africa is that the seemingly impossible is possible. Africa has not done bad. In    years they've gone from a pre Medieval situation to a very decent     year ago Europe  with a functioning nation and state. I would say that sub Saharan Africa has done best in the world during the last    years. Because we don't consider where they came from. It's this stupid concept of developing countries that puts us  Argentina and Mozambique together    years ago  and says that Mozambique did worse. We have to know a little more about the world. I have a neighbor who knows     types of wine. He knows everything. He knows the name of the grape  the temperature and everything. I only know two types of wine    red and white. But my neighbor only knows two types of countries    industrialized and developing. And I know      I know about the small data. But you can do that. But I have to get serious. And how do you get serious  You make a PowerPoint  you know  Homage to the Office package  no  What is this  what is this  what am I telling  I'm telling you that there are many dimensions of development. Everyone wants your pet thing. If you are in the corporate sector  you love micro credit. If you are fighting in a non governmental organization  you love equity between gender. Or if you are a teacher  you'll love UNESCO  and so on. On the global level  we have to have more than our own thing. We need everything. All these things are important for development  especially when you just get out of poverty and you should go towards welfare. Now  what we need to think about is  what is a goal for development  and what are the means for development  Let me first grade what are the most important means. Economic growth to me  as a public health professor  is the most important thing for development because it explains    percent of survival. Governance. To have a government which functions    that's what brought California out of the misery of     . It was the government that made law function finally. Education  human resources are important. Health is also important  but not that much as a mean. Environment is important. Human rights is also important  but it just gets one cross. Now what about goals  Where are we going toward  We are not interested in money. Money is not a goal. It's the best mean  but I give it zero as a goal. Governance  well it's fun to vote in a little thing  but it's not a goal. And going to school  that's not a goal  it's a mean. Health I give two points. I mean it's nice to be healthy    at my age especially    you can stand here  you're healthy. And that's good  it gets two plusses. Environment is very  very crucial. There's nothing for the grandkid if you don't save up. But where are the important goals  Of course  it's human rights. Human rights is the goal  but it's not that strong of a mean for achieving development. And culture. Culture is the most important thing  I would say  because that's what brings joy to life. That's the value of living. So the seemingly impossible is possible. Even African countries can achieve this. And I've shown you the shot where the seemingly impossible is possible. And remember  please remember my main message  which is this  the seemingly impossible is possible. We can have a good world. I showed you the shots  I proved it in the PowerPoint  and I think I will convince you also by culture. Bring me my sword  Sword swallowing is from ancient India. It's a cultural expression that for thousands of years has inspired human beings to think beyond the obvious. And I will now prove to you that the seemingly impossible is possible by taking this piece of steel    solid steel    this is the army bayonet from the Swedish Army        in the last year we had war. And it's all solid steel    you can hear here. And I'm going to take this blade of steel  and push it down through my body of blood and flesh  and prove to you that the seemingly impossible is possible. Can I request a moment of absolute silence  First place I'd like to take you is what many believe will be the world's deepest natural abyss. And I say believe because this process is still ongoing. Right now there are major expeditions being planned for next year that I'll talk a little bit about. One of the things that's changed here  in the last     years since Jules Verne had great science fiction concepts of what the underworld was like  is that technology has enabled us to go to these places that were previously completely unknown and speculated about. We can now descend thousands of meters into the Earth with relative impunity. Along the way we've discovered fantastic abysses and chambers so large that you can see for hundreds of meters without a break in the line of sight. When you go on a thing like this  we can usually be in the field for anywhere from two to four months  with a team as small as    or     to as big as    . And a lot of people ask me  you know  what kind of people do you get for a project like this  While our selection process is not as rigorous as NASA  it's nonetheless thorough. We're looking for competence  discipline  endurance  and strength. In case you're wondering  this is our strength test. But we also value esprit de corps and the ability to diplomatically resolve inter personal conflict while under great stress in remote locations. We have already gone far beyond the limits of human endurance. From the entrance  this is nothing like a commercial cave. You're looking at Camp Two in a place called J   not K   but J . We're roughly two days from the entrance at that point. And it's kind of like a high altitude mountaineering trip in reverse  except that you're now running a string of these things down. The idea is to try to provide some measure of physical comfort while you're down there  otherwise in damp  moist  cold conditions in utterly dark places. I should mention that everything you're seeing here  by the way  is artificially illuminated at great effort. Otherwise it is completely dark in these places. The deeper you go  the more you run into a conflict with water. It's basically like a tree collecting water coming down. And eventually you get to places where it is formidable and dangerous and unfortunately slides just don't do justice. So I've got a very brief clip here that was taken in the late     s. So descend into Huautla Plateau in Mexico. Now I have to tell you that the techniques being shown here are obsolete and dangerous. We would not do this today unless we were doing it for film. Along that same line  I have to tell you that with the spate of Hollywood movies that came out last year  we have never seen monsters underground    at least the kind that eat you. If there is a monster underground  it is the crushing psychological remoteness that begins to hit every member of the team once you cross about three days inbound from the nearest entrance. Next year I'll be leading an international team to J . We're going to be shooting from minus       meters    that's a little over       feet down    at    kilometers from the entrance. The lead crews will be underground for pushing    days straight. I don't think there's been a mission like that in a long time. Eventually  if you keep going down in these things  probability says that you're going to run into a place like this. It's a place where there's a fold in the geologic stratum that collects water and fills to the roof. And when you used to find these things  they would put a label on a map that said terminal siphon. Now I remember that term really well for two reasons. Number one  it's the name of my rock band  and second  is because the confrontation of these things forced me to become an inventor. And we've since gone on to develop many generations of gadgets for exploring places like this. This is some life support equipment closed cycle. And you can use that now to go for many kilometers horizontally underwater and to depths of     meters straight down underwater. When you do this kind of stuff it's like doing EVA. It's like doing extra vehicular activity in space  but at much greater distances  and at much greater physical peril. So it makes you think about how to design your equipment for long range  away from a safe haven. Here's a clip from a National Geographic movie that came out in     . of putting your foot in places where humans have never stepped before. This is where the last little nugget of totally unknown territory remains on this planet. To experience it is a privilege. Bill Stone  That was taken in Wakulla Springs  Florida. Couple of things to note about that movie. Every piece of equipment that you saw in there did not exist before     . It was developed within a two year period and used on actual exploratory projects. This gadget you see right here was called the digital wall mapper  and it produced the first three dimensional map anybody has ever done of a cave  and it happened to be underwater in Wakulla Springs. It was that gadget that serendipitously opened a door to another unexplored world. This is Europa. Carolyn Porco mentioned another one called Enceladus the other day. This is one of the places where planetary scientists believe there is a highest probability of the detection of the first life off earth in the ocean that exists below there. For those who have never seen this story  Jim Cameron produced a really wonderful IMAX movie couple of years ago  called  Aliens of the Deep.  There was a brief clip    would be the ultimate robotic challenge. Europa is so far away that even at the speed of light  it would take more than an hour for the command just to reach the vehicle. It has to be smart enough to avoid terrain hazards and to find a good landing site on the ice. Now we have to get through the ice. You need a melt probe. It's basically a nuclear heated torpedo. The ice could be anywhere from three to    miles deep. Week after week  the melt probe will sink of its own weight through the ancient ice  until finally    Now  what are you going to do when you reach the surface of that ocean  You need an AUV  an autonomous underwater vehicle. It needs to be one smart puppy  able to navigate and make decisions on its own in an alien ocean. BS  What Jim didn't know when he released that movie was that six months earlier NASA had funded a team I assembled to develop a prototype for the Europa AUV. I mean  I cut through three years of engineering meetings  design and system integration  and introduced DEPTHX    Deep Phreatic Thermal Explorer. And as the movie says  this is one smart puppy. It's got    sensors     onboard computers          lines of behavioral autonomy code  packs more than    kilos of TNT in electrical onboard equivalent. This is the target site  the world's deepest hydrothermal spring at Cenote Zacaton in northern Mexico. It's been explored to a depth of     meters and beyond that nobody knows anything. This is part of DEPTHX's mission. There are two primary targets we're doing here. One is  how do you do science autonomy underground  How do you take a robot and turn it into a field microbiologist  There are more stages involved here than I've got time to tell you about  but basically we drive through the space  we populate it with environmental variables    sulphide  halide  things like that. We calculate gradient surfaces  and drive the bot over to a wall where there's a high probability of life. We move along the wall  in what's called proximity operations  looking for changes in color. If we see something that looks interesting  we pull it into a microscope. If it passes the microscopic test  we go for a collection. We either draw in a liquid sample  or we can actually take a solid core from the wall. No hands at the wheel. This is all behavioral autonomy here that's being conducted by the robot on its own. The real hat trick for this vehicle  though  is a disruptive new navigation system we've developed  known as  D SLAM  for simultaneous localization and mapping. DEPTHX is an all seeing eyeball. Its sensor beams look both forward and backward at the same time  allowing it to do new exploration while it's still achieving geometric sensor lock on what it's gone through already. What I'm going to show you next is the first fully autonomous robotic exploration underground that's ever been done. This May  we're going to go from minus       meters in Zacaton  and if we're very lucky  DEPTHX will bring back the first robotically discovered division of bacteria. The next step after that is to test it in Antartica and then  if the funding continues and NASA has the resolution to go  we could potentially launch by       and by      we may have the first evidence of life off this planet. What then of manned space exploration  The government recently announced plans to return to the moon by     . The successful conclusion of that mission will result in infrequent visitation of the moon by a small number of government scientists and pilots. It will leave us no further along in the general expansion of humanity into space than we were    years ago. Something fundamental has to change if we are to see common access to space in our lifetime. What I'm going to show you next are a couple of controversial ideas. And I hope you'll bear with me and have some faith that there's credibility behind what we're going to say here. There are three underpinnings of working in space privately. One of them is the requirement for economical earth to space transport. The Bert Rutans and Richard Bransons of this world have got this in their sights and I salute them. Go  go  go. The next thing we need are places to stay on orbit. Orbital hotels to start with  but workshops for the rest of us later on. The final missing piece  the real paradigm buster  is this  a gas station on orbit. It's not going to look like that. If it existed  it would change all future spacecraft design and space mission planning. Now  to give you a chance to understand why there is power in that statement  I've got to give you the basics of Space    . And the first thing is everything you do in space you pay by the kilogram. Anybody drink one of these here this week  You'd pay        dollars for that in orbit. That's more than you pay for TED  if Google dropped their sponsorship. The second is more than    percent of the weight of a vehicle is in propellant. Thus  every time you'd want to do anything in space  you are literally blowing away enormous sums of money every time you hit the accelerator. Not even the guys at Tesla can fight that physics. So  what if you could get your gas at a   th the price  There is a place where you can. In fact  you can get it better    you can get it at    times lower if you can find propellant on the moon. There is a little known mission that was launched by the Pentagon     years ago now  called Clementine. And the most amazing thing that came out of that mission was a strong hydrogen signature at Shackleton crater on the south pole of the moon. That signal was so strong  it could only have been produced by    trillion tons of water buried in the sediment  collected over millions and billions of years by the impact of asteroids and comet material. If we're going to get that  and make that gas station possible  we have to figure out ways to move large volumes of payload through space. We can't do that right now. The way you normally build a system right now is you have a tube stack that has to be launched from the ground  and resist all kinds of aerodynamic forces. We have to beat that. We can do it because in space there are no aerodynamics. We can go and use inflatable systems for almost everything. This is an idea that  again  came out of Livermore back in       with Dr. Lowell Wood's group. And we can extend that now to just about everything. Bob Bigelow currently has a test article in the orbit. We can go much further. We can build space tugs  orbiting platforms for holding cryogens and water. There's another thing. When you're coming back from the moon  you have to deal with orbital mechanics. It says you're moving        feet per second faster than you really want to be to get back to your gas station. You got two choices. You can burn rocket fuel to get there  or you can do something really incredible. You can dive into the stratosphere  and precisely dissipate that velocity  and come back out to the space station. It has never been done. It's risky and it's going to be one hell of a ride    better than Disney. The traditional approach to space exploration has been that you carry all the fuel you need to get everybody back in case of an emergency. If you try to do that for the moon  you're going to burn a billion dollars in fuel alone sending a crew out there. But if you send a mining team there  without the return propellant  first    Did any of you guys hear the story of Cortez  This is not like that. I'm much more like Scotty. I like this equipment  you know  and I really value it so we're not going to burn the gear. But  if you were truly bold you could get it there  manufacture it  and it would be the most dramatic demonstration that you could do something worthwhile off this planet that has ever been done. There's a myth that you can't do anything in space for less than a trillion dollars and    years. That's not true. In seven years  we could pull off an industrial mission to Shackleton and demonstrate that you could provide commercial reality out of this in low earth orbit. We're living in one of the most exciting times in history. We're at a magical confluence where private wealth and imagination are driving the demand for access to space. The orbital refueling stations I've just described could create an entirely new industry and provide the final key for opening space to the general exploration. To bust the paradigm a radically different approach is needed. We can do it by jump starting with an industrial Lewis and Clark expedition to Shackleton crater  to mine the moon for resources  and demonstrate they can form the basis for a profitable business on orbit. Talk about space always seems to be hung on ambiguities of purpose and timing. I would like to close here by putting a stake in the sand at TED. I intend to lead that expedition. It can be done in seven years with the right backing. Those who join me in making it happen will become a part of history and join other bold individuals from time past who  had they been here today  would have heartily approved. There was once a time when people did bold things to open the frontier. We have collectively forgotten that lesson. Now we're at a time when boldness is required to move forward.     years after Sir Ernest Shackleton wrote these words  I intend to plant an industrial flag on the moon and complete the final piece that will open the space frontier  in our time  for all of us. Thank you. How many Creationists do we have in the room  Probably none. I think we're all Darwinians. And yet many Darwinians are anxious  a little uneasy    would like to see some limits on just how far the Darwinism goes. It's all right. You know spiderwebs  Sure  they are products of evolution. The World Wide Web  Not so sure. Beaver dams  yes. Hoover Dam  no. What do they think it is that prevents the products of human ingenuity from being themselves  fruits of the tree of life  and hence  in some sense  obeying evolutionary rules  And yet people are interestingly resistant to the idea of applying evolutionary thinking to thinking    to our thinking. And so I'm going to talk a little bit about that  keeping in mind that we have a lot on the program here. So you're out in the woods  or you're out in the pasture  and you see this ant crawling up this blade of grass. It climbs up to the top  and it falls  and it climbs  and it falls  and it climbs    trying to stay at the very top of the blade of grass. What is this ant doing  What is this in aid of  What goals is this ant trying to achieve by climbing this blade of grass  What's in it for the ant  And the answer is  nothing. There's nothing in it for the ant. Well then  why is it doing this  Is it just a fluke  Yeah  it's just a fluke. It's a lancet fluke. It's a little brain worm. It's a parasitic brain worm that has to get into the stomach of a sheep or a cow in order to continue its life cycle. Salmon swim upstream to get to their spawning grounds  and lancet flukes commandeer a passing ant  crawl into its brain  and drive it up a blade of grass like an all terrain vehicle. So there's nothing in it for the ant. The ant's brain has been hijacked by a parasite that infects the brain  inducing suicidal behavior. Pretty scary. Well  does anything like that happen with human beings  This is all on behalf of a cause other than one's own genetic fitness  of course. Well  it may already have occurred to you that Islam means  surrender   or  submission of self interest to the will of Allah.  Well  it's ideas    not worms    that hijack our brains. Now  am I saying that a sizable minority of the world's population has had their brain hijacked by parasitic ideas  No  it's worse than that. Most people have. There are a lot of ideas to die for. Freedom  if you're from New Hampshire. Justice. Truth. Communism. Many people have laid down their lives for communism  and many have laid down their lives for capitalism. And many for Catholicism. And many for Islam. These are just a few of the ideas that are to die for. They're infectious. Yesterday  Amory Lovins spoke about  infectious repititis.  It was a term of abuse  in effect. This is unthinking engineering. Well  most of the cultural spread that goes on is not brilliant  new  out of the box thinking. It's  infectious repetitis   and we might as well try to have a theory of what's going on when that happens so that we can understand the conditions of infection. Hosts work hard to spread these ideas to others. I myself am a philosopher  and one of our occupational hazards is that people ask us what the meaning of life is. And you have to have a bumper sticker  you know. You have to have a statement. So  this is mine. The secret of happiness is  Find something more important than you are and dedicate your life to it. Most of us    now that the  Me Decade  is well in the past    now we actually do this. One set of ideas or another have simply replaced our biological imperatives in our own lives. This is what our summum bonum is. It's not maximizing the number of grandchildren we have. Now  this is a profound biological effect. It's the subordination of genetic interest to other interests. And no other species does anything at all like it. Well  how are we going to think about this  It is  on the one hand  a biological effect  and a very large one. Unmistakable. Now  what theories do we want to use to look at this  Well  many theories. But how could something tie them together  The idea of replicating ideas  ideas that replicate by passing from brain to brain. Richard Dawkins  whom you'll be hearing later in the day  invented the term  memes   and put forward the first really clear and vivid version of this idea in his book  The Selfish Gene.  Now here am I talking about his idea. Well  you see  it's not his. Yes    he started it. But it's everybody's idea now. And he's not responsible for what I say about memes. I'm responsible for what I say about memes. Actually  I think we're all responsible for not just the intended effects of our ideas  but for their likely misuses. So it is important  I think  to Richard  and to me  that these ideas not be abused and misused. They're very easy to misuse. That's why they're dangerous. And it's just about a full time job trying to prevent people who are scared of these ideas from caricaturing them and then running off to one dire purpose or another. So we have to keep plugging away  trying to correct the misapprehensions so that only the benign and useful variants of our ideas continue to spread. But it is a problem. We don't have much time  and I'm going to go over just a little bit of this and cut out  because there's a lot of other things that are going to be said. So let me just point out  memes are like viruses. That's what Richard said  back in '  . And you might think   Well  how can that be  I mean  a virus is    you know  it's stuff  What's a meme made of   Yesterday  Negroponte was talking about viral telecommunications but    what's a virus  A virus is a string of nucleic acid with attitude. That is  there is something about it that tends to make it replicate better than the competition does. And that's what a meme is. It's an information packet with attitude. What's a meme made of  What are bits made of  Mom  Not silicon. They're made of information  and can be carried in any physical medium. What's a word made of  Sometimes when people say   Do memes exist   I say   Well  do words exist  Are they in your ontology   If they are  words are memes that can be pronounced. Then there's all the other memes that can't be pronounced. There are different species of memes. Remember the Shakers  Gift to be simple  Simple  beautiful furniture  And  of course  they're basically extinct now. And one of the reasons is that among the creed of Shaker dom is that one should be celibate. Not just the priests. Everybody. Well  it's not so surprising that they've gone extinct.  Laughter  But in fact that's not why they went extinct. They survived as long as they did at a time when the social safety nets weren't there. And there were lots of widows and orphans  people like that  who needed a foster home. And so they had a ready supply of converts. And they could keep it going. And  in principle  it could've gone on forever  with perfect celibacy on the part of the hosts. The idea being passed on through proselytizing  instead of through the gene line. So the ideas can live on in spite of the fact that they're not being passed on genetically. A meme can flourish in spite of having a negative impact on genetic fitness. After all  the meme for Shaker dom was essentially a sterilizing parasite. There are other parasites that do this    which render the host sterile. It's part of their plan. They don't have to have minds to have a plan. I'm just going to draw your attention to just one of the many implications of the memetic perspective  which I recommend. I've not time to go into more of it. In Jared Diamond's wonderful book   Guns  Germs and Steel   he talks about how it was germs  more than guns and steel  that conquered the new hemisphere    the Western hemisphere    that conquered the rest of the world. When European explorers and travelers spread out  they brought with them the germs that they had become essentially immune to  that they had learned how to tolerate over hundreds and hundreds of years  thousands of years  of living with domesticated animals who were the sources of those pathogens. And they just wiped out    these pathogens just wiped out the native people  who had no immunity to them at all. And we're doing it again. We're doing it this time with toxic ideas. Yesterday  a number of people    Nicholas Negroponte and others    spoke about all the wonderful things that are happening when our ideas get spread out  thanks to all the new technology all over the world. And I agree. It is largely wonderful. Largely wonderful. But among all those ideas that inevitably flow out into the whole world thanks to our technology  are a lot of toxic ideas. Now  this has been realized for some time. Sayyid Qutb is one of the founding fathers of fanatical Islam  one of the ideologues that inspired Osama bin Laden.  One has only to glance at its press films  fashion shows  beauty contests  ballrooms  wine bars and broadcasting stations.  Memes. These memes are spreading around the world and they are wiping out whole cultures. They are wiping out languages. They are wiping out traditions and practices. And it's not our fault  anymore than it's our fault when our germs lay waste to people that haven't developed the immunity. We have an immunity to all of the junk that lies around the edges of our culture. We're a free society  so we let pornography and all these things    we shrug them off. They're like a mild cold. They're not a big deal for us. But we should recognize that for many people in the world  they are a big deal. And we should be very alert to this. As we spread our education and our technology  one of the things that we are doing is we're the vectors of memes that are correctly viewed by the hosts of many other memes as a dire threat to their favorite memes    the memes that they are prepared to die for. Well now  how are we going to tell the good memes from the bad memes  That is not the job of the science of memetics. Memetics is morally neutral. And so it should be. This is not the place for hate and anger. If you've had a friend who's died of AIDS  then you hate HIV. But the way to deal with that is to do science  and understand how it spreads and why in a morally neutral perspective. Get the facts. Work out the implications. There's plenty of room for moral passion once we've got the facts and can figure out the best thing to do. And  as with germs  the trick is not to try to annihilate them. You will never annihilate the germs. What you can do  however  is foster public health measures and the like that will encourage the evolution of avirulence. That will encourage the spread of relatively benign mutations of the most toxic varieties. That's all the time I have  so thank you very much for your attention. I'm going to talk to you today about hopefully converting fear into hope. When we go to the physician today    when we go to the doctor's office and we walk in  there are words that we just don't want to hear. There are words that we're truly afraid of. Diabetes  cancer  Parkinson's  Alzheimer's  heart failure  lung failure    things that we know are debilitating diseases  for which there's relatively little that can be done. And what I want to lay out for you today is a different way of thinking about how to treat debilitating disease  why it's important  why without it perhaps our health care system will melt down if you think it already hasn't  and where we are clinically today  and where we might go tomorrow  and what some of the hurdles are. And we're going to do all of that in    minutes  I promise. I want to start with this slide  because this slide sort of tells the story the way Science Magazine thinks of it. This was an issue from      that they published with a lot of different articles on the bionic human. It was basically a regenerative medicine issue. Regenerative medicine is an extraordinarily simple concept that everybody can understand. It's simply accelerating the pace at which the body heals itself to a clinically relevant timescale. So we know how to do this in many of the ways that are up there. We know that if we have a damaged hip  you can put an artificial hip in. And this is the idea that Science Magazine used on their front cover. This is the complete antithesis of regenerative medicine. This is not regenerative medicine. Regenerative medicine is what Business Week put up when they did a story about regenerative medicine not too long ago. The idea is that instead of figuring out how to ameliorate symptoms with devices and drugs and the like    and I'll come back to that theme a few times    instead of doing that  we will regenerate lost function of the body by regenerating the function of organs and damaged tissue. So that at the end of the treatment  you are the same as you were at the beginning of the treatment. Very few good ideas    if you agree that this is a good idea    very few good ideas are truly novel. And this is just the same. If you look back in history  Charles Lindbergh  who was better known for flying airplanes  was actually one of the first people along with Alexis Carrel  one of the Nobel Laureates from Rockefeller  to begin to think about  could you culture organs  And they published this book in       where they actually began to think about  what could you do in bio reactors to grow whole organs  We've come a long way since then. I'm going to share with you some of the exciting work that's going on. But before doing that  what I'd like to do is share my depression about the health care system and the need for this with you. Many of the talks yesterday talked about improving the quality of life  and reducing poverty  and essentially increasing life expectancy all around the globe. One of the challenges is that the richer we are  the longer we live. And the longer we live  the more expensive it is to take care of our diseases as we get older. This is simply the wealth of a country versus the percent of population over the age of   . And you can basically see that the richer a country is  the older the people are within it. Why is this important  And why is this a particularly dramatic challenge right now  If the average age of your population is     then the average kind of disease that you have to treat is maybe a broken ankle every now and again  maybe a little bit of asthma. If the average age in your country is    to     now the average person is looking at diabetes  early onset diabetes  heart failure  coronary artery disease    things that are inherently more difficult to treat  and much more expensive to treat. Just have a look at the demographics in the U.S. here. This is from  The Untied States of America.  In       there were    workers per retiree.    people who were basically outside of being really sick  paying for the one retiree who was experiencing debilitating disease. In       two workers per retiree in the U.S. And this is matched in every industrialized  wealthy country in the world. How can you actually afford to treat patients when the reality of getting old looks like this  This is age versus cost of health care. And you can see that right around age        to     there's a sudden spike in the cost of health care. It's actually quite interesting. If you do the right studies  you can look at how much you as an individual spend on your own health care  plotted over your lifetime. And about seven years before you're about to die  there's a spike. And you can actually       we won't get into that. There are very few things  very few things that you can really do that will change the way that you can treat these kinds of diseases and experience what I would call healthy aging. I'd suggest there are four things  and none of these things include an insurance system or a legal system. All those things do is change who pays. They don't actually change what the actual cost of the treatment is. One thing you can do is not treat. You can ration health care. We won't talk about that anymore. It's too depressing. You can prevent. Obviously a lot of monies should be put into prevention. But perhaps most interesting  to me anyway  and most important  is the idea of diagnosing a disease much earlier on in the progression  and then treating the disease to cure the disease instead of treating a symptom. Think of it in terms of diabetes  for instance. Today  with diabetes  what do we do  We diagnose the disease eventually  once it becomes symptomatic  and then we treat the symptom for                years. And we do OK. Insulin's a pretty good therapy. But eventually it stops working  and diabetes leads to a predictable onset of debilitating disease. Why couldn't we just inject the pancreas with something to regenerate the pancreas early on in the disease  perhaps even before it was symptomatic  And it might be a little bit expensive at the time that we did it  but if it worked  we would truly be able to do something different. This video  I think  gets across the concept that I'm talking about quite dramatically. This is a newt re growing its limb. If a newt can do this kind of thing  why can't we  I'll actually show you some more important features about limb regeneration in a moment. But what we're talking about in regenerative medicine is doing this in every organ system of the body  for tissues and for organs themselves. So today's reality is that if we get sick  the message is we will treat your symptoms  and you need to adjust to a new way of life. I would pose to you that tomorrow    and when tomorrow is we could debate  but it's within the foreseeable future    we will talk about regenerative rehabilitation. There's a limb prosthetic up here  similar actually one on the soldier that's come back from Iraq. There are     soldiers that have come back from Iraq that have lost limbs. Imagine if instead of facing that  they could actually face the regeneration of that limb. It's a wild concept. I'll show you where we are at the moment in working towards that concept. But it's applicable  again  to every organ system. How can we do that  The way to do that is to develop a conversation with the body. We need to learn to speak the body's language. And to switch on processes that we knew how to do when we were a fetus. A mammalian fetus  if it loses a limb during the first trimester of pregnancy  will re grow that limb. So our DNA has the capacity to do these kinds of wound healing mechanisms. It's a natural process  but it is lost as we age. In a child  before the age of about six months  if they lose their fingertip in an accident  they'll re grow their fingertip. By the time they're five  they won't be able to do that anymore. So to engage in that conversation with the body  we need to speak the body's language. And there are certain tools in our toolbox that allow us to do this today. I'm going to give you an example of three of these tools through which to converse with the body. The first is cellular therapies. Clearly  we heal ourselves in a natural process  using cells to do most of the work. Therefore  if we can find the right cells and implant them in the body  they may do the healing. Secondly  we can use materials. We heard yesterday about the importance of new materials. If we can invent materials  design materials  or extract materials from a natural environment  then we might be able to have those materials induce the body to heal itself. And finally  we may be able to use smart devices that will offload the work of the body and allow it to heal. I'm going to show you an example of each of these  and I'm going to start with materials. Steve Badylak    who's at the University of Pittsburgh    about a decade ago had a remarkable idea. And that idea was that the small intestine of a pig  if you threw away all the cells  and if you did that in a way that allowed it to remain biologically active  may contain all of the necessary factors and signals that would signal the body to heal itself. And he asked a very important question. He asked the question  if I take that material  which is a natural material that usually induces healing in the small intestine  and I place it somewhere else on a person's body  would it give a tissue specific response  or would it make small intestine if I tried to make a new ear  I wouldn't be telling you this story if it weren't compelling. The picture I'm about to show you is a compelling picture. However  for those of you that are even the slightest bit squeamish    even though you may not like to admit it in front of your friends    the lights are down. This is a good time to look at your feet  check your Blackberry  do anything other than look at the screen. What I'm about to show you is a diabetic ulcer. And although    it's good to laugh before we look at this. This is the reality of diabetes. I think a lot of times we hear about diabetics  diabetic ulcers  we just don't connect the ulcer with the eventual treatment  which is amputation  if you can't heal it. So I'm going to put the slide up now. It won't be up for long. This is a diabetic ulcer. It's tragic. The treatment for this is amputation. This is an older lady. She has cancer of the liver as well as diabetes  and has decided to die with what' s left of her body intact. And this lady decided  after a year of attempted treatment of that ulcer  that she would try this new therapy that Steve invented. That's what the wound looked like    weeks later. That material contained only natural signals. And that material induced the body to switch back on a healing response that it didn't have before. There's going to be a couple more distressing slides for those of you    I'll let you know when you can look again. This is a horse. The horse is not in pain. If the horse was in pain  I wouldn't show you this slide. The horse just has another nostril that's developed because of a riding accident. Just a few weeks after treatment    in this case  taking that material  turning it into a gel  and packing that area  and then repeating the treatment a few times    and the horse heals up. And if you took an ultrasound of that area  it would look great. Here's a dolphin where the fin's been re attached. There are now         patients around the world who have used that material to heal their wounds. Could you regenerate a limb  DARPA just gave Steve    million dollars to lead an eight institution project to begin the process of asking that question. And I'll show you the    million dollar picture. This is a    year old man who's lost the end of his fingertip. Remember that I mentioned before the children who lose their fingertips. After treatment that's what it looks like. This is happening today. This is clinically relevant today. There are materials that do this. Here are the heart patches. But could you go a little further  Could you  say  instead of using material  can I take some cells along with the material  and remove a damaged piece of tissue  put a bio degradable material on there  You can see here a little bit of heart muscle beating in a dish. This was done by Teruo Okano at Tokyo Women's Hospital. He can actually grow beating tissue in a dish. He chills the dish  it changes its properties and he peels it right out of the dish. It's the coolest stuff. Now I'm going to show you cell based regeneration. And what I'm going to show you here is stem cells being removed from the hip of a patient. Again  if you're squeamish  you don't want to watch. But this one's kind of cool. So this is a bypass operation  just like what Al Gore had  with a difference. In this case  at the end of the bypass operation  you're going to see the stem cells from the patient that were removed at the beginning of the procedure being injected directly into the heart of the patient. And I'm standing up here because at one point I'm going to show you just how early this technology is. Here go the stem cells  right into the beating heart of the patient. And if you look really carefully  it's going to be right around this point you'll actually see a back flush. You see the cells coming back out. We need all sorts of new technology  new devices  to get the cells to the right place at the right time. Just a little bit of data  a tiny bit of data. This was a randomized trial. At this time this was an N of   . Now there's an N of about    . Basically  if you take an extremely sick patient and you give them a bypass  they get a little bit better. If you give them stem cells as well as their bypass  for these particular patients  they became asymptomatic. These are now two years out. The coolest thing would be is if you could diagnose the disease early  and prevent the onset of the disease to a bad state. This is the same procedure  but now done minimally invasively  with only three holes in the body where they're taking the heart and simply injecting stem cells through a laparoscopic procedure. There go the cells. We don't have time to go into all of those details  but basically  that works too. You can take patients who are less sick  and bring them back to an almost asymptomatic state through that kind of therapy. Here's another example of stem cell therapy that isn't quite clinical yet  but I think very soon will be. This is the work of Kacey Marra from Pittsburgh  along with a number of colleagues around the world. They've decided that liposuction fluid  which    in the United States  we have a lot of liposuction fluid. It's a great source of stem cells. Stem cells are packed in that liposuction fluid. So you could go in  you could get your tummy tuck. Out comes the liposuction fluid  and in this case  the stem cells are isolated and turned into neurons. All done in the lab. And I think fairly soon  you will see patients being treated with their own fat derived  or adipose derived  stem cells. I talked before about the use of devices to dramatically change the way we treat disease. Here's just one example before I close up. This is equally tragic. We have a very abiding and heartbreaking partnership with our colleagues at the Institute for Surgical Research in the US Army  who have to treat the now        kids that have come back from Iraq. Many of those patients are very severely burned. And if there's anything that's been learned about burn  it's that we don't know how to treat it. Everything that is done to treat burn    basically we do a sodding approach. We make something over here  and then we transplant it onto the site of the wound  and we try and get the two to take. In this case here  a new  wearable bio reactor has been designed    it should be tested clinically later this year at ISR    by Joerg Gerlach in Pittsburgh. And that bio reactor will lay down in the wound bed. The gun that you see there sprays cells. That's going to spray cells over that area. The reactor will serve to fertilize the environment  deliver other things as well at the same time  and therefore we will seed that lawn  as opposed to try the sodding approach. It's a completely different way of doing it. So my    minutes is up. So let me finish up with some good news  and maybe a little bit of bad news. The good news is that this is happening today. It's very powerful work. Clearly the images kind of get that across. It's incredibly difficult because it's highly inter disciplinary. Almost every field of science engineering and clinical practice is involved in trying to get this to happen. A number of governments  and a number of regions  have recognized that this is a new way to treat disease. The Japanese government were perhaps the first  when they decided to invest first   billion  later another   billion in this field. It's no coincidence. Japan is the oldest country on earth in terms of its average age. They need this to work or their health system dies. So they're putting a lot of strategic investment focused in this area. The European Union  same thing. China  the same thing. China just launched a national tissue engineering center. The first year budget was     million US dollars. In the United States we've had a somewhat different approach. Oh  for Al Gore to come and be in the real world as president. We've had a different approach. And the approach has basically been to just sort of fund things as they come along. But there's been no strategic investment to bring all of the necessary things to bear and focus them in a careful way. And I'm going to finish up with a quote  maybe a little cheap shot  at the director of the NIH  who's a very charming man. Myself and Jay Vacanti from Harvard went to visit with him and a number of his directors of his institute just a few months ago  to try and convince him that it was time to take just a little piece of that   .  billion dollars that he's going to get next year and focus it  in a strategic way  to make sure we can accelerate the pace at which these things get to patients. And at the end of a very testy meeting  what the NIH director said was   Your vision is larger than our appetite.  I'd like to close by saying that no one's going to change our vision  but together we can change his appetite. Thank you. So I really consider myself a storyteller. But I don't really tell stories in the usual way  in the sense that I don't usually tell my own stories. Instead  I'm really interested in building tools that allow large numbers of other people to tell their stories  people all around the world. I do this because I think that people actually have a lot in common. I think people are very similar  but I also think that we have trouble seeing that. You know  as I look around the world I see a lot of gaps  and I think we all see a lot of gaps. And we define ourselves by our gaps. There's language gaps  there's ethnicity and racial gaps  there's age gaps  there's gender gaps  there's sexuality gaps  there's wealth and money gaps  there's education gaps  there's also religious gaps. You know  we have all these gaps and I think we like our gaps because they make us feel like we identify with something  some smaller community. But I think that actually  despite our gaps  we really have a lot in common. And I think one thing we have in common is a very deep need to express ourselves. I think this is a very old human desire. It's nothing new. But the thing about self expression is that there's traditionally been this imbalance between the desire that we have to express ourselves and the number of sympathetic friends who are willing to stand around and listen. This  also  is nothing new. Since the dawn of human history  we've tried to rectify this imbalance by making art  writing poems  singing songs  scripting editorials and sending them in to a newspaper  gossiping with friends. This is nothing new. What's new is that in the last several years a lot of these very traditional physical human activities  these acts of self expression  have been moving onto the Internet. And as that's happened  people have been leaving behind footprints  footprints that tell stories of their moments of self expression. And so what I do is  I write computer programs that study very large sets of these footprints  and then try to draw conclusions about the people who left them    what they feel  what they think  what's different in the world today than usual  these sorts of questions. One project that explores these ideas  which was made about a year ago  is a piece called We Feel Fine. This is a piece that every two or three minutes scans the world's newly posted blog entries for occurrences of the phrases  I feel  or  I am feeling.  And when it finds one of those phrases  it grabs the sentence up to the period  and then automatically tries to deduce the age  gender and geographical location of the person that wrote that sentence. Then  knowing the geographical location and the time  we can also then figure out the weather when that person wrote the sentence. All of this information is saved in a database that collects about        feelings a day. It's been running for about a year and a half. It's reached about seven and a half million human feelings now. And I'll show you a glimpse of how this information is then visualized. So this is We Feel Fine. What you see here is a madly swarming mass of particles  each of which represents a single human feeling that was stated in the last few hours. The color of each particle corresponds to the type of feeling inside    so that happy  positive feelings are brightly colored. And sad  negative feelings are darkly colored. The diameter of each dot represents the length of the sentence inside  so that the large dots contain large sentences  and the small dots contain small sentences. Any dot can be clicked and expanded. And we see here   I would just feel so much better if I could curl up in his arms right now and feel his affection for me in the embrace of his body and the tenderness of his lips.  So it gets pretty hot and steamy sometimes in the world of human emotions. And all of these are stated by people   I know that objectively it really doesn't mean much  but after spending so many years as a small fish in a big pond  it's nice to feel bigger again.  The dots exhibit human qualities. They kind of have their own physics  and they swarm wildly around  kind of exploring the world of life. And then they also exhibit curiosity. You can see a few of them are swarming around the cursor right now. You can see some other ones are swarming around the bottom left corner of the screen around six words. Those six words represent the six movements of We Feel Fine. We're currently seeing Madness. There's also Murmurs  Montage  Mobs  Metrics and Mounds. And I'll walk you through a few of those now. Murmurs causes all of the feelings to fly to the ceiling. And then  one by one  in reverse chronological order  they excuse themselves  entering the scrolling list of feelings.  I feel a bit better now.   I feel confused and unsure of what the hell I want to do.   I feel gypped out of something awesome here.   I feel so free  I feel so good.   I feel like I'm in this fog of depression that I can't get out of.  And you can click any of these to go out and visit the blog from which it was collected. And in that way  you can connect with the authors of these statements if you feel some degree of empathy. The next movement is called Montage. Montage causes all of the feelings that contain photographs to become extracted and display themselves in a grid. This grid is then said to represent the picture of the world's feelings in the last few hours  if you will. Each of these can be clicked and we can blow it up. We see   I just feel like I'm not going to have fun if it's not the both of us.  That was from someone in Michigan. We see   I feel like I have been at a computer all day.  These are automatically constructed using the found objects   I think I feel a little full.  The next movement is called mobs. Mobs provides different statistical breakdowns of the population of the world's feelings in the last few hours. We see that  better  is the most frequent feeling right now  followed by  good    bad    guilty    right    down    sick  and so on. We can also get a gender breakdown. And we see that women are slightly more prolific talking about their emotions in the last few hours than men. We can do an age breakdown  which gives us a histogram of the world's emotional distribution by age. We see people in their twenties are the most prolific  followed by teenagers  and then people in their thirties  and it dies out very quickly from there. In weather  the feelings assume the physical characteristics of the weather that they represent  so that the ones collected on a sunny day swirl around as if they're part of the sun. The cloudy ones float along as if they're on a breeze. The rainy ones fall down as if they're in a rainstorm  and the snowy ones kind of flutter to the ground. Finally  location causes the feelings to move to their positions on a world map showing the geographical distribution of feelings. Metrics provides more numerical views on the data. We see that the world is feeling  used  at  .  times the normal level right now. They're feeling  warm  at  .  times the normal level  and so on. Other views are also available. Here are gender  age  weather  location. The final movement is called Mounds. It's a bit different from the others. Mounds visualizes the entire dataset as large  gelatinous blobs which kind of jiggle. And if I hold down my cursor  they do a little dance. We see  better  is the most frequent feeling  followed by  bad.  And then if I go over here  the list begins to scroll  and there are actually thousands of feelings that have been collected. You can see the little pink cursor moving along  representing our position. Here we see people that feel  slipping    nauseous    responsible.  There's also a search capability  if you're interested in finding out about a certain population. For instance  you could find women who feel  addicted  in their   s when it was cloudy in Bangladesh. But I'll spare you that. So here are some of my favorite montages that have been collected   I feel so much of my dad alive in me that there isn't even room for me.   I feel very lonely.   I need to be in some backwoods redneck town so that I can feel beautiful.   I feel invisible to you.   I wouldn't hide it if society didn't make me feel like I needed to.   I feel in love with Carolyn.   I feel so naughty.   I feel these weirdoes are actually an asset to college life.   I love how I feel today.  So as you can see  We Feel Fine uses a technique that I call  passive observation.  What I mean by that is that it passively observes people as they live their lives. It scans the world's blogs and looks at what people are writing  and these people don't know they're being watched or interviewed. And because of that  you end up getting very honest  candid  sincere responses that are often very moving. And this is a technique that I usually prefer in my work because people don't know they're being interviewed. They're just living life  and they end up just acting like that. Another technique is directly questioning people. And this is a technique that I explored in a different project  the Yahoo  Time Capsule  which was designed to take a fingerprint of the world in     . It was divided into ten very simple themes    love  anger  sadness and so on    each of which contained a single  very open ended question put to the world  What do you love  What makes you angry  What makes you sad  What do you believe in  And so on. The time capsule was available for one month online  translated into    languages  and this is what it looked like. It's a spinning globe  the surface of which is entirely composed of the pictures and words and drawings of people that submitted to the time capsule. The ten themes radiate out and orbit the time capsule. You can sift through this data and see what people have submitted. This is in response to  What's beautiful   Miss World.  There are two modes to the time capsule. There's One World  which presents the spinning globe  and Many Voices  which splits the data out into film strips and lets you sift through them one by one. So this project was punctuated by a really amazing event  which was held in the desert outside Albuquerque in New Mexico at the Jemez Pueblo  where for three consecutive nights  the contents of the capsule were projected onto the sides of the ancient Red Rock Canyon walls  which stand about     feet tall. It was really incredible. And we also projected the contents of the time capsule as binary code using a    watt laser into outer space. You can see the orange line leaving the desert floor at about a    degree angle there. This was amazing because the first night I looked at all this information and really started seeing the gaps that I talked about earlier    the differences in age  gender and wealth and so on. But  you know  as I looked at this more and more and more  and saw these images go across the rocks  I realized I was seeing the same archetypal events depicted again and again and again. You know  weddings  births  funerals  the first car  the first kiss  the first camel or horse    depending on the culture. And it was really moving. And this picture here was taken the final night from a distant cliff about two miles away  where the contents of the capsule were being beamed into space. And there was something very moving about all of this human expression being shot off into the night sky. And it started to make me think a lot about the night sky  and how humans have always used the night sky to project their great stories. You know  as a child in Vermont  on a farm where I grew up  I would often look up into the dark sky and see the three star belt of Orion  the Hunter. And as an adult  I've been more aware of the great Greek myths playing out in the sky overhead every night. You know  Orion facing the roaring bull. Perseus flying to the rescue of Andromeda. Zeus battling Chronos for control of Mount Olympus. I mean  these are the great tales of the Greeks. And it caused me to wonder about our world today. And it caused me to wonder specifically  if we could make new constellations today  what would those look like  What would those be  If we could make new pictures in the sky  what would we draw  What are the great stories of today  And those are the questions that inspired my new project  which is debuting here today at TED. Nobody's seen this yet  publicly. It's called Universe  Revealing Our Modern Mythology. And it uses this metaphor of an interactive night sky. So  it's my great pleasure now to show this to you. So  Universe will open here. And you'll see that it leads with a shifting star field  and there's an Aurora Borealis in the background  kind of morphing with color. The color of the Aurora Borealis can be controlled using this single bar of color at the bottom  and we'll put it down here to red. So you see this kind of    these stars moving along. Now  these aren't just little points of light  little pixels. Each of those stars actually represents a specific event in the real world    a quote that was stated by somebody  an image  a news story  a person  a company. You know  some kind of heroic personality. And you might notice that as the cursor begins to touch some of these stars  that shapes begin to emerge. We see here there's a little man walking along  or maybe a woman. And we see here a photograph with a head. You can start to see words emerging here. And those are the constellations of today. And I can turn them all on  and you can see them moving across the sky now. This is the universe of       the last two months. The data from this is global news coverage from thousands of news sources around the world. It's using the API of a really great company that I work with in New York  actually  called Daylife. And it's kind of the zeitgeist view at this level of the world's current mythology over the last couple of months. So we can see where it's emerging here  like President Ford  Iraq  Bush. And we can actually isolate just the words    I call them secrets    and we can cause them to form an alphabetical list. And we see Anna Nicole Smith playing a big role recently. President Ford    this is Gerald Ford's funeral. We can actually click anything in Universe and have it become the center of the universe  and everything else will enter its orbit. So  we'll click Ford  and now that becomes the center. And the things that relate to Ford enter its orbit and swirl around it. We can isolate just the photographs  and we now see those. We can click on one of those and have the photograph be the center of the universe. Now the things that relate to it are swirling around. We can click on this and we see this iconic image of Betty Ford kissing her husband's coffin. In Universe  there's kind of no end. It just goes infinitely  and you can just kind of click on stuff. This is a photographic representation  called Snapshots. But we can actually be more specific in defining our universe. So  if we want to  let's check out what Bill Clinton's universe looks like. And let's see  in the past week  what he's been up to. So now  we have a new universe  which is just constrained to all things Bill Clinton. We can have his constellations emerge here. We can pull out his secrets  and we see that it has a lot to do with candidates  Hillary  presidential  Barack Obama. We can see the stories that Bill Clinton is taking part in right now. Any of those can be opened up. So we see Obama and the Clintons meet in Alabama. You can see that this is an important story  there are a lot of things in its orbit. If we open this up  we get different perspectives on this story. You can click any of those to go out and read the article at the source. This one's from Al Jazeera. We can also see the superstars. These would be the people that are kind of the looming heroes and heroines in the universe of Bill Clinton. So there's Bill Clinton  Hillary  Iraq  George Bush  Barack Obama  Scooter Libby    these are kind of the people of Bill Clinton. We can also see a world map  so this shows us the geographic reach of Bill Clinton in the last week or so. We can see he's been focused in America because he's been campaigning  probably  but a little bit of action over here in the Middle East. And then we can also see a timeline. So we see that he was a bit quiet on Saturday  but he was back to work on Sunday morning  and actually been tapering off since then this week. And it's not limited to just people or dates  but we can actually put in concepts also. So if I put in climate change for all of       we'll see what that universe looks like. Here we have our star field. Here we have our shapes. Here we have our secrets. So we see again  climate change is large  Nairobi  global conference  environmental. And there are also quotes that you can see  if you're interested in reading about quotes on climate change. You know  this is really an infinite thing. The superstars of climate change in       United States  Britain  China. You know  these are the towering countries that kind of define this concept. So this is a piece that demands exploration. This will be online in several days  probably next Tuesday. And you'll all be able to use it and kind of explore what your own personal mythology might be. You'll notice that in Daylife    rather  in Universe    it supports both the notion of a global mythology  which is represented by something as broad as  say        and also a personal mythology. As you search for the things that are important to you in your world  and then see what the constellations of those might look like. So it's been a pleasure. Thank you very much. So I want to talk to you today about AIDS in sub Saharan Africa. And this is a pretty well educated audience  so I imagine you all know something about AIDS. You probably know that roughly    million people in Africa are infected with the virus  that AIDS is a disease of poverty  and that if we can bring Africa out of poverty  we would decrease AIDS as well. If you know something more  you probably know that Uganda  to date  is the only country in sub Saharan Africa that has had success in combating the epidemic. Using a campaign that encouraged people to abstain  be faithful  and use condoms    the ABC campaign    they decreased their prevalence in the     s from about    percent to   percent over just a few years. If you follow policy  you probably know that a few years ago the president pledged    billion dollars to fight the epidemic over five years  and a lot of that money is going to go to programs that try to replicate Uganda and use behavior change to encourage people and decrease the epidemic. So today I'm going to talk about some things that you might not know about the epidemic  and I'm actually also going to challenge some of these things that you think that you do know. To do that I'm going to talk about my research as an economist on the epidemic. And I'm not really going to talk much about the economy. I'm not going to tell you about exports and prices. But I'm going to use tools and ideas that are familiar to economists to think about a problem that's more traditionally part of public health and epidemiology. And I think in that sense  this fits really nicely with this lateral thinking idea. Here I'm really using the tools of one academic discipline to think about problems of another. So we think  first and foremost  AIDS is a policy issue. And probably for most people in this room  that's how you think about it. But this talk is going to be about understanding facts about the epidemic. It's going to be about thinking about how it evolves  and how people respond to it. I think it may seem like I'm ignoring the policy stuff  which is really the most important  but I'm hoping that at the end of this talk you will conclude that we actually cannot develop effective policy unless we really understand how the epidemic works. And the first thing that I want to talk about  the first thing I think we need to understand is  how do people respond to the epidemic  So AIDS is a sexually transmitted infection  and it kills you. So this means that in a place with a lot of AIDS  there's a really significant cost of sex. If you're an uninfected man living in Botswana  where the HIV rate is    percent  if you have one more partner this year    a long term partner  girlfriend  mistress    your chance of dying in    years increases by three percentage points. That is a huge effect. And so I think that we really feel like then people should have less sex. And in fact among gay men in the US we did see that kind of change in the     s. So if we look in this particularly high risk sample  they're being asked   Did you have more than one unprotected sexual partner in the last two months   Over a period from '   to '    that share drops from about    percent to    percent. It's a huge change in a very short period of time. We didn't see anything like that in Africa. So we don't have quite as good data  but you can see here the share of single men having pre marital sex  or married men having extra marital sex  and how that changes from the early '  s to late '  s  and late '  s to early     s. The epidemic is getting worse. People are learning more things about it. We see almost no change in sexual behavior. These are just tiny decreases    two percentage points    not significant. This seems puzzling. But I'm going to argue that you shouldn't be surprised by this  and that to understand this you need to think about health the way than an economist does    as an investment. So if you're a software engineer and you're trying to think about whether to add some new functionality to your program  it's important to think about how much it costs. It's also important to think about what the benefit is. And one part of that benefit is how much longer you think this program is going to be active. If version    is coming out next week  there's no point in adding more functionality into version nine. But your health decisions are the same. Every time you have a carrot instead of a cookie  every time you go to the gym instead of going to the movies  that's a costly investment in your health. But how much you want to invest is going to depend on how much longer you expect to live in the future  even if you don't make those investments. AIDS is the same kind of thing. It's costly to avoid AIDS. People really like to have sex. But  you know  it has a benefit in terms of future longevity. But life expectancy in Africa  even without AIDS  is really  really low     or    years in a lot of places. I think it's possible  if we think about that intuition  and think about that fact  that maybe that explains some of this low behavior change. But we really need to test that. And a great way to test that is to look across areas in Africa and see  do people with more life expectancy change their sexual behavior more  And the way that I'm going to do that is  I'm going to look across areas with different levels of malaria. So malaria is a disease that kills you. It's a disease that kills a lot of adults in Africa  in addition to a lot of children. And so people who live in areas with a lot of malaria are going to have lower life expectancy than people who live in areas with limited malaria. So one way to test to see whether we can explain some of this behavior change by differences in life expectancy is to look and see is there more behavior change in areas where there's less malaria. So that's what this figure shows you. This shows you    in areas with low malaria  medium malaria  high malaria    what happens to the number of sexual partners as you increase HIV prevalence. If you look at the blue line  the areas with low levels of malaria  you can see in those areas  actually  the number of sexual partners is decreasing a lot as HIV prevalence goes up. Areas with medium levels of malaria it decreases some    it doesn't decrease as much. And areas with high levels of malaria    actually  it's increasing a little bit  although that's not significant. This is not just through malaria. Young women who live in areas with high maternal mortality change their behavior less in response to HIV than young women who live in areas with low maternal mortality. There's another risk  and they respond less to this existing risk. So by itself  I think this tells a lot about how people behave. It tells us something about why we see limited behavior change in Africa. But it also tells us something about policy. Even if you only cared about AIDS in Africa  it might still be a good idea to invest in malaria  in combating poor indoor air quality  in improving maternal mortality rates. Because if you improve those things  then people are going to have an incentive to avoid AIDS on their own. But it also tells us something about one of these facts that we talked about before. Education campaigns  like the one that the president is focusing on in his funding  may not be enough  at least not alone. If people have no incentive to avoid AIDS on their own  even if they know everything about the disease  they still may not change their behavior. So the other thing that I think we learn here is that AIDS is not going to fix itself. People aren't changing their behavior enough to decrease the growth in the epidemic. So we're going to need to think about policy and what kind of policies might be effective. And a great way to learn about policy is to look at what worked in the past. The reason that we know that the ABC campaign was effective in Uganda is we have good data on prevalence over time. In Uganda we see the prevalence went down. We know they had this campaign. That's how we learn about what works. It's not the only place we had any interventions. Other places have tried things  so why don't we look at those places and see what happened to their prevalence  Unfortunately  there's almost no good data on HIV prevalence in the general population in Africa until about     . So if I asked you   Why don't you go and find me the prevalence in Burkina Faso in        You get on Google  you Google  and you find  actually the only people tested in Burkina Faso in      are STD patients and pregnant women  which is not a terribly representative group of people. Then if you poked a little more  you looked a little more at what was going on  you'd find that actually that was a pretty good year  because in some years the only people tested are IV drug users. But even worse    some years it's only IV drug users  some years it's only pregnant women. We have no way to figure out what happened over time. We have no consistent testing. Now in the last few years  we actually have done some good testing. In Kenya  in Zambia  and a bunch of countries  there's been testing in random samples of the population. But this leaves us with a big gap in our knowledge. So I can tell you what the prevalence was in Kenya in       but I can't tell you anything about      or     . So this is a problem for policy. It was a problem for my research. And I started thinking about how else might we figure out what the prevalence of HIV was in Africa in the past. And I think that the answer is  we can look at mortality data  and we can use mortality data to figure out what the prevalence was in the past. To do this  we're going to have to rely on the fact that AIDS is a very specific kind of disease. It kills people in the prime of their lives. Not a lot of other diseases have that profile. And you can see here    this is a graph of death rates by age in Botswana and Egypt. Botswana is a place with a lot of AIDS  Egypt is a place without a lot of AIDS. And you see they have pretty similar death rates among young kids and old people. That suggests it's pretty similar levels of development. But in this middle region  between    and     the death rates in Botswana are much  much  much higher than in Egypt. But since there are very few other diseases that kill people  we can really attribute that mortality to HIV. But because people who died this year of AIDS got it a few years ago  we can use this data on mortality to figure out what HIV prevalence was in the past. So it turns out  if you use this technique  actually your estimates of prevalence are very close to what we get from testing random samples in the population  but they're very  very different than what UNAIDS tells us the prevalences are. So this is a graph of prevalence estimated by UNAIDS  and prevalence based on the mortality data for the years in the late     s in nine countries in Africa. You can see  almost without exception  the UNAIDS estimates are much higher than the mortality based estimates. UNAIDS tell us that the HIV rate in Zambia is    percent  and mortality estimates suggest it's only about   percent. And these are not trivial differences in mortality rates. So this is another way to see this. You can see that for the prevalence to be as high as UNAIDS says  we have to really see    deaths per        rather than    deaths per        in this age group. I'm going to talk a little bit in a minute about how we can use this kind of information to learn something that's going to help us think about the world. But this also tells us that one of these facts that I mentioned in the beginning may not be quite right. If you think that    million people are infected  if you think that the UNAIDS numbers are much too high  maybe that's more like    or    million. It doesn't mean that AIDS isn't a problem. It's a gigantic problem. But it does suggest that that number might be a little big. What I really want to do  is I want to use this new data to try to figure out what makes the HIV epidemic grow faster or slower. And I said in the beginning  I wasn't going to tell you about exports. When I started working on these projects  I was not thinking at all about economics  but eventually it kind of sucks you back in. So I am going to talk about exports and prices. And I want to talk about the relationship between economic activity  in particular export volume  and HIV infections. So obviously  as an economist  I'm deeply familiar with the fact that development  that openness to trade  is really good for developing countries. It's good for improving people's lives. But openness and inter connectedness  it comes with a cost when we think about disease. I don't think this should be a surprise. On Wednesday  I learned from Laurie Garrett that I'm definitely going to get the bird flu  and I wouldn't be at all worried about that if we never had any contact with Asia. And HIV is actually particularly closely linked to transit. The epidemic was introduced to the US by actually one male steward on an airline flight  who got the disease in Africa and brought it back. And that was the genesis of the entire epidemic in the US. In Africa  epidemiologists have noted for a long time that truck drivers and migrants are more likely to be infected than other people. Areas with a lot of economic activity    with a lot of roads  with a lot of urbanization    those areas have higher prevalence than others. But that actually doesn't mean at all that if we gave people more exports  more trade  that that would increase prevalence. By using this new data  using this information about prevalence over time  we can actually test that. And so it seems to be    fortunately  I think    it seems to be the case that these things are positively related. More exports means more AIDS. And that effect is really big. So the data that I have suggests that if you double export volume  it will lead to a quadrupling of new HIV infections. So this has important implications both for forecasting and for policy. From a forecasting perspective  if we know where trade is likely to change  for example  because of the African Growth and Opportunities Act or other policies that encourage trade  we can actually think about which areas are likely to be heavily infected with HIV. And we can go and we can try to have pre emptive preventive measures there. Likewise  as we're developing policies to try to encourage exports  if we know there's this externality    this extra thing that's going to happen as we increase exports    we can think about what the right kinds of policies are. But it also tells us something about one of these things that we think that we know. Even though it is the case that poverty is linked to AIDS  in the sense that Africa is poor and they have a lot of AIDS  it's not necessarily the case that improving poverty    at least in the short run  that improving exports and improving development    it's not necessarily the case that that's going to lead to a decline in HIV prevalence. So throughout this talk I've mentioned a few times the special case of Uganda  and the fact that it's the only country in sub Saharan Africa with successful prevention. It's been widely heralded. It's been replicated in Kenya  and Tanzania  and South Africa and many other places. But now I want to actually also question that. Because it is true that there was a decline in prevalence in Uganda in the     s. It's true that they had an education campaign. But there was actually something else that happened in Uganda in this period. There was a big decline in coffee prices. Coffee is Uganda's major export. Their exports went down a lot in the early     s    and actually that decline lines up really  really closely with this decline in new HIV infections. So you can see that both of these series    the black line is export value  the red line is new HIV infections    you can see they're both increasing. Starting about      they're both going down a lot. And then actually they track each other a little bit on the increase later in the decade. So if you combine the intuition in this figure with some of the data that I talked about before  it suggests that somewhere between    percent and    percent of the decline in prevalence in Uganda actually would have happened even without any education campaign. But that's enormously important for policy. We're spending so much money to try to replicate this campaign. And if it was only    percent as effective as we think that it was  then there are all sorts of other things maybe we should be spending our money on instead. Trying to change transmission rates by treating other sexually transmitted diseases. Trying to change them by engaging in male circumcision. There are tons of other things that we should think about doing. And maybe this tells us that we should be thinking more about those things. I hope that in the last    minutes I've told you something that you didn't know about AIDS  and I hope that I've gotten you questioning a little bit some of the things that you did know. And I hope that I've convinced you maybe that it's important to understand things about the epidemic in order to think about policy. But more than anything  you know  I'm an academic. And when I leave here  I'm going to go back and sit in my tiny office  and my computer  and my data. And the thing that's most exciting about that is every time I think about research  there are more questions. There are more things that I think that I want to do. And what's really  really great about being here is I'm sure that the questions that you guys have are very  very different than the questions that I think up myself. And I can't wait to hear about what they are. So thank you very much. I've always wanted to be a cyborg. One of my favorite shows as a kid was  The Six Million Dollar Man   and this is a little bit closer to the     dollar man or so  but    At at any rate. I would normally feel very self conscious and geeky wearing this around  but a few days ago I saw one world renowned statistician swallowing swords on stage here  so I figure it's OK amongst this group. But that's not what I want to talk about today. I want to talk about toys  and the power that I see inherent in them. When I was a kid  I attended Montessori school up to sixth grade in Atlanta  Georgia. And at the time I didn't think much about it  but then later  I realized that that was the high point of my education. From that point on  everything else was pretty much downhill. And it wasn't until later  as I started making games  that    I really actually think of them more as toys. People call me a game designer  but I really think of these things more as toys. But I started getting very interested in Maria Montessori and her methods  and the way she went about things  and the way she thought it very valuable for kids to kind of discover things on their own rather than being taught these things overtly. And she would design these toys  where kids in playing with the toys would actually come to understand these deep principles of life and nature through play. And since they discovered those things  it really stuck with them so much more  and also they would experience their own failures  there was a failure based aspect to learning there. It was very important. And so  the games that I do  I think of really more as modern Montessori toys. And I really kind of want them to be presented in a way to where kids can kind of explore and discover their own principles. So a few years ago  I actually started getting very interested in the SETI program. And that's the way I work. I get interested in different kinds of subjects  I dive in  I research them  and then I try to figure out how to craft a toy around that  so that other people can kind of experience the same sense of discovery as I did as I was learning that subject. And it kind of led me to astrobiology  which is the study of possible life in the universe. And then Drake's Equation  which is looking at the probability of life arising on planets  how long it might last  how many planets are out there  stuff like that. And I started looking at how interesting Drake's Equation was  because it spanned all these different subjects    physics  chemistry  sociology  economics  astronomy. And another thing that really impressed me a long time ago was  Powers of Ten   Charles and Ray Eames' film. And I started putting those two together and wondering  could I build a toy where kids would kind of trip across all these interesting principles of life  as it exists and as it might go in the future. Things where you might trip across things like the Copernican Principle  the Fermi Paradox  the Anthropic Principle  the origin of life. And so I'm going to show you a toy today that I've been working on  that I think of more than anything else as kind of a philosophy toy. In playing this toy  you kind of    this will bring up philosophical questions in you. This game's called  Spore.  I've been working on it for several years. It's getting pretty close to finished now. It occurs at all these different scales  first of all  from very  very small to very  very large. I'm just going to pop in at the start of the game. And you actually start this game in a drop of water  as a very  very small single cell creature  and right off the bat you basically just have to live  survive  reproduce. So here we are  at a very microscopic scale  swimming around. And I actually realize that cells don't have eyes  but it helps to make it cute. The players are going to play through every generation of this species  and as you play the game the creature is actually growing bit by bit. And as we start growing the camera will actually start zooming out  and things that you see in the background there will actually start slowly pulling into the foreground  showing you a little bit of what you'll be interacting with as you grow. So as we eat  the camera starts pulling out  and then we start interacting with kind of larger and larger organisms. Now  we actually play through many generations here  at the cellular scale. I'm going to skip ahead here. At some point we get larger  and we actually get to a macro evolution scale. Now at this point we're leaving the water  and one thing that's kind of important about this game is that  at every level  the player is designing their creature  and that's a fundamental aspect of this. Now  in the evolution game here  the creature scale  basically you have to eat  survive  and then reproduce. You know  very Darwinian. One thing we noticed with  The Sims   which is a game I did earlier  is that players love making stuff. When they were able to make stuff in the game they had a tremendous amount of empathy in connection to it. Even if it wasn't as pretty as what other people would make it    as a professional artist would make for games    it really stuck with them and they really cared about what would happen to it. So at this point  we've left the water  and now with this little creature    we could bring up the volume a little bit    and now we might try to eat. We might sneak up on this little guy over here maybe  and try and eat him. OK  well  we fight. OK  we got him. Now we get a meal. So really  at this part of the game  what we're doing is we're running around and surviving  and also getting to the next generation  because we're going to play through every generation of this creature. We can mate  so I'm going to see if one of these creatures wants to mate with me. Yeah. We didn't want to replay actual evolution with humans and all that  because it's almost more interesting to look at alternate possibilities in evolution. Evolution is usually presented as this one path that we took through  but really it represents this huge set of possibilities. Now once we mate  we click on the egg. And this is where the game starts getting interesting  because one of the things we really focused on here was giving the players very high leverage tools  so that for a very small amount of effort the player can make something very cool. And it involves a lot of intelligence on the tool side. But basically  this is the editor where we're going to design the next generation of our creature. So it has a little spine. I can move around here. I can extend. I can also inflate or deflate it with the mouse wheel  so you sculpt it like clay. We have parts here that I can put on or pull off. The idea is that the player can basically design anything they can think of in this editor  and we'll basically bring it to life. So  for instance  I might put some limbs on the character here. I'll inflate them kind of large. And in this case I might decide I'm going to put    I'll put mouths on the limbs. So pretty much players are encouraged to be very creative in the game. Here  I'll give it one eye in the middle  maybe scale it up a bit. Point it down. And I'll also give it a few legs. So in some sense we want this to feel like an amplifier for the player's imagination  so that with a very small number of clicks a player can create something that they didn't really think was possible before. You know  this is almost like designing something like Maya that an eight year old can use. But really the goal here was  within about a minute  I wanted somebody to replicate what typically takes a pictorial artist several weeks to create. OK  now I'll put some hands on it. OK  so here I've basically thrown together a little creature. Let me give it a little weapon on the tail here  so it can fight. OK  so that's the complete model. Now we can actually go to the painting phase. Now  at this phase  the program actually has some understanding of the topology of this creature. It kind of knows where the backbone is  where the spine  the limbs are. It kind of knows how stripes should run  how it should be shaded. And so we're procedurally generating the texture map  and this is something a texture artist would take many  many days to work on. And then we can test it out  once we've done that  and see how it would move around. And so at this point the computer is procedurally animating this creature. It's looking at whatever I've designed. It will actually bring it to life. And I can see how it might dance. how it might show emotions  how it might fight. So it's acting with its two mouths there. I can even have it pose for a photo. Snap a little photo of it. So at any rate  then I bring this back into the game. It's born  and I play the next generation of my creature through evolution. Now again  the empathy that the players have when they create the content is tremendous. Now  when players create content in this game  it's automatically sent up to a server and then redistributed to all the other players transparently. So in fact  as I'm interacting in this world with other creatures  these creatures are transparently coming from other players as they play. So the process of playing the game is a process of building up this huge database of content. And pretty much everything you're going to see in this game  there's an editor for in the game that the player can create  all the way up through civilization. This is my baby. When I eat  I'll actually start growing. This is the next generation. But I'm going to skip way ahead here. Now  normally what would happen is these creatures would work their way up  eventually become intelligent. I'd start dealing with tribes  cities and civilizations of them over time. I'm going to skip way ahead here to the space phase. Eventually they would go out into space  and start colonizing and exploring the universe. Now really  in some sense  I want the players to be building this world in their imagination  and then extracting it from them with the least amount of pain. So that's kind of what these tools are about  are  how do we make the game play the player's imagination amplifier  And how do we make these tools  these editors  something that are just as fun as the game itself  So this is the planet that we've been playing on up to this point in the game. So far the entire game has been played on the surface of this little world here. Now  at this point we're actually dealing with a very little toy planet. Almost  again  like the Montessori toy idea. You know  what happens if you give somebody a toy planet  and let them play with a lot of dynamics on it  what could they discover  What might they learn on this  This world was actually extracted from the player's imagination. So  this is the planet that the player evolved on. Things like the buildings  and the vehicles  the architecture  civilizations were all designed by the player up to this point. So here's a little city with some of our guys kind of walking around in it. And most games kind of put the player in the role of Luke Skywalker  this protagonist playing through this story. Really  this is more about putting the player in the role of George Lucas  you know  I want them  after they've played this game  to have extracted an entire world that they're now interacting with. Now  as we pull down here  we still have a whole set of creatures living on the surface of the planet. There are all these different dynamics going on here. In fact  I can look over here  and this is kind of a little simplified food web that's going on with the creatures. I can open this up and then scan what exists on the surface  and get some sense of the diversity of creatures that were brought in. Some of these were created by the player  others by other players and automatically sent over here. But there's a very simple little kind of calculation of what's required  how much plants are required for the herbivores to live  how many herbivores for the carnivores to eat  etc.  that you actually have to balance actively. Now also with this phase  we're getting more and more God like powers for the player  and you can kind of experiment with this planet again as a toy. So I can come in and I can do things  and just treat this planet as a lump of clay. We have very simple little weather systems you see here  very simple geology. For instance  I could open one of my tools here and then carve out rivers. So this whole thing is kind of like a big lump of clay  a sculpture. I can also play with the dynamics of this world over time. So one of the things I can do is start pumping more CO  gases into the atmosphere  and so that's what I'm doing here. There's actually a little read out down there of our planetary atmosphere  pressure and temperature. So as I start pumping in more atmosphere  we're going to start pushing up the greenhouse gases here and if you'll start noticing  we start seeing the ocean levels rise over time. And our cities are going to be at risk too  because a lot of these are coastal cities. You can see the ocean levels are rising now and as they encroach upon the cities  I'll start losing cities here. So basically  I want the players to be able to experiment and explore a huge amount of failure space. So there goes one city. Now over time  this is actually going to heat up the planet. So at first what we're going to see is a global ocean rise here on this little toy planet  but then over time    I can speed it up just a little bit    we'll actually see the heat impact of that as well. So not only will it get hotter  but at some point it's going to get so hot the oceans will entirely evaporate. So at first they'll go up  and then they'll evaporate  and that'll be my planet. So basically  what we're getting here is the sequel to  An Inconvenient Truth   in about two minutes  and that actually brings up an interesting point about games. Now here  our entire oceans are evaporating off the surface  and as it keeps getting hotter at some point the entire planet's going to melt down. Here it goes. So we're not only simulating biological dynamics    food webs and all that    but also geologic  you know  on a very simple core scale. And what's interesting to me about games  in some sense  is that I think we can take a lot of long term dynamics and compress them into very short term kind of experiences. Because it's so hard for people to think    or     years out  but when you can give them a toy  and they can experience these long term dynamics in just a few minutes  I think it's an entirely different kind of point of view  where we're actually mapping  using the game to re map our intuition. It's almost in the same way that a telescope or microscope recalibrates your eyesight  I think computer simulations can recalibrate your instinct across vast scales of both space and time. So here's our little solar system  as we pull away from our melted planet here. We actually have a couple of other planets in this solar system. Let's fly to another one. So in fact  we're going to have this unlimited number of worlds you can kind of explore here. Now  as we move into the future  and we start going out in this space and doing stuff  we're drawing a lot from things like science fiction. And all my favorite science fiction movies I want to basically play out here as different dynamics. So this planet actually has some life on it. Here it is  some indigenous life down here. Now one of the tools I can eventually earn for my UFO is a monolith that I can drop down. Now as you can see  these guys are actually starting to go up and bow to it  and over time  once they touch it  they will become intelligent. So I can actually pick a species on a planet and then make them sentient. You see  now they've actually gone to tribal dynamics. And now  because I'm actually the one here  I can  if I want to  get out of the UFO and walk up  and they should be worshipping me at this point as a god. At first they're a little freaked out. OK  well maybe they're not worshipping me. I think I'll leave before they get hostile. But we basically want a diversity of activities the players can play through this. Basically  I want to be able to play   The Day the Earth Stood Still          A Space Odyssey    Star Trek    War Of the Worlds.  Now as we pull away from this world    we're going to keep pulling away from the star now. One of the things that always frustrated me a little bit about astronomy when I was a kid is how it was always presented so two dimensionally and so static. As we pull away from the star here  we're actually going now out into interstellar space  and we're getting a sense of the space around our home star. Now what I really wanted to do is to present this  basically as wonderfully  D as it is actually is. And not only that  but also show the dynamics  and a lot of the interesting objects that you might find  maybe like in the Hubble  at pretty much realistic frequencies and scales. So most people have no idea of the difference between like  an emission nebula and a planetary nebula. But these are the things that we can kind of put in this little galaxy here. So we're flying over here to what looks like a black hole. I want to basically have the entire zoo of Hubble objects that people can kind of interact with and play with  again  as toys. So here's a little black hole that we probably don't want to get too close to. But we also have stars and things as well. If we pull all the way back  we start seeing the entire galaxy here  kind of slowly in motion. And this is another thing where  typically when people present galaxies  it's always been these very beautiful photos  but they're always static. And when you actually bring it forward in time and start animating it  it's actually kind of amazing  what a galaxy would look like  fast forwarded. This would be about one million years a second  because you have about roughly one supernova every century or so. And so you'd have this wonderful sparkling thing  with the disk slowly rotating  and this is roughly what it would look like. And so really  part of this is about bringing the beauty of this  of the natural world  to somebody in a very imaginative way  so that they can start calibrating their instinct across these vast scales of space and time. Chris was wondering what kind of gods that the players would become. Because if you think about it  you're going to have    year olds     year olds  whatever  flying around this universe. And they might be a nurturing god. They might be boot strapping life on planets  trying to terra form and spread civilization. You might be a vengeful god and going out and conquesting  because you actually can do that  you can go in and attack other intelligent races. You might be a networking god  building alliances  which you can also do in the game  or just curious  going around and wanting to explore as much as you possibly can. But basically  the reason why I make toys like this is because I think if there's one difference I could possibly make in the world  that I would choose to make  it's that I would like to somehow give people just a little bit better calibration on long term thinking. Because I think most of the problems that our world is facing right now is the result of short term thinking  and the fact that it is so hard for us to think          or       years out. And I think by giving kids toys like this and letting them replay dynamics  very long term dynamics over the short term  and getting some sense of what we're doing now  what it's going to be like in     years  I think probably is the most effective thing I can be doing to help the world. And so that's why I think  personally  that toys can change the world. Thank you. This is a recent comic strip from the Los Angeles Times. The punch line   On the other hand  I don't have to get up at four every single morning to milk my Labrador.  This is a recent cover of New York Magazine. Best hospitals where doctors say they would go for cancer treatment  births  strokes  heart disease  hip replacements    a.m. emergencies. And this is a song medley I put together    Did you ever notice that four in the morning has become some sort of meme or shorthand  It means something like you are awake at the worst possible hour. A time for inconveniences  mishaps  yearnings. A time for plotting to whack the chief of police  like in this classic scene from  The Godfather.  Coppola's script describes these guys as   exhausted in shirt sleeves. It is four in the morning.  A time for even grimmer stuff than that  like autopsies and embalmings in Isabel Allende's  The House of the Spirits.  After the breathtaking green haired Rosa is murdered  the doctors preserve her with unguents and morticians' paste. They worked until four o'clock in the morning. A time for even grimmer stuff than that  like in last April's New Yorker magazine. This short fiction piece by Martin Amis starts out   On September           he opened his eyes at   a.m. in Portland  Maine  and Mohamed Atta's last day began.  For a time that I find to be the most placid and uneventful hour of the day  four in the morning sure gets an awful lot of bad press    across a lot of different media from a lot of big names. And it made me suspicious. I figured  surely some of the most creative artistic minds in the world  really  aren't all defaulting back to this one easy trope like they invented it  right  Could it be there is something more going on here  Something deliberate  something secret  and who got the four in the morning bad rap ball rolling anyway  I say this guy    Alberto Giacometti  shown here with some of his sculptures on the Swiss     franc note. He did it with this famous piece from the New York Museum of Modern Art. Its title     The Palace at Four in the Morning        . Not just the earliest cryptic reference to four in the morning I can find. I believe that this so called first surrealist sculpture may provide an incredible key to virtually every artistic depiction of four in the morning to follow it. I call this The Giacometti Code  a TED exclusive. No  feel free to follow along on your Blackberries or your iPhones if you've got them. It works a little something like    this is a recent Google search for four in the morning. Results vary  of course. This is pretty typical. The top    results yield you four hits for Faron Young's song   It's Four in the Morning   three hits for Judi Dench's film   Four in the Morning   one hit for Wislawa Szymborska's poem   Four in the Morning.  But what  you may ask  do a Polish poet  a British Dame  a country music hall of famer all have in common besides this totally excellent Google ranking  Well  let's start with Faron Young    who was born incidentally in     . In       he shot himself in the head on December ninth    which incidentally is Judi Dench's birthday. But he didn't die on Dench's birthday. He languished until the following afternoon when he finally succumbed to a supposedly self inflicted gunshot wound at the age of       which incidentally is how old Alberto Giacometti was when he died. Where was Wislawa Szymborska during all this  She has the world's most absolutely watertight alibi. On that very day  December          while Mr. Four in the Morning  Faron Young  was giving up the ghost in Nashville  Tennessee  Ms. Four in the Morning    or one of them anyway    Wislawa Szymborska was in Stockholm  Sweden  accepting the Nobel Prize for Literature.     years to the day after the death of Alfred Nobel himself. Coincidence  No  it's creepy. Coincidence to me has a much simpler metric. That's like me telling you   Hey  you know the Nobel Prize was established in       which coincidentally is the same year Alberto Giacometti was born   No  not everything fits so tidily into the paradigm  but that does not mean there's not something going on at the highest possible levels. In fact there are people in this room who may not want me to show you this clip we're about to see. Video  Homer Simpson  We have a tennis court  a swimming pool  a screening room    You mean if I want pork chops  even in the middle of the night  your guy will fry them up  Herbert Powell  Sure  that's what he's paid for. Now do you need towels  laundry  maids  HS  Wait  wait  wait  wait  wait  wait    let me see if I got this straight. It is Christmas Day    a.m. There's a rumble in my stomach. Marge Simpson  Homer  please. Rives  Wait  wait  wait  wait  wait  wait  wait. Let me see if I got this straight  Matt. When Homer Simpson needs to imagine the most remote possible moment of not just the clock  but the whole freaking calendar  he comes up with      on the birthday of the Baby Jesus. And no  I don't know how it works into the whole puzzling scheme of things  but obviously I know a coded message when I see one. I said  I know a coded message when I see one. And folks  you can buy a copy of Bill Clinton's  My Life  from the bookstore here at TED. Parse it cover to cover for whatever hidden references you want. Or you can go to the Random House website where there is this excerpt. And how far down into it you figure we'll have to scroll to get to the golden ticket  Would you believe about a dozen paragraphs  This is page     on your paperbacks if you're following along   Though it was getting better  I still wasn't satisfied with the inaugural address. My speechwriters must have been tearing their hair out because as we worked between one and four in the morning on Inauguration Day  I was still changing it.  Sure you were  because you've prepared your entire life for this historic quadrennial event that just sort of sneaks up on you. And then    three paragraphs later we get this little beauty   We went back to Blair House to look at the speech for the last time. It had gotten a lot better since   a.m.  Well  how could it have  By his own writing  this man was either asleep  at a prayer meeting with Al and Tipper or learning how to launch a nuclear missile out of a suitcase. What happens to American presidents at      on inauguration day  What happened to William Jefferson Clinton  We might not ever know. And I noticed  he's not exactly around here today to face any tough questions. It could get awkward  right  I mean after all  this whole business happened on his watch. But if he were here    he might remind us  as he does in the wrap up to his fine autobiography  that on this day Bill Clinton began a journey    a journey that saw him go on to become the first Democrat president elected to two consecutive terms in decades. In generations. The first since this man  Franklin Delano Roosevelt  who began his own unprecedented journey way back at his own first election  way back in a simpler time  way back in         the year Alberto Giacometti made  The Palace at Four in the Morning.  The year  let's remember  that this voice  now departed  first came a cryin' into this big old crazy world of ours. I'm a medical illustrator  and I come from a slightly different point of view. I've been watching  since I grew up  the expressions of truth and beauty in the arts and truth and beauty in the sciences. And while these are both wonderful things in their own right    they both have very wonderful things going for them    truth and beauty as ideals that can be looked at by the sciences and by math are almost like the ideal conjoined twins that a scientist would want to date. These are expressions of truth as awe full things  by meaning they are things you can worship. They are ideals that are powerful. They are irreducible. They are unique. They are useful    sometimes  often a long time after the fact. And you can actually roll some of the pictures now  because I don't want to look at me on the screen. Truth and beauty are things that are often opaque to people who are not in the sciences. They are things that describe beauty in a way that is often only accessible if you understand the language and the syntax of the person who studies the subject in which truth and beauty is expressed. If you look at the math  E mc squared  if you look at the cosmological constant  where there's an anthropic ideal  where you see that life had to evolve from the numbers that describe the universe    these are things that are really difficult to understand. And what I've tried to do since I had my training as a medical illustrator    since I was taught animation by my father  who was a sculptor and my visual mentor    I wanted to figure out a way to help people understand truth and beauty in the biological sciences by using animation  by using pictures  by telling stories so that the things that are not necessarily evident to people can be brought forth  and can be taught  and can be understood. Students today are often immersed in an environment where what they learn is subjects that have truth and beauty embedded in them  but the way they're taught is compartmentalized and it's drawn down to the point where the truth and beauty are not always evident. It's almost like that old recipe for chicken soup where you boil the chicken until the flavor is just gone. We don't want to do that to our students. So we have an opportunity to really open up education. And I had a telephone call from Robert Lue at Harvard  in the Molecular and Cellular Biology Department  a couple of years ago. He asked me if my team and I would be interested and willing to really change how medical and scientific education is done at Harvard. So we embarked on a project that would explore the cell    that would explore the truth and beauty inherent in molecular and cellular biology so that students could understand a larger picture that they could hang all of these facts on. They could have a mental image of the cell as a large  bustling  hugely complicated city that's occupied by micro machines. And these micro machines really are at the heart of life. These micro machines  which are the envy of nanotechnologists the world over  are self directed  powerful  precise  accurate devices that are made out of strings of amino acids. And these micro machines power how a cell moves. They power how a cell replicates. They power our hearts. They power our minds. And so what we wanted to do was to figure out how we could make this story into an animation that would be the centerpiece of BioVisions at Harvard  which is a website that Harvard has for its molecular and cellular biology students that will    in addition to all the textual information  in addition to all the didactic stuff    put everything together visually  so that these students would have an internalized view of what a cell really is in all of its truth and beauty  and be able to study with this view in mind  so that their imaginations would be sparked  so that their passions would be sparked and so that they would be able to go on and use these visions in their head to make new discoveries and to be able to find out  really  how life works. So we set out by looking at how these molecules are put together. We worked with a theme  which is  you've got macrophages that are streaming down a capillary  and they're touching the surface of the capillary wall  and they're picking up information from cells that are on the capillary wall  and they are given this information that there's an inflammation somewhere outside  where they can't see and sense. But they get the information that causes them to stop  causes them to internalize that they need to make all of the various parts that will cause them to change their shape  and try to get out of this capillary and find out what's going on. So these molecular motors    we had to work with the Harvard scientists and databank models of the atomically accurate molecules and figure out how they moved  and figure out what they did. And figure out how to do this in a way that was truthful in that it imparted what was going on  but not so truthful that the compact crowding in a cell would prevent the vista from happening. And so what I'm going to show you is a three minute Reader's Digest version of the first aspect of this film that we produced. It's an ongoing project that's going to go another four or five years. And I want you to look at this and see the paths that the cell manufactures    these little walking machines  they're called kinesins    that take these huge loads that would challenge an ant in relative size. Run the movie  please. But these machines that power the inside of the cells are really quite amazing  and they really are the basis of all life because all of these machines interact with each other. They pass information to each other. They cause different things to happen inside the cell. And the cell will actually manufacture the parts that it needs on the fly  from information that's brought from the nucleus by molecules that read the genes. No life  from the smallest life to everybody here  would be possible without these little micro machines. In fact  it would really  in the absence of these machines  have made the attendance here  Chris  really quite sparse. This is the FedEx delivery guy of the cell. This little guy is called the kinesin  and he pulls a sack that's full of brand new manufactured proteins to wherever it's needed in the cell    whether it's to a membrane  whether it's to an organelle  whether it's to build something or repair something. And each of us has about         of these things running around  right now  inside each one of your     trillion cells. So no matter how lazy you feel  you're not really intrinsically doing nothing. So what I want you to do when you go home is think about this  and think about how powerful our cells are. And think about some of the things that we're learning about cellular mechanics. Once we figure out all that's going on    and believe me  we know almost a percent of what's going on    once we figure out what's going on  we're really going to be able to have a lot of control over what we do with our health  with what we do with future generations  and how long we're going to live. And hopefully we'll be able to use this to discover more truth  and more beauty. But it's really quite amazing that these cells  these micro machines  are aware enough of what the cell needs that they do their bidding. They work together. They make the cell do what it needs to do. And their working together helps our bodies    huge entities that they will never see    function properly. Enjoy the rest of the show. Thank you. Allison Hunt  My three minutes hasn't started yet  has it  Chris Anderson  No  you can't start the three minutes. Reset the three minutes  that's just not fair. AH  Oh my God  it's harsh up here. I mean I'm nervous enough as it is. But I am not as nervous as I was five weeks ago. Five weeks ago I had total hip replacement surgery. Do you know that surgery  Electric saw  power drill  totally disgusting unless you're David Bolinsky  in which case it's all truth and beauty. Sure David  if it's not your hip  it's truth and beauty. Anyway  I did have a really big epiphany around the situation  so Chris invited me to tell you about it. But first you need to know two things about me. Just two things. I'm Canadian  and I'm the youngest of seven kids. Now  in Canada  we have that great healthcare system. That means we get our new hips for free. And being the youngest of seven  I have never been at the front of the line for anything. OK  So my hip had been hurting me for years. I finally went to the doctor  which was free. And she referred me to an orthopedic surgeon  also free. Finally got to see him after    months of waiting    almost a year. That is what free gets you. I met the surgeon  and he took some free X rays  and I got a good look at them. And you know  even I could tell my hip was bad  and I actually work in marketing. So he said   Allison  we've got to get you on the table. I'm going to replace your hip    it's about an    month wait.     more months. I'd already waited    months  and I had to wait    more months. You know  it's such a long wait that I actually started to even think about it in terms of TEDs. I wouldn't have my new hip for this TED. I wouldn't have my new hip for TEDGlobal in Africa. I would not have my new hip for TED    . I would still be on my bad hip. That was so disappointing. So  I left his office and I was walking through the hospital  and that's when I had my epiphany. This youngest of seven had to get herself to the front of the line. Oh yeah. Can I tell you how un Canadian that is  We do not think that way. We don't talk about it. It's not even a consideration. In fact  when we're traveling abroad  it's how we identify fellow Canadians.  After you.   Oh  no  no. After you.  Hey  are you from Canada   Oh  me too  Hi    Great  Excellent   So no  suddenly I wasn't averse to butting any geezer off the list. Some    year old who wanted his new hip so he could be back golfing  or gardening. No  no. Front of the line. So by now I was walking the lobby  and of course  that hurt  because of my hip  and I kind of needed a sign. And I saw a sign. In the window of the hospital's tiny gift shop there was a sign that said   Volunteers Needed.  Hmm. Well  they signed me up immediately. No reference checks. None of the usual background stuff  no. They were desperate for volunteers because the average age of the volunteer at the hospital gift shop was   . Yeah. They needed some young blood. So  next thing you know  I had my bright blue volunteer vest  I had my photo ID  and I was fully trained by my    year old boss. I worked alone. Every Friday morning I was at the gift shop. While ringing in hospital staff's Tic Tacs  I'd casually ask   What do you do   Then I'd tell them   Well  I'm getting my hip replaced    in    months. It's gonna be so great when the pain stops. Ow   All the staff got to know the plucky  young volunteer. My next surgeon's appointment was  coincidentally  right after a shift at the gift shop. So  naturally  I had my vest and my identification. I draped them casually over the chair in the doctor's office. And you know  when he walked in  I could just tell that he saw them. Moments later  I had a surgery date just weeks away  and a big fat prescription for Percocet. Now  word on the street was that it was actually my volunteering that got me to the front of the line. And  you know  I'm not even ashamed of that. Two reasons. First of all  I am going to take such good care of this new hip. But also I intend to stick with the volunteering  which actually leads me to the biggest epiphany of them all. Even when a Canadian cheats the system  they do it in a way that benefits society. Well  first of all  let me thank Emeka    as a matter of fact  TED Global    for putting this conference together. This conference is going to rank as the most important in the beginning of the   st century. Think African governments will put together a conference like this  You think the A.U. will put together a conference like this  Even before they do that they will ask for foreign aid. I would also like to pay homage and honor to the TED Fellows June Arunga  James Shikwati  Andrew  and the other TED Fellows. I call them the Cheetah Generation. The Cheetah Generation is a new breed of Africans who brook no nonsense about corruption. They understand what accountability and democracy is. They're not going to wait for government to do things for them. That's the Cheetah Generation  and Africa's salvation rests on the backs of these Cheetahs. In contrast  of course  we have the Hippo Generation. The Hippo Generation are the ruling elites. They are stuck in their intellectual patch. Complaining about colonialism and imperialism  they wouldn't move one foot. If you ask them to reform the economies  they're not going to reform it because they benefit from the rotten status quo. Now  there are a lot of Africans who are very angry  angry at the condition of Africa. Now  we're talking about a continent that is not poor. It is rich in mineral resources  natural mineral resources. But the mineral wealth of Africa is not being utilized to lift its people out of poverty. That's what makes a lot of Africans very angry. And in a way  Africa is more than a tragedy  in more ways than one. There's another enduring tragedy  and that tragedy is that there are so many people  so many governments  so many organizations who want to help the people in Africa. They don't understand. Now  we're not saying don't help Africa. Helping Africa is noble. But helping Africa has been turned into a theater of the absurd. It's like the blind leading the clueless. There are certain things that we need to recognize. Africa's begging bowl leaks. Did you know that    percent of the wealth created in Africa is not invested here in Africa  It's taken out of Africa. That's what the World Bank says. Look at Africa's begging bowl. It leaks horribly. There are people who think that we should pour more money  more aid into this bowl which leaks. What are the leakages  Corruption alone costs Africa     billion dollars a year. Yes  put that aside. Capital flight out of Africa     billion a year. Put that aside. Let's take food imports. Every year Africa spends    billion dollars to import food. Just add that up  all these leakages. That's far more than the    billion Tony Blair wants to raise for Africa. Now  back in the     s Africa not only fed itself  it also exported food. Not anymore. We know that something has gone fundamentally wrong. You know it  I know it  but let's not waste our time talking about these mistakes because we'll spend all day here. Let's move on  and flip over to the next chapter  and that's what this conference is all about    the next chapter. The next chapter begins with first of all  asking ourselves this fundamental question   Whom do we want to help in Africa   There is the people  and then there is the government or leaders. Now  the previous speaker before me  Idris Mohammed  indicated that we've had abysmal leadership in Africa. That characterization  in my view  is even more charitable. I belong to an Internet discussion forum  an African Internet discussion forum  and I asked them  I said   Since       we've had exactly     African heads of state  since     .  And I asked them to name me just    good leaders  just    good leaders    you may want to take this leadership challenge yourself. I asked them to name me just   . Everybody mentioned Nelson Mandela  of course. Kwame Nkrumah  Nyerere  Kenyatta    somebody mentioned Idi Amin. I let that pass. My point is  they couldn't go beyond   . Even if they had been able to name me     what does that tell you     out of     means that the vast majority of the African leaders failed their people. And if you look at them  the slate of the post colonial leaders    an assortment of military fufu heads  Swiss bank socialists  crocodile liberators  vampire elites  quack revolutionaries. Now  this leadership is a far cry from the traditional leaders that Africans have known for centuries. The second false premise that we make when we're trying to help Africa is that sometimes we think that there is something called a government in Africa that cares about its people  serves the interests of the people  and represents the people. There is one particular quote    a Lesotho chief once said that  Here in Lesotho  we've got two problems  rats and the government.  What you and I understand as a government doesn't exist in many African countries. In fact  what we call our governments are vampire states. Vampires because they suck the economic vitality out of their people. Government is the problem in Africa. A vampire state is the government       which has been hijacked by a phalanx of bandits and crooks who use the instruments of state power to enrich themselves  their cronies  and tribesmen and exclude everybody else. The richest people in Africa are heads of state and ministers  and quite often the chief bandit is the head of state himself. Where do they get their money  By creating wealth  No. By raking it off the backs of their suffering people. That's not wealth creation. It's wealth redistribution. The third fundamental issue that we have to recognize is that if we want to help the African people  we must know where the African people are. Take any African economy. An African economy can be broken up into three sectors. There is the modern sector  there is the informal sector and the traditional sector. The modern sector is the abode of the elites. It's the seat of government. In many African countries the modern sector is lost. It's dysfunctional. It is a meretricious fandango of imported systems  which the elites themselves don't understand. That is the source of many of Africa's problems where the struggles for political power emanate and then spill over onto the informal and the traditional sector  claiming innocent lives. Now the modern sector  of course  is where a lot of the development aid and resources went into. More than    percent of Ivory Coast's development went into the modern sector. The other sectors  the informal and the traditional sectors  are where you find the majority of the African people  the real people in Africa. That's where you find them. Now  obviously it makes common sense that if you want to help the people  you go where the people are. But that's not what we did. As a matter of fact  we neglected the informal and the traditional sectors. Now  traditional sector is where Africa produces its agriculture  which is one of the reasons why Africa can't feed itself  and that's why it must import food. All right  you cannot develop Africa by ignoring the informal and the traditional sectors. And you can't develop the informal and the traditional sectors without an operational understanding of how these two sectors work. These two sectors  let me describe to you  have their own indigenous institutions. First one is the political system. Traditionally  Africans hate governments. They hate tyranny. If you look into their traditional systems  Africans organize their states in two types. The first one belongs to those ethnic societies who believe that the state was necessarily tyrannous  so they didn't want to have anything to do with any centralized authority. These societies are the Ibo  the Somali  the Kikuyus  for example. They have no chiefs. The other ethnic groups  which did have chiefs  made sure that they surrounded the chiefs with councils upon councils upon councils to prevent them from abusing their power. In Ashanti tradition  for example  the chief cannot make any decision without the concurrence of the council of elders. Without the council the chief can't pass any law  and if the chief doesn't govern according to the will of the people he will be removed. If not  the people will abandon the chief  go somewhere else and set up a new settlement. And even if you look in ancient African empires  they were all organized around one particular principle    the confederacy principle  which is characterized by a great deal of devolution of authority  decentralization of power. Now  this is what I have described to you. This is part of Africa's indigenous political heritage. Now  compare that to the modern systems the ruling elites established on Africa. It is a total far cry. In the economic system in traditional Africa  the means of production is privately owned. It's owned by extended families. You see  in the West  the basic economic and social unit is the individual. The American will say   I am because I am  and I can damn well do anything I want  anytime.  The accent is on the  I.  In Africa  the Africans say   I am  because we are.  The  we  connotes community    the extended family system. The extended family system pools its resources together. They own farms. They decide what to do  what to produce. They don't take any orders from their chiefs. They decide what to do. And when they produce their crops  they sell the surplus on marketplaces. When they make a profit it is theirs to keep  not for the chief to sequester it from them. So  in a nutshell  what we had in traditional Africa was a free market system. There were markets in Africa before the colonialists stepped foot on the continent. Timbuktu was one great big market town. Kano  Salaga    they were all there. Even if you go to West Africa  you notice that market activity in West Africa has always been dominated by women. So  it's quite appropriate that this section is called a marketplace. The market is not alien to Africa. What Africans practiced was a different form of capitalism  but then after independence  all of a sudden  markets  capitalism became a western institution  and the leaders said Africans were ready for socialism. Nonsense. And even then  what kind of socialism did they practice  The socialism that they practiced was a peculiar form of Swiss bank socialism  which allowed the heads of states and the ministers to rape and plunder Africa's treasuries for deposit in Switzerland. That is not the kind of system Africans had known for centuries. What do we do now  Go back to Africa's indigenous institutions  and this is where we charge the Cheetahs to go into the informal sectors  the traditional sectors. That's where you find the African people. And I'd like to show you a quick little video about the informal sector  about the boat building that I  myself  tried to mobilize Africans in the Diaspora to invest in. Could you please show that  The men are going fishing in these small boats. Yes  it's an enterprise. This is by a local Ghanaian entrepreneur  using his own capital. He's getting no assistance from the government  and he's building a second  bigger boat. A bigger boat will mean more fish will be caught and landed. It means that he will be able to employ more Ghanaians. It also means that he will be able to generate wealth. And then it will have what economists call external effects on a local economy. All that you need to do  all that the elites need to do  is to move this operation into something that is enclosed so that the operation can be made more efficient. Now  it is not just this informal sector. There is also traditional medicine.    percent of Africans still rely on traditional medicine. The modern healthcare sector has totally collapsed. Now  this is an area    I mean  there is a treasure trove of wealth in the traditional medicine area. This is where we need to mobilize Africans  in the Diaspora especially  to invest in this. We also need to mobilize Africans in the Diaspora  not only to go into the traditional sectors  but to go into agriculture and also to instigate change from within. We were able to mobilize Ghanaians in the Diaspora to instigate change in Ghana and bring about democracy in Ghana. And I know that with the Cheetahs  we can take Africa back one village at a time. Thank you very much. It's very  very difficult to speak at the end of a conference like this  because everyone has spoken. Everything has been said. So I thought that what may be useful is to remind us of some of the things that have gone on here  and then maybe offer some ideas which we can take away  and take forward and work on. That's what I'd like to try and do. We came here saying we want to talk about  Africa  the Next Chapter.  But we are talking about  Africa  the Next Chapter  because we are looking at the old and the present chapter    that we're looking at  and saying it's not such a good thing. The picture I showed you before  and this picture  of drought  death and disease is what we usually see. What we want to look at is  Africa  the Next Chapter   and that's this  a healthy  smiling  beautiful African. And I think it's worth remembering what we've heard through the conference right from the first day  where I heard that all the important statistics have been given    about where we are now  about how the continent is doing much better. And the importance of that is that we have a platform to build on. So I'm not going to spend too much time    just to show you  refresh your memories that we are here for  Africa  the Next Chapter  because for the first time there really is a platform to build on. We really do have it going right that the continent is growing at rates that people had thought would not happen. After decades of   percent  we are now at   percent  and it's going to    projected      and   percent even. And inflation has come down. External debt    something that I can tell you a long story about because I personally worked on one of the biggest debts on the continent    has come down dramatically. You know  as you can see  from almost    billion down to about    or    billion. Now this is a huge achievement. You know  we've built up reserves. Why is that important  It's because it shows off our economies  shows off our currencies and gives a platform on which people can plan and build  including businesses. We've also seen some evidence that all this is making a difference because private investment flows have increased. I want to remind you again    I know you saw these statistics before    from almost   billion we are now at about    billion. In       remittances    I just took one country  Nigeria skyrocketing    skyrocketing is too dramatic  but increasing dramatically. And in many other countries this is happening. Why is this important  Because it shows confidence. People are now confident to bring    if your people in the diaspora bring their money back  it shows other people that  look  there is emerging confidence in your country. And instead of an outflow  you are now getting a net inflow. Now  why is all this important  to have to go really fast  It's important that we build this platform  that we have the president  Kikwete  and others of our leaders who are saying   Look  we must do something different.  Because we are confronted with a challenge.    percent of our population is below the age of   . What does this mean  This means that we have to focus on how our youth are going to be engaged in productive endeavor in their lives. You have to focus on how to create jobs  make sure they don't fall into disease  and that they get an education. But most of all that they are productively engaged in life  and that they are creating the kind of productive environment in our countries that will make things happen. And to support this  I just recently    one of the things I've done since leaving government is to start an opinion research organization in Nigeria. Most of our countries don't even have any opinion research. People don't have voice. There is no way you can know what people want. One of the things we asked them recently was what's their top issue. Like in every other country where this has been done  jobs is the top issue. I want to leave this up here and come back to it. But before I get to this slide  I just wanted to run you through this. And to say that for me  the next stage of building this platform that now enables us to move forward    and we mustn't make light of it. It was only         years ago we couldn't even talk about the next chapter  because we were in the old chapter. We were going nowhere. The economies were not growing. We were having negative per capita growth. The microeconomic framework and foundation for moving forward was not even there. So let's not forget that it's taken a lot to build this  including all those things that we tried to do in Nigeria that Dele referred to. Creating our own program to solve problems  like fighting corruption  building institutions  stabilizing the micro economy. So now we have this platform we can build on. And it brings us to the debate that has been going on here  aid versus private sector  aid versus trade  etc. And someone stood up to say that one of the frustrating things is that it's been a simplistic debate. And that's not what the debate should be about. That's engaging in the wrong debate. The issue here is how do we get a partnership that involves government donors  the private sector and ordinary African people taking charge of their own lives  How do we combine all this  To move our continent forward  to do the things that need doing that I talked about    getting young people employed. Getting the creative juices flowing on this continent  much of what you have seen here. So I'm afraid we've been engaging a little bit in the wrong debate. We need to bring it back to say  what is the combination of all these factors that is going to yield what we want   Applause  And I want to tell you something. For me  the issue about aid    I don't think that Africans need to now go all the way over to the other side and feel bad about aid. Africa has been giving the other countries aid. Mo Ibrahim said at a debate we were at that he dreams one day when Africa will be giving aid. And I said   Mo  you're right. We have    no  but we've already been doing it  The U.K. and the U.S. could not have been built today without Africa's aid.  It is all the resources that were taken from Africa  including human  that built these countries today  So when they try to give back  we shouldn't be on the defensive. The issue is not that. The issue is how are we using what has been given back. How are we using it  Is it being directed effectively  I want to tell you a little story. Why I don't mind if we get aid  but we use it well. From      to '    Nigeria fought a war    the Nigeria Biafra war. And in the middle of that war  I was    years old. We spent much of our time with my mother cooking. For the army    my father joined the army as a brigadier    the Biafran army. We were on the Biafran side. And we were down to eating one meal a day  running from place to place  but wherever we could help we did. At a certain point in time  in       things were really bad. We were down to almost nothing in terms of a meal a day. People  children were dying of kwashiorkor. I'm sure some of you who are not so young will remember those pictures. Well  I was in the middle of it. In the midst of all this  my mother fell ill with a stomach ailment for two or three days. We thought she was going to die. My father was not there. He was in the army. So I was the oldest person in the house. My sister fell very ill with malaria. She was three years old and I was   . And she had such a high fever. We tried everything. It didn't look like it was going to work. Until we heard that    kilometers away there was a doctor  who was looking at people and giving them meds. Now I put my sister on my back    burning    and I walked    kilometers with her strapped on my back. It was really hot. I was very hungry. I was scared because I knew her life depended on my getting to this woman. We heard there was a woman doctor who was treating people. I walked    kilometers  putting one foot in front of the other. I got there and I saw huge crowds. Almost a thousand people were there  trying to break down the door. She was doing this in a church. How was I going to get in  I had to crawl in between the legs of these people with my sister strapped on my back  find a way to a window. And while they were trying to break down the door  I climbed in through the window  and jumped in. This woman told me it was in the nick of time. By the time we jumped into that hall  she was barely moving. She gave a shot of her chloroquine    what I learned was the chloroquine then    gave her some    it must have been a re hydration    and some other therapies  and put us in a corner. In about two to three hours  she started to move. And then they toweled her down because she started sweating  which was a good sign. And then my sister woke up. And about five or six hours later  she said we could go home. I strapped her on my back. I walked the    kilometers back and it was the shortest walk I ever had. I was so happy     Applause     that my sister was alive  Today she's    years old  a mother of three  and she's a physician saving other lives. Why am I telling that  I'm telling you that because    when it is you or your person involved    you don't care where    whether it's aid. You don't care what it is   Applause  You just want the person to be alive  And now let me become less sentimental  and say that saving lives    which some of the aid we get does on this continent    when you save the life of anyone  a farmer  a teacher  a mother  they are contributing productively into the economy. And as an economist  we can also look at that side of the story. These are people who are productive agents in the economy. So if we save people from HIV AIDS  if we save them from malaria  it means they can form the base of production for our economy. And by the same token    as someone said yesterday    if we don't and they die  their children will become a burden on the economy. So even from an economic standpoint  if we leave the social and the humanitarian  we need to save lives now. So that's one of the reasons  from a personal experience  that I say let's channel these resources we get into something productive. However  I will also tell you that I'm one of those who doesn't believe that this is the sole answer. That's why I said the debate has to get more sophisticated. You know  we have to use it well. What has happened in Europe  Do you all know that Spain    part of the EU    got    billion dollars in aid from the rest of the EU  Resources that were transferred to them    and were the Spanish ashamed of this  No  The EU transferred    billion. Where did they use it  Have you been to southern Spain lately  There are roads everywhere. Infrastructure everywhere. It is on the back of this that the whole of southern Spain has developed into a services economy. Did you know that Ireland got   billion dollars in aid  Ireland is one of the fastest growing economies in the European Union today. For which many people  even from other parts of the world  are going there to find jobs. What did they do with the   billion dollars in aid  They used it to build an information superhighway  gain infrastructure that enables them to participate in the information technology revolution  and to create jobs in their economy. They didn't say   No  you know  we're not going to take this.  Today  the European Union is busy transferring aid. My frustration is if they can build infrastructure in Spain    which is roads  highways  other things that they can build    I say then  why do they refuse to use the same aid to build the same infrastructure in our countries   Applause  When we ask them and tell them what we need  one of my worries today is that we have many foundations now. Now we talk about the World Bank  IMF  and accountability  all that and the EU. We also have private citizens now who have a lot of money    some of them in this audience  with private foundations. And one day  these foundations have so much money  they will overtake the official aid that is being given. But I fear    and I'm very grateful to all of them for what they are trying to do on the continent    but I'm also worried. I wake up with a gnawing in my belly because I see a new set of aid entrepreneurs on the continent. And they're also going from country to country  and many times trying to find what to do. But I'm not really sure that their assistance is also being channeled in the right way. And many of them are not really familiar with the continent. They are just discovering. And many times I don't see Africans working with them. They are just going alone   Applause  And many times I get the impression that they are not really even interested in hearing from Africans who might know. They want to visit us  see what's happening on the ground and make a decision. And now I'm maybe being harsh. But I worry because this money is so important. Now  who are they accountable to  Are we on their boards when they make decisions about where to channel money  Are we there  Will we make the same mistake that we made before  Have our presidents and our leaders    everyone is talking about    have they ever called these people together and said   Look  your foundation and your foundation    you have so much money  we are grateful. Let's sit down and really tell you where the money should be channeled and where this aid should go.  Have we done that  The answer is no. And each one is making their own individual effort. And then    years from now  billions will again have gone into Africa  and we would still have the same problems. This is what gives us the hopeless image. Our inability to take charge and say to all these people bringing their money   Sit down.  And we don't do it because there are so many of us. We don't coordinate. We've not called the Bill Gates  and the Soros  and everybody else who is helping and say   Sit down. Let's have a conference with you. As a continent  here are our priorities. Here is where we want you to channel this money.  Each one should not be an entrepreneur going out and finding what is best. We're not trying to stop them at all  But to help them help us better. And what is disappointing me is that we are not doing this. Ten years from now we will have the same story  and we will be repeating the same things. So our problem right now is  how can we leverage all this good will that is coming towards our way  How can we get government to combine properly with these private foundations  with the international organizations  and with our private sector. I firmly believe in that private sector thing too. But it cannot do it alone. So there might be a few ideas we could think of that could work. They said this is about proliferating and sharing ideas. So why don't we think of using some of this aid  Well  why don't we first say to those helping us out   Don't be shy about infrastructure. That health that you're working on cannot be sustainable without infrastructure. That education will work better if we've got electricity and railroads  and so on. That agriculture will work better if there are railroads to get the goods to market. Don't be shy of it. Invest some of your resources in that  too.  And then we can see that this is one combination of private  international  multilateral money  private sector and the African that we can put together as a partnership  so that aid can be a facilitator. That is all aid can be. Aid cannot solve our problems  I'm firmly convinced about that. But it can be catalytic. And if we fail to use it as catalytic  we would have failed. One of the reasons why China is a bit popular with Africans now    one of the reasons is not only just that  you know  these people are stupid and China is coming to take resources. It's because there's a little more leverage in terms of the Chinese. If you tell them   We need a road here   they will help you build it. They don't shy away from infrastructure. In fact  the Chinese minister of finance said to me  when I asked him what are we doing wrong in Nigeria. He said   There are two things you need only. Infrastructure  infrastructure  infrastructure and discipline. You are undisciplined.   Applause  And I repeat it for the continent. It's the same. We need infrastructure  infrastructure and discipline. So we can make a catalytic to help us provide some of that. Now I realize    I'm not saying    health and education    no  you can also provide that as well. But I'm saying it's not either or. Let's see how aid can be a facilitator in partnership. One idea. Second thing  for the private sector  people are afraid to take risks on the continent. Why can't some of this aid be used as a kind of guarantee mechanisms  to enable people to take risk  And finally  because they are both standing at my    I'm out of time. Am I out of time  OK  so let me not forget my punchline. One of the things I want everybody to collaborate on is to support women  to create jobs.  Applause  A lot has been said here about women  I don't need to repeat it. But there are people    women    creating jobs. And we know  studies have shown that when you put resources in the hand of the woman    in fact  there's an econometric study  the World Bank Review  done in       showing that transfers into the hands of women result in healthier children  more for the household  more for the economy and all that. So I'm saying that one of the takeaways from here    I'm not saying the men are not important    obviously  if you leave the husbands out  what will they do  They'll come back home and get disgruntled  and it will result in difficulties we don't want. We don't want men beating their wives because they don't have a job  and so on. But at the margin  we also    I want to push this  because the reason is the men automatically    they get    not automatically  but they tend to get more support. But I want you to realize that resources in the hands of African women is a powerful tool. There are people creating jobs. Beatrice Gakuba has created     jobs from her flower business in Rwanda. We have Ibukun Awosika in Nigeria  with the chair company. She wants to expand. She needs another    million. She will create another          more jobs. So take away from here is how are you going to put together the resources to put money in the hands of women in the middle who are ready    business people who want to expand and create more jobs. And lastly  what are you going to do to be part of this partnership of aid  government  private sector and the African as an individual  Thank you.  Applause  Chris Anderson  William  hi. Good to see you. William Kamkwamba  Thanks. CA  So  we've got a picture  I think  Where is this  WK  This is my home. This is where I live. CA  Where  What country  WK  In Malawi  Kasungu. In Kasungu. Yeah  Mala. CA  OK. Now  you're    now  WK  Yeah. I'm    years now. CA  Five years ago you had an idea. What was that  WK  I wanted to make a windmill. CA  A windmill  WK  Yeah. CA  What  to power    for lighting and stuff  WK  Yeah. CA  So what did you do  How did you realize that  WK  After I dropped out of school  I went to library  and I read a book that would     Using Energy   and I get information about doing the mill. And I tried  and I made it. CA  So you copied    you exactly copied the design in the book. WK  Ah  no. I just    CA  What happened  WK  In fact  a design of the windmill that was in the book  it has got four    ah    three blades  and mine has got four blades. CA  The book had three  yours had four. WK  Yeah. CA  And you made it out of what  WK  I made four blades  just because I want to increase power. CA  OK. WK  Yeah. CA  You tested three  and found that four worked better  WK  Yeah. I test. CA  And what did you make the windmill out of  What materials did you use  WK  I use a bicycle frame  and a pulley  and plastic pipe  what then pulls    CA  Do we have a picture of that  Can we have the next slide  WK  Yeah. The windmill. CA  And so  and that windmill  what    it worked  WK  When the wind blows  it rotates and generates. CA  How much electricity  WK     watts. CA  And so  that lit a light for the house  How many lights  WK  Four bulbs and two radios. CA  Wow. WK  Yeah. so who's that  WK  This is my parents  holding the radio. CA  So what did they make of    that you were        at the time    what did they make of this  They were impressed  WK  Yeah. CA  And so what's your    what are you going to do with this  WK  Um    CA  What do you    I mean    do you want to build another one  WK  Yeah  I want to build another one    to pump water and irrigation for crops. CA  So this one would have to be bigger  WK  Yeah. CA  How big  WK  I think it will produce more than    the watts. CA  So that would produce irrigation for the entire village  WK  Yeah. CA  Wow. And so you're talking to people here at TED to get people who might be able to help in some way to realize this dream  WK  Yeah  if they can help me with materials  yeah. CA  And as you think of your life going forward  you're    now  do you picture continuing with this dream of working in energy  WK  Yeah. I'm still thinking to work on energy. CA  Wow. William  it's a real honor to have you at the TED conference. Thank you so much for coming. WK  Thank you. Welcome to Africa  Or rather  I should say  welcome home. Because this is where it all really began  isn't it  Looking at fossils dating back several millions of years    it all points to evidence that life for the human species as we know it began right here. We are on an amazing journey the next four days. You're going to hear stories of  Africa  The Next Chapter.  Fantastic tales  anecdotes from speakers. But I want to turn that upside down for a moment  and get something out on the table and clear the air so to say. What's the worst thing you've ever heard about Africa  And this is not a rhetorical question. I actually want answers from you. Go for it  The worst. Famine. Corruption. More. Genocide. AIDS. Slavery. That's enough. We've all heard these things. But this is about Africa  the story we have not heard. The stories that we want to know  and the stories that do exist about positive tales. A part of my talk is going to be about investment opportunities that exist on this continent  to separate the rhetoric from the reality  the fact from the fiction. To go to the actual data and statistics that exist about the actual things that are happening on the ground that make Africa a realistic investment opportunity and option for you. So let's get going because Africa  to some degree  is on a turnaround. A turnaround in terms of how it manages its image  and how it takes control of its own destiny. And turnarounds are part and parcel of what I have focused on for most of my professional career. And it all started almost a decade ago  as a young consultant at McKinsey   Company at their first African office in Johannesburg. And there we worked with leading CEOs on African issues  and African companies on turnarounds  making the companies not just the best in Africa but the best globally. But I really formalized this focus on turnarounds when I was completing my MBA in the United States. It all began with a fantastic phone call. It was from Rosabeth Moss Kanter  Harvard Business School guru and a professor of mine. And she said   I want to write a case  Euvin    a case on a public sector leader that has lessons for the corporate world.  And the leader that came to mind was Nelson Mandela. Because Nelson Mandela  as he took over power as the first democratically elected president of South Africa  faced a situation of a country that could have slid into the abyss of chaos. But he started the country on a path of a positive cycle. Now the case   Nelson Mandela  Change Leader   became part of the research base for a chapter in Rosabeth's new book called  Confidence.  And  Confidence  became a New York Times bestseller and topped Business Week's hardcover bestseller list. And why I tell you this story is because later  when I was interviewed on SABC Africa  on a pan African broadcast  they asked   What is your key lesson  or the key thing you enjoy the most      because it was a huge privilege to be part of such a project. The lesson from that was that it was Africa    an African story    that was used to share news with the rest of the world of what the benchmark can be for corporate turnarounds. Africa was being used as a success story  So I want to share with you a personal story about a turnaround or a transformation. And that has to do with me because in       I packed a few things into a backpack and headed off for a year of travel in the middle of my university career. You should have seen my parents' reaction  But very soon  I found myself from the southern part of Africa  in South Africa    at the very north  in Egypt. And I sought out the most remote places. I went to the Siwa Oasis. That was one of my stops. And the Siwa Oasis is famous for several things  but the key thing is that it was the place that Alexander the Great went to when he wanted to find out what his destiny had in store for him. And legend has it that Alexander trekked through this desert. Half his battalion was wiped out in the sandstorm. And myth says that he had an audience with the oracle  and it foretold his destiny of greatness. This was     BC. So Africa had long been seen as a place to go to for answers. Now  the thing I remember about Siwa was the magical view of the sky at night. With no natural light source  Siva is one of these amazing places that when you look up you see a perfect tapestry. Fast forward to     . I'm sitting in Cambridge  Massachusetts at the Healthcare Development Conference. And I see the same picture  but from the opposite side. A satellite picture looking down at the earth. And it was that picture that made such a profound impact on me because I'll never forget it. I remember the very moment. And I wanted to share that image with you of what I saw at that point. The first thing that I saw was North America at night    glowing  in all its glory. A warm feeling. Light. And then I saw it    Africa. Quite literally the  Dark Continent.  And while Africa may be dark  the thing that brought the message home to me was that this is the challenge we are facing  but it's also the opportunity. Because whilst Africa may be dark    other than the few specks that exist north and in the south and other areas    it's aglow with the light in the hearts of the millions of people that are there. Entrepreneurs  dynamic people  people with hope. It was George Kimble  the geographer  who said that   The only thing dark about Africa is our ignorance of it.  So let's start shedding light on this amazing eclectic continent that has so much to offer. Let's start unpacking it. Africa is the second largest continent  a landmass second from Asia. It also is the second most populated continent  with     million people. In fact    coming back to the land mass    Africa is so big that you could fit in the continental United States  China  and the entire Europe into Africa  and still have space. Africa is home to over       languages          is another estimate that's out there    with over       languages and dialects. But you could say   Invest in Africa in over       languages  and it wouldn't make a difference.  What does the data say  As an investment banker  I'm in the cross flow of information and the changes that are taking place in capital markets. So I want to share with you some of these bellwether signals  or signs  and winds of change that are sweeping this continent. So let's start on that. And let's start at the high level  on the macro factors. Inflation  in general  is coming down across Africa    that's the first sign    in many countries reaching double digit figures. So let's start looking at some of those. I call it my Z.E.N. cluster. Zambia  from      to       moves from the    percent in inflation to the nine percent. Egypt  from the    percent to about  .  percent. Nigeria  a similar situation  from the    percent to the eight percent. Single digits. More fascinating  you have other countries    South Africa  Mauritius  Namibia    all in single digits. But that's just part of the story. You have a similar trend with currencies    currencies going through an extreme time of stability. But that's looking at the big picture. And the first myth to dispel is that Africa is not a country. It's made up    It's made up of    different countries. So the very definition    to say  invest in Africa  is a no go. It's meaningless. Each country has a unique value proposition. You can make money  you can lose money in Africa. But opportunities  boy oh boy  they exist. And this is what today is about    it's about discussing those very opportunities. So let's start getting into the countries and into the specific material and data. I was recently elected  as Emeka mentioned  as the President of the South African Chamber of Commerce in America. And I'm very proud and happy to be in that role because it is a fascinating position to be in. To hear this dialogue that's just increasing in tenor and velocity  of decisions about trade and companies wanting to come. So the first port of call  let's talk a little bit about South Africa. But not the South Africa we always talk about    the gold  the minerals  the First World infrastructure    a bit about the other side of it. For example  South Africa was recently voted as the top destination for the top       UK companies for offshore call centers. Same language  timeline  et cetera. Makes sense. Other headlines that have recently reached South Africa were Bain Capital and KKR  the big boys of private equity. Headline in South Africa   They have landed.  Quite ominous. But what were they there for  To acquire assets. Bing Capital's acquisition of Edcon  a large retailer  is testimony to the confidence they are starting to place in the economy. Because it is actually a long term play. Being a retailer  it is a play on the belief that this middle class that's growing will continue to grow  that the boom and the confidence in consumer spending will continue. But the story of Africa  and my focus  is beyond South Africa because there's so much happening. Undoubtedly  Nigeria is clearly a hot spot. Challenges    and we will hear a lot about Nigeria in these four days. But looking at Goldman Sachs' work    we had the famous BRIC Report. The new report   The Next Eleven   highlights that by      Nigeria is going to be amongst the top    economies in the world. It's an investment opportunity. Think about that. Is anyone    our banks  our investors    seriously thinking about going to Nigeria  If you haven't  why not  What's going on in Nigeria  A couple of things. I want to talk about it from the perspective of capital markets. Bellwether signs again. Guarantee Trust Bank recently issued the first Euro Bond out of Africa  and this excludes South Africa. But the first Eurobond  the raising of international capital offshore  off its own balance sheet  without any sovereign backing    that is an indication of the confidence that is taking place in that economy. Without any sovereign backing  a Nigerian company raising capital offshore. It's just a sign of things to come. Looking at the oil industry  Africa provides    percent of the U.S.'s oil supply  with the Middle East just    percent. It's an important strategic partner. Let's put Nigeria in perspective.  .  to  .  million barrels of oil a day    the same league as Kuwait  the same league as Venezuela. But with Africa  let's start being careful about this. And Emeka and I have had these discussions. We have to move away from what's called  the curse of the commodities.  Because it's not about oil  it's not about commodities. For Africa to truly be sustainable  we have to move beyond to other industries. So let's unpack those very quickly  and I'm going to move through these very  very  very fast because I can see that clock counting down. What else is going on there  Egypt. Egypt is launching a first large industrial zone     .  billion investment. The announcement just came out the last few weeks. Close to the Mediterranean  near Alexandria    textiles  petrochemicals. It's being managed by a Singaporean based management company. So they want to emerge as an industrial powerhouse across the industries    away from oil. Let's look at agriculture. Let's look at forestry. What's going on there  In Tanzania last week  we had the launch of the East African Organic Produce Standard. Again  gathering together farmers  gathering together stakeholders in East Africa to get standards for organic produce. Better prices. It ties in with small scale farmers in terms of no pesticides  no fertilizers. Again  opportunity to tackle markets to get that higher price. Uganda  the New Forest Company  replanting and redeveloping their forests. Why is that important  As the energy needs are met and electricity is needed  we will need  poles for rolling out electricity. But here is the sweetener in the deal. They're going to be tapping into carbon credits. Let's go back to Nigeria. The banking sector has undergone tremendous transformation  from over    banks to    banks. Strengthening of the system. But what's going on there  Only    percent of the country is banked. The largest population in Africa is in Nigeria.     million plus people. Think about that. There are only     ATMs in the country. Opportunity. The same for telecoms across the country. Now let's look at the continent as a whole. People look at the roads  for example  and they'd say   Angola     percent of roads are untarred. Ah  problem   It's more expensive to transport goods. Prices of goods go up  inflation is affected. Nigeria     percent of roads are untarred. Zambia     percent. In general  more than    percent of roads are untarred. This is an opportunity  Energy needs    it's an opportunity. So what are the signs that things are fundamentally changing  Let's look at the stock markets in Africa. If I had to ask you   In      what was the best performing stock market or stock exchange in the world   Would Egypt come to mind  In       the Egyptian stock exchange returned over     percent. What's going on in some of the other countries  Let's look at some      numbers. Kenya  over    percent. Nigeria  over    percent. South Africa  in the    percents. High ones. These are the trends that are taking place. But in any investment decision  the key question is   What is my alternative investment   Because in Africa today  we are competing globally for capital. And global capital is agnostic    it has no loyalties. There's an overhang of capital in the U.S.  and the key is yield pickup. What Africa is providing is a diversification play  and also opportunities for yield pickup for the investor that's aware of what he or she is doing. Now  when looking at Africa vis a vis other things  and countries in Africa vis a vis other things  comparisons become important.    years ago there  were very few countries that received sovereign ratings from the Standard   Poors  Moody's and Fitch's. Today     African countries and growing have sovereign country ratings. What does this mean  Take Nigeria again  double B minus    in the league of Ukraine and Turkey. Immediately we have a comparison. The backbone of making investment decisions for global holders of capital. Some other figures. South Africa  triple B plus. Botswana  A plus. Bakino Faso  B minus. And so on. In fact  one of the big agencies is setting up an office in Africa. Why are they doing that  Because they expect investment to follow. So one of the big bellwethers  and one of my final points I want to mention  is the interesting thing I read is that CNBC has launched their first African channel. Why is CNBC doing this  It's the    hour rolling African news channel. They're doing it because they are expecting things to happen. Me and you  the investments we are going to be making  the investments the world is going to be making    that's the    hour news channel dedicated to Africa. So that's the change that's coming down the pipeline. So in conclusion  I want to turn back to that very slide that made such a deep impact on me all those years ago. This time  I'll  give you the entire picture that I saw in       and ask you that when you think about what your role can be in Africa  think about your journey in terms of bringing light to this continent. Because there are amazing opportunities available. And think about the concept of transformation in the back of your mind because things can be turned around rather quickly. In       Joseph Conrad released  The Heart of Darkness   a tale of grim horror along the Congo River. If one looks carefully  on the Congo River is one of those bright lights. And that's the very Congo river generating light    the old heart of darkness now generating light with hydro electric power. That is a transformation in power of ideas. So the next step  over the next four days  is us exploring more of these ideas. And perchance  if you can always keep this picture in your mind  that when we convene maybe in the distant future  in       that picture will look very different. Thank you. Like many of you here  I am trying to contribute towards a renaissance in Africa. The question of transformation in Africa really is a question of leadership. Africa can only be transformed by enlightened leaders. And it is my contention that the manner in which we educate our leaders is fundamental to progress on this continent. I want to tell you some stories that explain my view. We all heard about the importance of stories yesterday. An American friend of mine this year volunteered as a nurse in Ghana  and in a period of three months she came to a conclusion about the state of leadership in Africa that had taken me over a decade to reach. Twice she was involved in surgeries where they lost power at the hospital. The emergency generators did not start. There was not a flashlight  not a lantern  not a candle    pitch black. The patient's cut open  twice. The first time it was a C section. Thankfully  baby was out    mother and child survived. The second time was a procedure that involved local anesthesia. Anesthetic wears off. The patient feels pain. He's crying. He's screaming. He's praying. Pitch black. Not a candle  not a flashlight. And that hospital could have afforded flashlights. They could have afforded to purchase these things  but they didn't. And it happened twice. Another time  she watched in horror as nurses watched a patient die because they refused to give her oxygen that they had. And so three months later  just before she returned to the United States  nurses in Accra go on strike. And her recommendation is take this opportunity to fire everyone  start all over again. Start all over again. Now what does this have to do with leadership  You see  the folks at the ministry of health  the hospital administrators  the doctors  the nurses    they are among just five percent of their peers who get an education after secondary school. They are the elite. They are our leaders. Their decisions  their actions matter. And when they fail  a nation literally suffers. So when I speak of leadership  I'm not talking about just political leaders. We've heard a lot about that. I'm talking about the elite. Those who've been trained  whose job it is to be the guardians of their society. The lawyers  the judges  the policemen  the doctors  the engineers  the civil servants    those are the leaders. And we need to train them right. Now  my first pointed and memorable experience with leadership in Ghana occurred when I was    years old. We had just had a military coup  and soldiers were pervasive in our society. They were a pervasive presence. And one day I go to the airport to meet my father  and as I walk up this grassy slope from the car park to the terminal building  I'm stopped by two soldiers wielding AK    assault weapons. And they asked me to join a crowd of people that were running up and down this embankment. Why  Because the path I had taken was considered out of bounds. No sign to this effect. Now  I was   . I was very worried about what my peers at school might think if they saw me running up and down this hill. I was especially concerned of what the girls might think. And so I started to argue with these men. It was a little reckless  but you know  I was   . I got lucky. A Ghana Airways pilot falls into the same predicament. Because of his uniform they speak to him differently  and they explain to him that they're just following orders. So he takes their radio  talks to their boss  and gets us all released. What lessons would you take from an experience like this  Several  for me. Leadership matters. Those men are following the orders of a superior officer. I learned something about courage. It was important not to look at those guns. And I also learned that it can be helpful to think about girls. So a few years after this event  I leave Ghana on a scholarship to go to Swarthmore College for my education. It was a breath of fresh air. You know  the faculty there didn't want us to memorize information and repeat back to them as I was used to back in Ghana. They wanted us to think critically. They wanted us to be analytical. They wanted us to be concerned about social issues. In my economics classes I got high marks for my understanding of basic economics. But I learned something more profound than that  which is that the leaders    the managers of Ghana's economy    were making breathtakingly bad decisions that had brought our economy to the brink of collapse. And so here was this lesson again    leadership matters. It matters a great deal. But I didn't really fully understand what had happened to me at Swarthmore. I had an inkling  but I didn't fully realize it until I went out into the workplace and I went to work at Microsoft Corporation. And I was part of this team    this thinking  learning team whose job it was to design and implement new software that created value in the world. And it was brilliant to be part of this team. It was brilliant. And I realized just what had happened to me at Swarthmore  this transformation    the ability to confront problems  complex problems  and to design solutions to those problems. The ability to create is the most empowering thing that can happen to an individual. And I was part of that. Now  while I was at Microsoft  the annual revenues of that company grew larger than the GDP of the Republic of Ghana. And by the way  it's continued to. The gap has widened since I left. Now  I've already spoken about one of the reasons why this has occurred. I mean  it's the people there who are so hardworking  persistent  creative  empowered. But there were also some external factors  free markets  the rule of law  infrastructure. These things were provided by institutions run by the people that I call leaders. And those leaders did not emerge spontaneously. Somebody trained them to do the work that they do. Now  while I was at Microsoft  this funny thing happened. I became a parent. And for the first time  Africa mattered more to me than ever before. Because I realized that the state of the African continent would matter to my children and their children. That the state of the world    the state of the world depends on what's happening to Africa  as far as my kids would be concerned. And at this time  when I was going through what I call my  pre mid life crisis   Africa was a mess. Somalia had disintegrated into anarchy. Rwanda was in the throes of this genocidal war. And it seemed to me that that was the wrong direction  and I needed to be back helping. I couldn't just stay in Seattle and raise my kids in an upper middle class neighborhood and feel good about it. This was not the world that I'd want my children to grow up in. So I decided to get engaged  and the first thing that I did was to come back to Ghana and talk with a lot of people and really try to understand what the real issues were. And three things kept coming up for every problem  corruption  weak institutions and the people who run them    the leaders. Now  I was a little scared because when you see those three problems  they seem really hard to deal with. And they might say   Look  don't even try.  But  for me  I asked the question   Well  where are these leaders coming from  What is it about Ghana that produces leaders that are unethical or unable to solve problems   So I went to look at what was happening in our educational system. And it was the same    learning by rote    from primary school through graduate school. Very little emphasis on ethics  and the typical graduate from a university in Ghana has a stronger sense of entitlement than a sense of responsibility. This is wrong. So I decided to engage this particular problem. Because it seems to me that every society  every society  must be very intentional about how it trains its leaders. And Ghana was not paying enough attention. And this is true across sub Saharan Africa  actually. So this is what I'm doing now. I'm trying to bring the experience that I had at Swarthmore to Africa. I wish there was a liberal arts college in every African country. I think it would make a huge difference. And what Ashesi University is trying to do is to train a new generation of ethical  entrepreneurial leaders. We're trying to train leaders of exceptional integrity  who have the ability to confront the complex problems  ask the right questions  and come up with workable solutions. I'll admit that there are times when it seems like  Mission  Impossible   but we must believe that these kids are smart. That if we involve them in their education  if we have them discuss the real issues that they confront    that our whole society confronts    and if we give them skills that enable them to engage the real world  that magic will happen. Now  a month into this project  we'd just started classes. And a month into it  I come to the office  and I have this email from one of our students. And it said  very simply   I am thinking now.  And he signs off   Thank you.  It's such a simple statement. But I was moved almost to tears because I understood what was happening to this young man. And it is an awesome thing to be a part of empowering someone in this way. I am thinking now. This year we challenged our students to craft an honor code themselves. There's a very vibrant debate going on on campus now over whether they should have an honor code  and if so  what it should look like. One of the students asked a question that just warmed my heart. Can we create a perfect society  Her understanding that a student crafted honor code constitutes a reach towards perfection is incredible. Now  we cannot achieve perfection  but if we reach for it  then we can achieve excellence. I don't know ultimately what they will do. I don't know whether they will decide to have this honor code. But the conversation they're having now    about what their good society should look like  what their excellent society should look like  is a really good thing. Am I out of time  OK. Now  I just wanted to leave that slide up because it's important that we think about it. I'm very excited about the fact that every student at Ashesi University does community service before they graduate. That for many of them  it has been a life altering experience. These young future leaders are beginning to understand the real business of leadership  the real privilege of leadership  which is after all to serve humanity. I am even more thrilled by the fact that least year our student body elected a woman to be the head of Student Government. It's the first time in the history of Ghana that a woman has been elected head of Student Government at any university. It says a lot about her. It says a lot about the culture that's forming on campus. It says a lot about her peers who elected her. She won with    percent of the vote. And it gives me a lot of hope. It turns out that corporate West Africa also appreciates what's happening with our students. We've graduated two classes of students to date. And every single one of them has been placed. And we're getting great reports back from corporate Ghana  corporate West Africa  and the things that they're most impressed about is work ethic. You know  that passion for what they're doing. The persistence  their ability to deal with ambiguity  their ability to tackle problems that they haven't seen before. This is good because over the past five years  there have been times when I've felt this is  Mission  Impossible.  And it's just wonderful to see these glimmers of the promise of what can happen if we train our kids right. I think that the current and future leaders of Africa have an incredible opportunity to drive a major renaissance on the continent. It's an incredible opportunity. There aren't very many more opportunities like this in the world. I believe that Africa has reached an inflection point with a march of democracy and free markets across the continent. We have reached a moment from which can emerge a great society within one generation. It will depend on inspired leadership. And it is my contention that the manner in which we train our leaders will make all the difference. Thank you  and God bless. I just heard the best joke about Bond Emeruwa. I was having lunch with him just a few minutes ago  and a Nigerian journalist comes    and this will only make sense if you've ever watched a James Bond movie    and a Nigerian journalist comes up to him and goes   Aha  we meet again  Mr. Bond   It was great. So  I've got a little sheet of paper here  mostly because I'm Nigerian and if you leave me alone  I'll talk for like two hours. I just want to say good afternoon  good evening. It's been an incredible few days. It's downhill from now on. I wanted to thank Emeka and Chris. But also  most importantly  all the invisible people behind TED that you just see flitting around the whole place that have made sort of this space for such a diverse and robust conversation. It's really amazing. I've been in the audience. I'm a writer  and I've been watching people with the slide shows and scientists and bankers  and I've been feeling a bit like a gangsta rapper at a bar mitzvah. Like  what have I got to say about all this  And I was watching Jane  Goodall  yesterday  and I thought it was really great  and I was watching those incredible slides of the chimpanzees  and I thought   Wow. What if a chimpanzee could talk  you know  What would it say   My first thought was   Well  you know  there's George Bush.  But then I thought   Why be rude to chimpanzees   I guess there goes my green card. There's been a lot of talk about narrative in Africa. And what's become increasingly clear to me is that we're talking about news stories about Africa  we're not really talking about African narratives. And it's important to make a distinction  because if the news is anything to go by     percent of Americans can't    either can't afford health insurance or have the most inadequate health insurance  and have a president who  despite the protest of millions of his citizens    even his own Congress    continues to prosecute a senseless war. So if news is anything to go by  the U.S. is right there with Zimbabwe  right  Which it isn't really  is it  And talking about war  my girlfriend has this great t shirt that says   Bombing for peace is like fucking for virginity.  It's amazing  isn't it  The truth is  everything we know about America  everything Americans come to know about being American  isn't from the news. I live there. We don't go home at the end of the day and think   Well  I really know who I am now because the Wall Street Journal says that the Stock Exchange closed at this many points.  What we know about how to be who we are comes from stories. It comes from the novels  the movies  the fashion magazines. It comes from popular culture. In other words  it's the agents of our imagination who really shape who we are. And this is important to remember  because in Africa the complicated questions we want to ask about what all of this means has been asked from the rock paintings of the San people  through the Sundiata epics of Mali  to modern contemporary literature. If you want to know about Africa  read our literature    and not just  Things Fall Apart   because that would be like saying   I've read 'Gone with the Wind' and so I know everything about America.  That's very important. There's a poem by Jack Gilbert called  The Forgotten Dialect of the Heart.  He says   When the Sumerian tablets were first translated  they were thought to be business records. But what if they were poems and psalms  My love is like twelve Ethiopian goats standing still in the morning light. Shiploads of thuja are what my body wants to say to your body. Giraffes are this desire in the dark.  This is important. It's important because misreading is really the chance for complication and opportunity. The first Igbo Bible was translated from English in about the     s by Bishop Crowther  who was a Yoruba. And it's important to know Igbo is a tonal language  and so they'll say the word  igwe  and  igwe   same spelling  one means  sky  or  heaven   and one means  bicycle  or  iron.  So  God is in heaven surrounded by His angels  was translated as     Igbo . And for some reason  in Cameroon  when they tried to translate the Bible into Cameroonian patois  they chose the Igbo version. And I'm not going to give you the patois translation  I'm going to make it standard English. Basically  it ends up as  God is on a bicycle with his angels.  This is good  because language complicates things. You know  we often think that language mirrors the world in which we live  and I find that's not true. The language actually makes the world in which we live. Language is not    I mean  things don't have any mutable value by themselves  we ascribe them a value. And language can't be understood in its abstraction. It can only be understood in the context of story  and everything  all of this is story. And it's important to remember that  because if we don't  then we become ahistorical. We've had a lot of    a parade of amazing ideas here. But these are not new to Africa. Nigeria got its independence in     . The first time the possibility for independence was discussed was in       following the Aba women's market riots. In       in the middle of the Biafran Nigerian Civil War  Dr. Njoku Obi invented the Cholera vaccine. So  you know  the thing is to remember that because otherwise     years from now  we'll be back here trying to tell this story again. So  what it says to me then is that it's not really    the problem isn't really the stories that are being told or which stories are being told  the problem really is the terms of humanity that we're willing to bring to complicate every story  and that's really what it's all about. Let me tell you a Nigerian joke. Well  it's just a joke  anyway. So there's Tom  Dick and Harry and they're working construction. And Tom opens up his lunch box and there's rice in it  and he goes on this rant about   Twenty years  my wife has been packing rice for lunch. If she does it again tomorrow  I'm going to throw myself off this building and kill myself.  And Dick and Harry repeat this. The next day  Tom opens his lunchbox  there's rice  so he throws himself off and kills himself  and Tom  Dick and Harry follow. And now the inquest    you know  Tom's wife and Dick's wife are distraught. They wished they'd not packed rice. But Harry's wife is confused  because she said   You know  Harry had been packing his own lunch for    years.  This seemingly innocent joke  when I heard it as a child in Nigeria  was told about Igbo  Yoruba and Hausa  with the Hausa being Harry. So what seems like an eccentric if tragic joke about Harry becomes a way to spread ethnic hatred. My father was educated in Cork  in the University of Cork  in the '  s. In fact  every time I read in Ireland  people get me all mistaken and they say   Oh  this is Chris O'Barney from Cork.  But he was also in Oxford in the '  s  and yet growing up as a child in Nigeria  my father used to say to me   You must never eat or drink in a Yoruba person's house because they will poison you.  It makes sense now when I think about it  because if you'd known my father  you would've wanted to poison him too. So I was born in       at the beginning of the Biafran Nigerian Civil War  and the war ended after three years. And I was growing up in school and the federal government didn't want us taught about the history of the war  because they thought it probably would make us generate a new generation of rebels. So I had a very inventive teacher  a Pakistani Muslim  who wanted to teach us about this. So what he did was to teach us Jewish Holocaust history  and so huddled around books with photographs of people in Auschwitz  I learned the melancholic history of my people through the melancholic history of another people. I mean  picture this    really picture this. A Pakistani Muslim teaching Jewish Holocaust history to young Igbo children. Story is powerful. Story is fluid and it belongs to nobody. And it should come as no surprise that my first novel at    was about Neo Nazis taking over Nigeria to institute the Fourth Reich. It makes perfect sense. And they were to blow up strategic targets and take over the country  and they were foiled by a Nigerian James Bond called Coyote Williams  and a Jewish Nazi hunter. And it happened over four continents. And when the book came out  I was heralded as Africa's answer to Frederick Forsyth  which is a dubious honor at best. But also  the book was launched in time for me to be accused of constructing the blueprint for a foiled coup attempt. So at     I was bonded off to prison in Nigeria. I grew up very privileged  and it's important to talk about privilege  because we don't talk about it here. A lot of us are very privileged. I grew up    servants  cars  televisions  all that stuff. My story of Nigeria growing up was very different from the story I encountered in prison  and I had no language for it. I was completely terrified  completely broken  and kept trying to find a new language  a new way to make sense of all of this. Six months after that  with no explanation  they let me go. Now for those of you who have seen me at the buffet tables know that it was because it was costing them too much to feed me. But I mean  I grew up with this incredible privilege  and not just me    millions of Nigerians grew up with books and libraries. In fact  we were talking last night about how all of the steamy novels of Harold Robbins had done more for sex education of horny teenage boys in Africa than any sex education programs ever had. All of those are gone. We are squandering the most valuable resource we have on this continent  the valuable resource of the imagination. In the film   Sometimes in April  by Raoul Peck  Idris Elba is poised in a scene with his machete raised  and he's being forced by a crowd to chop up his best friend    fellow Rwandan Army officer  albeit a Tutsi    played by Fraser James. And Fraser's on his knees  arms tied behind his back  and he's crying. He's sniveling. It's a pitiful sight. And as we watch it  we are ashamed. And we want to say to Idris   Chop him up. Shut him up.  And as Idris moves  Fraser screams   Stop  Please stop   Idris pauses  then he moves again  and Fraser says   Please  Please stop   And it's not the look of horror and terror on Fraser's face that stops Idris or us  it's the look in Fraser's eyes. It's one that says   Don't do this. And I'm not saying this to save myself  although this would be nice. I'm doing it to save you  because if you do this  you will be lost.  To be so afraid that you're standing in the face of a death you can't escape and that you're soiling yourself and crying  but to say in that moment  as Fraser says to Idris   Tell my girlfriend I love her.  In that moment  Fraser says   I am lost already  but not you ... not you.  This is a redemption we can all aspire to. African narratives in the West  they proliferate. I really don't care anymore. I'm more interested in the stories we tell about ourselves    how as a writer  I find that African writers have always been the curators of our humanity on this continent. The question is  how do I balance narratives that are wonderful with narratives of wounds and self loathing  And this is the difficulty that I face. I am trying to move beyond political rhetoric to a place of ethical questioning. I am asking us to balance the idea of our complete vulnerability with the complete notion of transformation of what is possible. As a young middle class Nigerian activist  I launched myself along with a whole generation of us into the campaign to stop the government. And I asked millions of people  without questioning my right to do so  to go up against the government. And I watched them being locked up in prison and tear gassed. I justified it  and I said   This is the cost of revolution. Have I not myself been imprisoned  Have I not myself been beaten   It wasn't until later  when I was imprisoned again  that I understood the real meaning of torture  and how easy your humanity can be taken from you  for the time I was engaged in war  righteous  righteous war. Excuse me. Sometimes I can stand before the world    and when I say this  transformation is a difficult and slow process    sometimes I can stand before the world and say   My name is Chris Abani. I have been human six days  but only sometimes.  But this is a good thing. It's never going to be easy. There are no answers. As I was telling Rachel from Google Earth  that I had challenged my students in America    I said   You don't know anything about Africa  you're all idiots.  And so they said   Tell me about Africa  Professor Abani.  So I went to Google Earth and learned about Africa. And the truth be told  this is it  isn't it  There are no essential Africans  and most of us are as completely ignorant as everyone else about the continent we come from  and yet we want to make profound statements about it. And I think if we can just admit that we're all trying to approximate the truth of our own communities  it will make for a much more nuanced and a much more interesting conversation. I want to believe that we can be agnostic about this  that we can rise above all of this. When I was     I read James Baldwin's  Another Country   and that book broke me. Not because I was encountering homosexual sex and love for the first time  but because the way James wrote about it made it impossible for me to attach otherness to it.  Here   Jimmy said.  Here is love  all of it.  The fact that it happens in  Another Country  takes you quite by surprise. My friend Ronald Gottesman says there are three kinds of people in the world  those who can count  and those who can't. He also says that the cause of all our trouble is the belief in an essential  pure identity  religious  ethnic  historical  ideological. I want to leave you with a poem by Yusef Komunyakaa that speaks to transformation. It's called  Ode to the Drum   and I'll try and read it the way Yusef would be proud to hear it read.  Gazelle  I killed you for your skin's exquisite touch  for how easy it is to be nailed to a board weathered raw as white butcher paper. Last night I heard my daughter praying for the meat here at my feet. You know it wasn't anger that made me stop my heart till the hammer fell. Weeks ago  you broke me as a woman once shattered me into a song beneath her weight  before you slouched into that grassy hush. And now I'm tightening lashes  shaped in hide as if around a ribcage  shaped like five bowstrings. Ghosts cannot slip back inside the body's drum. You've been seasoned by wind  dusk and sunlight. Pressure can make everything whole again. Brass nails tacked into the ebony wood  your face has been carved five times. I have to drive trouble in the hills. Trouble in the valley  and trouble by the river too. There is no palm wine  fish  salt  or calabash. Kadoom. Kadoom. Kadoom. Ka doooom. Now I have beaten a song back into you. Rise and walk away like a panther.  Thank you. I really am honored to be here  and as Chris said  it's been over    years since I started working in Africa. My first introduction was at the Abidjan airport on a sweaty  Ivory Coast morning. I had just left Wall Street  cut my hair to look like Margaret Mead  given away most everything that I owned  and arrived with all the essentials    some poetry  a few clothes  and  of course  a guitar    because I was going to save the world  and I thought I would just start with the African continent. But literally within days of arriving I was told  in no uncertain terms  by a number of West African women  that Africans didn't want saving  thank you very much  least of all not by me. I was too young  unmarried  I had no children  didn't really know Africa  and besides  my French was pitiful. And so  it was an incredibly painful time in my life  and yet it really started to give me the humility to start listening. I think that failure can be an incredibly motivating force as well  so I moved to Kenya and worked in Uganda  and I met a group of Rwandan women  who asked me  in       to move to Kigali to help them start the first microfinance institution there. And I did  and we ended up naming it Duterimbere  meaning  to go forward with enthusiasm.  And while we were doing it  I realized that there weren't a lot of businesses that were viable and started by women  and so maybe I should try to run a business  too. And so I started looking around  and I heard about a bakery that was run by    prostitutes. And  being a little intrigued  I went to go meet this group  and what I found was    unwed mothers who were trying to survive. And it was really the beginning of my understanding the power of language  and how what we call people so often distances us from them  and makes them little. I also found out that the bakery was nothing like a business  that  in fact  it was a classic charity run by a well intentioned person  who essentially spent     dollars a month to keep these    women busy making little crafts and baked goods  and living on    cents a day  still in poverty. So  I made a deal with the women. I said   Look  we get rid of the charity side  and we run this as a business and I'll help you.  They nervously agreed. I nervously started  and  of course  things are always harder than you think they're going to be. First of all  I thought  well  we need a sales team  and we clearly aren't the A Team here  so let's    I did all this training. And the epitome was when I literally marched into the streets of Nyamirambo  which is the popular quarter of Kigali  with a bucket  and I sold all these little doughnuts to people  and I came back  and I was like   You see   And the women said   You know  Jacqueline  who in Nyamirambo is not going to buy doughnuts out of an orange bucket from a tall American woman   And like    So then I went the whole American way  with competitions  team and individual. Completely failed  but over time  the women learnt to sell on their own way. And they started listening to the marketplace  and they came back with ideas for cassava chips  and banana chips  and sorghum bread  and before you knew it  we had cornered the Kigali market  and the women were earning three to four times the national average. And with that confidence surge  I thought   Well  it's time to create a real bakery  so let's paint it.  And the women said   That's a really great idea.  And I said   Well  what color do you want to paint it   And they said   Well  you choose.  And I said   No  no  I'm learning to listen. You choose. It's your bakery  your street  your country    not mine.  But they wouldn't give me an answer. So  one week  two weeks  three weeks went by  and finally I said   Well  how about blue   And they said   Blue  blue  we love blue. Let's do it blue.  So  I went to the store  I brought Gaudence  the recalcitrant one of all  and we brought all this paint and fabric to make curtains  and on painting day  we all gathered in Nyamirambo  and the idea was we would paint it white with blue as trim  like a little French bakery. But that was clearly not as satisfying as painting a wall of blue like a morning sky. So  blue  blue  everything became blue. The walls were blue  the windows were blue  the sidewalk out front was painted blue. And Aretha Franklin was shouting  R E S P E C T   the women's hips were swaying and little kids were trying to grab the paintbrushes  but it was their day. And at the end of it  we stood across the street and we looked at what we had done  and I said   It is so beautiful.  And the women said   It really is.  And I said   And I think the color is perfect   and they all nodded their head  except for Gaudence  and I said   What   And she said   Nothing.  And I said   What   And she said   Well  it is pretty  but  you know  our color  really  it is green.  And       I learned then that listening isn't just about patience  but that when you've lived on charity and dependent your whole life long  it's really hard to say what you mean. And  mostly because people never really ask you  and when they do  you don't really think they want to know the truth. And so then I learned that listening is not only about waiting  but it's also learning how better to ask questions. And so  I lived in Kigali for about two and a half years  doing these two things  and it was an extraordinary time in my life. And it taught me three lessons that I think are so important for us today  and certainly in the work that I do. The first is that dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth. As Eleni has said  when people gain income  they gain choice  and that is fundamental to dignity. But as human beings  we also want to see each other  and we want to be heard by each other  and we should never forget that. The second is that traditional charity and aid are never going to solve the problems of poverty. I think Andrew pretty well covered that  so I will move to the third point  which is that markets alone also are not going to solve the problems of poverty. Yes  we ran this as a business  but someone needed to pay the philanthropic support that came into the training  and the management support  the strategic advice and  maybe most important of all  the access to new contacts  networks and new markets. And so  on a micro level  there's a real role for this combination of investment and philanthropy. And on a macro level    some of the speakers have inferred that even health should be privatized. But  having had a father with heart disease  and realizing that what our family could afford was not what he should have gotten  and having a good friend step in to help  I really believe that all people deserve access to health at prices they can afford. I think the market can help us figure that out  but there's got to be a charitable component  or I don't think we're going to create the kind of societies we want to live in. And so  it was really those lessons that made me decide to build Acumen Fund about six years ago. It's a nonprofit  venture capital fund for the poor  a few oxymorons in one sentence. It essentially raises charitable funds from individuals  foundations and corporations  and then we turn around and we invest equity and loans in both for profit and nonprofit entities that deliver affordable health  housing  energy  clean water to low income people in South Asia and Africa  so that they can make their own choices. We've invested about    million dollars in    different enterprises  and have  in so doing  created nearly        jobs  and delivered tens of millions of services to people who otherwise would not be able to afford them. I want to tell you two stories. Both of them are in Africa. Both of them are about investing in entrepreneurs who are committed to service  and who really know the markets. Both of them live at the confluence of public health and enterprise  and both of them  because they're manufacturers  create jobs directly  and create incomes indirectly  because they're in the malaria sector  and Africa loses about    billion dollars a year because of malaria. And so as people get healthier  they also get wealthier. The first one is called Advanced Bio Extracts Limited. It's a company built in Kenya about seven years ago by an incredible entrepreneur named Patrick Henfrey and his three colleagues. These are old hand farmers who've gone through all the agricultural ups and downs in Kenya over the last    years. Now  this plant is an Artemisia plant  it's the basic component for artemisinin  which is the best known treatment for malaria. It's indigenous to China and the Far East  but given that the prevalence of malaria is here in Africa  Patrick and his colleagues said   Let's bring it here  because it's a high value add product.  The farmers get three to four times the yields that they would with maize. And so  using patient capital    money that they could raise early on  that actually got below market returns and was willing to go the long haul and be combined with management assistance  strategic assistance    they've now created a company where they purchase from       farmers. So that's about        people affected. And I think some of you may have visited    these farmers are helped by KickStart and TechnoServe  who help them become more self sufficient. They buy it  they dry it and they bring it to this factory  which was purchased in part by  again  patient capital from Novartis  who has a real interest in getting the powder so that they can make Coartem. Acumen's been working with ABE for the past year  year and a half  both on looking at a new business plan  and what does expansion look like  helping with management support and helping to do term sheets and raise capital. And I really understood what patient capital meant emotionally in the last month or so. Because the company was literally    days away from proving that the product they produced was at the world quality level needed to make Coartem  when they were in the biggest cash crisis of their history. And we called all of the social investors we know. Now  some of these same social investors are really interested in Africa and understand the importance of agriculture  and they even helped the farmers. And even when we explained that if ABE goes away  all those       jobs go away too  we sometimes have this bifurcation between business and the social. And it's really time we start thinking more creatively about how they can be fused. So Acumen made not one  but two bridge loans  and the good news is they did indeed meet world quality classification and are now in the final stages of closing a    million dollar round  to move it to the next level  and I think that this will be one of the more important companies in East Africa. This is Samuel. He's a farmer. He was actually living in the Kibera slums when his father called him and told him about Artemisia and the value add potential. So he moved back to the farm  and  long story short  they now have seven acres under cultivation. Samuel's kids are in private school  and he's starting to help other farmers in the area also go into Artemisia production    dignity being more important than wealth. The next one  many of you know. I talked about it a little at Oxford two years ago  and some of you visited A to Z manufacturing  which is one of the great  real companies in East Africa. It's another one that lives at the confluence of health and enterprise. And this is really a story about a public private solution that has really worked. It started in Japan. Sumitomo had developed a technology essentially to impregnate a polyethylene based fiber with organic insecticide  so you could create a bed net  a malaria bed net  that would last five years and not need to be re dipped. It could alter the vector  but like Artemisia  it had been produced only in East Asia. And as part of its social responsibility  Sumitomo said   Why don't we experiment with whether we can produce it in Africa  for Africans   UNICEF came forward and said   We'll buy most of the nets  and then we'll give them away  as part of the global fund's and the U.N.'s commitment to pregnant women and children  for free.  Acumen came in with the patient capital  and we also helped to identify the entrepreneur that we would all partner with here in Africa  and Exxon provided the initial resin. Well  in looking around for entrepreneurs  there was none better that we could find on earth than Anuj Shah  in A to Z manufacturing company. It's a    year old company  it understands manufacturing. It's gone from socialist Tanzania into capitalist Tanzania  and continued to flourish. It had about       employees when we first found it. And so  Anuj took the entrepreneurial risk here in Africa to produce a public good that was purchased by the aid establishment to work with malaria. And  long story short  again  they've been so successful. In our first year  the first net went off the line in October of     . We thought the hitting it out of the box number was         nets a year. This year  they are now producing eight million nets a year  and they employ       people     percent of whom are women  mostly unskilled. They're in a joint venture with Sumitomo. And so  from an enterprise perspective for Africa  and from a public health perspective  these are real successes. But it's only half the story if we're really looking at solving problems of poverty  because it's not long term sustainable. It's a company with one big customer. And if avian flu hits  or for any other reason the world decides that malaria is no longer as much of a priority  everybody loses. And so  Anuj and Acumen have been talking about testing the private sector  because the assumption that the aid establishment has made is that  look  in a country like Tanzania     percent of the population makes less than two dollars a day. It costs  at manufacturing point  six dollars to produce these  and it costs the establishment another six dollars to distribute it  so the market price in a free market would be about    dollars per net. Most people can't afford that  so let's give it away free. And we said   Well  there's another option. Let's use the market as the best listening device we have  and understand at what price people would pay for this  so they get the dignity of choice. We can start building local distribution  and actually  it can cost the public sector much less.  And so we came in with a second round of patient capital to A to Z  a loan as well as a grant  so that A to Z could play with pricing and listen to the marketplace  and found a number of things. One  that people will pay different prices  but the overwhelming number of people will come forth at one dollar per net and make a decision to buy it. And when you listen to them  they'll also have a lot to say about what they like and what they don't like. And that some of the channels we thought would work didn't work. But because of this experimentation and iteration that was allowed because of the patient capital  we've now found that it costs about a dollar in the private sector to distribute  and a dollar to buy the net. So then  from a policy perspective  when you start with the market  we have a choice. We can continue going along at    dollars a net  and the customer pays zero  or we could at least experiment with some of it  to charge one dollar a net  costing the public sector another six dollars a net  give the people the dignity of choice  and have a distribution system that might  over time  start sustaining itself. We've got to start having conversations like this  and I don't think there's any better way to start than using the market  but also to bring other people to the table around it. Whenever I go to visit A to Z  I think of my grandmother  Stella. She was very much like those women sitting behind the sewing machines. She grew up on a farm in Austria  very poor  didn't have very much education. She moved to the United States  where she met my grandfather  who was a cement hauler  and they had nine children. Three of them died as babies. My grandmother had tuberculosis  and she worked in a sewing machine shop  making shirts for about    cents an hour. She  like so many of the women I see at A to Z  worked hard every day  understood what suffering was  had a deep faith in God  loved her children and would never have accepted a handout. But because she had the opportunity of the marketplace  and she lived in a society that provided the safety of having access to affordable health and education  her children and their children were able to live lives of real purpose and follow real dreams. I look around at my siblings and my cousins    and as I said  there are a lot of us    and I see teachers and musicians  hedge fund managers  designers. One sister who makes other people's wishes come true. And my wish  when I see those women  I meet those farmers  and I think about all the people across this continent who are working hard every day  is that they have that sense of opportunity and possibility  and that they also can believe and get access to services  so that their children  too  can live those lives of great purpose. It shouldn't be that difficult. But what it takes is a commitment from all of us to essentially refuse trite assumptions  get out of our ideological boxes. It takes investing in those entrepreneurs that are committed to service as well as to success. It takes opening your arms  both  wide  and expecting very little love in return  but demanding accountability  and bringing the accountability to the table as well. And most of all  most of all  it requires that all of us have the courage and the patience  whether we are rich or poor  African or non African  local or diaspora  left or right  to really start listening to each other. Thank you. I d like to dedicate this one to all the women in South Africa    those women who refused to dwindle in the midst of apartheid. And  of course  I m dedicating it also to my grandmother  whom I think really played quite a lot of important roles  especially for me when I was an activist  and being harassed by the police. You will recall that in       June     the students of South Africa boycotted the language of Afrikaans as the medium of the oppressor  as they were sort of like really told that they must do everything in Afrikaans    biology  mathematics    and what about our languages  And the students wanted to speak to the government  and police answered with bullets. So every year  June     we will commemorate all those comrades or students who died. And I was very young then. I think I was    years  and I started asking questions  and that s when my political education started. And I joined  later on  the youth organization under the African National Congress. So as part of organizing this and whatever  this commemoration  the police will round us up as they call us leaders. And I used to run away from home  when I know that maybe the police might be coming around the ninth or   th of June or so. And my grandmother one time said   No  look  you re not going to run away. This is your place  you stay here.  And indeed  the police came    because they ll just arrest us and put us in jail and release us whenever they feel like  after the   th or so. So it was on the   th of June  and they came  and they surrounded the house  and my grandmother switched off all the lights in the house  and opened the kitchen door. And she said to them   Vusi's here  and you're not going to take him tonight. I'm tired of you having to come here  harassing us  while your children are sleeping peacefully in your homes. He is here  and you're not going to take him. I've got a bowl full of boiling water    the first one who comes in here  gets it.  And they left.   Thula Mama  Thula Mama  Thula Mama  Thula Mama.     Through the mist of the tears in your eyes on my childhood memory      I know the truth in your smile      I know the truth in your smile      piercing through the gloom of my ignorance.     Oh  there is a mama lying down sleeping     you're very ill and your heart crying.     Wondering  wondering  wondering  wondering where is this world coming to.     Is it right the children have to fend for themselves  No  no  no  no  no. no.     Is it right heaping trouble on an old lady's head      So unlucky faceless people.     Thula Mama Mama  Thula Mama. Thula Mama Mama.     Thula Mama  Thula Mama  Thula Mama Mama  Thula Mama     Tomorrow it s going to be better.     Tomorrow it's going to be better to climb  Mama.     Thula Mama  Thula Mama.     Am I to break into the song like the blues man or troubadour.     And then from long distance in no blues club am I to sing      baby  baby  baby  baby  baby  baby  baby  baby  baby  baby  baby  baby.     Should I now stop singing of love      now that my memory s surrounded by blood      Sister  why oh why do we at times mistake a pimple for a cancer      So who are they who says  no more love poems now      I want to sing a song of love     for that woman who jumped the fences pregnant     and still gave birth to a healthy child.     Softly I walk into the sun rays of the smile     that will ignite my love song  my song of life      my song of love  my song of life  my song of love      my song of life  my song of love  my song of life.     Ooh  I ve not tried to run away from song      I hear a persistent voice  more powerful than the enemy bombs.     The song that washed our lives and the rains of our blood.     My song of love and my song of life  my song of love      my song of life  my song of love      my song of life  my song of love    I want everybody to sing with me        my song of life  my song of love  my song of life    everybody sing with me        my song of life  my song of love    I can t hear you        my song of love  my song of life    you can do better        my song of life  my song of love    keep singing  keep singing        my song of love  my song of life  yes  my song of love        you can do better than that        my song of life  yes  my song of love  my song of life  my song of love        keep singing  keep singing  keep singing    my song of love.     Oh yeah. My song of    a love song  my song of life. Sing. A love song  my song of life. Sing.     Love song  my song of life. Sing. Love song  my song of life. Sing.     Love song  my song of life. Sing. Love song  my song of life.     Love song  my song of life.   I've actually been waiting by the phone for a call from TED for years. And in fact  in       I was ready to talk about eBay  but no call. In       I was ready to do a talk about the Skoll Foundation and social entrepreneurship. No call. In       I started Participant Productions and we had a really good first year  and no call. And finally  I get a call last year  and then I have to go up after J.J. Abrams. You've got a cruel sense of humor  TED. When I first moved to Hollywood from Silicon Valley  I had some misgivings. But I found that there were some advantages to being in Hollywood. And  in fact  some advantages to owning your own media company. And I also found that Hollywood and Silicon Valley have a lot more in common than I would have dreamed. Hollywood has its sex symbols  and the Valley has its sex symbols. Hollywood has its rivalries  and the Valley has its rivalries. Hollywood gathers around power tables  and the Valley gathers around power tables. So it turned out there was a lot more in common than I would have dreamed. But I'm actually here today to tell a story. And part of it is a personal story. When Chris invited me to speak  he said  people think of you as a bit of an enigma  and they want to know what drives you a bit. And what really drives me is a vision of the future that I think we all share. It's a world of peace and prosperity and sustainability. And when we heard a lot of the presentations over the last couple of days  Ed Wilson and the pictures of James Nachtwey  I think we all realized how far we have to go to get to this new version of humanity that I like to call  Humanity  . .  And it's also something that resides in each of us  to close what I think are the two big calamities in the world today. One is the gap in opportunity    this gap that President Clinton last night called uneven  unfair and unsustainable    and  out of that  comes poverty and illiteracy and disease and all these evils that we see around us. But perhaps the other  bigger gap is what we call the hope gap. And someone  at some point  came up with this very bad idea that an ordinary individual couldn't make a difference in the world. And I think that's just a horrible thing. And so chapter one really begins today  with all of us  because within each of us is the power to equal those opportunity gaps and to close the hope gaps. And if the men and women of TED can't make a difference in the world  I don't know who can. And for me  a lot of this started when I was younger and my family used to go camping in upstate New York. And there really wasn't much to do there for the summer  except get beaten up by my sister or read books. And so I used to read authors like James Michener and James Clavell and Ayn Rand. And their stories made the world seem a very small and interconnected place. And it struck me that if I could write stories that were about this world as being small and interconnected  that maybe I could get people interested in the issues that affected us all  and maybe engage them to make a difference. I didn't think that was necessarily the best way to make a living  so I decided to go on a path to become financially independent  so I could write these stories as quickly as I could. I then had a bit of a wake up call when I was   . And my dad came home one day and announced that he had cancer  and it looked pretty bad. And what he said was  he wasn't so much afraid that he might die  but that he hadn't done the things that he wanted to with his life. And knock on wood  he's still alive today  many years later. But for a young man that made a real impression on me  that one never knows how much time one really has. So I set out in a hurry. I studied engineering. I started a couple of businesses that I thought would be the ticket to financial freedom. One of those businesses was a computer rental business called Micros on the Move  which is very well named  because people kept stealing the computers. So I figured I needed to learn a little bit more about business  so I went to Stanford Business School and studied there. And while I was there  I made friends with a fellow named Pierre Omidyar  who is here today. And Pierre  I apologize for this. This is a photo from the old days. And just after I'd graduated  Pierre came to me with this idea to help people buy and sell things online with each other. And with the wisdom of my Stanford degree  I said   Pierre  what a stupid idea.  And needless to say  I was right. But right after that  Pierre    in '    Pierre and I left our full time jobs to build eBay as a company. And the rest of that story  you know. The company went public two years later and is today one of the best known companies in the world. Hundreds of millions of people use it in hundreds of countries  and so on. But for me  personally  it was a real change. I went from living in a house with five guys in Palo Alto and living off their leftovers  to all of a sudden having all kinds of resources. And I wanted to figure out how I could take the blessing of these resources and share it with the world. And around that time  I met John Gardner  who is a remarkable man. He was the architect of the Great Society programs under Lyndon Johnson in the     s. And I asked him what he felt was the best thing I could do  or anyone could do  to make a difference in the long term issues facing humanity. And John said   Bet on good people doing good things. Bet on good people doing good things.  And that really resonated with me. I started a foundation to bet on these good people doing good things. These leading  innovative  nonprofit folks  who are using business skills in a very leveraged way to solve social problems. People today we call social entrepreneurs. And to put a face on it  people like Muhammad Yunus  who started the Grameen Bank  has lifted     million people plus out of poverty around the world  won the Nobel Peace Prize. But there's also a lot of people that you don't know. Folks like Ann Cotton  who started a group called CAMFED in Africa  because she felt girls' education was lagging. And she started it about    years ago  and today  she educates over a quarter million African girls. And somebody like Dr. Victoria Hale  who started the world's first nonprofit pharmaceutical company  and whose first drug will be fighting visceral leishmaniasis  also known as black fever. And by       she hopes to eliminate this disease  which is really a scourge in the developing world. And so this is one way to bet on good people doing good things. And a lot of this comes together in a philosophy of change that I find really is powerful. It's what we call   Invest  connect and celebrate.  And invest  if you see good people doing good things  invest in them. Invest in their organizations  or in business. Invest in these folks. Connecting them together through conferences    like a TED    brings so many powerful connections  or through the World Forum on Social Entrepreneurship that my foundation does at Oxford every year. And celebrate them  tell their stories  because not only are there good people doing good work  but their stories can help close these gaps of hope. And it was this last part of the mission  the celebrate part  that really got me back to thinking when I was a kid and wanted to tell stories to get people involved in the issues that affect us all. And a light bulb went off  which was  first  that I didn't actually have to do the writing myself  I could find writers. And then the next light bulb was  better than just writing  what about film and TV  to get out to people in a big way  And I thought about the films that inspired me  films like  Gandhi  and  Schindler's List.  And I wondered who was doing these kinds of films today. And there really wasn't a specific company that was focused on the public interest. So  in       I started to make my way around Los Angeles to talk about the idea of a pro social media company and I was met with a lot of encouragement. One of the lines of encouragement that I heard over and over was   The streets of Hollywood are littered with the carcasses of people like you  who think you're going to come to this town and make movies.  And then of course  there was the other adage.  The surest way to become a millionaire is to start by being a billionaire and go into the movie business.  Undeterred  in January of       I started Participant Productions with the vision to be a global media company focused on the public interest. And our mission is to produce entertainment that creates and inspires social change. And we don't just want people to see our movies and say  that was fun  and forget about it. We want them to actually get involved in the issues. In       we launched our first slate of films   Murder Ball    North Country    Syriana  and  Good Night and Good Luck.  And much to my surprise  they were noticed. We ended up with    Oscar nominations for these films. And it turned out to be a pretty good year for this guy. Perhaps more importantly  tens of thousands of people joined the advocacy programs and the activism programs that we created to go around the movies. And we had an online component of that  our community sect called Participate.net. But with our social sector partners  like the ACLU and PBS and the Sierra Club and the NRDC  once people saw the film  there was actually something they could do to make a difference. One of these films in particular  called  North Country   was actually kind of a box office disaster. But it was a film that starred Charlize Theron and it was about women's rights  women's empowerment  domestic violence and so on. And we released the film at the same time that the Congress was debating the renewal of the Violence Against Women Act. And with screenings on the Hill  and discussions  and with our social sector partners  like the National Organization of Women  the film was widely credited with influencing the successful renewal of the act. And that to me  spoke volumes  because it's    the film started about a true life story about a woman who was harassed  sued her employer  led to a landmark case that led to the Equal Opportunity Act  and the Violence Against Women Act and others. And then the movie about this person doing these things  then led to this greater renewal. And so again  it goes back to betting on good people doing good things. Speaking of which  our fellow TEDster  Al    I first saw Al do his slide show presentation on global warming in May of     . At that point  I thought I knew something about global warming. I thought it was a    to    year problem. And after we saw his slide show  it became clear that it was much more urgent. And so right afterwards  I met backstage with Al  and with Lawrence Bender  who was there  and Laurie David  and Davis Guggenheim  who was running documentaries for Participant at the time. And with Al's blessing  we decided on the spot to turn it into a film  because we felt that we could get the message out there far more quickly than having Al go around the world  speaking to audiences of     or     at a time. And you know  there's another adage in Hollywood  that nobody knows nothing about anything. And I really thought this was going to be a straight to PBS charitable initiative. And so it was a great shock to all of us when the film really captured the public interest  and today is mandatory viewing in schools in England and Scotland  and most of Scandinavia. We've sent        DVDs to high school teachers in the U.S. and it's really changed the debate on global warming. It was also a pretty good year for this guy. We now call Al the George Clooney of global warming. And for Participant  this is just the start. Everything we do looks at the major issues in the world. And we have    films in production right now  and dozens others in development. I'll quickly talk about a few coming up. One is  Charlie Wilson's War   with Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts. And it's the true story of Congressman Charlie Wilson  and how he funded the Taliban to fight the Russians in Afghanistan. And we're also doing a movie called  The Kite Runner   based on the book  The Kite Runner   also about Afghanistan. And we think once people see these films  they'll have a much better understanding of that part of the world and the Middle East in general. We premiered a film called  The Chicago     at Sundance this year. It's based on the protesters at the Democratic Convention in       Abby Hoffman and crew  and  again  a story about a small group of individuals who did make change in the world. And a documentary that we're doing on Jimmy Carter and his Mid East peace efforts over the years. And in particular  we've been following him on his recent book tour  which  as many of you know  has been very non controversial       which is really bad for getting people to come see a movie. In closing  I'd like to say that everybody has the opportunity to make change in their own way. And all the people in this room have done so through their business lives  or their philanthropic work  or their other interests. And one thing that I've learned is that there's never one right way to make change. One can do it as a tech person  or as a finance person  or a nonprofit person  or as an entertainment person  but every one of us is all of those things and more. And I believe if we do these things  we can close the opportunity gaps  we can close the hope gaps. And I can imagine  if we do this  the headlines in    years might read something like these   New AIDS Cases in Africa Fall to Zero    U.S. Imports its Last Barrel of Oil         Israelis and Palestinians Celebrate    Years of Peaceful Coexistence.  And I like this one   Snow Has Returned to Kilimanjaro.  And finally  an eBay listing for one well traveled slide show  now obsolete  museum piece. Please contact Al Gore. And I believe that  working together  we can make all of these things happen. And I want to thank you all for having me here today. It's been a real honor. Thank you. Oh  thank you. I got a visit almost exactly a year ago  a little over a year ago  from a very senior person at the Department of Defense. Came to see me and said         of the kids that we've sent out have come back missing at least one full arm. Whole arm. Shoulder disarticulation. And we're doing the same thing we did for    more or less  that we've done since the Civil War  a stick and a hook. And they deserve more than that.  And literally  this guy sat in my office in New Hampshire and said   I want you to give me something that we can put on these kids that'll pick up a raisin or a grape off a table  they'll be able to put it in their mouth without destroying either one  and they'll be able to know the difference without looking at it.  You know  had efferent  afferent  and haptic response. He finishes explaining that  and I'm waiting for the big     pound paper proposal  and he said   That's what I want from you.  I said   Look  you're nuts. That technology's just not available right now. And it can't be done. Not in an envelope of a human arm  with    degrees of freedom  from your shoulder to your fingertips.  He said   About two dozen of these       kids have come back bilateral. You think it's bad to lose one arm  That's an inconvenience compared to having both of them gone.  I got a day job  and my nights and weekends are already filled up with things like  let's supply water to the world  and power to the world  and educate all the kids  which  Chris  I will not talk about. I don't need another mission. I keep thinking about these kids with no arms. He says to me   We've done some work around the country. We've got some pretty amazing neurology and other people.  I said   I'll take a field trip  I'll go see what you got.  Over the next month I visited lots of places  some out here  around the country  found the best of the best. I went down to Washington. I saw these guys  and said   I did what you asked me. I looked at what's out there. I still think you're nuts. But not as nuts as I thought.  I put a team together  a little over    months ago  got up to    some odd people. We said  we're going to build a device that does what he wants. We have    out of the    degrees of freedom  you don't need the ones in the last two fingers. We put this thing together. A couple of weeks ago we took it down to Walter Reed  which is unfortunately more in the news these days. We showed it to a bunch of guys. One guy who described himself as being lucky  because he lost his left arm  and he's a righty. He sat at a table with seven or eight of these other guys. Said he was lucky  because he had his good arm  and then he pushed himself back from the table. He had no legs. These kids have attitudes that you just can't believe. So I'm going to show you now  without the skin on it  a    second piece  and then I'm done. But understand what you're looking at we made small enough to fit on a   th percentile female  so that we could put it in any of these people. It's going to go inside something that we use in CAT scans and MRIs of whatever is their good arm  to make silicon rubber  then coat it  and paint it in  D    exact mirror image of their other limb. So  you won't see all the really cool stuff that's in this series elastic set of    actuators  each one which has its own capability to sense temperature and pressure. It also has a pneumatic cuff that holds it on  so the more they put themselves under load  the more it attaches. They take the load off  and it becomes  again  compliant. I'm going to show you a guy doing a couple of simple things with this that we demonstrated in Washington. Can we look at this thing  Watch the fingers grab. The thumb comes up. Wrist. This weighs  .  pounds. Going to scratch his nose. It's got    active degrees of freedom. Now he's going to pick up a pen with his opposed thumb and index finger. Now he's going to put that down  pick up a piece of paper  rotate all the degrees of freedom in his hand and wrist  and read it. Now  have any of y'all ever looked up this word  You know  in a dictionary   Laughter  Yeah  that's what I thought. How about this word  Here  I'll show it to you. Lexicography  the practice of compiling dictionaries. Notice    we're very specific    that word  compile.  The dictionary is not carved out of a piece of granite  out of a lump of rock. It's made up of lots of little bits. It's little discrete    that's spelled D I S C R E T E    bits. And those bits are words. Now one of the perks of being a lexicographer    besides getting to come to TED    is that you get to say really fun words  like lexicographical. Lexicographical has this great pattern  it's called a double dactyl. And just by saying double dactyl  I've sent the geek needle all the way into the red.  Laughter   Applause  But  lexicographical  is the same pattern as  higgledy piggledy.  Right  It's a fun word to say  and I get to say it a lot. Now  one of the non perks of being a lexicographer is that people don't usually have a kind of warm  fuzzy  snuggly image of the dictionary. Right  Nobody hugs their dictionaries. But what people really often think about the dictionary is  they think more like this. Just to let you know  I do not have a lexicographical whistle. But people think that my job is to let the good words make that difficult left hand turn into the dictionary  and keep the bad words out. But the thing is  I don't want to be a traffic cop. For one thing  I just do not do uniforms. And for another  deciding what words are good and what words are bad is actually not very easy. And it's not very fun. And when parts of your job are not easy or fun  you kind of look for an excuse not to do them. So if I had to think of some kind of occupation as a metaphor for my work  I would much rather be a fisherman. I want to throw my big net into the deep  blue ocean of English and see what marvelous creatures I can drag up from the bottom. But why do people want me to direct traffic  when I would much rather go fishing  Well  I blame the Queen. Why do I blame the Queen  Well  first of all  I blame the Queen because it's funny. But secondly  I blame the Queen because dictionaries have really not changed. Our idea of what a dictionary is has not changed since her reign. The only thing that Queen Victoria would not be amused by in modern dictionaries is our inclusion of the F word  which has happened in American dictionaries since     . So  there's this guy  right  Victorian era. James Murray  first editor of the Oxford English Dictionary. I do not have that hat. I wish I had that hat. So he's really responsible for a lot of what we consider modern in dictionaries today. When a guy who looks like that  in that hat  is the face of modernity  you have a problem. And so  James Murray could get a job on any dictionary today. There'd be virtually no learning curve. And of course  a few of us are saying  okay  computers  Computers  What about computers  The thing about computers is  I love computers. I mean  I'm a huge geek  I love computers. I would go on a hunger strike before I let them take away Google Book Search from me. But computers don't do much else other than speed up the process of compiling dictionaries. They don't change the end result. Because what a dictionary is  is it's Victorian design merged with a little bit of modern propulsion. It's steampunk. What we have is an electric velocipede. You know  we have Victorian design with an engine on it. That's all  The design has not changed. And OK  what about online dictionaries  right  Online dictionaries must be different. This is the Oxford English Dictionary Online  one of the best online dictionaries. This is my favorite word  by the way. Erinaceous  pertaining to the hedgehog family  of the nature of a hedgehog. Very useful word. So  look at that. Online dictionaries right now are paper thrown up on a screen. This is flat. Look how many links there are in the actual entry  two  Right  Those little buttons  I had them all expanded except for the date chart. So there's not very much going on here. There's not a lot of clickiness. And in fact  online dictionaries replicate almost all the problems of print  except for searchability. And when you improve searchability  you actually take away the one advantage of print  which is serendipity. Serendipity is when you find things you weren't looking for  because finding what you are looking for is so damned difficult. So     Laughter   Applause     now  when you think about this  what we have here is a ham butt problem. Does everyone know the ham butt problem  Woman's making a ham for a big  family dinner. She goes to cut the butt off the ham and throw it away  and she looks at this piece of ham and she's like   This is a perfectly good piece of ham. Why am I throwing this away   She thought   Well  my mom always did this.  So she calls up mom  and she says   Mom  why'd you cut the butt off the ham  when you're making a ham   She says   I don't know  my mom always did it   So they call grandma  and grandma says   My pan was too small    Laughter  So  it's not that we have good words and bad words. We have a pan that's too small  You know  that ham butt is delicious  There's no reason to throw it away. The bad words    see  when people think about a place and they don't find a place on the map  they think   This map sucks   When they find a nightspot or a bar  and it's not in the guidebook  they're like   Ooh  this place must be cool  It's not in the guidebook.  When they find a word that's not in the dictionary  they think   This must be a bad word.  Why  It's more likely to be a bad dictionary. Why are you blaming the ham for being too big for the pan  So  you can't get a smaller ham. The English language is as big as it is. So  if you have a ham butt problem  and you're thinking about the ham butt problem  the conclusion that it leads you to is inexorable and counterintuitive  paper is the enemy of words. How can this be  I mean  I love books. I really love books. Some of my best friends are books. But the book is not the best shape for the dictionary. Now they're going to think  Oh  boy. People are going to take away my beautiful  paper dictionaries   No. There will still be paper dictionaries. When we had cars    when cars became the dominant mode of transportation  we didn't round up all the horses and shoot them. You know  there're still going to be paper dictionaries  but it's not going to be the dominant dictionary. The book shaped dictionary is not going to be the only shape dictionaries come in. And it's not going to be the prototype for the shapes dictionaries come in. So  think about it this way  if you've got an artificial constraint  artificial constraints lead to arbitrary distinctions and a skewed worldview. What if biologists could only study animals that made people go   Aww.  Right  What if we made aesthetic judgments about animals  and only the ones we thought were cute were the ones that we could study  We'd know a whole lot about charismatic megafauna  and not very much about much else. And I think this is a problem. I think we should study all the words  because when you think about words  you can make beautiful expressions from very humble parts. Lexicography is really more about material science. We are studying the tolerances of the materials that you use to build the structure of your expression  your speeches and your writing. And then  often people say to me   Well  OK  how do I know that this word is real   They think   OK  if we think words are the tools that we use to build the expressions of our thoughts  how can you say that screwdrivers are better than hammers  How can you say that a sledgehammer is better than a ball peen hammer   They're just the right tools for the job. And so people say to me   How do I know if a word is real   You know  anybody who's read a children's book knows that love makes things real. If you love a word  use it. That makes it real. Being in the dictionary is an artificial distinction. It doesn't make a word any more real than any other way. If you love a word  it becomes real. So if we're not worrying about directing traffic  if we've transcended paper  if we are worrying less about control and more about description  then we can think of the English language as being this beautiful mobile. And any time one of those little parts of the mobile changes  is touched  any time you touch a word  you use it in a new context  you give it a new connotation  you verb it  you make the mobile move. You didn't break it. It's just in a new position  and that new position can be just as beautiful. Now  if you're no longer a traffic cop    the problem with being a traffic cop is there can only be so many traffic cops in any one intersection  or the cars get confused. Right  But if your goal is no longer to direct the traffic  but maybe to count the cars that go by  then more eyeballs are better. You can ask for help  If you ask for help  you get more done. And we really need help. Library of Congress     million books  of which half are in English. If only one out of every    of those books had a word that's not in the dictionary in it  that would be equivalent to more than two unabridged dictionaries. And I find an un dictionaried word    a word like  un dictionaried   for example    in almost every book I read. What about newspapers  Newspaper archive goes back to         .  million newspaper pages. If only one in     of those pages had an un dictionaried word on it  it would be an entire other OED. That's         more words. So that's a lot. And I'm not even talking about magazines. I'm not talking about blogs    and I find more new words on BoingBoing in a given week than I do Newsweek or Time. There's a lot going on there. And I'm not even talking about polysemy  which is the greedy habit some words have of taking more than one meaning for themselves. So if you think of the word  set   a set can be a badger's burrow  a set can be one of the pleats in an Elizabethan ruff  and there's one numbered definition in the OED. The OED has    different numbered definitions for set. Tiny  little word     numbered definitions. One of them is just labeled  miscellaneous technical senses.  Do you know what that says to me  That says to me  it was Friday afternoon and somebody wanted to go down the pub.  Laughter  That's a lexicographical cop out  to say   miscellaneous technical senses.  So  we have all these words  and we really need help  And the thing is  we could ask for help    asking for help's not that hard. I mean  lexicography is not rocket science. See  I just gave you a lot of words and a lot of numbers  and this is more of a visual explanation. If we think of the dictionary as being the map of the English language  these bright spots are what we know about  and the dark spots are where we are in the dark. If that was the map of all the words in American English  we don't know very much. And we don't even know the shape of the language. If this was the dictionary    if this was the map of American English    look  we have a kind of lumpy idea of Florida  but there's no California  We're missing California from American English. We just don't know enough  and we don't even know that we're missing California. We don't even see that there's a gap on the map. So again  lexicography is not rocket science. But even if it were  rocket science is being done by dedicated amateurs these days. You know  It can't be that hard to find some words  So  enough scientists in other disciplines are really asking people to help  and they're doing a good job of it. For instance  there's eBird  where amateur birdwatchers can upload information about their bird sightings. And then  ornithologists can go and help track populations  migrations  etc. And there's this guy  Mike Oates. Mike Oates lives in the U.K. He's a director of an electroplating company. He's found more than     comets. He's found so many comets  they named a comet after him. It's kind of out past Mars. It's a hike. I don't think he's getting his picture taken there anytime soon. But he found     comets without a telescope. He downloaded data from the NASA SOHO satellite  and that's how he found them. If we can find comets without a telescope  shouldn't we be able to find words  Now  y'all know where I'm going with this. Because I'm going to the Internet  which is where everybody goes. And the Internet is great for collecting words  because the Internet's full of collectors. And this is a little known technological fact about the Internet  but the Internet is actually made up of words and enthusiasm. And words and enthusiasm actually happen to be the recipe for lexicography. Isn't that great  So there are a lot of really good word collecting sites out there right now  but the problem with some of them is that they're not scientific enough. They show the word  but they don't show any context. Where did it come from  Who said it  What newspaper was it in  What book  Because a word is like an archaeological artifact. If you don't know the provenance or the source of the artifact  it's not science  it's a pretty thing to look at. So a word without its source is like a cut flower. You know  it's pretty to look at for a while  but then it dies. It dies too fast. So  this whole time I've been saying   The dictionary  the dictionary  the dictionary  the dictionary.  Not  a dictionary   or  dictionaries.  And that's because  well  people use the dictionary to stand for the whole language. They use it synecdochically. And one of the problems of knowing a word like  synecdochically  is that you really want an excuse to say  synecdochically.  This whole talk has just been an excuse to get me to the point where I could say  synecdochically  to all of you. So I'm really sorry. But when you use a part of something    like the dictionary is a part of the language  or a flag stands for the United States  it's a symbol of the country    then you're using it synecdochically. But the thing is  we could make the dictionary the whole language. If we get a bigger pan  then we can put all the words in. We can put in all the meanings. Doesn't everyone want more meaning in their lives  And we can make the dictionary not just be a symbol of the language    we can make it be the whole language. You see  what I'm really hoping for is that my son  who turns seven this month    I want him to barely remember that this is the form factor that dictionaries used to come in. This is what dictionaries used to look like. I want him to think of this kind of dictionary as an eight track tape. It's a format that died because it wasn't useful enough. It wasn't really what people needed. And the thing is  if we can put in all the words  no longer have that artificial distinction between good and bad  we can really describe the language like scientists. We can leave the aesthetic judgments to the writers and the speakers. If we can do that  then I can spend all my time fishing  and I don't have to be a traffic cop anymore. Thank you very much for your kind attention.
