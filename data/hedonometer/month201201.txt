I've spent the last decade subjecting myself to pain and humiliation  hopefully for a good cause  which is self improvement. And I've done this in three parts. So first I started with the mind. And I decided to try to get smarter by reading the entire Encyclopedia Britannica from A to Z    or  more precisely  from  a ak  to  Zywiec.  And here's a little image of that. And this was an amazing year. It was really a fascinating journey. It was painful at times  especially for those around me. My wife started to fine me one dollar for every irrelevant fact I inserted into conversation. So it had its downsides. But after that  I decided to work on the spirit. As I mentioned last year  I grew up with no religion at all. I'm Jewish  but I'm Jewish in the same way the Olive Garden is Italian. Not really. But I decided to learn about the Bible and my heritage by actually diving in and trying to live it and immerse myself in it. So I decided to follow all the rules of the Bible. And from the Ten Commandments to growing my beard    because Leviticus says you cannot shave. So this is what I looked like by the end. Thank you for that reaction. I look a little like Moses  or Ted Kaczynski. I got both of them. So there was the topiary there. And there's the sheep. Now the final part of the trilogy was I wanted to focus on the body and try to be the healthiest person I could be  the healthiest person alive. So that's what I've been doing the last couple of years. And I just finished a couple of months ago. And I have to say  thank God. Because living so healthily was killing me. It was so overwhelming  because the amount of things you have to do  it's just mind boggling. I was listening to all the experts and talking to sort of a board of medical advisers. And they were telling me all the things I had to do. I had to eat right  exercise  meditate  pet dogs  because that lowers the blood pressure. I wrote the book on a treadmill  and it took me about a thousand miles to write the book. I had to put on sunscreen. This was no small feat  because if you listen to dermatologists  they say that you should have a shot glass full of sunscreen. And you have to reapply it every two to four hours. So I think half of my book advance went into sunscreen. I was like a glazed doughnut for most of the year. There was the washing of hands. I had to do that properly. And my immunologist told me that I should also wipe down all of the remote controls and iPhones in my house  because those are just orgies of germs. So that took a lot of time. I also tried to be the safest person I could be  because that's a part of health. I was inspired by the Danish Safety Council. They started a public campaign that says   A walking helmet is a good helmet.  So they believe you should not just wear helmets for biking  but also for walking around. And you can see there they're shopping with their helmets. Well yeah  I tried that. Now it's a little extreme  I admit. But if you think about this  this is actually    the  Freakonomics  authors wrote about this    that more people die on a per mile basis from drunk walking than from drunk driving. So something to think about tonight if you've had a couple. So I finished  and it was a success in a sense. All of the markers went in the right direction. My cholesterol went down  I lost weight  my wife stopped telling me that I looked pregnant. So that was nice. And it was successful overall. But I also learned that I was too healthy  and that was unhealthy. I was so focused on doing all these things that I was neglecting my friends and family. And as Dan Buettner can tell you  having a strong social network is so crucial to our health. So I finished. And I kind of went overboard on the week after the project was over. I went to the dark side  and I just indulged myself. It was like something out of Caligula. Without the sex part. Because I have three young kids  so that wasn't happening. But the over eating and over drinking  definitely. And I finally have stabilized. So now I'm back to adopting many    not all  I don't wear a helmet anymore    but dozens of healthy behaviors that I adopted during my year. It was really a life changing project. And I  of course  don't have time to go into all of them. Let me just tell you two really quickly. The first is    and this was surprising to me  I didn't expect this to come out    but I live a much quieter life now. Because we live in such a noisy world. There's trains and planes and cars and Bill O'Reilly  he's very noisy. And this is a real underestimated  under appreciated health hazard    not just because it harms our hearing  which it obviously does  but it actually initiates the fight or flight response. A loud noise will get your fight or flight response going. And this  over the years  can cause real damage  cardiovascular damage. The World Health Organization just did a big study that they published this year. And it was done in Europe. And they estimated that  .  million years of healthy living are lost every year in Europe because of noise pollution. So they think it's actually very deadly. And by the way  it's also terrible for your brain. It really impairs cognition. And our Founding Fathers knew about this. When they wrote the Constitution  they put dirt all over the cobblestones outside the hall so that they could concentrate. So without noise reduction technology  our country would not exist. So as a patriot  I felt it was important to    I wear all the earplugs and the earphones  and it's really improved my life in a surprising and unexpected way. And the second point I want to make  the final point  is that    and it's actually been a theme of TEDMED    that joy is so important to your health  that very few of these behaviors will stick with me unless there's some sense of pleasure and joy in them. And just to give you one instance of this  food. The junk food industry is really great at pressing our pleasure buttons and figuring out what's the most pleasurable. But I think we can use their techniques and apply them to healthy food. To give just one example  we love crunchiness  mouthfeel. So I basically have tried to incorporate crunchiness into a lot of my recipes    throw in some sunflower seeds. And you can almost trick yourself into thinking you're eating Doritos. And it has made me a healthier person. So that is it. The book about it comes out in April. It's called  Drop Dead Healthy.  And I hope that I don't get sick during the book tour. That's my greatest hope. So thank you very much. There have been many revolutions over the last century  but perhaps none as significant as the longevity revolution. We are living on average today    years longer than our great grandparents did. Think about that. That's an entire second adult lifetime that's been added to our lifespan. And yet  for the most part  our culture has not come to terms with what this means. We're still living with the old paradigm of age as an arch. That's the metaphor  the old metaphor. You're born  you peak at midlife and decline into decrepitude. Age as pathology. But many people today    philosophers  artists  doctors  scientists    are taking a new look at what I call the third act  the last three decades of life. They realize that this is actually a developmental stage of life with its own significance    as different from midlife as adolescence is from childhood. And they are asking    we should all be asking    how do we use this time  How do we live it successfully  What is the appropriate new metaphor for aging  I've spent the last year researching and writing about this subject. And I have come to find that a more appropriate metaphor for aging is a staircase    the upward ascension of the human spirit  bringing us into wisdom  wholeness and authenticity. Age not at all as pathology  age as potential. And guess what  This potential is not for the lucky few. It turns out  most people over    feel better  are less stressed  are less hostile  less anxious. We tend to see commonalities more than differences. Some of the studies even say we're happier. This is not what I expected  trust me. I come from a long line of depressives. As I was approaching my late   s  when I would wake up in the morning my first six thoughts would all be negative. And I got scared. I thought  oh my gosh. I'm going to become a crotchety old lady. But now that I am actually smack dab in the middle of my own third act  I realize I've never been happier. I have such a powerful feeling of well being. And I've discovered that when you're inside oldness  as opposed to looking at it from the outside  fear subsides. You realize  you're still yourself    maybe even more so. Picasso once said   It takes a long time to become young.  I don't want to romanticize aging. Obviously  there's no guarantee that it can be a time of fruition and growth. Some of it is a matter of luck. Some of it  obviously  is genetic. One third of it  in fact  is genetic. And there isn't much we can do about that. But that means that two thirds of how well we do in the third act  we can do something about. We're going to discuss what we can do to make these added years really successful and use them to make a difference. Now let me say something about the staircase  which may seem like an odd metaphor for seniors given the fact that many seniors are challenged by stairs. Myself included. As you may know  the entire world operates on a universal law  entropy  the second law of thermodynamics. Entropy means that everything in the world  everything  is in a state of decline and decay  the arch. There's only one exception to this universal law  and that is the human spirit  which can continue to evolve upwards    the staircase    bringing us into wholeness  authenticity and wisdom. And here's an example of what I mean. This upward ascension can happen even in the face of extreme physical challenges. About three years ago  I read an article in the New York Times. It was about a man named Neil Selinger       years old  a retired lawyer    who had joined the writers group at Sarah Lawrence where he found his writer's voice. Two years later  he was diagnosed with ALS  commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease. It's a terrible disease. It's fatal. It wastes the body  but the mind remains intact. In this article  Mr. Selinger wrote the following to describe what was happening to him. And I quote   As my muscles weakened  my writing became stronger. As I slowly lost my speech  I gained my voice. As I diminished  I grew. As I lost so much  I finally started to find myself.  Neil Selinger  to me  is the embodiment of mounting the staircase in his third act. Now we're all born with spirit  all of us  but sometimes it gets tamped down beneath the challenges of life  violence  abuse  neglect. Perhaps our parents suffered from depression. Perhaps they weren't able to love us beyond how we performed in the world. Perhaps we still suffer from a psychic pain  a wound. Perhaps we feel that many of our relationships have not had closure. And so we can feel unfinished. Perhaps the task of the third act is to finish up the task of finishing ourselves. For me  it began as I was approaching my third act  my   th birthday. How was I supposed to live it  What was I supposed to accomplish in this final act  And I realized that  in order to know where I was going  I had to know where I'd been. And so I went back and I studied my first two acts  trying to see who I was then  who I really was    not who my parents or other people told me I was  or treated me like I was. But who was I  Who were my parents    not as parents  but as people  Who were my grandparents  How did they treat my parents  These kinds of things. I discovered a couple of years later that this process that I had gone through is called by psychologists  doing a life review.  And they say it can give new significance and clarity and meaning to a person's life. You may discover  as I did  that a lot of things that you used to think were your fault  a lot of things you used to think about yourself  really had nothing to do with you. It wasn't your fault  you're just fine. And you're able to go back and forgive them and forgive yourself. You're able to free yourself from your past. You can work to change your relationship to your past. Now while I was writing about this  I came upon a book called  Man's Search for Meaning  by Viktor Frankl. Viktor Frankl was a German psychiatrist who'd spent five years in a Nazi concentration camp. And he wrote that  while he was in the camp  he could tell  should they ever be released  which of the people would be okay and which would not. And he wrote this   Everything you have in life can be taken from you except one thing  your freedom to choose how you will respond to the situation. This is what determines the quality of the life we've lived    not whether we've been rich or poor  famous or unknown  healthy or suffering. What determines our quality of life is how we relate to these realities  what kind of meaning we assign them  what kind of attitude we cling to about them  what state of mind we allow them to trigger.  Perhaps the central purpose of the third act is to go back and to try  if appropriate  to change our relationship to the past. It turns out that cognitive research shows when we are able to do this  it manifests neurologically    neural pathways are created in the brain. You see  if you have  over time  reacted negatively to past events and people  neural pathways are laid down by chemical and electrical signals that are sent through the brain. And over time  these neural pathways become hardwired  they become the norm    even if it's bad for us because it causes us stress and anxiety. If however  we can go back and alter our relationship  re vision our relationship to past people and events  neural pathways can change. And if we can maintain the more positive feelings about the past  that becomes the new norm. It's like resetting a thermostat. It's not having experiences that make us wise  it's reflecting on the experiences that we've had that makes us wise    and that helps us become whole  brings wisdom and authenticity. It helps us become what we might have been. Women start off whole  don't we  I mean  as girls  we start off feisty     Yeah  who says   We have agency. We are the subjects of our own lives. But very often  many  if not most of us  when we hit puberty  we start worrying about fitting in and being popular. And we become the subjects and objects of other people's lives. But now  in our third acts  it may be possible for us to circle back to where we started and know it for the first time. And if we can do that  it will not just be for ourselves. Older women are the largest demographic in the world. If we can go back and redefine ourselves and become whole  this will create a cultural shift in the world  and it will give an example to younger generations so that they can reconceive their own lifespan. Thank you very much. There's a poem written by a very famous English poet at the end of the   th century. It was said to echo in Churchill's brain in the     s. And the poem goes   On the idle hill of summer  lazy with the flow of streams  hark I hear a distant drummer  drumming like a sound in dreams  far and near and low and louder on the roads of earth go by  dear to friend and food to powder  soldiers marching  soon to die.  Those who are interested in poetry  the poem is  A Shropshire Lad  written by A.E. Housman. But what Housman understood  and you hear it in the symphonies of Nielsen too  was that the long  hot  silvan summers of stability of the   th century were coming to a close  and that we were about to move into one of those terrifying periods of history when power changes. And these are always periods  ladies and gentlemen  accompanied by turbulence  and all too often by blood. And my message for you is that I believe we are condemned  if you like  to live at just one of those moments in history when the gimbals upon which the established order of power is beginning to change and the new look of the world  the new powers that exist in the world  are beginning to take form. And these are    and we see it very clearly today    nearly always highly turbulent times  highly difficult times  and all too often very bloody times. By the way  it happens about once every century. You might argue that the last time it happened    and that's what Housman felt coming and what Churchill felt too    was that when power passed from the old nations  the old powers of Europe  across the Atlantic to the new emerging power of the United States of America    the beginning of the American century. And of course  into the vacuum where the too old European powers used to be were played the two bloody catastrophes of the last century    the one in the first part and the one in the second part  the two great World Wars. Mao Zedong used to refer to them as the European civil wars  and it's probably a more accurate way of describing them. Well  ladies and gentlemen  we live at one of those times. But for us  I want to talk about three factors today. And the first of these  the first two of these  is about a shift in power. And the second is about some new dimension which I want to refer to  which has never quite happened in the way it's happening now. But let's talk about the shifts of power that are occurring to the world. And what is happening today is  in one sense  frightening because it's never happened before. We have seen lateral shifts of power    the power of Greece passed to Rome and the power shifts that occurred during the European civilizations    but we are seeing something slightly different. For power is not just moving laterally from nation to nation. It's also moving vertically. What's happening today is that the power that was encased  held to accountability  held to the rule of law  within the institution of the nation state has now migrated in very large measure onto the global stage. The globalization of power    we talk about the globalization of markets  but actually it's the globalization of real power. And where  at the nation state level that power is held to accountability subject to the rule of law  on the international stage it is not. The international stage and the global stage where power now resides  the power of the Internet  the power of the satellite broadcasters  the power of the money changers    this vast money go round that circulates now    times the amount of money necessary for the trade it's supposed to be there to finance    the money changers  if you like  the financial speculators that have brought us all to our knees quite recently  the power of the multinational corporations now developing budgets often bigger than medium sized countries. These live in a global space which is largely unregulated  not subject to the rule of law  and in which people may act free of constraint. Now that suits the powerful up to a moment. It's always suitable for those who have the most power to operate in spaces without constraint  but the lesson of history is that  sooner or later  unregulated space    space not subject to the rule of law    becomes populated  not just by the things you wanted    international trade  the Internet  etc.    but also by the things you don't want    international criminality  international terrorism. The revelation of      is that even if you are the most powerful nation on earth  nevertheless  those who inhabit that space can attack you even in your most iconic of cities one bright September morning. It's said that something like    percent of the four million dollars that was taken to fund      actually passed through the institutions of the Twin Towers which      destroyed. You see  our enemies also use this space    the space of mass travel  the Internet  satellite broadcasters    to be able to get around their poison  which is about destroying our systems and our ways. Sooner or later  sooner or later  the rule of history is that where power goes governance must follow. And if it is therefore the case  as I believe it is  that one of the phenomenon of our time is the globalization of power  then it follows that one of the challenges of our time is to bring governance to the global space. And I believe that the decades ahead of us now will be to a greater or lesser extent turbulent the more or less we are able to achieve that aim  to bring governance to the global space. Now notice  I'm not talking about government. I'm not talking about setting up some global democratic institution. My own view  by the way  ladies and gentlemen  is that this is unlikely to be done by spawning more U.N. institutions. If we didn't have the U.N.  we'd have to invent it. The world needs an international forum. It needs a means by which you can legitimize international action. But when it comes to governance of the global space  my guess is this won't happen through the creation of more U.N. institutions. It will actually happen by the powerful coming together and making treaty based systems  treaty based agreements  to govern that global space. And if you look  you can see them happening  already beginning to emerge. The World Trade Organization  treaty based organization  entirely treaty based  and yet  powerful enough to hold even the most powerful  the United States  to account if necessary. Kyoto  the beginnings of struggling to create a treaty based organization. The G    we know now that we have to put together an institution which is capable of bringing governance to that financial space for financial speculation. And that's what the G   is  a treaty based institution. Now there's a problem there  and we'll come back to it in a minute  which is that if you bring the most powerful together to make the rules in treaty based institutions  to fill that governance space  then what happens to the weak who are left out  And that's a big problem  and we'll return to it in just a second. So there's my first message  that if you are to pass through these turbulent times more or less turbulently  then our success in doing that will in large measure depend on our capacity to bring sensible governance to the global space. And watch that beginning to happen. My second point is  and I know I don't have to talk to an audience like this about such a thing  but power is not just shifting vertically  it's also shifting horizontally. You might argue that the story  the history of civilizations  has been civilizations gathered around seas    with the first ones around the Mediterranean  the more recent ones in the ascendents of Western power around the Atlantic. Well it seems to me that we're now seeing a fundamental shift of power  broadly speaking  away from nations gathered around the Atlantic  seaboard  to the nations gathered around the Pacific rim. Now that begins with economic power  but that's the way it always begins. You already begin to see the development of foreign policies  the augmentation of military budgets occurring in the other growing powers in the world. I think actually this is not so much a shift from the West to the East  something different is happening. My guess is  for what it's worth  is that the United States will remain the most powerful nation on earth for the next    years      but the context in which she holds her power has now radically altered  it has radically changed. We are coming out of    years  most unusual years  of history in which we have had a totally mono polar world  in which every compass needle for or against has to be referenced by its position to Washington    a world bestrode by a single colossus. But that's not a usual case in history. In fact  what's now emerging is the much more normal case of history. You're beginning to see the emergence of a multi polar world. Up until now  the United States has been the dominant feature of our world. They will remain the most powerful nation  but they will be the most powerful nation in an increasingly multi polar world. And you begin to see the alternative centers of power building up    in China  of course  though my own guess is that China's ascent to greatness is not smooth. It's going to be quite grumpy as China begins to democratize her society after liberalizing her economy. But that's a subject of a different discussion. You see India  you see Brazil. You see increasingly that the world now looks actually  for us Europeans  much more like Europe in the   th century. Europe in the   th century  a great British foreign secretary  Lord Canning  used to describe it as the  European concert of powers.  There was a balance  a five sided balance. Britain always played to the balance. If Paris got together with Berlin  Britain got together with Vienna and Rome to provide a counterbalance. Now notice  in a period which is dominated by a mono polar world  you have fixed alliances    NATO  the Warsaw Pact. A fixed polarity of power means fixed alliances. But a multiple polarity of power means shifting and changing alliances. And that's the world we're coming into  in which we will increasingly see that our alliances are not fixed. Canning  the great British foreign secretary once said   Britain has a common interest  but no common allies.  And we will see increasingly that even we in the West will reach out  have to reach out  beyond the cozy circle of the Atlantic powers to make alliances with others if we want to get things done in the world. Note  that when we went into Libya  it was not good enough for the West to do it alone  we had to bring others in. We had to bring  in this case  the Arab League in. My guess is Iraq and Afghanistan are the last times when the West has tried to do it themselves  and we haven't succeeded. My guess is that we're reaching the beginning of the end of     years    I say     years because it's the end of the Ottoman Empire    of the hegemony of Western power  Western institutions and Western values. You know  up until now  if the West got its act together  it could propose and dispose in every corner of the world. But that's no longer true. Take the last financial crisis after the Second World War. The West got together    the Bretton Woods Institution  World Bank  International Monetary Fund    the problem solved. Now we have to call in others. Now we have to create the G  . Now we have to reach beyond the cozy circle of our Western friends. Let me make a prediction for you  which is probably even more startling. I suspect we are now reaching the end of     years when Western power was enough. People say to me   The Chinese  of course  they'll never get themselves involved in peace making  multilateral peace making around the world.  Oh yes  Why not  How many Chinese troops are serving under the blue beret  serving under the blue flag  serving under the U.N. command in the world today       . How many Americans    . What is the largest naval contingent tackling the issue of Somali pirates  The Chinese naval contingent. Of course they are  they are a mercantilist nation. They want to keep the sea lanes open. Increasingly  we are going to have to do business with people with whom we do not share values  but with whom  for the moment  we share common interests. It's a whole new different way of looking at the world that is now emerging. And here's the third factor  which is totally different. Today in our modern world  because of the Internet  because of the kinds of things people have been talking about here  everything is connected to everything. We are now interdependent. We are now interlocked  as nations  as individuals  in a way which has never been the case before  never been the case before. The interrelationship of nations  well it's always existed. Diplomacy is about managing the interrelationship of nations. But now we are intimately locked together. You get swine flu in Mexico  it's a problem for Charles de Gaulle Airport    hours later. Lehman Brothers goes down  the whole lot collapses. There are fires in the steppes of Russia  food riots in Africa. We are all now deeply  deeply  deeply interconnected. And what that means is the idea of a nation state acting alone  not connected with others  not working with others  is no longer a viable proposition. Because the actions of a nation state are neither confined to itself  nor is it sufficient for the nation state itself to control its own territory  because the effects outside the nation state are now beginning to affect what happens inside them. I was a young soldier in the last of the small empire wars of Britain. At that time  the defense of my country was about one thing and one thing only  how strong was our army  how strong was our air force  how strong was our navy and how strong were our allies. That was when the enemy was outside the walls. Now the enemy is inside the walls. Now if I want to talk about the defense of my country  I have to speak to the Minister of Health because pandemic disease is a threat to my security  I have to speak to the Minister of Agriculture because food security is a threat to my security  I have to speak to the Minister of Industry because the fragility of our hi tech infrastructure is now a point of attack for our enemies    as we see from cyber warfare    I have to speak to the Minister of Home Affairs because who has entered my country  who lives in that terraced house in that inner city has a direct effect on what happens in my country    as we in London saw in the     bombings. It's no longer the case that the security of a country is simply a matter for its soldiers and its ministry of defense. It's its capacity to lock together its institutions. And this tells you something very important. It tells you that  in fact  our governments  vertically constructed  constructed on the economic model of the Industrial Revolution    vertical hierarchy  specialization of tasks  command structures    have got the wrong structures completely. You in business know that the paradigm structure of our time  ladies and gentlemen  is the network. It's your capacity to network that matters  both within your governments and externally. So here is Ashdown's third law. By the way  don't ask me about Ashdown's first law and second law because I haven't invented those yet  it always sounds better if there's a third law  doesn't it  Ashdown's third law is that in the modern age  where everything is connected to everything  the most important thing about what you can do is what you can do with others. The most important bit about your structure    whether you're a government  whether you're an army regiment  whether you're a business    is your docking points  your interconnectors  your capacity to network with others. You understand that in industry  governments don't. But now one final thing. If it is the case  ladies and gentlemen    and it is    that we are now locked together in a way that has never been quite the same before  then it's also the case that we share a destiny with each other. Suddenly and for the very first time  collective defense  the thing that has dominated us as the concept of securing our nations  is no longer enough. It used to be the case that if my tribe was more powerful than their tribe  I was safe  if my country was more powerful than their country  I was safe  my alliance  like NATO  was more powerful than their alliance  I was safe. It is no longer the case. The advent of the interconnectedness and of the weapons of mass destruction means that  increasingly  I share a destiny with my enemy. When I was a diplomat negotiating the disarmament treaties with the Soviet Union in Geneva in the     s  we succeeded because we understood we shared a destiny with them. Collective security is not enough. Peace has come to Northern Ireland because both sides realized that the zero sum game couldn't work. They shared a destiny with their enemies. One of the great barriers to peace in the Middle East is that both sides  both Israel and  I think  the Palestinians  do not understand that they share a collective destiny. And so suddenly  ladies and gentlemen  what has been the proposition of visionaries and poets down the ages becomes something we have to take seriously as a matter of public policy. I started with a poem  I'll end with one. The great poem of John Donne's.  Send not for whom the bell tolls.  The poem is called  No Man is an Island.  And it goes   Every man's death affected me  for I am involved in mankind  send not to ask for whom the bell tolls  it tolls for thee.  For John Donne  a recommendation of morality. For us  I think  part of the equation for our survival. Thank you very much. There's currently over a thousand TEDTalks on the TED website. And I guess many of you here think that this is quite fantastic    except for me. I don't agree with this. I think we have a situation here. Because if you think about it        TEDTalks  that's over       ideas worth spreading. How on earth are you going to spread a thousand ideas  Even if you just try to get all of those ideas into your head by watching all those thousand TED videos  it would actually currently take you over     hours to do so. And I did a little calculation of this. The damage to the economy for each one who does this is around        . So having seen this danger to the economy  I thought  we need to find a solution to this problem. Here's my approach to it all. If you look at the current situation  you have a thousand TEDTalks. Each of those TEDTalks has an average length of about       words. Now take this together and you end up with  .  million words of TEDTalks  which is about three Bibles worth of content. The obvious question here is  does a TEDTalk really need       words  Isn't there something shorter  I mean  if you have an idea worth spreading  surely you can put it into something shorter than       words. The only question is  how short can you get  What's the minimum amount of words you would need to do a TEDTalk  While I was pondering this question  I came across this urban legend about Ernest Hemingway  who allegedly said that these six words here   For sale  baby shoes  never worn   were the best novel he had ever written. And I also encountered a project called Six Word Memoirs where people were asked  take your whole life and please sum this up into six words  such as these here   Found true love  married someone else.  Or  Living in existential vacuum  it sucks.  I actually like that one. So if a novel can be put into six words and a whole memoir can be put into six words  you don't need more than six words for a TEDTalk. We could have been done by lunch here. I mean ... And if you did this for all thousand TEDTalks  you would get from  .  million words down to      . So I thought this was quite worthwhile. So I started asking all my friends  please take your favorite TEDTalk and put that into six words. So here are some of the results that I received. I think they're quite nice. For example  Dan Pink's talk on motivation  which was pretty good if you haven't seen it   Drop carrot. Drop stick. Bring meaning.  It's what he's basically talking about in those    and a half minutes. Or some even included references to the speakers  such as Nathan Myhrvold's speaking style  or the one of Tim Ferriss  which might be considered a bit strenuous at times. The challenge here is  if I try to systematically do this  I would probably end up with a lot of summaries  but not with many friends in the end. So I had to find a different method  preferably involving total strangers. And luckily there's a website for that called Mechanical Turk  which is a website where you can post tasks that you don't want to do yourself  such as  Please summarize this text for me in six words.  And I didn't allow any low cost countries to work on this  but I found out I could get a six word summary for just    cents  which I think is a pretty good price. Even then  unfortunately  it's not possible to summarize each TEDTalk individually. Because if you do the math  you have a thousand TEDTalks  the pay    cents each  you have to do more than one summary for each of those talks  because some of them will probably be  or are  really bad. So I would end up paying hundreds of dollars. So I thought of a different way by thinking  well  the talks revolve around certain themes. So what if I don't let people summarize individual TEDTalks to six words  but give them    TEDTalks at the same time and say   Please do a six word summary for that one.  I would cut my costs by    percent. So for      I could summarize a thousand TEDTalks into just     summaries  which would actually be quite nice. Now some of you might actually right now be thinking  It's downright crazy to have    TEDTalks summarized into just six words. But it's actually not  because there's an example by statistics professor  Hans Rosling. I guess many of you have seen one or more of his talks. He's got eight talks online  and those talks can basically be summed up into just four words  because that's all he's basically showing us  our intuition is really bad. He always proves us wrong. So people on the Internet  some didn't do so well. I mean  when I asked them to summarize the    TEDTalks at the same time  some took the easy route out. They just had some general comment. There were others  and I found this quite cheeky. They used their six words to talk back to me and ask me if I'd been too much on Google lately. And finally also  I never understood this  some people really came up with their own version of the truth. I don't know any TEDTalk that contains this. But  oh well. In the end  however  and this is really amazing  for each of those    TEDTalk clusters that I submitted  I actually received meaningful summaries. Here are some of my favorites. For example  for all the TEDTalks around food  someone summed this up into   Food shaping body  brains and environment   which I think is pretty good. Or happiness   Striving toward happiness   moving toward unhappiness.  So here I was. I had started out with a thousand TEDTalks and I had     six word summaries for those. Actually it sounded nice in the beginning  but when you look at     summaries  it's quite a lot. It's a huge list. So I thought  I probably have to take this one step further here and create summaries of the summaries    and this is exactly what I did. So I took the     summaries that I had  put them into nine groups according to the ratings that the talks had originally received on TED.com and asked people to do summaries of those. Again  there were some misunderstandings. For example  when I had a cluster of all the beautiful talks  someone thought I was just trying to find the ultimate pick up line. But in the end  amazingly  again  people were able to do it. For example  all the courageous TEDTalks   People dying   or  People suffering   was also one   with easy solutions around.  Or the recipe for the ultimate jaw dropping TEDTalk   Flickr photos of intergalactic classical composer.  I mean that's the essence of it all. Now I had my nine groups  but  I mean  it's already quite a reduction. But of course  once you are that far  you're not really satisfied. I wanted to go all the way  all the way down the distillery  starting out with a thousand TEDTalks. I wanted to have a thousand TEDTalks summarized into just six words    which would be a   .     percent reduction in content. And I would only pay    .      so stay even below a hundred dollars for it. So I had    overall summaries done. This time I paid    cents because I thought the task was a bit harder. And unfortunately when I first received the answers    and here you'll see six of the answers    I was a bit disappointed. Because I think you'll agree  they all summarize some aspect of TED  but to me they felt a bit bland  or they just had a certain aspect of TED in them. So I was almost ready to give up when one night I played around with these sentences and found out that there's actually a beautiful solution in here. So here it is  a crowd sourced  six word summary of a thousand TEDTalks at the value of    .     Why the worry  I'd rather wonder.  Thank you very much. Lauren Hodge  If you were going to a restaurant and wanted a healthier option  which would you choose  grilled or fried chicken  Now most people would answer grilled  and it's true that grilled chicken does contain less fat and fewer calories. However  grilled chicken poses a hidden danger. The hidden danger is heterocyclic amines    specifically phenomethylimidazopyridine  or PhIP    which is the immunogenic or carcinogenic compound. A carcinogen is any substance or agent that causes abnormal growth of cells  which can also cause them to metastasize or spread. They are also organic compounds in which one or more of the hydrogens in ammonia is replaced with a more complex group. Studies show that antioxidants are known to decrease these heterocyclic amines. However  no studies exist yet that show how or why. These here are five different organizations that classify carcinogens. And as you can see  none of the organizations consider the compounds to be safe  which justifies the need to decrease them in our diet. Now you might wonder how a    year old girl could come up with this idea. And I was led to it through a series of events. I first learned about it through a lawsuit I read about in my doctor's office    which was between the Physician's Committee for Responsible Medicine and seven different fast food restaurants. They weren't sued because there was carcinogens in the chicken  but they were sued because of California's Proposition     which stated that if there's anything dangerous in the products then the companies had to give a clear warning. So I was very surprised about this. And I was wondering why nobody knew more about this dangerous grilled chicken  which doesn't seem very harmful. But then one night  my mom was cooking grilled chicken for dinner  and I noticed that the edges of the chicken  which had been marinated in lemon juice  turned white. And later in biology class  I learned that it's due to a process called denaturing  which is where the proteins will change shape and lose their ability to chemically function. So I combined these two ideas and I formulated a hypothesis  saying that  could possibly the carcinogens be decreased due to a marinade and could it be due to the differences in PH  So my idea was born  and I had the project set up and a hypothesis  so what was my next step  Well obviously I had to find a lab to work at because I didn't have the equipment in my school. I thought this would be easy  but I emailed about     different people within a five hour radius of where I lived  and I got one positive response that said that they could work with me. Most of the others either never responded back  said they didn't have the time or didn't have the equipment and couldn't help me. So it was a big commitment to drive to the lab to work multiple times. However  it was a great opportunity to work in a real lab    so I could finally start my project. The first stage was completed at home  which consisted of marinating the chicken  grilling the chicken  amassing it and preparing it to be transported to the lab. The second stage was completed at the Penn State University main campus lab  which is where I extracted the chemicals  changed the PH so I could run it through the equipment and separated the compounds I needed from the rest of the chicken. The final stages  when I ran the samples through a high pressure liquid chromatography mass spectrometer  which separated the compounds and analyzed the chemicals and told me exactly how much carcinogens I had in my chicken. So when I went through the data  I had very surprising results  because I found that four out of the five marinating ingredients actually inhibited the carcinogen formation. When compared with the unmarinated chicken  which is what I used as my control  I found that lemon juice worked by far the best  which decreased the carcinogens by about    percent. The saltwater marinade and the brown sugar marinade also worked very well  decreasing the carcinogens by about    percent. Olive oil slightly decreased the PhIP formation  but it was nearly negligible. And the soy sauce results were inconclusive because of the large data range  but it seems like soy sauce actually increased the potential carcinogens. Another important factor that I didn't take into account initially was the time cooked. And I found that if you increase the time cooked  the amount of carcinogens rapidly increases. So the best way to marinate chicken  based on this  is to  not under cook  but definitely don't over cook and char the chicken  and marinate in either lemon juice  brown sugar or saltwater. Based on these findings  I have a question for you. Would you be willing to make a simple change in your diet that could potentially save your life  Now I'm not saying that if you eat grilled chicken that's not marinated  you're definitely going to catch cancer and die. However  anything you can do to decrease the risk of potential carcinogens can definitely increase the quality of lifestyle. Is it worth it to you  How will you cook your chicken now  Shree Bose  Hi everyone. I'm Shree Bose. I was the       year old age category winner and then the grand prize winner. And I want all of you to imagine a little girl holding a dead blue spinach plant. And she's standing in front of you and she's explaining to you that little kids will eat their vegetables if they're different colors. Sounds ridiculous  right. But that was me years ago. And that was my first science fair project. It got a bit more complicated from there. My older brother Panaki Bose spent hours of his time explaining atoms to me when I barely understood basic algebra. My parents suffered through many more of my science fair projects  including a remote controlled garbage can. And then came the summer after my freshman year  when my grandfather passed away due to cancer. And I remember watching my family go through that and thinking that I never wanted another family to feel that kind of loss. So  armed with all the wisdom of freshman year biology  I decided I wanted to do cancer research at   . Good plan. So I started emailing all of these professors in my area asking to work under their supervision in a lab. Got rejected by all except one. And then went on  my next summer  to work under Dr. Basu at the UNT Health Center at Fort Worth  Texas. And that is where the research began. So ovarian cancer is one of those cancers that most people don't know about  or at least don't pay that much attention to. But yet  it's the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths among women in the United States. In fact  one in    women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer. One in     will die from it. Chemotherapy  one of the most effective ways used to treat cancer today  involves giving patients really high doses of chemicals to try and kill off cancer cells. Cisplatin is a relatively common ovarian cancer chemotherapy drug    a relatively simple molecule made in the lab that messes with the DNA of cancer cells and causes them to kill themselves. Sounds great  right  But here's the problem  sometimes patients become resistant to the drug  and then years after they've been declared to be cancer free  they come back. And this time  they no longer respond to the drug. It's a huge problem. In fact  it's one of the biggest problems with chemotherapy today. So we wanted to figure out how these ovarian cancer cells are becoming resistant to this drug called Cisplatin. And we wanted to figure this out  because if we could figure that out  then we might be able to prevent that resistance from ever happening. So that's what we set out to do. And we thought it had something to do with this protein called AMP kinase  an energy protein. So we ran all of these tests blocking the protein  and we saw this huge shift. I mean  on the slide  you can see that on our sensitive side  these cells that are responding to the drug  when we start blocking the protein  the number of dying cells    those colored dots    they're going down. But then on this side  with the same treatment  they're going up    interesting. But those are dots on a screen for you  what exactly does that mean  Well basically that means that this protein is changing from the sensitive cell to the resistant cell. And in fact  it might be changing the cells themselves to make the cells resistant. And that's huge. In fact  it means that if a patient comes in and they're resistant to this drug  then if we give them a chemical to block this protein  then we can treat them again with the same drug. And that's huge for chemotherapy effectiveness    possibly for many different types of cancer. So that was my work  and it was my way of reimagining the future for future research  with figuring out exactly what this protein does  but also for the future of chemotherapy effectiveness    so maybe all grandfathers with cancer have a little bit more time to spend with their grandchildren. But my work wasn't just about the research. It was about finding my passion. That's why being the grand prize winner of the Google Global Science Fair    cute picture  right    it was so exciting to me and it was such an amazing honor. And ever since then  I've gotten to do some pretty cool stuff    from getting to meet the president to getting to be on this stage to talk to all of you guys. But like I said  my journey wasn't just about the research  it was about finding my passion  and it was about making my own opportunities when I didn't even know what I was doing. It was about inspiration and determination and never giving up on my interest for science and learning and growing. After all  my story begins with a dried  withered spinach plant and it's only getting better from there. Thank you. Naomi Shah  Hi everyone. I'm Naomi Shah  and today I'll be talking to you about my research involving indoor air quality and asthmatic patients.  .  million deaths worldwide. One death every    seconds. People spend over    percent of their lives indoors. And the economic burden of asthma exceeds that of HIV and tuberculosis combined. Now these statistics had a huge impact on me  but what really sparked my interest in my research was watching both my dad and my brother suffer from chronic allergies year round. It confused me  why did these allergy symptoms persist well past the pollen season  With this question in mind  I started researching  and I soon found that indoor air pollutants were the culprit. As soon as I realized this  I investigated the underlying relationship between four prevalent air pollutants and their affect on the lung health of asthmatic patients. At first  I just wanted to figure out which of these four pollutants have the largest negative health impact on the lung health of asthmatic patients. But soon after  I developed a novel mathematical model that essentially quantifies the effect of these environmental pollutants on the lung health of asthmatic patients. And it surprises me that no model currently exists that quantifies the effect of environmental factors on human lung health  because that relationship seems so important. So with that in mind  I started researching more  I started investigating more  and I became very passionate. Because I realized that if we could find a way to target remediation  we could also find a way to treat asthmatic patients more effectively. For example  volatile organic compounds are chemical pollutants that are found in our schools  homes and workplaces. They're everywhere. These chemical pollutants are currently not a criteria air pollutant  as defined by the U.S. Clean Air Act. Which is surprising to me  because these chemical pollutants  through my research  I show that they had a very large negative impact on the lung health of asthmatic patients and thus should be regulated. So today I want to show you my interactive software model that I created. I'm going to show it to you on my laptop. And I have a volunteer subject in the audience today  Julie. And all of Julie's data has been pre entered into my interactive software model. And this can be used by anyone. So I want you to imagine that you're in Julie's shoes  or someone who's really close to you who suffers from asthma or another lung disorder. So Julie's going to her doctor's office to get treated for her asthma. And the doctor has her sit down  and he takes her peak expiratory flow rate    which is essentially her exhalation rate  or the amount of air that she can breathe out in one breath. So that peak expiratory flow rate  I've entered it up into the interactive software model. I've also entered in her age  her gender and her height. I've assumed that she lives in an average household with average air pollutant levels. So any user can come in here and click on  lung function report  and it'll take them to this report that I created. And this report really drives home the crux of my research. So what it shows    if you want to focus on that top graph in the right hand corner    it shows Julie's actual peak expiratory flow rate in the yellow bar. This is the measurement that she took in her doctor's office. In the blue bar at the bottom of the graph  it shows what her peak expiratory flow rate  what her exhalation rate or lung health  should be based on her age  gender and height. So the doctor sees this difference between the yellow bar and the blue bar  and he says   Wow  we need to give her steroids  medication and inhalers.  But I want everyone here to reimagine a world where instead of prescribing steroids  inhalers and medication  the doctor turns to Julie and says   Why don't you go home and clean out your air filters. Clean out the air ducts in your home  in your workplace  in your school. Stop the use of incense and candles. And if you're remodeling your house  take out all the carpeting and put in hardwood flooring.  Because these solutions are natural  these solutions are sustainable  and these solutions are long term investments    long term investments that we're making for our generation and for future generations. Because these environmental solutions that Julie can make in her home  her workplace and her school are impacting everyone that lives around her. So I'm very passionate about this research and I really want to continue it and expand it to more disorders besides asthma  more respiratory disorders  as well as more pollutants. But before I end my talk today  I want to leave you with one saying. And that saying is that genetics loads the gun  but the environment pulls the trigger. And that made a huge impact on me when I was doing this research. Because what I feel  is a lot of us think that the environment is at a macro level  that we can't do anything to change our air quality or to change the climate or anything. But if each one of us takes initiative in our own home  in our own school and in our own workplace  we can make a huge difference in air quality. Because remember  we spend    percent of our lives indoors. And air quality and air pollutants have a huge impact on the lung health of asthmatic patients  anyone with a respiratory disorder and really all of us in general. So I want you to reimagine a world with better air quality  better quality of life and better quality of living for everyone including our future generations. Thank you. Lisa Ling  Right. Can I have Shree and Lauren come up really quickly  Your Google Science Fair champions. Your winners. Amongst all the troubling deficits we struggle with today    we think of financial and economic primarily    the ones that concern me most is the deficit of political dialogue    our ability to address modern conflicts as they are  to go to the source of what they're all about and to understand the key players and to deal with them. We who are diplomats  we are trained to deal with conflicts between states and issues between states. And I can tell you  our agenda is full. There is trade  there is disarmament  there is cross border relations. But the picture is changing  and we are seeing that there are new key players coming onto the scene. We loosely call them  groups.  They may represent social  religious  political  economic  military realities. And we struggle with how to deal with them. The rules of engagement  how to talk  when to talk  and how to deal with them. Let me show you a slide here which illustrates the character of conflicts since      until today. You see the green is a traditional interstate conflict  the ones we used to read about. The red is modern conflict  conflicts within states. These are quite different  and they are outside the grasp of modern diplomacy. And the core of these key actors are groups who represent different interests inside countries. And the way they deal with their conflicts rapidly spreads to other countries. So in a way  it is everybody's business. Another acknowledgment we've seen during these years  recent years  is that very few of these domestic interstate  intrastate conflicts can be solved militarily. They may have to be dealt with with military means  but they cannot be solved by military means. They need political solutions. And we  therefore  have a problem  because they escape traditional diplomacy. And we have among states a reluctance in dealing with them. Plus  during the last decade  we've been in the mode where dealing with groups was conceptually and politically dangerous. After       either you were with us or against us. It was black or white. And groups are very often immediately label terrorists. And who would talk to terrorists  The West  as I would see it  comes out of that decade weakened  because we didn't understand the group. So we've spent more time on focusing on why we should not talk to others than finding out how we talk to others. Now I'm not naive. You cannot talk to everybody all the time. And there are times you should walk. And sometimes military intervention is necessary. I happen to believe that Libya was necessary and that military intervention in Afghanistan was also necessary. And my country relies on its security through military alliance  that's clear. But still we have a large deficit in dealing with and understanding modern conflict. Let us turn to Afghanistan.    years after that military intervention  that country is far from secure. The situation  to be honest  is very serious. Now again  the military is necessary  but the military is no problem solver. When I first came to Afghanistan in      as a foreign minister  I met the commander of ISAF  the international troops. And he told me that   This can be won militarily  minister. We just have to persevere.  Now four COM ISAF's later  we hear a different message   This cannot be won militarily. We need military presence  but we need to move to politics. We can only solve this through a political solution. And it is not us who will solve it  Afghans have to solve it.  But then they need a different political process than the one they were given in           . They need an inclusive process where the real fabric of this very complicated society can deal with their issues. Everybody seems to agree with that. It was very controversial to say three  four  five years ago. Now everybody agrees. But now  as we prepare to talk  we understand how little we know. Because we didn't talk. We didn't grasp what was going on. The International Committee of the Red Cross  the ICRC  is talking to everyone  and it is doing so because it is neutral. And that's one reason why that organization probably is the best informed key player to understand modern conflict    because they talk. My point is that you don't have to be neutral to talk. And you don't have to agree when you sit down with the other side. And you can always walk. But if you don't talk  you can't engage the other side. And the other side which you're going to engage is the one with whom you profoundly disagree. Prime Minister Rabin said when he engaged the Oslo process   You don't make peace with your friends  you make peace with your enemies.  It's hard  but it is necessary. Let me go one step further. This is Tahrir Square. There's a revolution going on. The Arab Spring is heading into fall and is moving into winter. It will last for a long  long time. And who knows what it will be called in the end. That's not the point. The point is that we are probably seeing  for the first time in the history of the Arab world  a revolution bottom up    people's revolution. Social groups are taking to the streets. And we find out in the West that we know very little about what's happening. Because we never talk to the people in these countries. Most governments followed the dictate of the authoritarian leaders to stay away from these different groups  because they were terrorists. So now that they are emerging in the street and we salute the democratic revolution  we find out how little we know. Right now  the discussion goes   Should we talk to the Muslim Brotherhood  Should we talk to Hamas  If we talk to them  we may legitimize them.  I think that is wrong. If you talk in the right way  you make it very clear that talking is not agreeing. And how can we tell the Muslim Brotherhood  as we should  that they must respect minority rights  if we don't accept majority rights  Because they may turn out to be a majority. How can we escape  having  a double standard  if we at the same time preach democracy and at the same time don't want to deal with the groups that are representative  How will we ever be interlocutors  Now my diplomats are instructed to talk to all these groups. But talking can be done in different ways. We make a distinction between talking from a diplomatic level and talking at the political level. Now talking can be accompanied with aid or not with aid. Talking can be accompanied with inclusion or not inclusion. There's a big array of the ways of dealing with this. So if we refuse to talk to these new groups that are going to be dominating the news in years to come  we will further radicalization  I believe. We will make the road from violent activities into politics harder to travel. And if we cannot demonstrate to these groups that if you move towards democracy  if you move towards taking part in civilized and normal standards among states  there are some rewards on the other side. The paradox here is that the last decade probably was a lost decade for making progress on this. And the paradox is that the decade before the last decade was so promising    and for one reason primarily. And the reason is what happened in South Africa  Nelson Mandela. When Mandela came out of prison after    years of captivity  if he had told his people   It's time to take up the arms  it's time to fight   he would have been followed. And I think the international community would have said   Fair enough. It's their right to fight.  Now as you know  Mandela didn't do that. In his memoirs   Long Road to Freedom   he wrote that he survived during those years of captivity because he always decided to look upon his oppressor as also being a human being  also being a human being. So he engaged a political process of dialogue  not as a strategy of the weak  but as a strategy of the strong. And he engaged talking profoundly by settling some of the most tricky issues through a truth and reconciliation process where people came and talked. Now South African friends will know that was very painful. So what can we learn from all of this  Dialogue is not easy    not between individuals  not between groups  not between governments    but it is very necessary. If we're going to deal with political conflict solving of conflicts  if we're going to understand these new groups which are coming from bottom up  supported by technology  which is available to all  we diplomats cannot be sitting back in the banquets believing that we are doing interstate relations. We have to connect with these profound changes. And what is dialogue really about  When I enter into dialogue  I really hope that the other side would pick up my points of view  that I would impress upon them my opinions and my values. I cannot do that unless I send the signals that I will be open to listen to the other side's signals. We need a lot more training on how to do that and a lot more practice on how that can take problem solving forward. We know from our personal experiences that it's easy sometimes just to walk  and sometimes you may need to fight. And I wouldn't say that is the wrong thing in all circumstances. Sometimes you have to. But that strategy seldom takes you very far. The alternative is a strategy of engagement and principled dialogue. And I believe we need to strengthen this approach in modern diplomacy  not only between states  but also within states. We are seeing some new signs. We could never have done the convention against anti personnel landmines and the convention that is banning cluster munitions unless we had done diplomacy differently  by engaging with civil society. All of a sudden  NGOs were not only standing in the streets  crying their slogans  but they were taking  them  into the negotiations  partly because they represented the victims of these weapons. And they brought their knowledge. And there was an interaction between diplomacy and the power coming bottom up. This is perhaps a first element of a change. In the future  I believe  we should draw examples from these different illustrations  not to have diplomacy which is disconnected from people and civil society. And we have to go also beyond traditional diplomacy to the survival issue of our times  climate change. How are we going to solve climate change through negotiations  unless we are able to make civil society and people  not part of the problem  but part of the solution  It is going to demand an inclusive process of diplomacy very different from the one we are practicing today as we are heading to new rounds of difficult climate negotiations  but when we move toward something which has to be much more along a broad mobilization. It's crucial to understand  I believe  because of technology and because of globalization  societies from bottom up. We as diplomats need to know the social capital of communities. What is it that makes people trust each other  not only between states  but also within states  What is the legitimacy of diplomacy  of the the solution we devise as diplomats if they cannot be reflected and understood by also these broader forces of societies that we now very loosely call groups  The good thing is that we are not powerless. We have never had as many means of communication  means of being connected  means of reaching out  means of including. The diplomatic toolbox is actually full of different tools we can use to strengthen our communication. But the problem is that we are coming out of a decade where we had a fear of touching it. Now  I hope  in the coming years  that we are able to demonstrate through some concrete examples that fear is receding and that we can take courage from that alliance with civil society in different countries to support their problem solving  among the Afghans  inside the Palestinian population  between the peoples of Palestine and Israel. And as we try to understand this broad movement across the Arab world  we are not powerless. We need to improve the necessary skills  and we need the courage to use them. In my country  I have seen how the council of Islamist groups and Christian groups came together  not as a government initiative  but they came together on their own initiative to establish contact and dialogue in times where things were pretty low key tension. And when tension increased  they already had that dialogue  and that was a strength to deal with different issues. Our modern Western societies are more complex than before  in this time of migration. How are we going to settle and build a bigger  We  to deal with our issues if we don't improve our skills of communication  So there are many reasons  and for all of these reasons  this is time and this is why we must talk. Thank you for your attention. What I'm going to show you are the astonishing molecular machines that create the living fabric of your body. Now molecules are really  really tiny. And by tiny  I mean really. They're smaller than a wavelength of light  so we have no way to directly observe them. But through science  we do have a fairly good idea of what's going on down at the molecular scale. So what we can do is actually tell you about the molecules  but we don't really have a direct way of showing you the molecules. One way around this is to draw pictures. And this idea is actually nothing new. Scientists have always created pictures as part of their thinking and discovery process. They draw pictures of what they're observing with their eyes  through technology like telescopes and microscopes  and also what they're thinking about in their minds. I picked two well known examples  because they're very well known for expressing science through art. And I start with Galileo who used the world's first telescope to look at the Moon. And he transformed our understanding of the Moon. The perception in the   th century was the Moon was a perfect heavenly sphere. But what Galileo saw was a rocky  barren world  which he expressed through his watercolor painting. Another scientist with very big ideas  the superstar of biology  is Charles Darwin. And with this famous entry in his notebook  he begins in the top left hand corner with   I think   and then sketches out the first tree of life  which is his perception of how all the species  all living things on Earth  are connected through evolutionary history    the origin of species through natural selection and divergence from an ancestral population. Even as a scientist  I used to go to lectures by molecular biologists and find them completely incomprehensible  with all the fancy technical language and jargon that they would use in describing their work  until I encountered the artworks of David Goodsell  who is a molecular biologist at the Scripps Institute. And his pictures  everything's accurate and it's all to scale. And his work illuminated for me what the molecular world inside us is like. So this is a transection through blood. In the top left hand corner  you've got this yellow green area. The yellow green area is the fluids of blood  which is mostly water  but it's also antibodies  sugars  hormones  that kind of thing. And the red region is a slice into a red blood cell. And those red molecules are hemoglobin. They are actually red  that's what gives blood its color. And hemoglobin acts as a molecular sponge to soak up the oxygen in your lungs and then carry it to other parts of the body. I was very much inspired by this image many years ago  and I wondered whether we could use computer graphics to represent the molecular world. What would it look like  And that's how I really began. So let's begin. This is DNA in its classic double helix form. And it's from X ray crystallography  so it's an accurate model of DNA. If we unwind the double helix and unzip the two strands  you see these things that look like teeth. Those are the letters of genetic code  the        genes you've got written in your DNA. This is what they typically talk about    the genetic code    this is what they're talking about. But I want to talk about a different aspect of DNA science  and that is the physical nature of DNA. It's these two strands that run in opposite directions for reasons I can't go into right now. But they physically run in opposite directions  which creates a number of complications for your living cells  as you're about to see  most particularly when DNA is being copied. And so what I'm about to show you is an accurate representation of the actual DNA replication machine that's occurring right now inside your body  at least      biology. So DNA's entering the production line from the left hand side  and it hits this collection  these miniature biochemical machines  that are pulling apart the DNA strand and making an exact copy. So DNA comes in and hits this blue  doughnut shaped structure and it's ripped apart into its two strands. One strand can be copied directly  and you can see these things spooling off to the bottom there. But things aren't so simple for the other strand because it must be copied backwards. So it's thrown out repeatedly in these loops and copied one section at a time  creating two new DNA molecules. Now you have billions of this machine right now working away inside you  copying your DNA with exquisite fidelity. It's an accurate representation  and it's pretty much at the correct speed for what is occurring inside you. I've left out error correction and a bunch of other things. This was work from a number of years ago. Thank you. This is work from a number of years ago  but what I'll show you next is updated science  it's updated technology. So again  we begin with DNA. And it's jiggling and wiggling there because of the surrounding soup of molecules  which I've stripped away so you can see something. DNA is about two nanometers across  which is really quite tiny. But in each one of your cells  each strand of DNA is about    to    million nanometers long. So to keep the DNA organized and regulate access to the genetic code  it's wrapped around these purple proteins    or I've labeled them purple here. It's packaged up and bundled up. All this field of view is a single strand of DNA. This huge package of DNA is called a chromosome. And we'll come back to chromosomes in a minute. We're pulling out  we're zooming out  out through a nuclear pore  which is the gateway to this compartment that holds all the DNA called the nucleus. All of this field of view is about a semester's worth of biology  and I've got seven minutes. So we're not going to be able to do that today  No  I'm being told   No.  This is the way a living cell looks down a light microscope. And it's been filmed under time lapse  which is why you can see it moving. The nuclear envelope breaks down. These sausage shaped things are the chromosomes  and we'll focus on them. They go through this very striking motion that is focused on these little red spots. When the cell feels it's ready to go  it rips apart the chromosome. One set of DNA goes to one side  the other side gets the other set of DNA    identical copies of DNA. And then the cell splits down the middle. And again  you have billions of cells undergoing this process right now inside of you. Now we're going to rewind and just focus on the chromosomes and look at its structure and describe it. So again  here we are at that equator moment. The chromosomes line up. And if we isolate just one chromosome  we're going to pull it out and have a look at its structure. So this is one of the biggest molecular structures that you have  at least as far as we've discovered so far inside of us. So this is a single chromosome. And you have two strands of DNA in each chromosome. One is bundled up into one sausage. The other strand is bundled up into the other sausage. These things that look like whiskers that are sticking out from either side are the dynamic scaffolding of the cell. They're called mircrotubules. That name's not important. But what we're going to focus on is this red region    I've labeled it red here    and it's the interface between the dynamic scaffolding and the chromosomes. It is obviously central to the movement of the chromosomes. We have no idea really as to how it's achieving that movement. We've been studying this thing they call the kinetochore for over a hundred years with intense study  and we're still just beginning to discover what it's all about. It is made up of about     different types of proteins  thousands of proteins in total. It is a signal broadcasting system. It broadcasts through chemical signals telling the rest of the cell when it's ready  when it feels that everything is aligned and ready to go for the separation of the chromosomes. It is able to couple onto the growing and shrinking microtubules. It's involved with the growing of the microtubules  and it's able to transiently couple onto them. It's also an attention sensing system. It's able to feel when the cell is ready  when the chromosome is correctly positioned. It's turning green here because it feels that everything is just right. And you'll see  there's this one little last bit that's still remaining red. And it's walked away down the microtubules. That is the signal broadcasting system sending out the stop signal. And it's walked away. I mean  it's that mechanical. It's molecular clockwork. This is how you work at the molecular scale. So with a little bit of molecular eye candy  we've got kinesins  which are the orange ones. They're little molecular courier molecules walking one way. And here are the dynein. They're carrying that broadcasting system. And they've got their long legs so they can step around obstacles and so on. So again  this is all derived accurately from the science. The problem is we can't show it to you any other way. Exploring at the frontier of science  at the frontier of human understanding  is mind blowing. Discovering this stuff is certainly a pleasurable incentive to work in science. But most medical researchers    discovering the stuff is simply steps along the path to the big goals  which are to eradicate disease  to eliminate the suffering and the misery that disease causes and to lift people out of poverty. Thank you. Cholera was reported in Haiti for the first time in over    years last October. There was no way to predict how far it would spread through water supplies and how bad the situation would get. And not knowing where help was needed always ensured that help was in short supply in the areas that needed it most. We've gotten good at predicting and preparing for storms before they take innocent lives and cause irreversible damage  but we still can't do that with water  and here's why. Right now  if you want to test water in the field  you need a trained technician  expensive equipment like this  and you have to wait about a day for chemical reactions to take place and provide results. It's too slow to get a picture of conditions on the ground before they change  too expensive to implement in all the places that require testing. And it ignores the fact that  in the meanwhile  people still need to drink water. Most of the information that we collected on the cholera outbreak didn't come from testing water  it came from forms like this  which documented all the people we failed to help. Countless lives have been saved by canaries in coalmines    a simple and invaluable way for miners to know whether they're safe. I've been inspired by that simplicity as I've been working on this problem with some of the most hardworking and brilliant people I've ever known. We think there's a simpler solution to this problem    one that can be used by people who face conditions like this everyday. It's in its early stages  but this is what it looks like right now. We call it the Water Canary. It's a fast  cheap device that answers an important question  Is this water contaminated  It doesn't require any special training. And instead of waiting for chemical reactions to take place  it uses light. That means there's no waiting for chemical reactions to take place  no need to use reagents that can run out and no need to be an expert to get actionable information. To test water  you simply insert a sample and  within seconds  it either displays a red light  indicating contaminated water  or a green light  indicating the sample is safe. This will make it possible for anyone to collect life saving information and to monitor water quality conditions as they unfold. We're also  on top of that  integrating wireless networking into an affordable device with GPS and GSM. What that means is that each reading can be automatically transmitted to servers to be mapped in real time. With enough users  maps like this will make it possible to take preventive action  containing hazards before they turn into emergencies that take years to recover from. And then  instead of taking days to disseminate this information to the people who need it most  it can happen automatically. We've seen how distributed networks  big data and information can transform society. I think it's time for us to apply them to water. Our goal over the next year is to get Water Canary ready for the field and to open source the hardware so that anyone can contribute to the development and the evaluation  so we can tackle this problem together. Thank you. One of the most common ways of dividing the world is into those who believe and those who don't    into the religious and the atheists. And for the last decade or so  it's been quite clear what being an atheist means. There have been some very vocal atheists who've pointed out  not just that religion is wrong  but that it's ridiculous. These people  many of whom have lived in North Oxford  have argued    they've argued that believing in God is akin to believing in fairies and essentially that the whole thing is a childish game. Now I think it's too easy. I think it's too easy to dismiss the whole of religion that way. And it's as easy as shooting fish in a barrel. And what I'd like to inaugurate today is a new way of being an atheist    if you like  a new version of atheism we could call Atheism  . . Now what is Atheism  .   Well it starts from a very basic premise  of course  there's no God. Of course  there are no deities or supernatural spirits or angels  etc. Now let's move on  that's not the end of the story  that's the very  very beginning. I'm interested in the kind of constituency that thinks something along these lines  that thinks   I can't believe in any of this stuff. I can't believe in the doctrines. I don't think these doctrines are right. But   a very important but   I love Christmas carols. I really like the art of Mantegna. I really like looking at old churches. I really like turning the pages of the Old Testament.  Whatever it may be  you know the kind of thing I'm talking about    people who are attracted to the ritualistic side  the moralistic  communal side of religion  but can't bear the doctrine. Until now  these people have faced a rather unpleasant choice. It's almost as though either you accept the doctrine and then you can have all the nice stuff  or you reject the doctrine and you're living in some kind of spiritual wasteland under the guidance of CNN and Walmart. So that's a sort of tough choice. I don't think we have to make that choice. I think there is an alternative. I think there are ways    and I'm being both very respectful and completely impious    of stealing from religions. If you don't believe in a religion  there's nothing wrong with picking and mixing  with taking out the best sides of religion. And for me  atheism  .  is about both  as I say  a respectful and an impious way of going through religions and saying   What here could we use   The secular world is full of holes. We have secularized badly  I would argue. And a thorough study of religion could give us all sorts of insights into areas of life that are not going too well. And I'd like to run through a few of these today. I'd like to kick off by looking at education. Now education is a field the secular world really believes in. When we think about how we're going to make the world a better place  we think education  that's where we put a lot of money. Education is going to give us  not only commercial skills  industrial skills  it's also going to make us better people. You know the kind of thing a commencement address is  and graduation ceremonies  those lyrical claims that education  the process of education    particularly higher education    will make us into nobler and better human beings. That's a lovely idea. Interesting where it came from. In the early   th century  church attendance in Western Europe started sliding down very  very sharply  and people panicked. They asked themselves the following question. They said  where are people going to find the morality  where are they going to find guidance  and where are they going to find sources of consolation  And influential voices came up with one answer. They said culture. It's to culture that we should look for guidance  for consolation  for morality. Let's look to the plays of Shakespeare  the dialogues of Plato  the novels of Jane Austen. In there  we'll find a lot of the truths that we might previously have found in the Gospel of Saint John. Now I think that's a very beautiful idea and a very true idea. They wanted to replace scripture with culture. And that's a very plausible idea. It's also an idea that we have forgotten. If you went to a top university    let's say you went to Harvard or Oxford or Cambridge    and you said   I've come here because I'm in search of morality  guidance and consolation  I want to know how to live   they would show you the way to the insane asylum. This is simply not what our grandest and best institutes of higher learning are in the business of. Why  They don't think we need it. They don't think we are in an urgent need of assistance. They see us as adults  rational adults. What we need is information. We need data  we don't need help. Now religions start from a very different place indeed. All religions  all major religions  at various points call us children. And like children  they believe that we are in severe need of assistance. We're only just holding it together. Perhaps this is just me  maybe you. But anyway  we're only just holding it together. And we need help. Of course  we need help. And so we need guidance and we need didactic learning. You know  in the   th century in the U.K.  the greatest preacher  greatest religious preacher  was a man called John Wesley  who went up and down this country delivering sermons  advising people how they could live. He delivered sermons on the duties of parents to their children and children to their parents  the duties of the rich to the poor and the poor to the rich. He was trying to tell people how they should live through the medium of sermons  the classic medium of delivery of religions. Now we've given up with the idea of sermons. If you said to a modern liberal individualist   Hey  how about a sermon   they'd go   No  no. I don't need one of those. I'm an independent  individual person.  What's the difference between a sermon and our modern  secular mode of delivery  the lecture  Well a sermon wants to change your life and a lecture wants to give you a bit of information. And I think we need to get back to that sermon tradition. The tradition of sermonizing is hugely valuable  because we are in need of guidance  morality and consolation    and religions know that. Another point about education  we tend to believe in the modern secular world that if you tell someone something once  they'll remember it. Sit them in a classroom  tell them about Plato at the age of     send them out for a career in management consultancy for    years  and that lesson will stick with them. Religions go   Nonsense. You need to keep repeating the lesson    times a day. So get on your knees and repeat it.  That's what all religions tell us   Get on you knees and repeat it    or    or    times a day.  Otherwise our minds are like sieves. So religions are cultures of repetition. They circle the great truths again and again and again. We associate repetition with boredom.  Give us the new   we're always saying.  The new is better than the old.  If I said to you   Okay  we're not going to have new TED. We're just going to run through all the old ones and watch them five times because they're so true. We're going to watch Elizabeth Gilbert five times because what she says is so clever   you'd feel cheated. Not so if you're adopting a religious mindset. The other things that religions do is to arrange time. All the major religions give us calendars. What is a calendar  A calendar is a way of making sure that across the year you will bump into certain very important ideas. In the Catholic chronology  Catholic calendar  at the end of March you will think about St. Jerome and his qualities of humility and goodness and his generosity to the poor. You won't do that by accident  you will do that because you are guided to do that. Now we don't think that way. In the secular world we think   If an idea is important  I'll bump into it. I'll just come across it.  Nonsense  says the religious world view. Religious view says we need calendars  we need to structure time  we need to synchronize encounters. This comes across also in the way in which religions set up rituals around important feelings. Take the Moon. It's really important to look at the Moon. You know  when you look at the Moon  you think   I'm really small. What are my problems   It sets things into perspective  etc.  etc. We should all look at the Moon a bit more often. We don't. Why don't we  Well there's nothing to tell us   Look at the Moon.  But if you're a Zen Buddhist in the middle of September  you will be ordered out of your home  made to stand on a canonical platform and made to celebrate the festival of Tsukimi  where you will be given poems to read in honor of the Moon and the passage of time and the frailty of life that it should remind us of. You'll be handed rice cakes. And the Moon and the reflection on the Moon will have a secure place in your heart. That's very good. The other thing that religions are really aware of is  speak well    I'm not doing a very good job of this here    but oratory  oratory is absolutely key to religions. In the secular world  you can come through the university system and be a lousy speaker and still have a great career. But the religious world doesn't think that way. What you're saying needs to be backed up by a really convincing way of saying it. So if you go to an African American Pentecostalist church in the American South and you listen to how they talk  my goodness  they talk well. After every convincing point  people will go   Amen  amen  amen.  At the end of a really rousing paragraph  they'll all stand up  and they'll go   Thank you Jesus  thank you Christ  thank you Savior.  If we were doing it like they do it    let's not do it  but if we were to do it    I would tell you something like   Culture should replace scripture.  And you would go   Amen  amen  amen.  And at the end of my talk  you would all stand up and you would go   Thank you Plato  thank you Shakespeare  thank you Jane Austen.  And we'd know that we had a real rhythm going. All right  all right. We're getting there. We're getting there. The other thing that religions know is we're not just brains  we are also bodies. And when they teach us a lesson  they do it via the body. So for example  take the Jewish idea of forgiveness. Jews are very interested in forgiveness and how we should start anew and start afresh. They don't just deliver us sermons on this. They don't just give us books or words about this. They tell us to have a bath. So in Orthodox Jewish communities  every Friday you go to a Mikveh. You immerse yourself in the water  and a physical action backs up a philosophical idea. We don't tend to do that. Our ideas are in one area and our behavior with our bodies is in another. Religions are fascinating in the way they try and combine the two. Let's look at art now. Now art is something that in the secular world  we think very highly of. We think art is really  really important. A lot of our surplus wealth goes to museums  etc. We sometimes hear it said that museums are our new cathedrals  or our new churches. You've heard that saying. Now I think that the potential is there  but we've completely let ourselves down. And the reason we've let ourselves down is that we're not properly studying how religions handle art. The two really bad ideas that are hovering in the modern world that inhibit our capacity to draw strength from art  The first idea is that art should be for art's sake    a ridiculous idea    an idea that art should live in a hermetic bubble and should not try to do anything with this troubled world. I couldn't disagree more. The other thing that we believe is that art shouldn't explain itself  that artists shouldn't say what they're up to  because if they said it  it might destroy the spell and we might find it too easy. That's why a very common feeling when you're in a museum    let's admit it    is   I don't know what this is about.  But if we're serious people  we don't admit to that. But that feeling of puzzlement is structural to contemporary art. Now religions have a much saner attitude to art. They have no trouble telling us what art is about. Art is about two things in all the major faiths. Firstly  it's trying to remind you of what there is to love. And secondly  it's trying to remind you of what there is to fear and to hate. And that's what art is. Art is a visceral encounter with the most important ideas of your faith. So as you walk around a church  or a mosque or a cathedral  what you're trying to imbibe  what you're imbibing is  through your eyes  through your senses  truths that have otherwise come to you through your mind. Essentially it's propaganda. Rembrandt is a propagandist in the Christian view. Now the word  propaganda  sets off alarm bells. We think of Hitler  we think of Stalin. Don't  necessarily. Propaganda is a manner of being didactic in honor of something. And if that thing is good  there's no problem with it at all. My view is that museums should take a leaf out of the book of religions. And they should make sure that when you walk into a museum    if I was a museum curator  I would make a room for love  a room for generosity. All works of art are talking to us about things. And if we were able to arrange spaces where we could come across works where we would be told  use these works of art to cement these ideas in your mind  we would get a lot more out of art. Art would pick up the duty that it used to have and that we've neglected because of certain mis founded ideas. Art should be one of the tools by which we improve our society. Art should be didactic. Let's think of something else. The people in the modern world  in the secular world  who are interested in matters of the spirit  in matters of the mind  in higher soul like concerns  tend to be isolated individuals. They're poets  they're philosophers  they're photographers  they're filmmakers. And they tend to be on their own. They're our cottage industries. They are vulnerable  single people. And they get depressed and they get sad on their own. And they don't really change much. Now think about religions  think about organized religions. What do organized religions do  They group together  they form institutions. And that has all sorts of advantages. First of all  scale  might. The Catholic Church pulled in    billion dollars last year according to the Wall Street Journal. These are massive machines. They're collaborative  they're branded  they're multinational  and they're highly disciplined. These are all very good qualities. We recognize them in relation to corporations. And corporations are very like religions in many ways  except they're right down at the bottom of the pyramid of needs. They're selling us shoes and cars. Whereas the people who are selling us the higher stuff    the therapists  the poets    are on their own and they have no power  they have no might. So religions are the foremost example of an institution that is fighting for the things of the mind. Now we may not agree with what religions are trying to teach us  but we can admire the institutional way in which they're doing it. Books alone  books written by lone individuals  are not going to change anything. We need to group together. If you want to change the world  you have to group together  you have to be collaborative. And that's what religions do. They are multinational  as I say  they are branded  they have a clear identity  so they don't get lost in a busy world. That's something we can learn from. I want to conclude. Really what I want to say is for many of you who are operating in a range of different fields  there is something to learn from the example of religion    even if you don't believe any of it. If you're involved in anything that's communal  that involves lots of people getting together  there are things for you in religion. If you're involved  say  in a travel industry in any way  look at pilgrimage. Look very closely at pilgrimage. We haven't begun to scratch the surface of what travel could be because we haven't looked at what religions do with travel. If you're in the art world  look at the example of what religions are doing with art. And if you're an educator in any way  again  look at how religions are spreading ideas. You may not agree with the ideas  but my goodness  they're highly effective mechanisms for doing so. So really my concluding point is you may not agree with religion  but at the end of the day  religions are so subtle  so complicated  so intelligent in many ways that they're not fit to be abandoned to the religious alone  they're for all of us. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Now this is actually a courageous talk  because you're kind of setting up yourself in some ways to be ridiculed in some quarters. AB  You can get shot by both sides. You can get shot by the hard headed atheists  and you can get shot by those who fully believe. CA  Incoming missiles from North Oxford at any moment. AB  Indeed. CA  But you left out one aspect of religion that a lot of people might say your agenda could borrow from  which is this sense    that's actually probably the most important thing to anyone who's religious    of spiritual experience  of some kind of connection with something that's bigger than you are. Is there any room for that experience in Atheism  .   AB  Absolutely. I  like many of you  meet people who say things like   But isn't there something bigger than us  something else   And I say   Of course.  And they say   So aren't you sort of religious   And I go   No.  Why does that sense of mystery  that sense of the dizzying scale of the universe  need to be accompanied by a mystical feeling  Science and just observation gives us that feeling without it  so I don't feel the need. The universe is large and we are tiny  without the need for further religious superstructure. So one can have so called spiritual moments without belief in the spirit. CA  Actually  let me just ask a question. How many people here would say that religion is important to them  Is there an equivalent process by which there's a sort of bridge between what you're talking about and what you would say to them  AB  I would say that there are many  many gaps in secular life and these can be plugged. It's not as though  as I try to suggest  it's not as though either you have religion and then you have to accept all sorts of things  or you don't have religion and then you're cut off from all these very good things. It's so sad that we constantly say   I don't believe so I can't have community  so I'm cut off from morality  so I can't go on a pilgrimage.  One wants to say   Nonsense. Why not   And that's really the spirit of my talk. There's so much we can absorb. Atheism shouldn't cut itself off from the rich sources of religion. CA  It seems to me that there's plenty of people in the TED community who are atheists. But probably most people in the community certainly don't think that religion is going away any time soon and want to find the language to have a constructive dialogue and to feel like we can actually talk to each other and at least share some things in common. Are we foolish to be optimistic about the possibility of a world where  instead of religion being the great rallying cry of divide and war  that there could be bridging  AB  No  we need to be polite about differences. Politeness is a much overlooked virtue. It's seen as hypocrisy. But we need to get to a stage when you're an atheist and someone says   Well you know  I did pray the other day   you politely ignore it. You move on. Because you've agreed on    percent of things  because you have a shared view on so many things  and you politely differ. And I think that's what the religious wars of late have ignored. They've ignored the possibility of harmonious disagreement. CA  And finally  does this new thing that you're proposing that's not a religion but something else  does it need a leader  and are you volunteering to be the pope  AB  Well  one thing that we're all very suspicious of is individual leaders. It doesn't need it. What I've tried to lay out is a framework and I'm hoping that people can just fill it in. I've sketched a sort of broad framework. But wherever you are  as I say  if you're in the travel industry  do that travel bit. If you're in the communal industry  look at religion and do the communal bit. So it's a wiki project. CA  Alain  thank you for sparking many conversations later. In the     s in the communist Eastern Germany  if you owned a typewriter  you had to register it with the government. You had to register a sample sheet of text out of the typewriter. And this was done so the government could track where text was coming from. If they found a paper which had the wrong kind of thought  they could track down who created that thought. And we in the West couldn't understand how anybody could do this  how much this would restrict freedom of speech. We would never do that in our own countries. But today in       if you go and buy a color laser printer from any major laser printer manufacturer and print a page  that page will end up having slight yellow dots printed on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your printer. This is happening to us today. And nobody seems to be making a fuss about it. And this is an example of the ways that our own governments are using technology against us  the citizens. And this is one of the main three sources of online problems today. If we take a look at what's really happening in the online world  we can group the attacks based on the attackers. We have three main groups. We have online criminals. Like here  we have Mr. Dimitry Golubov from the city of Kiev in Ukraine. And the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand. These guys make money. They use online attacks to make lots of money  and lots and lots of it. We actually have several cases of millionaires online  multimillionaires  who made money with their attacks. Here's Vladimir Tsastsin form Tartu in Estonia. This is Alfred Gonzalez. This is Stephen Watt. This is Bjorn Sundin. This is Matthew Anderson  Tariq Al Daour and so on and so on. These guys make their fortunes online  but they make it through the illegal means of using things like banking trojans to steal money from our bank accounts while we do online banking  or with keyloggers to collect our credit card information while we are doing online shopping from an infected computer. The U.S. Secret Service  two months ago  froze the Swiss bank account of Mr. Sam Jain right here  and that bank account had   .  million U.S. dollars on it when it was frozen. Mr. Jain himself is on the loose  nobody knows where he is. And I claim it's already today that it's more likely for any of us to become the victim of a crime online than here in the real world. And it's very obvious that this is only going to get worse. In the future  the majority of crime will be happening online. The second major group of attackers that we are watching today are not motivated by money. They're motivated by something else    motivated by protests  motivated by an opinion  motivated by the laughs. Groups like Anonymous have risen up over the last    months and have become a major player in the field of online attacks. So those are the three main attackers  criminals who do it for the money  hacktivists like Anonymous doing it for the protest  but then the last group are nation states  governments doing the attacks. And then we look at cases like what happened in DigiNotar. This is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens. DigiNotar is a Certificate Authority from The Netherlands    or actually  it was. It was running into bankruptcy last fall because they were hacked into. Somebody broke in and they hacked it thoroughly. And I asked last week in a meeting with Dutch government representatives  I asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found plausible that people died because of the DigiNotar hack. And his answer was yes. So how do people die as the result of a hack like this  Well DigiNotar is a C.A. They sell certificates. What do you do with certificates  Well you need a certificate if you have a website that has https  SSL encrypted services  services like Gmail. Now we all  or a big part of us  use Gmail or one of their competitors  but these services are especially popular in totalitarian states like Iran  where dissidents use foreign services like Gmail because they know they are more trustworthy than the local services and they are encrypted over SSL connections  so the local government can't snoop on their discussions. Except they can if they hack into a foreign C.A. and issue rogue certificates. And this is exactly what happened with the case of DigiNotar. What about Arab Spring and things that have been happening  for example  in Egypt  Well in Egypt  the rioters looted the headquarters of the Egyptian secret police in April       and when they were looting the building they found lots of papers. Among those papers  was this binder entitled  FINFISHER.  And within that binder were notes from a company based in Germany which had sold the Egyptian government a set of tools for intercepting    and in very large scale    all the communication of the citizens of the country. They had sold this tool for         Euros to the Egyptian government. The company headquarters are right here. So Western governments are providing totalitarian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens. But Western governments are doing it to themselves as well. For example  in Germany  just a couple of weeks ago the so called State Trojan was found  which was a trojan used by German government officials to investigate their own citizens. If you are a suspect in a criminal case  well it's pretty obvious  your phone will be tapped. But today  it goes beyond that. They will tap your Internet connection. They will even use tools like State Trojan to infect your computer with a trojan  which enables them to watch all your communication  to listen to your online discussions  to collect your passwords. Now when we think deeper about things like these  the obvious response from people should be that   Okay  that sounds bad  but that doesn't really affect me because I'm a legal citizen. Why should I worry  Because I have nothing to hide.  And this is an argument  which doesn't make sense. Privacy is implied. Privacy is not up for discussion. This is not a question between privacy against security. It's a question of freedom against control. And while we might trust our governments right now  right here in       any right we give away will be given away for good. And do we trust  do we blindly trust  any future government  a government we might have    years from now  And these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next    years. I'm going to start here. This is a hand lettered sign that appeared in a mom and pop bakery in my old neighborhood in Brooklyn a few years ago. The store owned one of those machines that can print on plates of sugar. And kids could bring in drawings and have the store print a sugar plate for the top of their birthday cake. But unfortunately  one of the things kids liked to draw was cartoon characters. They liked to draw the Little Mermaid  they'd like to draw a smurf  they'd like to draw Micky Mouse. But it turns out to be illegal to print a child's drawing of Micky Mouse onto a plate of sugar. And it's a copyright violation. And policing copyright violations for children's birthday cakes was such a hassle that the College Bakery said   You know what  we're getting out of that business. If you're an amateur  you don't have access to our machine anymore. If you want a printed sugar birthday cake  you have to use one of our prefab images    only for professionals.  So there's two bills in Congress right now. One is called SOPA  the other is called PIPA. SOPA stands for the Stop Online Piracy Act. It's from the Senate. PIPA is short for PROTECTIP  which is itself short for Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property    because the congressional aides who name these things have a lot of time on their hands. And what SOPA and PIPA want to do is they want to do this. They want to raise the cost of copyright compliance to the point where people simply get out of the business of offering it as a capability to amateurs. Now the way they propose to do this is to identify sites that are substantially infringing on copyright    although how those sites are identified is never fully specified in the bills    and then they want to remove them from the domain name system. They want to take them out of the domain name system. Now the domain name system is the thing that turns human readable names  like Google.com  into the kinds of addresses machines expect      .   .   .   . Now the problem with this model of censorship  of identifying a site and then trying to remove it from the domain name system  is that it won't work. And you'd think that would be a pretty big problem for a law  but Congress seems not to have let that bother them too much. Now the reason it won't work is that you can still type   .   .   .    into the browser or you can make it a clickable link and you'll still go to Google. So the policing layer around the problem becomes the real threat of the act. Now to understand how Congress came to write a bill that won't accomplish its stated goals  but will produce a lot of pernicious side effects  you have to understand a little bit about the back story. And the back story is this  SOPA and PIPA  as legislation  were drafted largely by media companies that were founded in the   th century. The   th century was a great time to be a media company  because the thing you really had on your side was scarcity. If you were making a TV show  it didn't have to be better than all other TV shows ever made  it only had to be better than the two other shows that were on at the same time    which is a very low threshold of competitive difficulty. Which meant that if you fielded average content  you got a third of the U.S. public for free    tens of millions of users for simply doing something that wasn't too terrible. This is like having a license to print money and a barrel of free ink. But technology moved on  as technology is wont to do. And slowly  slowly  at the end of the   th century  that scarcity started to get eroded    and I don't mean by digital technology  I mean by analog technology. Cassette tapes  video cassette recorders  even the humble Xerox machine created new opportunities for us to behave in ways that astonished the media business. Because it turned out we're not really couch potatoes. We don't really like to only consume. We do like to consume  but every time one of these new tools came along  it turned out we also like to produce and we like to share. And this freaked the media businesses out    it freaked them out every time. Jack Valenti  who was the head lobbyist for the Motion Picture Association of America  once likened the ferocious video cassette recorder to Jack the Ripper and poor  helpless Hollywood to a woman at home alone. That was the level of rhetoric. And so the media industries begged  insisted  demanded that Congress do something. And Congress did something. By the early   s  Congress passed the law that changed everything. And that law was called the Audio Home Recording Act of     . What the Audio Home Recording Act of      said was  look  if people are taping stuff off the radio and then making mixtapes for their friends  that is not a crime. That's okay. Taping and remixing and sharing with your friends is okay. If you make lots and lots of high quality copies and you sell them  that's not okay. But this taping business  fine  let it go. And they thought that they clarified the issue  because they'd set out a clear distinction between legal and illegal copying. But that wasn't what the media businesses wanted. They had wanted Congress to outlaw copying full stop. So when the Audio Home Recording Act of      was passed  the media businesses gave up on the idea of legal versus illegal distinctions for copying because it was clear that if Congress was acting in their framework  they might actually increase the rights of citizens to participate in our own media environment. So they went for plan B. It took them a while to formulate plan B. Plan B appeared in its first full blown form in         something called the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. It was a complicated piece of legislation  a lot of moving parts. But the main thrust of the DMCA was that it was legal to sell you uncopyable digital material    except that there's no such things as uncopyable digital material. It would be  as Ed Felton once famously said   Like handing out water that wasn't wet.  Bits are copyable. That's what computers do. That is a side effect of their ordinary operation. So in order to fake the ability to sell uncopyable bits  the DMCA also made it legal to force you to use systems that broke the copying function of your devices. Every DVD player and game player and television and computer you brought home    no matter what you thought you were getting when you bought it    could be broken by the content industries  if they wanted to set that as a condition of selling you the content. And to make sure you didn't realize  or didn't enact their capabilities as general purpose computing devices  they also made it illegal for you to try to reset the copyability of that content. The DMCA marks the moment when the media industries gave up on the legal system of distinguishing between legal and illegal copying and simply tried to prevent copying through technical means. Now the DMCA had  and is continuing to have  a lot of complicated effects  but in this one domain  limiting sharing  it has mostly not worked. And the main reason it hasn't worked is the Internet has turned out to be far more popular and far more powerful than anyone imagined. The mixtape  the fanzine  that was nothing compared to what we're seeing now with the Internet. We are in a world where most American citizens over the age of    share things with each other online. We share written things  we share images  we share audio  we share video. Some of the stuff we share is stuff we've made. Some of the stuff we share is stuff we've found. Some of the stuff we share is stuff we've made out of what we've found  and all of it horrifies those industries. So PIPA and SOPA are round two. But where the DMCA was surgical    we want to go down into your computer  we want to go down into your television set  down into your game machine  and prevent it from doing what they said it would do at the store    PIPA and SOPA are nuclear and they're saying  we want to go anywhere in the world and censor content. Now the mechanism  as I said  for doing this  is you need to take out anybody pointing to those IP addresses. You need to take them out of search engines  you need to take them out of online directories  you need to take them out of user lists. And because the biggest producers of content on the Internet are not Google and Yahoo  they're us  we're the people getting policed. Because in the end  the real threat to the enactment of PIPA and SOPA is our ability to share things with one another. So what PIPA and SOPA risk doing is taking a centuries old legal concept  innocent until proven guilty  and reversing it    guilty until proven innocent. You can't share until you show us that you're not sharing something we don't like. Suddenly  the burden of proof for legal versus illegal falls affirmatively on us and on the services that might be offering us any new capabilities. And if it costs even a dime to police a user  that will crush a service with a hundred million users. So this is the Internet they have in mind. Imagine this sign everywhere    except imagine it doesn't say College Bakery  imagine it says YouTube and Facebook and Twitter. Imagine it says TED  because the comments can't be policed at any acceptable cost. The real effects of SOPA and PIPA are going to be different than the proposed effects. The threat  in fact  is this inversion of the burden of proof  where we suddenly are all treated like thieves at every moment we're given the freedom to create  to produce or to share. And the people who provide those capabilities to us    the YouTubes  the Facebooks  the Twitters and TEDs    are in the business of having to police us  or being on the hook for contributory infringement. There's two things you can do to help stop this    a simple thing and a complicated thing  an easy thing and a hard thing. The simple thing  the easy thing  is this  if you're an American citizen  call your representative  call your senator. When you look at the people who co signed on the SOPA bill  people who've co signed on PIPA  what you see is that they have cumulatively received millions and millions of dollars from the traditional media industries. You don't have millions and millions of dollars  but you can call your representatives  and you can remind them that you vote  and you can ask not to be treated like a thief  and you can suggest that you would prefer that the Internet not be broken. And if you're not an American citizen  you can contact American citizens that you know and encourage them to do the same. Because this seems like a national issue  but it is not. These industries will not be content with breaking our Internet. If they break it  they will break it for everybody. That's the easy thing. That's the simple thing. The hard thing is this  get ready  because more is coming. SOPA is simply a reversion of COICA  which was purposed last year  which did not pass. And all of this goes back to the failure of the DMCA to disallow sharing as a technical means. And the DMCA goes back to the Audio Home Recording Act  which horrified those industries. Because the whole business of actually suggesting that someone is breaking the law and then gathering evidence and proving that  that turns out to be really inconvenient.  We'd prefer not to do that   says the content industries. And what they want is not to have to do that. They don't want legal distinctions between legal and illegal sharing. They just want the sharing to go away. PIPA and SOPA are not oddities  they're not anomalies  they're not events. They're the next turn of this particular screw  which has been going on    years now. And if we defeat these  as I hope we do  more is coming. Because until we convince Congress that the way to deal with copyright violation is the way copyright violation was dealt with with Napster  with YouTube  which is to have a trial with all the presentation of evidence and the hashing out of facts and the assessment of remedies that goes on in democratic societies. That's the way to handle this. In the meantime  the hard thing to do is to be ready. Because that's the real message of PIPA and SOPA. Time Warner has called and they want us all back on the couch  just consuming    not producing  not sharing    and we should say   No.  Thank you. Do you know how many choices you make in a typical day  Do you know how many choices you make in typical week  I recently did a survey with over       Americans  and the average number of choices that the typical American reports making is about    in a typical day. There was also recently a study done with CEOs in which they followed CEOs around for a whole week. And these scientists simply documented all the various tasks that these CEOs engaged in and how much time they spent engaging in making decisions related to these tasks. And they found that the average CEO engaged in about     tasks in a week. Each task was made up of many  many  many sub choices of course.    percent of their decisions were made in nine minutes or less. Only about    percent of the decisions did they make an hour or more of their time. Think about your own choices. Do you know how many choices make it into your nine minute category versus your one hour category  How well do you think you're doing at managing those choices  Today I want to talk about one of the biggest modern day choosing problems that we have  which is the choice overload problem. I want to talk about the problem and some potential solutions. Now as I talk about this problem  I'm going to have some questions for you and I'm going to want to know your answers. So when I ask you a question  since I'm blind  only raise your hand if you want to burn off some calories. Otherwise  when I ask you a question  and if your answer is yes  I'd like you to clap your hands. So for my first question for you today  Are you guys ready to hear about the choice overload problem  Thank you. So when I was a graduate student at Stanford University  I used to go to this very  very upscale grocery store  at least at that time it was truly upscale. It was a store called Draeger's. Now this store  it was almost like going to an amusement park. They had     different kinds of mustards and vinegars and over     different kinds of fruits and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of bottled water    and this was during a time when we actually used to drink tap water. I used to love going to this store  but on one occasion I asked myself  well how come you never buy anything  Here's their olive oil aisle. They had over    different kinds of olive oil  including those that were in a locked case that came from thousand year old olive trees. So I one day decided to pay a visit to the manager  and I asked the manager   Is this model of offering people all this choice really working   And he pointed to the busloads of tourists that would show up everyday  with cameras ready usually. We decided to do a little experiment  and we picked jam for our experiment. Here's their jam aisle. They had     different kinds of jam. We set up a little tasting booth right near the entrance of the store. We there put out six different flavors of jam or    different flavors of jam  and we looked at two things  First  in which case were people more likely to stop  sample some jam  More people stopped when there were     about    percent  than when there were six  about    percent. The next thing we looked at is in which case were people more likely to buy a jar of jam. Now we see the opposite effect. Of the people who stopped when there were     only three percent of them actually bought a jar of jam. Of the people who stopped when there were six  well now we saw that    percent of them actually bought a jar of jam. Now if you do the math  people were at least six times more likely to buy a jar of jam if they encountered six than if they encountered   . Now choosing not to buy a jar of jam is probably good for us    at least it's good for our waistlines    but it turns out that this choice overload problem affects us even in very consequential decisions. We choose not to choose  even when it goes against our best self interests. So now for the topic of today  financial savings. Now I'm going to describe to you a study I did with Gur Huberman  Emir Kamenica  Wei Jang where we looked at the retirement savings decisions of nearly a million Americans from about     plans all in the U.S. And what we looked at was whether the number of fund offerings available in a retirement savings plan  the     k  plan  does that affect people's likelihood to save more for tomorrow. And what we found was that indeed there was a correlation. So in these plans  we had about     plans that ranged from offering people anywhere from two to    different fund offerings. And what we found was that  the more funds offered  indeed  there was less participation rate. So if you look at the extremes  those plans that offered you two funds  participation rates were around in the mid   s    still not as high as we want it to be. In those plans that offered nearly    funds  participation rates have now dropped to about the   th percentile. Now it turns out that even if you do choose to participate when there are more choices present  even then  it has negative consequences. So for those people who did choose to participate  the more choices available  the more likely people were to completely avoid stocks or equity funds. The more choices available  the more likely they were to put all their money in pure money market accounts. Now neither of these extreme decisions are the kinds of decisions that any of us would recommend for people when you're considering their future financial well being. Well  over the past decade  we have observed three main negative consequences to offering people more and more choices. They're more likely to delay choosing    procrastinate even when it goes against their best self interest. They're more likely to make worse choices    worse financial choices  medical choices. They're more likely to choose things that make them less satisfied  even when they do objectively better. The main reason for this is because  we might enjoy gazing at those giant walls of mayonnaises  mustards  vinegars  jams  but we can't actually do the math of comparing and contrasting and actually picking from that stunning display. So what I want to propose to you today are four simple techniques    techniques that we have tested in one way or another in different research venues    that you can easily apply in your businesses. The first  Cut. You've heard it said before  but it's never been more true than today  that less is more. People are always upset when I say   Cut.  They're always worried they're going to lose shelf space. But in fact  what we're seeing more and more is that if you are willing to cut  get rid of those extraneous redundant options  well there's an increase in sales  there's a lowering of costs  there is an improvement of the choosing experience. When Proctor   Gamble went from    different kinds of Head   Shoulders to     they saw an increase in sales by    percent. When the Golden Cat Corporation got rid of their    worst selling cat litter products  they saw an increase in profits by    percent    a function of both increase in sales and lowering of costs. You know  the average grocery store today offers you        products. The typical Walmart today offers you         products. But the ninth largest retailer  the ninth biggest retailer in the world today is Aldi  and it offers you only       products    one kind of canned tomato sauce. Now in the financial savings world  I think one of the best examples that has recently come out on how to best manage the choice offerings has actually been something that David Laibson was heavily involved in designing  which was the program that they have at Harvard. Every single Harvard employee is now automatically enrolled in a lifecycle fund. For those people who actually want to choose  they're given    funds  not     or more funds. You know  often  people say   I don't know how to cut. They're all important choices.  And the first thing I do is I ask the employees   Tell me how these choices are different from one another. And if your employees can't tell them apart  neither can your consumers.  Now before we started our session this afternoon  I had a chat with Gary. And Gary said that he would be willing to offer people in this audience an all expenses paid free vacation to the most beautiful road in the world. Here's a description of the road. And I'd like you to read it. And now I'll give you a few seconds to read it and then I want you to clap your hands if you're ready to take Gary up on his offer. Okay. Anybody who's ready to take him up on his offer. Is that all  All right  let me show you some more about this. You guys knew there was a trick  didn't you. Now who's ready to go on this trip. I think I might have actually heard more hands. All right. Now in fact  you had objectively more information the first time around than the second time around  but I would venture to guess that you felt that it was more real the second time around. Because the pictures made it feel more real to you. Which brings me to the second technique for handling the choice overload problem  which is concretization. That in order for people to understand the differences between the choices  they have to be able to understand the consequences associated with each choice  and that the consequences need to be felt in a vivid sort of way  in a very concrete way. Why do people spend an average of    to    percent more when they use an ATM card or a credit card as opposed to cash  Because it doesn't feel like real money. And it turns out that making it feel more concrete can actually be a very positive tool to use in getting people to save more. So a study that I did with Shlomo Benartzi and Alessandro Previtero  we did a study with people at ING    employees that are all working at ING    and now these people were all in a session where they're doing enrollment for their     k  plan. And during that session  we kept the session exactly the way it used to be  but we added one little thing. The one little thing we added was we asked people to just think about all the positive things that would happen in your life if you saved more. By doing that simple thing  there was an increase in enrollment by    percent and there was an increase in the amount of people willing to save or the amount that they were willing to put down into their savings account by four percent. The third technique  Categorization. We can handle more categories than we can handle choices. So for example  here's a study we did in a magazine aisle. It turns out that in Wegmans grocery stores up and down the northeast corridor  the magazine aisles range anywhere from     different kinds of magazines all the way up to    . But you know what  If I show you     magazines and I divide them up into    categories  versus I show you     magazines and divide them up into    categories  you believe that I have given you more choice and a better choosing experience if I gave you the     than if I gave you the    . Because the categories tell me how to tell them apart. Here are two different jewelry displays. One is called  Jazz  and the other one is called  Swing.  If you think the display on the left is Swing and the display on the right is Jazz  clap your hands. Okay  there's some. If you think the one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is Swing  clap your hands. Okay  a bit more. Now it turns out you're right. The one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is Swing  but you know what  This is a highly useless categorization scheme. The categories need to say something to the chooser  not the choice maker. And you often see that problem when it comes down to those long lists of all these funds. Who are they actually supposed to be informing  My fourth technique  Condition for complexity. It turns out we can actually handle a lot more information than we think we can  we've just got to take it a little easier. We have to gradually increase the complexity. I'm going to show you one example of what I'm talking about. Let's take a very  very complicated decision  buying a car. Here's a German car manufacturer that gives you the opportunity to completely custom make your car. You've got to make    different decisions  completely make up your car. Now these decisions vary in the number of choices that they offer per decision. Car colors  exterior car colors    I've got    choices. Engines  gearshift    four choices. So now what I'm going to do is I'm going to vary the order in which these decisions appear. So half of the customers are going to go from high choice     car colors  to low choice  four gearshifts. The other half of the customers are going to go from low choice  four gearshifts  to    car colors  high choice. What am I going to look at  How engaged you are. If you keep hitting the default button per decision  that means you're getting overwhelmed  that means I'm losing you. What you find is the people who go from high choice to low choice  they're hitting that default button over and over and over again. We're losing them. They go from low choice to high choice  they're hanging in there. It's the same information. It's the same number of choices. The only thing that I have done is I have varied the order in which that information is presented. If I start you off easy  I learn how to choose. Even though choosing gearshift doesn't tell me anything about my preferences for interior decor  it still prepares me for how to choose. It also gets me excited about this big product that I'm putting together  so I'm more willing to be motivated to be engaged. So let me recap. I have talked about four techniques for mitigating the problem of choice overload    cut    get rid of the extraneous alternatives  concretize    make it real  categorize    we can handle more categories  less choices  condition for complexity. All of these techniques that I'm describing to you today are designed to help you manage your choices    better for you  you can use them on yourself  better for the people that you are serving. Because I believe that the key to getting the most from choice is to be choosy about choosing. And the more we're able to be choosy about choosing the better we will be able to practice the art of choosing. Thank you very much. What I'm going to do is  I'm going to explain to you an extreme green concept that was developed at NASA's Glenn Research Center in Cleveland  Ohio. But before I do that  we have to go over the definition of what green is  'cause a lot of us have a different definition of it. Green. The product is created through environmentally and socially conscious means. There's plenty of things that are being called green now. What does it actually mean  We use three metrics to determine green. The first metric is  Is it sustainable  Which means  are you preserving what you are doing for future use or for future generations  Is it alternative  Is it different than what is being used today  or does it have a lower carbon footprint than what's used conventionally  And three  Is it renewable  Does it come from Earth's natural replenishing resources  such as sun  wind and water  Now  my task at NASA is to develop the next generation of aviation fuels. Extreme green. Why aviation  The field of aviation uses more fuel than just about every other combined. We need to find an alternative. Also it's a national aeronautics directive. One of the national aeronautics goals is to develop the next generation of fuels  biofuels  using domestic and safe  friendly resources. Now  combating that challenge we have to also meet the big three metric   Actually  extreme green for us is all three together  that's why you see the plus there. I was told to say that. So it has to be the big three at GRC. That's another metric. Ninety seven percent of the world's water is saltwater. How about we use that  Combine that with number three. Do not use arable land. Because crops are already growing on that land that's very scarce around the world. Number two  Don't compete with food crops. That's already a well established entity  they don't need another entry. And lastly the most precious resource we have on this Earth is fresh water. Don't use fresh water. If   .  percent of the world's water is saltwater   .  percent is fresh water. Less than a half percent of that is accessible for human use. But    percent of the population lives within that one percent. So  combating my problem was  now I have to be extreme green and meet the big three. Ladies and gentlemen  welcome to the GreenLab Research Facility. This is a facility dedicated to the next generation of aviation fuels using halophytes. A halophyte is a salt tolerating plant. Most plants don't like salt  but halophytes tolerate salt. We also are using weeds and we are also using algae. The good thing about our lab is  we've had       visitors in the last two years. Why do you think that's so  Because we are on to something special. So  in the lower you see the GreenLab obviously  and on the right hand side you'll see algae. If you are into the business of the next generation of aviation fuels  algae is a viable option  there's a lot of funding right now  and we have an algae to fuels program. There's two types of algae growing. One is a closed photobioreactor that you see here  and what you see on the other side is our species   we are currently using a species called Scenedesmus dimorphus. Our job at NASA is to take the experimental and computational and make a better mixing for the closed photobioreactors. Now the problems with closed photobioreactors are  They are quite expensive  they are automated  and it's very difficult to get them in large scale. So on large scale what do they use  We use open pond systems. Now  around the world they are growing algae  with this racetrack design that you see here. Looks like an oval with a paddle wheel and mixes really well  but when it gets around the last turn  which I call turn four   it's stagnant. We actually have a solution for that. In the GreenLab in our open pond system we use something that happens in nature  waves. We actually use wave technology on our open pond systems. We have    percent mixing and our lipid content is higher than a closed photobioreactor system  which we think is significant. There is a drawback to algae  however  It's very expensive. Is there a way to produce algae inexpensively  And the answer is  yes. We do the same thing we do with halophytes  and that is  climatic adaptation. In our GreenLab we have six primary ecosystems that range from freshwater all the way to saltwater. What we do  We take a potential species  we start at freshwater  we add a little bit more salt  when the second tank here will be the same ecosystem as Brazil   right next to the sugar cane fields you can have our plants   the next tank represents Africa  the next tank represents Arizona  the next tank represents Florida  and the next tank represents California or the open ocean. What we are trying to do is to come up with a single species that can survive anywhere in the world  where there's barren desert. We are being very successful so far. Now  here's one of the problems. If you are a farmer  you need five things to be successful  You need seeds  you need soil  you need water and you need sun  and the last thing that you need is fertilizer. Most people use chemical fertilizers. But guess what  We do not use chemical fertilizer. Wait a second  I just saw lots of greenery in your GreenLab. You have to use fertilizer. Believe it or not  in our analysis of our saltwater ecosystems    percent of what we need are in these tanks themselves. The    percent that's missing is nitrogen and phosphorous. We have a natural solution  fish. No we don't cut up the fish and put them in there. Fish waste is what we use. As a matter of fact we use freshwater mollies  that we've used our climatic adaptation technique from freshwater all the way to seawater. Freshwater mollies  cheap  they love to make babies  and they love to go to the bathroom. And the more they go to the bathroom  the more fertilizer we get  the better off we are  believe it or not. It should be noted that we use sand as our soil  regular beach sand. Fossilized coral. So a lot of people ask me   How did you get started   Well  we got started in what we call the indoor biofuels lab. It's a seedling lab. We have    different species of halophytes  and five are winners. What we do here is   actually it should be called a death lab  'cause we try to kill the seedlings  make them rough   and then we come to the GreenLab. What you see in the lower corner is a wastewater treatment plant experiment that we are growing  a macro algae that I'll talk about in a minute. And lastly  it's me actually working in the lab to prove to you I do work  I don't just talk about what I do. Here's the plant species. Salicornia virginica. It's a wonderful plant. I love that plant. Everywhere we go we see it. It's all over the place  from Maine all the way to California. We love that plant. Second is Salicornia bigelovii. Very difficult to get around the world. It is the highest lipid content that we have  but it has a shortcoming  It's short. Now you take europaea  which is the largest or the tallest plant that we have. And what we are trying to do with natural selection or adaptive biology   combine all three to make a high growth  high lipid plant. Next  when a hurricane decimated the Delaware Bay   soybean fields gone   we came up with an idea  Can you have a plant that has a land reclamation positive in Delaware  And the answer is yes. It's called seashore mallow. Kosteletzkya virginica   say that five times fast if you can. This is a     percent usable plant. The seeds  biofuels. The rest  cattle feed. It's there for    years  it's working very well. Now we get to Chaetomorpha. This is a macro algae that loves excess nutrients. If you are in the aquarium industry you know we use it to clean up dirty tanks. This species is so significant to us. The properties are very close to plastic. We are trying right now to convert this macro algae into a bioplastic. If we are successful  we will revolutionize the plastics industry. So  we have a seed to fuel program. We have to do something with this biomass that we have. And so we do G.C. extraction  lipid optimization  so on and so forth  because our goal really is to come up with the next generation of aviation fuels  aviation specifics  so on and so forth. So far we talked about water and fuel  but along the way we found out something interesting about Salicornia  It's a food product. So we talk about ideas worth spreading  right  How about this  In sub Saharan Africa  next to the sea  saltwater  barren desert  how about we take that plant  plant it  half use for food  half use for fuel. We can make that happen  inexpensively. You can see there's a greenhouse in Germany that sells it as a health food product. This is harvested  and in the middle here is a shrimp dish  and it's being pickled. So I have to tell you a joke. Salicornia is known as sea beans  saltwater asparagus and pickle weed. So we are pickling pickle weed in the middle. Oh  I thought it was funny.  Laughter  And at the bottom is seaman's mustard. It does make sense  this is a logical snack. You have mustard  you are a seaman  you see the halophyte  you mix it together  it's a great snack with some crackers. And last  garlic with Salicornia  which is what I like. So  water  fuel and food. None of this is possible without the GreenLab team. Just like the Miami Heat has the big three  we have the big three at NASA GRC. That's myself  professor Bob Hendricks  our fearless leader  and Dr. Arnon Chait. The backbone of the GreenLab is students. Over the last two years we've had    different students from around the world working at GreenLab. As a matter fact my division chief says a lot   You have a green university.  I say   I'm okay with that  'cause we are nurturing the next generation of extreme green thinkers  which is significant.  So  in first summary I presented to you what we think is a global solution for food  fuel and water. There's something missing to be complete. Clearly we use electricity. We have a solution for you   We're using clean energy sources here. So  we have two wind turbines connected to the GreenLab  we have four or five more hopefully coming soon. We are also using something that is quite interesting   there is a solar array field at NASA's Glenn Research Center  hasn't been used for    years. Along with some of my electrical engineering colleagues  we realized that they are still viable  so we are refurbishing them right now. In about    days or so they'll be connected to the GreenLab. And the reason why you see red  red and yellow  is a lot of people think NASA employees don't work on Saturday   This is a picture taken on Saturday. There are no cars around  but you see my truck in yellow. I work on Saturday.  Laughter  This is a proof to you that I'm working. 'Cause we do what it takes to get the job done  most people know that. Here's a concept with this  We are using the GreenLab for a micro grid test bed for the smart grid concept in Ohio. We have the ability to do that  and I think it's going to work. So  GreenLab Research Facility. A self sustainable renewable energy ecosystem was presented today. We really  really hope this concept catches on worldwide. We think we have a solution for food  water  fuel and now energy. Complete. It's extreme green  it's sustainable  alternative and renewable and it meets the big three at GRC  Don't use arable land  don't compete with food crops  and most of all  don't use fresh water. So I get a lot of questions about   What are you doing in that lab   And I usually say   None of your business  that's what I'm doing in the lab.   Laughter  And believe it or not  my number one goal for working on this project is I want to help save the world. Is there a real you  This might seem to you  like a very odd question. Because  you might ask  how do we find the real you  how do you know what the real you is  And so forth. But the idea that there must be a real you  surely that's obvious. If there's anything real  in the world  it's you. Well  I'm not quite sure. At least we have to understand  a bit better what that means. Now certainly  I think there are lots of things in our culture around us which sort of reinforce the idea that for each one of us  we have a kind of a core  an essence. There is something about what it means to be you which defines you  and it's kind of permanent and unchanging. The most kind of crude way in which we have it  are things like horoscopes. You know  people are very wedded to these  actually. People put them on their Facebook profile as though they are meaningul  you even know  your Chinese horoscope as well. There are also  more scientific versions of this  all sorts of ways of profiling personality type  such as the Myers Briggs tests  for example. I don't know if you've done those. A lot of companies  use these for recruitment. You answer a lot of questions  and this is supposed to reveal something about your core personality. And of course  the popular fascination  with this is enormous. In magazines like this  you'll see  in the bottom left corner  they'll advertise in virtually every issue some kind of personality thing. And if you pick up one of those magazines  it's hard to resist  isn't it  Doing the test to find what is your learning style  what is your loving style  or what is your working style  Are you this kind of person or that  So I think that we have a common sense idea that there is a kind of core  or essence of ourselves to be discovered. And that this is kind of a permanent truth about ourselves  something that's the same throughout life. Well  that's the idea I want to challenge. And I have to say now  I'll say it a bit later  but I'm not challenging this just because I'm weird  the challenge actually has a very  very long and distinguished history. Here's the common sense idea. There is you. You are the individuals you are  and you have this kind of core. Now in your life  what happens is that you  of course  accumulate different experiences and so forth. So you have memories  and these memories help  to create what you are. You have desires  maybe for a cookie  maybe for something that we don't want to talk about at    o'clock in the morning in a school. You will have beliefs. This is a number plate from someone in America. I don't know whether this number plate  which says  messiah     indicates that the driver believes in the messiah  or that they are the messiah. Either way  they have beliefs  about messiahs. We have knowledge. We have sensations and experiences as well. It's not just intellectual things. So this is kind of  the common sense model  I think  of what a person is. There is a person who has all the things that make up our life experiences. But the suggestion  I want to put to you today is that there's something  fundamentally wrong with this model. And I can show you what's wrong with one click. Which is there isn't actually a  you  at the heart of all these experiences. Strange thought  Well  maybe not. What is there  then  Well  clearly there are memories  desires  intentions  sensations  and so forth. But what happens is these things exist  and they're kind of all integrated  they're overlapped  they're connected in various different ways. They're connecting partly  and perhaps even mainly  because they all belong to one body and one brain. But there's also a narrative   a story we tell about ourselves  the experiences we have when we remember past things. We do things because of other things. So what we desire is partly a result of what we believe  and what we remember is also informing us what we know. And so really  there are all these things  like beliefs  desires   sensations  experiences  they're all related to each other  and that just is you. In some ways  it's a small difference from the common sense understanding. In some ways  it's a massive one. It's the shift between thinking of yourself as a thing which has  all the experiences of life  and thinking of yourself as simply that collection of all experiences in life. You are the sum of your parts. Now those parts are also physical parts   of course  brains  bodies and legs and things  but they aren't so important  actually. If you have a heart transplant  you're still the same person. If you have a memory transplant  are you the same person  If you have a belief transplant   would you be the same person  Now this idea  that what we are   the way to understand ourselves  is as not of some permanent being  which has experiences  but is kind of a collection of experiences  might strike you as kind of weird. But actually  I don't think  it should be weird. In a way  it's common sense. Because I just invite you  to think about  by comparison  think about pretty much anything else in the universe  maybe apart from the  very most fundamental forces or powers. Let's take something like water. Now my science isn't very good. We might say something like  water has two parts hydrogen and one parts oxygen  right  We all know that. I hope no one in this room thinks that what that means is there is a thing called water   and attached to it are hydrogen and oxygen atoms  and that's what water is. Of course we don't. We understand  very easily  very straightforwardly  that water is nothing more than the hydrogen and oxygen molecules suitably arranged. Everything else in the universe is the same. There's no mystery about my watch  for example. We say the watch has a face  and hands  and a mechanism and a battery  But what we really mean is  we don't think  there is a thing called the watch to which we then attach all these bits. We understand very clearly  that you get the parts of the watch  you put them together  and you create a watch. Now if everything else  in the universe is like this  why are we different  Why think of ourselves as somehow not just being  a collection of all our parts  but somehow being a separate  permanent entity which has those parts  Now this view is not particularly new   actually. It has quite a long lineage. You find it in Buddhism  you find it in   th     th century philosophy going through to the current day  people like Locke and Hume. But interestingly  it's also a view increasingly being heard reinforced by neuroscience. This is Paul Broks   he's a clinical neuropsychologist  and he says this   We have a deep intuition that there is a core  an essence there   and it's hard to shake off  probably impossible to shake off   I suspect. But it's true that neuroscience shows that there is no centre in the brain where things do all come together.  So when you look at the brain  and you look at how the brain makes possible a sense of self  you find that there isn't  a central control spot in the brain. There is no kind of center where everything happens. There are lots of different processes in the brain  all of which operate  in a way  quite independently. But it's because of the way  that they relate that we get this sense of self. The term I use in the book   I call it the ego trick. It's like a mechanical trick. It's not that we don't exist  it's just that the trick is  to make us feel that inside of us is something more unified than is really there. Now you might think this is a worrying idea. You might think that if it's true  that for each one of us there is no abiding core of self  no permanent essence  does that mean that really  the self is an illusion  Does it mean that we really don't exist  There is no real you. Well  a lot of people actually do use  this talk of illusion and so forth. These are three psychologists  Thomas Metzinger  Bruce Hood  Susan Blackmore  a lot of these people do talk  the language of illusion  the self is an illusion  it's a fiction. But I don't think this is  a very helpful way of looking at it. Go back to the watch. The watch isn't an illusion   because there is nothing to the watch other than a collection of its parts. In the same way   we're not illusions either. The fact that we are  in some ways  just this very  very complex collection  ordered collection of things  does not mean we're not real. I can give you  a very sort of rough metaphor for this. Let's take something like a waterfall. These are the Iguazu Falls  in Argentina. Now if you take something like this  you can appreciate the fact  that in lots of ways  there's nothing permanent about this. For one thing  it's always changing. The waters  are always carving new channels. with changes and tides and the weather  some things dry up   new things are created. Of course the water that flows  through the waterfall is different every single instance. But it doesn't mean that  the Iguazu Falls are an illusion. It doesn't mean it's not real. What it means is we have  to understand what it is as something which has a history  has certain things that keep it together  but it's a process  it's fluid   it's forever changing. Now that  I think  is a model for understanding ourselves  and I think it's a liberating model. Because if you think that you have this fixed  permanent essence  which is always the same  throughout your life  no matter what  in a sense you're kind of trapped. You're born with an essence  that's what you are until you die  if you believe in an afterlife   maybe you continue. But if you think of yourself as being  in a way  not a thing as such   but a kind of a process  something that is changing  then I think that's quite liberating. Because unlike the the waterfalls  we actually have the capacity to channel the direction of our development for ourselves to a certain degree. Now we've got to be careful here  right  If you watch the X Factor too much  you might buy into this idea that we can all be whatever we want to be. That's not true. I've heard some fantastic musicians this morning  and I am very confident that I could in no way be as good as them. I could practice hard  and maybe be good  but I don't have that really natural ability. There are limits to what we can achieve. There are limits to what  we can make of ourselves. But nevertheless  we do have  this capacity to  in a sense  shape ourselves. The true self  as it were then  is not something that is just there for you to discover  you don't sort of look into your soul and find your true self  What you are partly doing  at least  is actually creating your true self. And this  I think  is very  very significant  particularly at this stage of life you're at. You'll be aware of the fact how much of you changed over recent years. If you have any videos of yourself   three or four years ago  you probably feel embarrassed  because you don't recognize yourself. So I want to get that message over  that what we need to do is think about ourselves as things that we can shape  and channel and change. This is the Buddha  again   Well makers lead the water  fletchers bend the arrow  carpenters bend a log of wood  wise people fashion themselves.  And that's the idea  I want to leave you with  that your true self is not something  that you will have to go searching for  as a mystery  and maybe never ever find. To the extent you have a true self  it's something that you in part discover  but in part create. and that  I think   is a liberating and exciting prospect. Thank you very much. It is actually a reality today that you can download products from the Web    product data  I should say  from the Web    perhaps tweak it and personalize it to your own preference or your own taste  and have that information sent to a desktop machine that will fabricate it for you on the spot. We can actually build for you  very rapidly  a physical object. And the reason we can do this is through an emerging technology called additive manufacturing  or  D printing. This is a  D printer. They have been around for almost    years now  which is quite amazing to think of  but they're only just starting to filter into the public arena. And typically  you would take data  like the data of a pen here  which would be a geometric representation of that product in  D  and we would pass that data with material into a machine. And a process that would happen in the machine would mean layer by layer that product would be built. And we can take out the physical product  and ready to use  or to  perhaps  assemble into something else. But if these machines have been around for almost    years  why don't we know about them  Because typically they've been too inefficient  inaccessible  they've not been fast enough  they've been quite expensive. But today  it is becoming a reality that they are now becoming successful. Many barriers are breaking down. That means that you guys will soon be able to access one of these machines  if not this minute. And it will change and disrupt the landscape of manufacturing  and most certainly our lives  our businesses and the lives of our children. So how does it work  It typically reads CAD data  which is a product design data created on professional product design programs. And here you can see an engineer    it could be an architect or it could be a professional product designer    create a product in  D. And this data gets sent to a machine that slices the data into two dimensional representations of that product all the way through    almost like slicing it like salami. And that data  layer by layer  gets passed through the machine  starting at the base of the product and depositing material  layer upon layer  infusing the new layer of materials to the old layer in an additive process. And this material that's deposited either starts as a liquid form or a material powder form. And the bonding process can happen by either melting and depositing or depositing then melting. In this case  we can see a laser sintering machine developed by EOS. It's actually using a laser to fuse the new layer of material to the old layer. And over time    quite rapidly actually  in a number of hours    we can build a physical product  ready to take out of the machine and use. And this is quite an extraordinary idea  but it is reality today. So all these products that you can see on the screen were made in the same way. They were all  D printed. And you can see  they're ranging from shoes  rings that were made out of stainless steal  phone covers out of plastic  all the way through to spinal implants  for example  that were created out of medical grade titanium  and engine parts. But what you'll notice about all of these products is they're very  very intricate. The design is quite extraordinary. Because we're taking this data in  D form  slicing it up before it gets past the machine  we can actually create structures that are more intricate than any other manufacturing technology    or  in fact  are impossible to build in any other way. And you can create parts with moving components  hinges  parts within parts. So in some cases  we can abolish totally the need for manual labor. It sounds great. It is great. We can have  D printers today that build structures like these. This is almost three meters high. And this was built by depositing artificial sandstone layer upon layer in layers of about five millimeters to    mm in thickness    slowly growing this structure. This was created by an architectural firm called Shiro. And you can actually walk into it. And on the other end of the spectrum  this is a microstructure. It's created depositing layers of about four microns. So really the resolution is quite incredible. The detail that you can get today is quite amazing. So who's using it  Typically  because we can create products very rapidly  it's been used by product designers  or anyone who wanted to prototype a product and very quickly create or reiterate a design. And actually what's quite amazing about this technology as well is that you can create bespoke products en masse. There's very little economies of scale. So you can now create one offs very easily. Architects  for example  they want to create prototypes of buildings. Again you can see  this is a building of the Free University in Berlin and it was designed by Foster and Partners. Again  not buildable in any other way. And very hard to even create this by hand. Now this is an engine component. It was developed by a company called Within Technologies and  T RPD. It's very  very  very detailed inside with the design. Now  D printing can break away barriers in design which challenge the constraints of mass production. If we slice into this product which is actually sitting here  you can see that it has a number of cooling channels pass through it  which means it's a more efficient product. You can't create this with standard manufacturing techniques even if you tried to do it manually. It's more efficient because we can now create all these cavities within the object that cool fluid. And it's used by aerospace and automotive. It's a lighter part and it uses less material waste. So it's overall performance and efficiency just exceeds standard mass produced products. And then taking this idea of creating a very detailed structure  we can apply it to honeycomb structures and use them within implants. Typically an implant is more effective within the body if it's more porous  because our body tissue will grow into it. There's a lower chance of rejection. But it's very hard to create that in standard ways. With  D printing  we're seeing today that we can create much better implants. And in fact  because we can create bespoke products en masse  one offs  we can create implants that are specific to individuals. So as you can see  this technology and the quality of what comes out of the machines is fantastic. And we're starting to see it being used for final end products. And in fact  as the detail is improving  the quality is improving  the price of the machines are falling and they're becoming quicker. They're also now small enough to sit on a desktop. You can buy a machine today for about      that you can create yourself  which is quite incredible. But then it begs the question  why don't we all have one in our home  Because  simply  most of us here today don't know how to create the data that a  D printer reads. If I gave you a  D printer  you wouldn't know how to direct it to make what you want it to. But there are more and more technologies  software and processes today that are breaking down those barriers. I believe we're at a tipping point where this is now something that we can't avoid. This technology is really going to disrupt the landscape of manufacturing and  I believe  cause a revolution in manufacturing. So today  you can download products from the Web    anything you would have on your desktop  like pens  whistles  lemon squeezers. You can use software like Google SketchUp to create products from scratch very easily.  D printing can be also used to download spare parts from the Web. So imagine you have  say  a Hoover in your home and it has broken down. You need a spare part  but you realize that Hoover's been discontinued. Can you imagine going online    this is a reality    and finding that spare part from a database of geometries of that discontinued product and downloading that information  that data  and having the product made for you at home  ready to use  on your demand  And in fact  because we can create spare parts with things the machines are quite literally making themselves. You're having machines fabricate themselves. These are parts of a RepRap machine  which is a kind of desktop printer. But what interests my company the most is the fact that you can create individual unique products en masse. There's no need to do a run of thousands of millions or send that product to be injection molded in China. You can just make it physically on the spot. Which means that we can now present to the public the next generation of customization. This is something that is now possible today  that you can direct personally how you want your products to look. We're all familiar with the idea of customization or personalization. Brands like Nike are doing it. It's all over the Web. In fact  every major household name is allowing you to interact with their products on a daily basis    all the way from Smart Cars to Prada to Ray Ban  for example. But this is not really mass customization  it's known as variant production  variations of the same product. What you could do is really influence your product now and shape manipulate your product. I'm not sure about you guys  but I've had experiences when I've walked into a store and I've know exactly what I've wanted and I've searched everywhere for that perfect lamp that I know where I want to sit in my house and I just can't find the right thing  or that perfect piece of jewelry as a gift or for myself. Imagine that you can now engage with a brand and interact  so that you can pass your personal attributes to the products that you're about to buy. You can today download a product with software like this  view the product in  D. This is the sort of  D data that a machine will read. This is a lamp. And you can start iterating the design. You can direct what color that product will be  perhaps what material. And also  you can engage in shape manipulation of that product  but within boundaries that are safe. Because obviously the public are not professional product designers. The piece of software will keep an individual within the bounds of the possible. And when somebody is ready to purchase the product in their personalized design  they click  Enter  and this data gets converted into the data that a  D printer reads and gets passed to a  D printer  perhaps on someone's desktop. But I don't think that that's immediate. I don't think that will happen soon. What's more likely  and we're seeing it today  is that data gets sent to a local manufacturing center. This means lower carbon footprint. We're now  instead of shipping a product across the world  we're sending data across the Internet. Here's the product being built. You can see  this came out of the machine in one piece and the electronics were inserted later. It's this lamp  as you can see here. So as long as you have the data  you can create the part on demand. And you don't necessarily need to use this for just aesthetic customization  you can use it for functional customization  scanning parts of the body and creating things that are made to fit. So we can run this through to something like prosthetics  which is highly specialized to an individual's handicap. Or we can create very specific prosthetics for that individual. Scanning teeth today  you can have your teeth scanned and dental coatings made in this way to fit you. While you wait at the dentist  a machine will quietly be creating this for you ready to insert in the teeth. And the idea of now creating implants  scanning data  an MRI scan of somebody can now be converted into  D data and we can create very specific implants for them. And applying this to the idea of building up what's in our bodies. You know  this is pair of lungs and the bronchial tree. It's very intricate. You couldn't really create this or simulate it in any other way. But with MRI data  we can just build the product  as you can see  very intricately. Using this process  pioneers in the industry are layering up cells today. So one of the pioneers  for example  is Dr. Anthony Atala  and he has been working on layering cells to create body parts    bladders  valves  kidneys. Now this is not something that's ready for the public  but it is in working progress. So just to finalize  we're all individual. We all have different preferences  different needs. We like different things. We're all different sizes and our companies the same. Businesses want different things. Without a doubt in my mind  I believe that this technology is going to cause a manufacturing revolution and will change the landscape of manufacturing as we know it. Thank you. Yeah  so a couple of years ago I was turning     and I don't like being   . And I started grappling with this existential angst of what little I had done with my life. It wasn't the resume of breaking this record here  it was more like  who had I become  How had I spent my valuable time  How could this have gone by like lightning  And I couldn't forgive myself for the countless  countless hours I had lost in negative thought    all the time I had spent beating myself up for losing my marriage and not stopping the sexual abuse when I was a kid and career moves and this and this and this. Just why  why didn't I do it better  Why  Why  Why  And then my mother died at   . And so I starting thinking  not only am I not happy with the past  now I'm getting choked with   I've only got    years left.  What am I going to do with this short amount of time that's just fleeting  And I'm not in the present whatsoever. And I decided the remedy to all this malaise was going to be for me to chase an elevated dream  an extreme dream  something that would require utter conviction and unwavering passion  something that would make me be my best self in every aspect of my life  every minute of every day  because the dream was so big that I couldn't get there without that kind of behavior and that kind of conviction. And I decided  it was an old dream that was lingering  that was from so many years ago  three decades ago    the only sort of world class swim I had tried and failed at back in my   s    was going from Cuba to Florida. It was deep in my imagination. No one's ever done it without a shark cage. It's daunting. It's more than a hundred miles across a difficult passage of ocean. It's probably  at my speed  at my age    for anybody's speed at anybody's age    going to take     maybe     hours of continuous swimming  never getting out on the boat. And I started to train. I hadn't swum for    years  not a stroke. And I had kept in good shape  but swimming's a whole different animal. As a matter of fact  this picture is supposed to be me during training. It's a smiling face. And when you're training for this sport  you are not smiling. It's an arduous  difficult sport  and I don't remember smiling at any time during this sport. As I said  I respect other sports  and I compare this sport sometimes to cycling and to mountain climbing and other of the expedition type events  but this is a sensory deprivation  a physical duress. And when I started in with the eight hours and the    hours and the    hours and the    hours and the    hours and the    hour swims  I knew I had it  because I was making it through these. And when I said I'm going to go out and do a    hour swim  and we're coming into the dock after a long day and it's now night  and we come in and it's    hours and    minutes and I can touch the dock and we're done  the trainer says   That's great. It's    hours    minutes. Who cares the last two minutes   I say   No  it's got to be    hours   and I swim another minute out and another minute back to make the    hours. And I put together an expedition. It's not that I didn't have help  but honestly  I sort of led  I was the team leader. And to get the government permissions  you read in the paper  you think it's easy to get into Cuba everyday  Try going in with an armada like we had of    people and five boats and CNN's crew  etc. The navigation is difficult. There's a big river called the Gulf Stream that runs across and it's not going in the direction you are. It's going to the east and you'd like to go north. It's tricky. And there's dehydration. And there's hypothermia. And there are sharks. And there are all kinds of problems. And I gathered together  honestly  the world's leading experts in every possible way. And a month ago  the   rd of September  I stood on that shore and I looked across to that long  long faraway horizon and I asked myself  do you have it  Are your shoulders ready  And they were. They were prepared. No stone left unturned. Was the mind ready  You know  you're swimming with the fogged goggles  you're swimming at    strokes a minute  so you're never really focused on anything  you don't see well. You've got tight bathing caps over your ears trying to keep the heat of the head  because it's where the hypothermia starts  and so you don't hear very well. You're really left alone with your own thoughts. And I had all kinds of counting systems ready there in English  followed by German  followed by Spanish  followed by French. You save the French for last. And I had songs  I had a playlist in my head    not through headphones  in my own head    of    songs. And I couldn't wait to get into the dark in the middle of the night  because that's when Neil Young comes out. And it's odd  isn't it  You'd think you'd be singing Leonard Cohen's  Hallelujah  out in the majesty of the ocean  not songs about heroin addiction in New York City. But no  for some reason I couldn't wait to get into the dark of the night and be singing     A heard you knocking at my cellar door     I love you baby and I want some more     Ooh  ooh  the damage done    The night before I started  I finished Stephen Hawking's  The Grand Design.  And I couldn't wait to trip the mind fantastic. About the   th hour  I was going to start thinking about the edge of the universe. Is there an edge  Is this an envelope we're living inside of  or no  does it go onto infinity in both time and space  And there's nothing like swimming for    hours in the ocean that gets you thinking about things like this. I couldn't wait to prove the athlete I am  that nobody else in the world can do this swim. And I knew I could do it. And when I jumped into that water  I yelled in my mother's French   Courage   And I started swimming  and  oh my God  it was glassy. And we knew it  all    people on the boat  we all knew this was it  this was our time. And I reminded myself a couple hours in  you know  the sport is sort of a microcosm of life itself. First of all  you're going to hit obstacles. And even though you're feeling great at any one moment  don't take it for granted  be ready  because there's going to be pain  there's going to be suffering. It's not going to feel this good all the way across. And I was thinking of the hypothermia and maybe some shoulder pain and all the other things    the vomiting that comes from being in the saltwater. You're immersed in the liquid. Your body doesn't like the saltwater. After a couple of days  three days  you tend to rebel in a lot of physical ways. But no  two hours in  wham  Never in my life ... I knew there were Portuguese men o' war  all kinds of moon jellies  all kinds of things  but the box jellyfish from the southern oceans is not supposed to be in these waters. And I was on fire    excruciating  excruciating pain. I don't know if you can still see the red line here and up the arm. Evidently  a piece this big of tentacle has a hundred thousand little barbs on it and each barb is not just stinging your skin  it's sending a venom. The most venomous animal that lives in the ocean is the box jellyfish. And every one of those barbs is sending that venom into this central nervous system. So first I feel like boiling hot oil  I've been dipped in. And I'm yelling out   Fire  Fire  Fire  Fire  Help me  Somebody help me   And the next thing is paralysis. I feel it in the back and then I feel it in the chest up here  and I can't breathe. And now I'm not swimming with a nice long stroke  I'm sort of crabbing it this way. Then come convulsions. A young man on our boat is an EMT. He dives in to try to help me. He's stung. They drag him out on the boat  and he's    evidently  I didn't see any of this    but lying on the boat and giving himself epinephrine shots and crying out. He's    years old  very well built  lean  he's six foot  five  weighs     lbs.  and he is down. And he is crying and he's yelling to my trainer who's trying to help me. And he's saying   Bonnie  I think I'm going to die. My breath is down to three breaths a minute. I need help  and I can't help Diana.  So that was at eight o'clock at night. The doctor  medical team from University of Miami arrived at five in the morning. So I swam through the night  and at dawn they got there and they started with prednisone shots. I didn't get out  but was in the water taking prednisone shots  taking Xanax  oxygen to the face. It was like an ICU unit in the water. And I guess the story is that even Navy SEALS who are stung by the box jelly  they're done. They either die or they quickly get to a hospital. And I swam through the night and I swam through the next day. And the next night at dusk  again  wham  The box jelly again    all across the neck  all across here. And this time  I don't like it  I didn't want to give into it  but there's a difference between a non stop swim and a staged swim. And I gave in to the staged swim. And they got me out and they started again with the epinephrine and the prednisone and with the oxygen and with everything they had on board. And I got back in. And I swam through that night and into the next day. And at    hours  this body couldn't make it. The devastation of those stings had taken the respiratory system down so that I couldn't make the progress I wanted. And the dream was crushed. And how odd is this intelligent person who put this together and got all these world experts together. And I knew about the jellyfish  but I was sort of cavalier. A lot of athletes have this  you know  sort of invincibility. They should worry about me. I don't worry about them. I'll just swim right through them. We've got benadryl on board. If I get stung  I'll just grin and bear it. Well there was no grin and bearing this. As a matter of fact  the best advice I got was from an elementary school class in the Caribbean. And I was telling these kids      of them    they were all in the school on the gymnasium floor    and I was telling them about the jellyfish and how they're gelatinous and you can't see them at night especially. And they have these long    to    to    ft. tentacles. And they do this wrapping. And they can send the poison into the system. And a little kid from the back was like this. And I said   What's your name    Henry.   Henry  what's your question   He said   Well  I didn't have a question so much as I had a suggestion.  He said   You know those guys who really believe in what they believe in and so they wear bombs   And I said   Well it's odd that you've learned of this as a noble kind of pursuit  but yeah  I know those guys.  He said   That's what you need. You need like a school of fish that would swim in front of you like this.   And when the jellyfish come and they wrap their tentacles around the fish  they're going to be busy with them  and you'll just scoot around.  I said   Oh  it's like a suicide army.  He said   That's what I'm talking about. That's what you need.  And little did I know  that you should listen to eight year olds. And so I started that swim in a bathing suit like normal  and  no joke  this is it  it came from the shark divers. I finished the swim like this. I was swimming with this thing on. That's how scared of the jellyfish I was. So now what do I do  I wouldn't mind if every one of you came up on this stage tonight and told us how you've gotten over the big disappointments of your lives. Because we've all had them  haven't we  We've all had a heartache. And so my journey now is to find some sort of grace in the face of this defeat. And I can look at the journey  not just the destination. I can feel proud. I can stand here in front of you tonight and say I was courageous. Yeah. Thank you. And with all sincerity  I can say  I am glad I lived those two years of my life that way  because my goal to not suffer regrets anymore  I got there with that goal. When you live that way  when you live with that kind of passion  there's no time  there's no time for regrets  you're just moving forward. And I want to live every day of the rest of my life that way  swim or no swim. But the difference in accepting this particular defeat is that sometimes  if cancer has won  if there's death and we have no choice  then grace and acceptance are necessary. But that ocean's still there. This hope is still alive. And I don't want to be the crazy woman who does it for years and years and years  and tries and fails and tries and fails and tries and fails  but I can swim from Cuba to Florida  and I will swim from Cuba to Florida. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And so  what after that  Are you going to swim the Atlantic  No  that's the last swim. It's the only swim I'm interested in. But I'm ready. And by the way  a reporter called me the other day and he said he looked on Wikipedia and he said he saw my birthday was August   nd       and for some odd reason in Wikipedia  they had my death date too. He said   Did you know you're going to die the same place you were born  New York City  and it's going to be in January of '     I said   Nope. I didn't know.  And now I'm going to live to   . I have three more years than I thought. And so I ask myself  I'm starting to ask myself now  even before this extreme dream gets achieved for me  I'm asking myself  and maybe I can ask you tonight too  to paraphrase the poet Mary Oliver  she says   So what is it  what is it you're doing  with this one wild and precious life of yours   Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Live it large. Live it large. I think we have to do something about a piece of the culture of medicine that has to change. And I think it starts with one physician  and that's me. And maybe I've been around long enough that I can afford to give away some of my false prestige to be able to do that. Before I actually begin the meat of my talk  let's begin with a bit of baseball. Hey  why not  We're near the end  we're getting close to the World Series. We all love baseball  don't we  Baseball is filled with some amazing statistics. And there's hundreds of them.  Moneyball  is about to come out  and it's all about statistics and using statistics to build a great baseball team. I'm going to focus on one stat that I hope a lot of you have heard of. It's called batting average. So we talk about a      a batter who bats    . That means that ballplayer batted safely  hit safely three times out of    at bats. That means hit the ball into the outfield  it dropped  it didn't get caught  and whoever tried to throw it to first base didn't get there in time and the runner was safe. Three times out of   . Do you know what they call a     hitter in Major League Baseball  Good  really good  maybe an all star. Do you know what they call a     baseball hitter  That's somebody who hit  by the way  four times safely out of every   . Legendary    as in Ted Williams legendary    the last Major League Baseball player to hit over     during a regular season. Now let's take this back into my world of medicine where I'm a lot more comfortable  or perhaps a bit less comfortable after what I'm going to talk to you about. Suppose you have appendicitis and you're referred to a surgeon who's batting     on appendectomies. Somehow this isn't working out  is it  Now suppose you live in a certain part of a certain remote place and you have a loved one who has blockages in two coronary arteries and your family doctor refers that loved one to a cardiologist who's batting     on angioplasties. But  but  you know what  She's doing a lot better this year. She's on the comeback trail. And she's hitting a    . Somehow this isn't working. But I'm going to ask you a question. What do you think a batting average for a cardiac surgeon or a nurse practitioner or an orthopedic surgeon  an OBGYN  a paramedic is supposed to be         very good. Now truth of the matter is  nobody knows in all of medicine what a good surgeon or physician or paramedic is supposed to bat. What we do though is we send each one of them  including myself  out into the world with the admonition  be perfect. Never ever  ever make a mistake  but you worry about the details  about how that's going to happen. And that was the message that I absorbed when I was in med school. I was an obsessive compulsive student. In high school  a classmate once said that Brian Goldman would study for a blood test. And so I did. And I studied in my little garret at the nurses' residence at Toronto General Hospital  not far from here. And I memorized everything. I memorized in my anatomy class the origins and exertions of every muscle  every branch of every artery that came off the aorta  differential diagnoses obscure and common. I even knew the differential diagnosis in how to classify renal tubular acidosis. And all the while  I was amassing more and more knowledge. And I did well  I graduated with honors  cum laude. And I came out of medical school with the impression that if I memorized everything and knew everything  or as much as possible  as close to everything as possible  that it would immunize me against making mistakes. And it worked for a while  until I met Mrs. Drucker. I was a resident at a teaching hospital here in Toronto when Mrs. Drucker was brought to the emergency department of the hospital where I was working. At the time I was assigned to the cardiology service on a cardiology rotation. And it was my job  when the emergency staff called for a cardiology consult  to see that patient in emerg. and to report back to my attending. And I saw Mrs. Drucker  and she was breathless. And when I listened to her  she was making a wheezy sound. And when I listened to her chest with a stethoscope  I could hear crackly sounds on both sides that told me that she was in congestive heart failure. This is a condition in which the heart fails  and instead of being able to pump all the blood forward  some of the blood backs up into the lung  the lungs fill up with blood  and that's why you have shortness of breath. And that wasn't a difficult diagnosis to make. I made it and I set to work treating her. I gave her aspirin. I gave her medications to relieve the strain on her heart. I gave her medications that we call diuretics  water pills  to get her to pee out the access fluid. And over the course of the next hour and a half or two  she started to feel better. And I felt really good. And that's when I made my first mistake  I sent her home. Actually  I made two more mistakes. I sent her home without speaking to my attending. I didn't pick up the phone and do what I was supposed to do  which was call my attending and run the story by him so he would have a chance to see her for himself. And he knew her  he would have been able to furnish additional information about her. Maybe I did it for a good reason. Maybe I didn't want to be a high maintenance resident. Maybe I wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that I would do so and I would be able to take care of my attending's patients without even having to contact him. The second mistake that I made was worse. In sending her home  I disregarded a little voice deep down inside that was trying to tell me   Goldman  not a good idea. Don't do this.  In fact  so lacking in confidence was I that I actually asked the nurse who was looking after Mrs. Drucker   Do you think it's okay if she goes home   And the nurse thought about it and said very matter of factly   Yeah  I think she'll do okay.  I can remember that like it was yesterday. So I signed the discharge papers  and an ambulance came  paramedics came to take her home. And I went back to my work on the wards. All the rest of that day  that afternoon  I had this kind of gnawing feeling inside my stomach. But I carried on with my work. And at the end of the day  I packed up to leave the hospital and walked to the parking lot to take my car and drive home when I did something that I don't usually do. I walked through the emergency department on my way home. And it was there that another nurse  not the nurse who was looking after Mrs. Drucker before  but another nurse  said three words to me that are the three words that most emergency physicians I know dread. Others in medicine dread them as well  but there's something particular about emergency medicine because we see patients so fleetingly. The three words are  Do you remember   Do you remember that patient you sent home   the other nurse asked matter of factly.  Well she's back   in just that tone of voice. Well she was back all right. She was back and near death. About an hour after she had arrived home  after I'd sent her home  she collapsed and her family called     and the paramedics brought her back to the emergency department where she had a blood pressure of     which is in severe shock. And she was barely breathing and she was blue. And the emerg. staff pulled out all the stops. They gave her medications to raise her blood pressure. They put her on a ventilator. And I was shocked and shaken to the core. And I went through this roller coaster  because after they stabilized her  she went to the intensive care unit  and I hoped against hope that she would recover. And over the next two or three days  it was clear that she was never going to wake up. She had irreversible brain damage. And the family gathered. And over the course of the next eight or nine days  they resigned themselves to what was happening. And at about the nine day mark  they let her go    Mrs. Drucker  a wife  a mother and a grandmother. They say you never forget the names of those who die. And that was my first time to be acquainted with that. Over the next few weeks  I beat myself up and I experienced for the first time the unhealthy shame that exists in our culture of medicine    where I felt alone  isolated  not feeling the healthy kind of shame that you feel  because you can't talk about it with your colleagues. You know that healthy kind  when you betray a secret that a best friend made you promise never to reveal and then you get busted and then your best friend confronts you and you have terrible discussions  but at the end of it all that sick feeling guides you and you say  I'll never make that mistake again. And you make amends and you never make that mistake again. That's the kind of shame that is a teacher. The unhealthy shame I'm talking about is the one that makes you so sick inside. It's the one that says  not that what you did was bad  but that you are bad. And it was what I was feeling. And it wasn't because of my attending  he was a doll. He talked to the family  and I'm quite sure that he smoothed things over and made sure that I didn't get sued. And I kept asking myself these questions. Why didn't I ask my attending  Why did I send her home  And then at my worst moments  Why did I make such a stupid mistake  Why did I go into medicine  Slowly but surely  it lifted. I began to feel a bit better. And on a cloudy day  there was a crack in the clouds and the sun started to come out and I wondered  maybe I could feel better again. And I made myself a bargain that if only I redouble my efforts to be perfect and never make another mistake again  please make the voices stop. And they did. And I went back to work. And then it happened again. Two years later I was an attending in the emergency department at a community hospital just north of Toronto  and I saw a    year old man with a sore throat. It was busy  I was in a bit of a hurry. He kept pointing here. I looked at his throat  it was a little bit pink. And I gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him on his way. And even as he was walking out the door  he was still sort of pointing to his throat. And two days later I came to do my next emergency shift  and that's when my chief asked to speak to me quietly in her office. And she said the three words  Do you remember   Do you remember that patient you saw with the sore throat   Well it turns out  he didn't have a strep throat. He had a potentially life threatening condition called epiglottitis. You can Google it  but it's an infection  not of the throat  but of the upper airway  and it can actually cause the airway to close. And fortunately he didn't die. He was placed on intravenous antibiotics and he recovered after a few days. And I went through the same period of shame and recriminations and felt cleansed and went back to work  until it happened again and again and again. Twice in one emergency shift  I missed appendicitis. Now that takes some doing  especially when you work in a hospital that at the time saw but    people a night. Now in both cases  I didn't send them home and I don't think there was any gap in their care. One I thought had a kidney stone. I ordered a kidney X ray. When it turned out to be normal  my colleague who was doing a reassessment of the patient noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant and called the surgeons. The other one had a lot of diarrhea. I ordered some fluids to rehydrate him and asked my colleague to reassess him. And he did and when he noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant  called the surgeons. In both cases  they had their operations and they did okay. But each time  they were gnawing at me  eating at me. And I'd like to be able to say to you that my worst mistakes only happened in the first five years of practice as many of my colleagues say  which is total B.S. Some of my doozies have been in the last five years. Alone  ashamed and unsupported. Here's the problem  If I can't come clean and talk about my mistakes  if I can't find the still small voice that tells me what really happened  how can I share it with my colleagues  How can I teach them about what I did so that they don't do the same thing  If I were to walk into a room    like right now  I have no idea what you think of me. When was the last time you heard somebody talk about failure after failure after failure  Oh yeah  you go to a cocktail party and you might hear about some other doctor  but you're not going to hear somebody talking about their own mistakes. If I were to walk into a room filled with my colleages and ask for their support right now and start to tell what I've just told you right now  I probably wouldn't get through two of those stories before they would start to get really uncomfortable  somebody would crack a joke  they'd change the subject and we would move on. And in fact  if I knew and my colleagues knew that one of my orthopedic colleagues took off the wrong leg in my hospital  believe me  I'd have trouble making eye contact with that person. That's the system that we have. It's a complete denial of mistakes. It's a system in which there are two kinds of physicians    those who make mistakes and those who don't  those who can't handle sleep deprivation and those who can  those who have lousy outcomes and those who have great outcomes. And it's almost like an ideological reaction  like the antibodies begin to attack that person. And we have this idea that if we drive the people who make mistakes out of medicine  what will we be left with  but a safe system. But there are two problems with that. In my    years or so of medical broadcasting and journalism  I've made a personal study of medical malpractice and medical errors to learn everything I can  from one of the first articles I wrote for the Toronto Star to my show  White Coat  Black Art.  And what I've learned is that errors are absolutely ubiquitous. We work in a system where errors happen every day  where one in    medications are either the wrong medication given in hospital or at the wrong dosage  where hospital acquired infections are getting more and more numerous  causing havoc and death. In this country  as many as        Canadians die of preventable medical errors. In the United States  the Institute of Medicine pegged it at        . In both cases  these are gross underestimates  because we really aren't ferreting out the problem as we should. And here's the thing. In a hospital system where medical knowledge is doubling every two or three years  we can't keep up with it. Sleep deprivation is absolutely pervasive. We can't get rid of it. We have our cognitive biases  so that I can take a perfect history on a patient with chest pain. Now take the same patient with chest pain  make them moist and garrulous and put a little bit of alcohol on their breath  and suddenly my history is laced with contempt. I don't take the same history. I'm not a robot  I don't do things the same way each time. And my patients aren't cars  they don't tell me their symptoms in the same way each time. Given all of that  mistakes are inevitable. So if you take the system  as I was taught  and weed out all the error prone health professionals  well there won't be anybody left. And you know that business about people not wanting to talk about their worst cases  On my show  on  White Coat  Black Art   I made it a habit of saying   Here's my worst mistake   I would say to everybody from paramedics to the chief of cardiac surgery   Here's my worst mistake   blah  blah  blah  blah  blah   What about yours   and I would point the microphone towards them. And their pupils would dilate  they would recoil  then they would look down and swallow hard and start to tell me their stories. They want to tell their stories. They want to share their stories. They want to be able to say   Look  don't make the same mistake I did.  What they need is an environment to be able to do that. What they need is a redefined medical culture. And it starts with one physician at a time. The redefined physician is human  knows she's human  accepts it  isn't proud of making mistakes  but strives to learn one thing from what happened that she can teach to somebody else. She shares her experience with others. She's supportive when other people talk about their mistakes. And she points out other people's mistakes  not in a gotcha way  but in a loving  supportive way so that everybody can benefit. And she works in a culture of medicine that acknowledges that human beings run the system  and when human beings run the system  they will make mistakes from time to time. So the system is evolving to create backups that make it easier to detect those mistakes that humans inevitably make and also fosters in a loving  supportive way places where everybody who is observing in the health care system can actually point out things that could be potential mistakes and is rewarded for doing so  and especially people like me  when we do make mistakes  we're rewarded for coming clean. My name is Brian Goldman. I am a redefined physician. I'm human. I make mistakes. I'm sorry about that  but I strive to learn one thing that I can pass on to other people. I still don't know what you think of me  but I can live with that. And let me close with three words of my own  I do remember. We do not invest in victims  we invest in survivors. And in ways both big and small  the narrative of the victim shapes the way we see women. You can't count what you don't see. And we don't invest in what's invisible to us. But this is the face of resilience. Six years ago  I started writing about women entrepreneurs during and after conflict. I set out to write a compelling economic story  one that had great characters  that no one else was telling  and one that I thought mattered. And that turned out to be women. I had left ABC news and a career I loved at the age of    for business school  a path I knew almost nothing about. None of the women I had grown up with in Maryland had graduated from college  let alone considered business school. But they had hustled to feed their kids and pay their rent. And I saw from a young age that having a decent job and earning a good living made the biggest difference for families who were struggling. So if you're going to talk about jobs  then you have to talk about entrepreneurs. And if you're talking about entrepreneurs in conflict and post conflict settings  then you must talk about women  because they are the population you have left. Rwanda in the immediate aftermath of the genocide was    percent female. I want to introduce you to some of those entrepreneurs I've met and share with you some of what they've taught me over the years. I went to Afghanistan in      to work on a Financial Times piece  and there I met Kamila  a young women who told me she had just turned down a job with the international community that would have paid her nearly        a month    an astronomical sum in that context. And she had turned it down  she said  because she was going to start her next business  an entrepreneurship consultancy that would teach business skills to men and women all around Afghanistan. Business  she said  was critical to her country's future. Because long after this round of internationals left  business would help keep her country peaceful and secure. And she said business was even more important for women because earning an income earned respect and money was power for women. So I was amazed. I mean here was a girl who had never lived in peace time who somehow had come to sound like a candidate from  The Apprentice.  So I asked her   How in the world do you know this much about business  Why are you so passionate   She said   Oh Gayle  this is actually my third business. My first business was a dressmaking business I started under the Taliban. And that was actually an excellent business  because we provided jobs for women all around our neighborhood. And that's really how I became an entrepreneur.  Think about this  Here were girls who braved danger to become breadwinners during years in which they couldn't even be on their streets. And at a time of economic collapse when people sold baby dolls and shoe laces and windows and doors just to survive  these girls made the difference between survival and starvation for so many. I couldn't leave the story  and I couldn't leave the topic either  because everywhere I went I met more of these women who no one seemed to know about  or even wish to. I went on to Bosnia  and early on in my interviews I met with an IMF official who said   You know  Gayle  I don't think we actually have women in business in Bosnia  but there is a lady selling cheese nearby on the side of the road. So maybe you could interview her.  So I went out reporting and within a day I met Narcisa Kavazovic who at that point was opening a new factory on the war's former front lines in Sarajevo. She had started her business squatting in an abandoned garage  sewing sheets and pillow cases she would take to markets all around the city so that she could support the    or    family members who were counting on her for survival. By the time we met  she had    employees  most of them women  who were sending their boys and their girls to school. And she was just the start. I met women running essential oils businesses  wineries and even the country's largest advertising agency. So these stories together became the Herald Tribune business cover. And when this story posted  I ran to my computer to send it to the IMF official. And I said   Just in case you're looking for entrepreneurs to feature at your next investment conference  here are a couple of women.  But think about this. The IMF official is hardly the only person to automatically file women under micro. The biases  whether intentional or otherwise  are pervasive  and so are the misleading mental images. If you see the word  microfinance   what comes to mind  Most people say women. And if you see the word  entrepreneur   most people think men. Why is that  Because we aim low and we think small when it comes to women. Microfinance is an incredibly powerful tool that leads to self sufficiency and self respect  but we must move beyond micro hopes and micro ambitions for women  because they have so much greater hopes for themselves. They want to move from micro to medium and beyond. And in many places  they're there. In the U.S.  women owned businesses will create five and a half million new jobs by     . In South Korea and Indonesia  women own nearly half a million firms. China  women run    percent of all small businesses. And in the developing world overall  That figure is    to    percent. Nearly everywhere I go  I meet incredibly interesting entrepreneurs who are seeking access to finance  access to markets and established business networks. They are often ignored because they're harder to help. It is much riskier to give a        dollar loan than it is to give a     dollar loan. And as the World Bank recently noted  women are stuck in a productivity trap. Those in small businesses can't get the capital they need to expand and those in microbusiness can't grow out of them. Recently I was at the State Department in Washington and I met an incredibly passionate entrepreneur from Ghana. She sells chocolates. And she had come to Washington  not seeking a handout and not seeking a microloan. She had come seeking serious investment dollars so that she could build the factory and buy the equipment she needs to export her chocolates to Africa  Europe  the Middle East and far beyond    capital that would help her to employ more than the    people that she already has working for her  and capital that would fuel her own country's economic climb. The great news is we already know what works. Theory and empirical evidence Have already taught us. We don't need to invent solutions because we have them    cash flow loans based in income rather than assets  loans that use secure contracts rather than collateral  because women often don't own land. And Kiva.org  the microlender  is actually now experimenting with crowdsourcing small and medium sized loans. And that's just to start. Recently it has become very much in fashion to call women  the emerging market of the emerging market.  I think that is terrific. You know why  Because    and I say this as somebody who worked in finance        billion dollars at least has gone into the emerging markets in the past decade. Because investors saw the potential for return at a time of slowing economic growth  and so they created financial products and financial innovation tailored to the emerging markets. How wonderful would it be if we were prepared to replace all of our lofty words with our wallets and invest     billion dollars unleashing women's economic potential  Just think of the benefits when it comes to jobs  productivity  employment  child nutrition  maternal mortality  literacy and much  much more. Because  as the World Economic Forum noted  smaller gender gaps are directly correlated with increased economic competitiveness. And not one country in all the world has eliminated its economic participation gap    not one. So the great news is this is an incredible opportunity. We have so much room to grow. So you see  this is not about doing good  this is about global growth and global employment. It is about how we invest and it's about how we see women. And women can no longer be both half the population and a special interest group. Oftentimes I get into very interesting discussions with reporters who say to me   Gayle  these are great stories  but you're really writing about the exceptions.  Now that makes me pause for just a couple reasons. First of all  for exceptions  there are a lot of them and they're important. Secondly  when we talk about men who are succeeding  we rightly consider them icons or pioneers or innovators to be emulated. And when we talk about women  they are either exceptions to be dismissed or aberrations to be ignored. And finally  there is no society anywhere in all the world that is not changed except by its most exceptional. So why wouldn't we celebrate and elevate these change makers and job creators rather than overlook them  This topic of resilience is very personal to me and in many ways has shaped my life. My mom was a single mom who worked at the phone company during the day and sold Tupperware at night so that I could have every opportunity possible. We shopped double coupons and layaway and consignment stores  and when she got sick with stage four breast cancer and could no longer work  we even applied for food stamps. And when I would feel sorry for myself as nine or    year old girls do  she would say to me   My dear  on a scale of major world tragedies  yours is not a three.  And when I was applying to business school and felt certain I couldn't do it and nobody I knew had done it  I went to my aunt who survived years of beatings at the hand of her husband and escaped a marriage of abuse with only her dignity intact. And she told me   Never import other people's limitations.  And when I complained to my grandmother  a World War II veteran who worked in film for    years and who supported me from the age of     that I was terrified that if I turned down a plum assignment at ABC for a fellowship overseas  I would never ever  ever find another job  she said   Kiddo  I'm going to tell you two things. First of all  no one turns down a Fulbright  and secondly  McDonald's is always hiring.   You will find a job. Take the leap.  The women in my family are not exceptions. The women in this room and watching in L.A. and all around the world are not exceptions. We are not a special interest group. We are the majority. And for far too long  we have underestimated ourselves and been undervalued by others. It is time for us to aim higher when it comes to women  to invest more and to deploy our dollars to benefit women all around the world. We can make a difference  and make a difference  not just for women  but for a global economy that desperately needs their contributions. Together we can make certain that the so called exceptions begin to rule. When we change the way we see ourselves  others will follow. And it is time for all of us to think bigger. Thank you very much. I want to talk to you about  or share with you  a breakthrough new approach for managing items of inventory inside of a warehouse. We're talking about a pick  pack and ship setting here. So as a hint  this solution involves hundreds of mobile robots  sometimes thousands of mobile robots  moving around a warehouse. And I'll get to the solution. But for a moment  just think about the last time that you ordered something online. You were sitting on your couch and you decided that you absolutely had to have this red t shirt. So   click    you put it into your shopping cart. And then you decided that green pair of pants looks pretty good too   click  And maybe a blue pair of shoes   click  So at this point you've assembled your order. You didn't stop to think  for a moment that that might not be a great outfit. But you hit  submit order.  And two days later  this package shows up on your doorstep. And you open the box and you're like  wow  there's my goo. Did you ever stop to think about how those items of inventory actually found their way inside that box in the warehouse  So I'm here to tell you  it's that guy right there. So deep in the middle of that picture  you see a classic pick pack worker in a distribution or order fulfillments setting. Classically these pick workers will  spend    or    percent of their day wandering around the warehouse. They'll often walk as much as   or    miles in pursuit of those items of inventory. Not only is this an unproductive way to fill orders  it also turns out to be an unfulfilling way to fill orders. So let me tell you where I first bumped into this problem. I was out in the Bay area  in '          the dot com boom. I worked for a fabulously spectacular flame out called Webvan. This company raised hundreds of millions of dollars with the notion that we will deliver grocery orders online. And it really came down to the fact that we couldn't do it cost effectively. Turns out e commerce was something that was very hard and very costly. In this particular instance we were trying to assemble    items of inventory into a few totes  onto a van to deliver to the home. And when you think about it  it was costing us    dollars. Imagine  we had an     can of soup that was costing us one dollar to pick and pack into that tote. And that's before we actually tried to deliver it to the home. So long story short  during my one year at Webvan  what I realized by talking to  all the material handling providers was that there was no solution designed specifically to solve each base picking. Red item  green  blue  getting those three things in a box. So we said  there's just got to be a better way to do this. Existing material handling was set up to pump pallets and cases of goo to retail stores. Of course Webvan went out of business  and about a year and a half later  I was still noodling on this problem. It was still nagging at me. And I started thinking about it again. And I said  let me just focus briefly on what I wanted as a pick worker  or my vision for how it should work. I said  let's focus on the problem. I have an order here and what I want to do is I want to put red  green and blue in this box right here. What I need is a system where I put out my hand and   poof    the product shows up  and I pack it into the order  and now we're thinking  this would be a very operator centric approach to solving the problem. This is what I need. What technology is available to solve this problem  But as you can see  orders can come and go  products can come and go. It allows us to focus on making the pick worker the center of the problem  and providing them the tools to make them as productive as possible. So how did I arrive at this notion  Well  actually it came from a brainstorming exercise  probably a technique that many of you use  It's this notion of testing your ideas. Take a blank sheet  of course  but then test your ideas at the limits   infinity  zero. In this particular case  we challenged ourselves with the idea  What if we had to build a distribution center in China  where it's a very  very low cost market  And say  labor is cheap  land is cheap. And we said specifically   What if it was zero dollars an hour for direct labor and we could build a million  square foot distribution center   So naturally that led to ideas that said   Let's put lots of people in the warehouse.  And I said   Hold on  zero dollars per hour  what I would do is 'hire'        workers to come to the warehouse every morning at   a.m.  walk into the warehouse and pick up one item of inventory and then just stand there. So you hold Captain Crunch  you hold the Mountain Dew  you hold the Diet Coke. If I need it  I'll call you  otherwise just stand there. But when I need Diet Coke and I call it  you guys talk amongst yourselves. Diet Coke walks up to the front   pick it  put it in the tote  away it goes.  Wow  what if the products could walk and talk on their own  That's a very interesting  very powerful way that we could potentially organize this warehouse. So of course  labor isn't free  on that practical versus awesome spectrum. So we said mobile shelving   We'll put them on mobile shelving. We'll use mobile robots and we'll move the inventory around. And so we got underway on that and then I'm sitting on my couch in     . Did any of you see the Beijing Olympics  the opening ceremonies  I about fell out of my couch when I saw this. I'm like  that was the idea  We'll put thousands of people on the warehouse floor  the stadium floor. But interestingly enough  this actually relates to the idea in that these guys were creating some incredibly powerful  impressive digital art  all without computers  I'm told  it was all peer to peer coordination and communication. You stand up  I'll squat down. And they made some fabulous art. It speaks to the power of emergence in systems when you let things start to talk with each other. So that was a little bit of the journey. So of course  now what became the practical reality of this idea  Here is a warehouse. It's a pick  pack and ship center that has about        different SKUs. We'll call them red pens  green pens  yellow Post It Notes. We send the little orange robots out to pick up the blue shelving pods. And we deliver them to the side of the building. So all the pick workers now get to stay on the perimeter. And the game here is to pick up the shelves  take them down the highway and deliver them straight to the pick worker. This pick worker's life is completely different. Rather than wandering around the warehouse  she gets to stay still in a pick station like this and every product in the building can now come to her. So the process is very productive. Reach in  pick an item  scan the bar code  pack it out. By the time you turn around  there's another product there ready to be picked and packed. So what we've done is take out all of the non value added walking  searching  wasting  waited time  and we've developed a very  high fidelity way to pick these orders  where you point at it with a laser  scan the UPC barcode  and then indicate with a light which box it needs to go into. So more productive  more accurate and  it turns out  it's a more interesting office environment for these pick workers. They actually complete the whole order. So they do red  green and blue  not just a part of the order. And they feel a little bit more in control of their environment. So the side effects of this approach are what really surprised us. We knew it was going  to be more productive. But we didn't realize just how pervasive this way of thinking extended to other functions in the warehouse. But what effectively this approach is doing inside of the DC is turning it into a massively parallel processing engine. So this is again a cross fertilization of ideas. Here's a warehouse and we're thinking about parallel processing supercomputer architectures. The notion here is that you have    workers on  the right side of the screen that are now all independent autonomous pick workers. If the worker in station three decides to leave and go to the bathroom  it has no impact on the productivity of the other nine workers. Contrast that  for a moment  with the traditional method of using a conveyor. When one person passes the order to you  you put something in and pass it downstream. Everyone has to be in place for that serial process to work. This becomes a more robust way to think about the warehouse. And then underneath the hoods gets interesting in that we're tracking the popularity of the products. And we're using dynamic and adaptive algorithms to tune the floor of the warehouse. So what you see here potentially the week leading up to Valentine's Day. All that pink chalky candy has moved to the front of the building and is now being picked into a lot of orders in those pick stations. Come in two days after Valentine's Day  and that candy  the leftover candy  has all drifted to the back of the warehouse and is occupying the cooler zone on the thermal map there. One other side effect of this approach using the parallel processing is these things can scale to ginormous. So whether you're doing two pick stations     pick stations  or     pick stations  the path planning algorithms and all of the inventory algorithms just work. In this example you see that the inventory has now occupied all the perimeter of the building because that's where the pick stations were. They sorted it out for themselves. So I'll conclude with just one final video that shows how this comes to bear on the pick worker's actual day in the life of. So as we mentioned  the process is to move inventory along the highway and then find your way into these pick stations. And our software in the background understands what's going on  in each station  we direct the pods across the highway and we're attempting to get into a queuing system to present the work to the pick worker. What's interesting is we can even adapt the speed of the pick workers. The faster pickers get more pods and the slower pickers get few. But this pick worker now is literally having that experience that we described before. She puts out her hand. The product jumps into it. Or she has to reach in and get it. She scans it and  she puts it in the bucket. And all of the rest of the technology is kind of behind the scenes. So she gets to now focus on the picking and packing portion of her job. Never has any idle time  never has to leave her mat. And actually we think not only a more productive and more accurate way to fill orders. We think it's a more fulfilling way to fill orders. The reason we can say that  though  is that workers in a lot of these buildings now compete for the privilege of working in the Kiva zone that day. And sometimes we'll catch them on testimonial videos saying such things as  they have more energy after the day to play with their grandchildren  or in one case a guy said   the Kiva zone is so stress free that I've actually stopped taking my blood pressure medication.  That was at a pharmaceutical distributor  so they told us not to use that video. So what I wanted to leave you with today is the notion that when you let things start to think and walk and talk on their own  interesting processes and productivities can emerge. And now I think next time you go to your front step and pick up that box that you just ordered online  you break it open and the goo is in there  you'll have some wonderment as to whether a robot assisted in the picking and packing of that order. Thank you. As the highest military commander of the Netherlands  with troops stationed around the world  I'm really honored to be here today. When I look around this TEDxAmsterdam venue  I see a very special audience. You are the reason why I said yes to the invitation to come here today. When I look around  I see people who want to make a contribution. I see people who want to make a better world  by doing groundbreaking scientific work  by creating impressive works of art  by writing critical articles or inspiring books  by starting up sustainable businesses. And you all have chosen your own instruments to fulfill this mission of creating a better world. Some chose the microscope as their instrument. Others chose dancing or painting  or making music like we just heard. Some chose the pen. Others work through the instrument of money. Ladies and gentlemen  I made a different choice. Thanks. Ladies and gentlemen ... I share your goals. I share the goals of the speakers you heard before. I did not choose to take up the pen  the brush  the camera. I chose this instrument. I chose the gun. For you  and you heard already  being so close to this gun may make you feel uneasy. It may even feel scary. A real gun at a few feet's distance. Let us stop for a moment and feel this uneasiness. You could even hear it. Let us cherish the fact that probably most of you have never been close to a gun. It means the Netherlands is a peaceful country. The Netherlands is not at war. It means soldiers are not needed to patrol our streets. Guns are not a part of our lives. In many countries  it is a different story. In many countries  people are confronted with guns. They are oppressed. They are intimidated    by warlords  by terrorists  by criminals. Weapons can do a lot of harm. They are the cause of much distress. Why then am I standing before you with this weapon  Why did I choose the gun as my instrument  Today I want to tell you why. Today I want to tell you why I chose the gun to create a better world. And I want to tell you how this gun can help. My story starts in the city of Nijmegen in the east of the Netherlands  the city where I was born. My father was a hardworking baker  but when he had finished work in the bakery  he often told me and my brother stories. And most of the time  he told me this story I'm going to share with you now. The story of what happened when he was a conscripted soldier in the Dutch armed forces at the beginning of the Second World War. The Nazis invaded the Netherlands. Their grim plans were evident. They meant to rule by means of repression. Diplomacy had failed to stop the Germans. Only brute force remained. It was our last resort. My father was there to provide it. As the son of a farmer who knew how to hunt  my father was an excellent marksman. When he aimed  he never missed. At this decisive moment in Dutch history my father was positioned on the bank of the river Waal near the city of Nijmegen. He had a clear shot at the German soldiers who came to occupy a free country  his country  our country. He fired. Nothing happened. He fired again. No German soldier fell to the ground. My father had been given an old gun that could not even reach the opposite riverbank. Hitler's troops marched on  and there was nothing my father could do about it. Until the day my father died  he was frustrated about missing these shots. He could have done something. But with an old gun  not even the best marksman in the armed forces could have hit the mark. So this story stayed with me. Then in high school  I was gripped by the stories of the Allied soldiers    soldiers who left the safety of their own homes and risked their lives to liberate a country and a people that they didn't know. They liberated my birth town. It was then that I decided I would take up the gun    out of respect and gratitude for those men and women who came to liberate us. From the awareness that sometimes only the gun can stand between good and evil. And that is why I took up the gun    not to shoot  not to kill  not to destroy  but to stop those who would do evil  to protect the vulnerable  to defend democratic values  to stand up for the freedom we have to talk here today in Amsterdam about how we can make the world a better place. Ladies and gentlemen  I do not stand here today to tell you about the glory of weapons. I do not like guns. And once you have been under fire yourself  it brings home even more clearly that a gun is not some macho instrument to brag about. I stand here today to tell you about the use of the gun as an instrument of peace and stability. The gun may be one of the most important instruments of peace and stability that we have in this world. Now this may sound contradictory to you. But not only have I seen with my own eyes during my deployments in Lebanon  Sarajevo and as the Netherlands' Chief of Defence  this is also supported by cold  hard statistics. Violence has declined dramatically over the last     years. Despite the pictures we are shown daily in the news  wars between developed countries are no longer commonplace. The murder rate in Europe has dropped by a factor of    since the Middle Ages. And occurrences of civil war and repression have declined since the end of the Cold War. Statistics show that we are living in a relatively peaceful era. Why  Why has violence decreased  Has the human mind changed  Well  we were talking about the human mind this morning. Did we simply lose our beastly impulses for revenge  for violent rituals  for pure rage  Or is there something else  In his latest book  Harvard professor Steven Pinker    and many other thinkers before him    concludes that one of the main drivers behind less violent societies is the spread of the constitutional state and the introduction  on a large scale  of the state monopoly on the legitimized use of violence    legitimized by a democratically elected government  legitimized by checks and balances and an independent judicial system. In other words  a state monopoly that has the use of violence well under control. Such a state monopoly on violence  first of all  serves as a reassurance. It removes the incentive for an arms race between potentially hostile groups in our societies. Secondly  the presence of penalties that outweigh the benefits of using violence tips the balance even further. Abstaining from violence becomes more profitable than starting a war. Now nonviolence starts to work like a flywheel. It enhances peace even further. Where there is no conflict  trade flourishes. And trade is another important incentive against violence. With trade  there's mutual interdependency and mutual gain between parties. And when there is mutual gain  both sides stand to lose more than they would gain if they started a war. War is simply no longer the best option  and that is why violence has decreased. This  ladies and gentlemen  is the rationale behind the existence of my armed forces. The armed forces implement the state monopoly on violence. We do this in a legitimized way only after our democracy has asked us to do so. It is this legitimate  controlled use of the gun that has contributed greatly to reducing the statistics of war  conflict and violence around the globe. It is this participation in peacekeeping missions that has led to the resolution of many civil wars. My soldiers use the gun as an instrument of peace. And this is exactly why failed states are so dangerous. Failed states have no legitimized  democratically controlled use of force. Failed states do not know of the gun as an instrument of peace and stability. That is why failed states can drag down a whole region into chaos and conflict. That is why spreading the concept of the constitutional state is such an important aspect of our foreign missions. That is why we are trying to build a judicial system right now in Afghanistan. That is why we train police officers  we train judges  we train public prosecutors around the world. And that is why    and in the Netherlands  we are very unique in that    that is why the Dutch constitution states that one of the main tasks of the armed forces is to uphold and promote the international rule of law. Ladies and gentlemen  looking at this gun  we are confronted with the ugly side of the human mind. Every day I hope that politicians  diplomats  development workers can turn conflict into peace and threat into hope. And I hope that one day armies can be disbanded and humans will find a way of living together without violence and oppression. But until that day comes  we will have to make ideals and human failure meet somewhere in the middle. Until that day comes  I stand for my father who tried to shoot the Nazis with an old gun. I stand for my men and women who are prepared to risk their lives for a less violent world for all of us. I stand for this soldier who suffered partial hearing loss and sustained permanent injuries to her leg  when she was hit by a rocket on a mission in Afghanistan. Ladies and gentlemen  until the day comes when we can do away with the gun  I hope we all agree that peace and stability do not come free of charge. It takes hard work  often behind the scenes. It takes good equipment and well trained  dedicated soldiers. I hope you will support the efforts of our armed forces to train soldiers like this young captain and provide her with a good gun  instead of the bad gun my father was given. I hope you will support our soldiers when they are out there  when they come home and when they are injured and need our care. They put their lives on the line  for us  for you  and we cannot let them down. I hope you will respect my soldiers  this soldier with this gun. Because she wants a better world. Because she makes an active contribution to a better world  just like all of us here today. Thank you very much. Everybody in our society's life is touched by cancer    if not personally  then through a loved one  a family member  colleague  friend. And once our lives are touched by cancer  we quickly learn that there are basically three weapons  or three tools  that are available to fight the disease  surgery  radiation and chemotherapy. And once we get involved in the therapeutic decisions  again either personally or with our loved ones and family members  we also very quickly learn the benefits  the trade offs and the limitations of these tools. I'm very thankful to Jay and to Mark and the TEDMED team for inviting me today to describe a fourth tool  a new tool  that we call Tumor Treating Fields. Tumor Treating Fields were invented by Dr. Yoram Palti  professor emeritus at the Technion in Israel. And they use low intensity electric fields to fight cancer. To understand how Tumor Treating Fields work  we first need to understand what are electric fields. Let me first address a few popular misconceptions. First of all  electric fields are not an electric current that is coursing through the tissue. Electric fields are not ionizing radiation  like X rays or proton beams  that bombard tissue to disrupt DNA. And electric fields are not magnetism. What electric fields are are a field of forces. And these forces act on  attract  bodies that have an electrical charge. The best way to visualize an electric field is to think of gravity. Gravity is also a field of forces that act on masses. We can all picture astronauts in space. They float freely in three dimensions without any forces acting on them. But as that space shuttle returns to Earth  and as the astronauts enter the Earth's gravitational field  they begin to see the effects of gravity. They begin to be attracted towards Earth. And as they land  they're fully aligned in the gravitational field. We're  of course  all stuck in the Earth's gravitational field right now. That's why you're all in your chairs. And that's why we have to use our muscle energy to stand up  to walk around and to lift things. In cancer  cells rapidly divide and lead to uncontrolled tumor growth. We can think of a cell from an electrical perspective as if it's a mini space station. And in that space station we have the genetic material  the chromosomes  within a nucleus. And out in the cytoplasmic soup we have special proteins that are required for cell division that float freely in this soup in three dimensions. Importantly  those special proteins are among the most highly charged objects in our body. As cell division begins the nucleus disintegrates  the chromosomes line up in the middle of the cell and those special proteins undergo a three dimensional sequence whereby they attach and they literally click into place end on end to form chains. These chains then progress and attach to the genetic material and pull the genetic material from one cell into two cells. And this is exactly how one cancer cell becomes two cancer cells  two cancer cells become four cancer cells  and we have ultimately uncontrolled tumor growth. Tumor Treating Fields use externally placed transducers attached to a field generator to create an artificial electric field on that space station. And when that cellular space station is within the electric field  it acts on those highly charged proteins and aligns them. And it prevents them from forming those chains  those mitotic spindles  that are necessary to pull the genetic material into the daughter cells. What we see is that the cells will attempt to divide for several hours. And they will either enter into this so called cellular suicide  programmed cell death  or they will form unhealthy daughter cells and enter into apoptosis once they have divided. And we can observe this. What I'm going to show you next are two in vitro experiments. This is cultures  identical cultures  of cervical cancer cells. And we've stained these cultures with a green florescent dye so that we can look at these proteins that form these chains. The first clip shows a normal cell division without the Tumor Treating Fields. What we see are  first of all  a very active culture  a lot of divisions  and then very clear nuclei once the cells have separated. And we can see them dividing throughout. When we apply the fields    again  in the identical time scale to the identical culture    you're going to see something different. The cells round up for division  but they're very static in that position. We'll see two cells in the upper part of the screen attempting to divide. The one within the circle manages. But see how much of the protein is still throughout the nucleus  even in the dividing cell. The one up there can't divide at all. And then this bubbling  this membrane bubbling  is the hallmark of apoptosis in this cell. Formation of healthy mitotic spindles is necessary for division in all cell types. We've applied Tumor Treating Fields to over    different cancers in the lab  and we see this effect in all of them. Now importantly  these Tumor Treating Fields have no effect on normal undividing cells.    years ago  Dr. Palti founded a company called Novocure to develop his discovery into a practical therapy for patients. In that time  Novocure's developed two systems    one system for cancers in the head and another system for cancers in the trunk of the body. The first cancer that we have focused on is the deadly brain cancer  GBM. GBM affects about        people in the U.S. each year. It's a death sentence. The expected five year survival is less than five percent. And the typical patient with optimal therapy survives just a little over a year  and only about seven months from the time that the cancer is first treated and then comes back and starts growing again. Novocure conducted its first phase three randomized trial in patients with recurrent GBM. So these are patients who had received surgery  high dose radiation to the head and first line chemotherapy  and that had failed and their tumors had grown back. We divided the patients into two groups. The first group received second line chemotherapy  which is expected to double the life expectancy  versus no treatment at all. And then the second group received only Tumor Treating Field therapy. What we saw in that trial is that that the life expectancies of both groups    so the chemotherapy treated group and the Tumor Treating Field group    was the same. But importantly  the Tumor Treating Field group suffered none of the side effects typical of chemotherapy patients. They had no pain  suffered none of the infections. They had no nausea  diarrhea  constipation  fatigue that would be expected. Based on this trial  in April of this year  the FDA approved Tumor Treating Fields for the treatment of patients with recurrent GBM. Importantly  it was the first time ever that the FDA included in their approval of an oncology treatment a quality of life claim. So I'm going to show you now one of the patients from this trial. Robert Dill Bundi is a famous Swiss cycling champion. He won the gold medal in Moscow in the       meter pursuit. And five years ago  Robert was diagnosed with GBM. He received the standard treatments. He received surgery. He received high dose radiation to the head. And he received first line chemotherapy. A year after this treatment    in fact  this is his baseline MRI. You can see that the black regions in the upper right quadrant are the areas where he had surgery. And a year after that treatment  his tumor grew back with a vengeance. That cloudy white mass that you see is the recurrence of the tumor. At this point  he was told by his doctors that he had about   months to live. He entered our trial. And here we can see him getting the therapy. First of all  these electrodes are noninvasive. They're attached to the skin in the area of the tumor. Here you can see that a technician is placing them on there much like bandages. The patients learn to do this themselves And then the patients can undergo all the activities of their daily life. There's none of the tiredness. There's none of what is called the  chemo head.  There's no sensation. It doesn't interfere with computers or electrical equipment. And the therapy is delivered continuously at home  without having to go into the hospital either periodically or continually. These are Robert's MRIs  again  under only TTField treatment. This is a therapy that takes time to work. It's a medical device  it works when it's on. But what we can see is  by month six  the tumor has responded and it's begun to melt away. It's still there. By month     we could argue whether there's a little bit of material around the edges  but it's essentially completely gone. It's now five years since Robert's diagnosis  and he's alive  but importantly  he's healthy and he's at work. I'm going to let him  in this very short clip  describe his impressions of the therapy in his own words. I rate what I have today a bit different than what most people would assume. I am the happiest  the happiest person in the world. And every single morning I appreciate life. Every night I fall asleep very well  and I am  I repeat  the happiest man in the world  and I'm thankful I am alive. BD  Novocure's also working on lung cancer as the second target. We've run a phase two trial in Switzerland on  again  recurrent patients    patients who have received standard therapy and whose cancer has come back. I'm going to show you another clip of a woman named Lydia. Lydia's a    year old farmer in Switzerland. She was diagnosed with lung cancer five years ago. She underwent four different regimes of chemotherapy over two years  none of which had an effect. Her cancer continued to grow. Three years ago  she entered the Novocure lung cancer trial. You can see  in her case  she's wearing her transducer arrays  one of the front of her chest  one on the back  and then the second pair side to side over the liver. You can see the Tumor Treating Field field generator  but importantly you can also see that she is living her life. She is managing her farm. She's interacting with her kids and her grand kids. And when we talked to her  she said that when she was undergoing chemotherapy  she had to go to the hospital every month for her infusions. Her whole family suffered as her side effect profile came and went. Now she can run all of the activities of her farm. It's only the beginning. In the lab  we've observed tremendous synergies between chemotherapy and Tumor Treating Fields. There's research underway now at Harvard Medical School to pick the optimum pairs to maximize that benefit. We also believe that Tumor Treating Fields will work with radiation and interrupt the self repair mechanisms that we have. There's now a new research project underway at the Karolinska in Sweden to prove that hypothesis. We have more trials planned for lung cancer  pancreatic cancer  ovarian cancer and breast cancer. And I firmly believe that in the next    years Tumor Treating Fields will be a weapon available to doctors and patients for all of these most difficult to treat solid tumors. I'm also very hopeful that in the next decades  we will make big strides on reducing that death rate that has been so challenging in this disease. Thank you.
